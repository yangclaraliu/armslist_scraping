The Ruger 10/22 is one of the most popular 22 rifles in the world and many types of scopes and mounts are available for this handy little carbine. Many of the compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles and, even though the eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of the full size scopes, they do present a problem. Because of their short length, they need to be mounted further back on the receiver.

Most Weaver style scope mounts were made to accommodate full size scopes on high power rifles and don’t work well on smaller 22s. Until recently, there were few mounts made that could effectively accommodate the smaller mini-scopes while still maintaining proper eye relief.

We have a unique, reversible Picatinny rail scope mount for the Ruger 10/22 rim fire rifle that can be installed in two positions. In the forward position it accommodates the longer full size scopes, but when the mount is reversed, a mini-scope can be mounted further back to obtain a full field of view.

We installed this Picatinny rail mount on several of our Ruger 10/22s and mounted a variety of fixed and variable power mini-scopes using different types and brands of scope rings. The result of these experiments were several Ruger 10/22 packages, including this kit, which offer great values for hunters and target shooters.

Leave the power set on 3x or 4x in the field and you’re ready for close-in fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For those really long shots at smaller targets, steady the rifle on a solid rest and turn the power ring up to the full 9X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

This mini-scope package is also an ideal application for your Ruger 10/22 Take-Apart rifle as the scope does not need to be removed when the rifle is disassembled.

I would prefer a glock but I am open to others. My glock is a gen 2 and it has had a lot of work done to it. It has had a new 3.5 trigger connector put on it and also had new trigger springs put on it at gander mountain. It also has a new firing pin spring installed. I also put on a plug in the bottom and a new plate on the back. It also comes with 7 15 round mgs and 300 rounds of ammo. This is a great gun and I will not be lowballed. I would also consider trades for a 1911 or maby other pistols. Thank you.

The butt plate has been replaced with a Pachmayer white line pad.  Double trigger and bead front sight.  Case hardening visible but not distinctive.  Bluing worn and wood has the mars expected of a 64 year old shotgun that has been used.  No pitting and wood has pretty grain so would take to refinishing well if you want to display instead of use.  Numerich/GunParts has a replacement butt plate that will return pull to 14"".

Case is a Boyt take down style purchased from LL Bean and not used.  Some discoloring on the canvas exterior and leather is very good.

Shot shells are mixed lot of high brass, lead, Federal, Remington, Winchester and Fiocchi.  Mostly field power in varied shot sizes from 9's to double aught.   I think there is a couple of slugs in the mixed lot box.

The shot shells go with the gun or will sell separately after the shotgun sells.  Not interested in any trades.   I've shipped several firearms of late and now have the intricacies down and can advise.  Shotguns can be sold and shipped within CO without using a dealer until July 1 and to any contiguous state to Colorado with similar interstate laws as CO.  NM and WY are two I know of.

I am listing here two Ruger Mini-14 Magazines as follows:

1. 20 Round Factory Magazine. Shows no wear on the feedlips. Maybe unused but poorly stored as there is / was some discoloring surface rust. I went over it with some stainless steel wool (won't damage blueing) and oil and the rust is gone but there are minor splotches where it was. I tinkered with the photo to make it look obvious but in reality it's not as bad as it looks. Full disclosure. Marked LEO.

2. 1 New in the wrap Precision Mag Industries 30-round mag with a 1994 date on the package. Do not confuse Precision mags with PMI or any other mag company; these have the reputation of being among the best aftermarket Ruger mags. The company ceased production in 1994 or thereabouts after the 1994 Crime Bill and other California laws went into effect. These are hard to find, especially in the wrap.

A couple things included to make this a complete package for carry and the range. This is a great pistol but just not for me. It has been taken care of and cleaned. I am the original owner and i have put ~200 rounds through it. I few extras, but did not enjoy shooting it enough to continue upgrading it. So let's just get down to it...

Included:
Glock 23 Gen 4 black
Meprolight Tru Dot night sights orange rear/green front
Glock extended slide release
Houge rubber grip
Snug plug for frame
3- 13 round Glock magazines
Glock box with lock, extra back straps, manuals, test round, cleaning rod
2- 50 round boxes of PMC bronze 40S&W 165gr FMJ target ammo
20-aguila 40 S&W hollow point rounds
5-40 s&W Snap caps
Desantis intruder In-the-waistband holster (great holster btw)

Okay whats not included is; the original Glock sights and slide lock (sorry I cannot find them around my house for the life of me) and the Glock magazine loader. I don't have another one and it saves my thumbs at the range. The engravings have white nail polish in them, easy to remove if you don't like.

Partial trades interests include:
S&W M&P-17 round mags
Windowed P-Mags
223/556 ammo
9MM target and/or hollow point ammo
Red dot or ""ACOG style"" AR optic
Certain AR Flash hider/suppressor adapters

Think I got it all but if you have any questions please PM me. I feel that this is a complete package for someone as a carry/home defense/ range gun. Whatever the case may be. I am asking $650 OBO right now and I feel that is fair so if you don't like it, don't buy it or be passive aggressive and one star the post(haha nice! Good job!). I will be checking and replying my PM's in the order they arrive. I live in Lynnwood and I am willing to meet within 10 miles for a FTF sale. No negotiation on seeing your WADL, CPL, and filling out a bill of sale for my records."

Other than that, it has sat in my closet, but now I need to raise some funds to go towards a house down payment. This rifle has no functional issues whatsoever, and all internals and exterior surfaces are in excellent condition (nothing more significant than some minor scuffing on some of the moving surfaces). The bore is clean and shiny. I estimate it has no more than a few hundred rounds through it. 

The rifle comes with five magazines total, three 42-rounders, one 30-rounder, and one 20-rounder.

Also included is the factory 1.5x optic shown in the photos, along with a padded foam cover for the optic. There is also an aftermarket picattiny rail mounted on the right side that will be included. Factory cable lock and sling are included as well. I don't have the paper manual, but a PDF version can be obtained on the manufacturer's website. 

I'm asking $1,750 OBO for the rifle.  I would also consider a trade for a Glock 26 plus cash.  That's the only trade I'd be interested in.

Will take $275 for all the ammo (I paid 277.33) or $18.50 a box. Remember this is not FMJ it is the SFHP that's why it's more expensive.

I also have fresh oil, oil filter, coolant and spark plug wires that I will give you with the car. This WS6 T/A has numerous upgrades, and several thousand dollars invested in both the engine and rear end. It has not run since Feb 2009, since I put it in storage just before I joined the Army. It should need nothing more than any other vehicle that has sat for a while; some TLC. I built the short block while I was attending UTI automotive school in Southern California, its an LT1 Gen 2 SBC V-8, currently at 355 cubic inches, in front of a T-56 6 speed manual, it has a forged Eagle crank, forged Eagle I-beam rods, forged Speed Pro flat top pistons, a custom cam that I had reground from a Comp Cams camshaft, the specs on the custom grind are 233/233 @ .050 .542/.542 valve lift with 1.6 rockers, ground on a 112 degree LSA, it has Proform 1.6 anodized aluminum full roller rockers, Comp Cams double valve springs, stock heads, intake manifold and exhaust manifolds. The engine also has other small mods, such as some modifications I made to the factory ram air box like a K&N filter, home made smooth bellow, an LT4 knock sensor to work properly with the roller rockers, PCM tune, Ford Racing(I got an amazing deal I couldnt pass up, even if they say Ford lol) 42 LB/hr EV6 injectors w/ harnesses to work with the factory EV1 harness, and other little things not worth listing. The rear end has forged Tom's Gears 3.73 ring and pinion, with forged Tom's Gears 28 spline axles, and ARP wheel studs that I shortened to make the car look stock from the outside, sitting on Mickey Thompson E/T street radials in the rear, measuring 275/40/R17. The exhaust system has both cats gutted, running to a single Spintech Street Series 3"" muffler, which runs to the drivers side exhaust tip, the passenger side is there but only to keep the stock look, and the single 3"" exhaust helps to build low RPM torque, since the somewhat aggressive camshaft's powerband is approx 3000-7000+ RPM. Again, there are other small mods, but not worth listing, I built this vehicle by myself, and it was stock when I bought it, so everything done to it has been by my hands, and none of what I have listed is fake, false, an exaggeration, or a guess. I also have other parts for it that I'm willing to let go for a fair price, namely a Ram HD series clutch kit, which it will need anyways, and a set of Hooker Headers, which it could really use, if you are interested in the parts let me know."

It's a 20ga. It is a good shotgun. The only issue with it is the previous owner had it under his bed after he first bought it new and had a puppy that got a hold of the stock and chewed it up. He only got a hold of the wood that is all that got chewed up. I am open to offers on this as well. trades or cash. the guy I got it from just shot it like it was chewed up instead of buying the new stock which you can find for around $200+/- new if you really want to replace it.

ALL SOLD TOGETHER FOR $400!!!(negotiable) I just need to make room in my closet and gun cabinet for new things. This deal I basically a steal for you so please Text me at REDACTED for any questions, more pictures, or if you're interested. 

The FN Scar-L was bought in May of 2010 and I've taken good care of it. I clean this, and all of my guns after every use and I even upgraded the gearbox to a high frequency pressure motor so it shoots a lot harder and more accurately. It shoots at roughly 430~450 fps.
The Echo 1 M4 was bought in July of 2012. This gun is my masterpiece. The only thing that's stock on this gun is the base frame that has the trademarks on it. Everything else is improved and upgraded. It has a brand new G&G gearbox, a 6.01mm 230mm tight bore barrel, a stable fixed stock with a medium sized battery hole for no rattling, a 4 point floating RIS, everything is either stainless steel, aluminum, or a tough polymer plastic (stronger than ABS plastic), it comes with a red/green dot sight that's made from AimSports (69.99 value, used only once). This thing is a beast. I put about $300 into it which is the cost of the gun and all the upgrades. It also comes with a high capacity 600rd extended magazine. It shoots at a steady 435 fps with .25g bb's and it shoots pretty fast and accurately for only having an 8.4v 1500mAh battery. If you upgrade the battery, you'll have a monster at your disposal. 
The LPAEG M4 is nothing too special at all. It was my first gun and its kinda dinged up because its just basic plastic. It shoots well though. It shoots at a steady 353 with .2g bb's but .12 is preferred with it. also, I'm willing to give away 15,000 .12g bb's with this gun.
The tactical vest is ACU digital camouflage. it has many pockets and pouches. there's 4 M4 mag pouches, 6 pistol mag pouches, 3 of which can be used for most sub machine gun magazines, a random accessories pouch, and shotgun shell holders. Its a one size fits most vest and I assure you that it will fit.
The uniform is standard issue military ACU digital camouflage. I only wore it twice. Its a large and I fit in a medium. although it is a large, it did fit me okay but I want one that fits me pretty well. 
The goggles are shatter proof and fog proof. They have complete eye protection and are very comfortable to wear. I bought them specifically for being able to look through a sight and they do that perfectly. Most goggles are annoying and are too bulky to enable you to look through the sights. These are meant for viewing through sights."

Would you guys cry me a river!,"Everywhere, Indiana, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, March 10, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Boo hoo! People wanting more money than what their shit is worth is nothing new to this site. No one is making anyone buy anything from anyone else. Do you all not realize that this is an Internet site?  If you are unsure about the cost of something.... Goggle it!  Gunbroker is usually what I look at to see what high end retail value is. It's not a wal-Mart price check, its the current market.  Guess what the market is saying; there are more people wanting to buy ammo than there is ammo for sale.  Doesn't matter if i bought it at walmart yesterday or have had it in my closet ten years ago. It's selling more than retail nationwide right now, not just in Indy.  I am still looking for some ammo but I'm not going to pay a crazy price for it. I will wait and pray it comes back down but it may not. There's only one person to be mad at for making stupid purchasing decisions,and you know who that is!  What do all of you think is going to happen when we waiting for a truck to show up at wal-mart that has a little food on it instead of ammo when the dollar collapses. It's inevitable at this point, we can only print so much before it has to reset!  Who will you cry to then?  When you actually do need milk, food, or clothes for your kids?  Hopefully you have preferred your friends and neighbors to help one another. Although I hope that day never comes, if it does, guess what the price of a bag of my rice and beans will cost you?  Whatever the f@$k I say it does!!!!!!!  And by the way... you don't have to buy it!"
