Price $799.
Magazine capacity 11+1 rounds (with the extended mags 15 and 20 rounds). Mags from Beretta 92 fit as well.
In original box, never fired, brand new. Comes with cleaning brush, manual, warranty, factory certificate of pressure testing and quality control.
This is the best handgun in the world (my opinion). A  40 S&W caliber is the best choice between the stopping power, number of rounds in the mag and the price. This is the caliber that is being used by US police, secret service and special units.
CZ 99 reassembles Sig Sauer P226, but in many ways is better and more improved then Sig. It's combat-proven all over the world, and it is the service weapon of choice for the police and military forces in many countries.
I had a CZ 99 in the military and police service and as my personal concealed carry weapon for many years. My experience is 100% positive. There was not one malfunction on any of these guns that I know of. They performed flawlessly under any condition and without cleaning, for months of extensive use, and accuracy was always the same.
The feeling and fit of the CZ 99 in your hands, while aiming and shooting, can be compared with the Mercedes amongst cars. And yes, I have been shooting many different guns and calibers for the past 25 years.  I own a Beretta 92 and a Sig Sauer as well, and have been shooting and comparing them side by side millions of times. My choice is always CZ 99. My hands are small to medium size, and it fits well.

In America, CZ 99 is known under different names and was imported by different companies:

CZ 99, CZ 99S, CZ 999, CZ999 Scorpion, ZDA, EZ9, EZ40, CZ05, Zastava Arms, Serbia Yugoslavia.
US importers: Nationwide sports, TD Arms, Century International Arms, Charles Daly ZDA, Arsenal, EAA.
License: KSN Industries Israel - Golan, Tressitu South Africa.
""CZ"" is short for Crvena Zastava, translates to Red Flag, which is the old name of the factory from Kragujevac, Serbia. This Factory started making canons and firearms in 1800s. With the rich history and recognizable quality has set their reputation. Today they make many good quality firearms, handguns, hunting rifles, shotguns, military firearms, machine guns... including the famous AK 47s, which are practically indestructible and the most reliable in the whole world, same as CZ 99. We had these AKs and CZs falling from the chopper from 200 yards and, they worked like new afterwards.

The CZ 99 is a military-police service gun, or it can be a very dependable self defense and concealed carry gun. Alloy frame and polymer grips make it very light.

Parts exposed to high dynamic loads such as hammer, firing pin and unlocking insert (locking block) are made of the military ordnance steel
Hard-chromed barrel inside and out, no need for oiling, will never corrode. Barrel length 4,5"", machined slide from one solid block of steel, full length slider rails.
Forged alloy frame, decocker and slide release in one, ambidextrous.
Good trigger SA and DA (single & double action), low recoil, firing pin block, easy field strip.
Barrel is made from same material used in the M-84 machine gun and is hard-chromed. In the test done in the USA in 1991 it was found that it dissipated heat very well. While this is not a concern with handguns nearly as much as it is with the machine guns, the ability to dissipate heat rapidly makes the barrel capable of lasting longer due to a shorter expansion/contraction cycle. After many Serbian and FBI tests (mud, water, sand, snow, ice, hot) firing 200,000 rounds from the single gun, there was not one malfunction, and accuracy was the same like the new one. 
It's been accepted like a service weapon for many different police stations in the US.
Not many people here know how good this gun is, because is not advertised globally and many after seeing it, think it's Sig Sauer. To add to that, Sig besides CZ 99, is the only official police service weapon today for many police stations in the US (in 40 S&W caliber only), replacing Beretta 92 and Glock. Portage police station is one of them.

Now is the smart and best time to invest in a good quality affordable hand gun like CZ 99. The time is coming soon when you will not be able to purchase it. Import is very limited and can stop for good. Current owners know how good it is and will never sell it.
This one will go fast. So please no negotiations. Price is firm, $799.
This is private sale. I am not a gun store or a gun dealer. There is no background check, and according to Indiana law, the sale is simple and straightforward - exchanging cash and guns between hands. But, my moral obligation is to make sure that these guns end up in criminal- free and responsible hands. So please, if you can legally own guns you are welcome; if you cannot or have mental issues, you are not welcome, and I will refuse to sell to you.

Overall Condition: This gun retains about 80% of its metal finish. The balance of the finish shows dings and scuffs, as seen in the photographs, none significant. The finish has begun to turn patina under the varnish, though the varnish makes it a bit difficult to asses as the varnish may be giving the patina appearance and may give the barrel a mottled appearance. The Screw heads are used but strong. The markings are present, although a bit difficult to discern under the coat of varnish which has been applied.. Overall, this gun rates in about very good condition.

Mechanics: The action functions smoothly and correctly, although we have not test fired this rifle.

Box & Accessories: None

Our Assessment: Here is one of the best .22 Botl Action Rifles ever made. The barrel is ""lead-lapped"" which is a process that fills in the micro-cracks in the metal producing a very smooth surface with very little variance or imperfections. It is also very labor intensive and, as a result, expensive. The process is only applied to the most expensive target rifles these days. It was pointed out that it was doing a remarkable job of preserving the wood and metal. This is a rifle which is a significant part of U.S. History, like these used as military training rifles and later sold by the CMP, a reminder of when Americans truly knew how to shoot.

If you have one of the above glocks and are interested in selling one, they need to be:

- In mint to good condition – little to no wear (no scratches, dings, dents, etc) and hasn't had many rounds fired through the pistol. Yes, I know how to tell if the pistol has been fired excessively.

- Be able to provide the firearm's serial number. If not, I AM NOT INTERESTED; only legal guns that ARE registered, period. I'm able to legally purchase and carry, so my interest does NOT lay with illegal firearms, and I'm not in the business of paying a premium for private sales.

If you have one of the above pistols and you can commit to the above requirements, please contact me. As mentioned, I'm have ca$h money to pay for a quality Glock after inspection. The gun will be field stripped, inspected, and fired to insure gun does not have function problems. If you can't agree to this, because I'm going to insure I'm buying a quality used weapon, ignore this add.

For transaction, we shall meet at a gun shop that has a gun range. Hopefully you have extra rounds to throw down the range thereby insuring the gun works properly.

Understand these requirements are not only for my safety, but likewise for your safety.

If you have never shot one, you are missing a great experience and piece of our military history. It was America's first true assault rifle - small, manuverable, and magazine fed.

This carbine is an Inland with an Inland barrel, bolt, stock, and handguard. Other parts are various USGI manufacturers. Original USGI and came from CMP a while back. Has Austrian markings on trigger housing and sliede to add to its history. 5 million serial number so was made towards end of WWII. Barrel is dated 1944. Stock is dark walnut with the usual nicks and dents for a rifle that has been to war and back.

Selling it with one 15-round USGI magazine, and reproduction sling and oiler. Will also make available to buyer additional 15- and 30-round magazines and several boxes of carbine ammo at very reasonable prices ($20/mags and $23/50-rd box of ammo).

I had no intent of selling but with the craziness, I figured here is a chance for someone to get a great piece of history and still buy the 15- and 30-round magazines legally at a fair price.

DetailsSpecificationsDownloadsReviews The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

92 FS. A LEGENDARY FIREARMS.

• Two-thirds of all M9 pistols endurance tested at Beretta U.S.A. fired 5,000 rounds without a single mal function or, at most, with only one malfunction. 
• The average durability of Beretta M9 slides is over 35,000 rounds, the point at which U.S. Army testing ceases. 
• The average durability of M9 frames is over 30,000 rounds. The average durability of M9 locking blocks is 22,000 rounds.

ive shot steel out to 600, but no MOA results from that, was not able to go down range. i know this price is a little high but im actually loosing money, the badger ordnance kit sells for 350 plus IF you can find it, and the accuracy int. mag sells for about 80$ AGAIN IF YOU CAN FIND IT. i have approximately 2600$ in this rifle, even though the rifle itself can be purchased for far less, the hogue stock it comes with is worthless for any kind of accurized shooting, and the LUEPOLD scope is 900$ on its own. this rifle is amazing, and i hate to part with it, but times require sacrifice. that doesnt mean however that ill give it away. i would consider trade as part of cash for a POF 308 with 20"" barrel, but nothing else. more pics to fallow, email me for questions.

It has the ability to be configured in everything from full sized range pistol to a deep concealment weapon, in any of four calibers.

Up for your consideration is a just a beautiful M1 Garand.

This rifle is:

A 6 Digit Springfield Armory M1 Garand 30.06 ( Late 1942 ) Much more scarce
SA Bolt, Charging Handle, Barrel (1945) and Reciever
HRA trigger group with all Parts being HRA
Muzzle/THroat wear are 1+ and 2+ so a lot of barrel left
Comes with the beautiful Stock and 1 Additional Darker Walnut Stock set with handguards. (2 stocks total)
The finish is simply nice, in fact looks new maybe 90% Arsenal Refinish dark black
Comes with manual, Hard Travel Case and Sling.

These rifles are getting harder to find especially a 6 digit wartime production. 

This is simply the nicest shooter I have ever owned and could be easily converted to a collector/investment grade with some attention.

Please no low ball offers or trades, these rifles come nicer but not at this price .

Contact Erik

Thank you"

When a transaction takes place between private (unlicensed) persons who reside in the same State, the Gun Control Act (GCA) does not require any record keeping. A private person may sell a firearm to another private individual in his or her State of residence and, similarly, a private individual may buy a firearm from another private person who resides in the same State. It is not necessary under Federal law for a Federal firearms licensee (FFL) to assist in the sale or transfer when the buyer and seller are “same-State” residents. Of course, the transferor/seller may not knowingly transfer a firearm to someone who falls within any of the categories of prohibited persons contained in the GCA. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g) and (n). However, as stated above, there are no GCA-required records to be completed by either party to the transfer.

There may be State or local laws or regulations that govern this type of transaction. Contact State Police units or the office of your State Attorney General for information on any such requirements.

Please note that if a private person wants to obtain a firearm from a private person who resides in another State, the firearm will have to be shipped to an FFL in the buyer’s State. The FFL will be responsible for record keeping. See also Question B3.

I have a pair of unfired Ar-15's in new condition up for trade or sale. I’m looking for $1500 OBO for each in cash, PAYPAL, or trade. 
Both come with factory mag, box or case, and paper work. Both have collapsible butt stocks.

First is a Bushmaster Carbine Flattop ORC 16"" in .223/5.56. It is NOT the carbon lower. It has a bayonet mount gas block with no rail or sight. This model in my opinion would be better suited for customization.It is easy to modify for a longer than carbine length quadrail. It does have optic risers with it but no sights. 

Second, is a Windham Weaponry 16"" in .223/5.56. This model has the more m4 feel with the detachable carry handle with rear aperture sight and fixed front sight. If you are looking for a stock set up that is good to go, this would be more your flavor. This one comes in a case.

For the right deal I have extra pmags, a little ammo and a couple of ""tacticool"" items including back up iron sights.

These are the trades I am interested in:



KIMBER: 
Anything from the Custom shop.
Super Carry and Super Carry HD
Gold Match family
I would also consider other Kimbers plus cash.



Wouldn't mind an STI, Nighthawk, or Ed Brown 1911

Full Size Glock in 40 or 45 plus an additional 
Full Size XDM in 40 or 45 plus an additional 
Full Size S&W in 40 or 45 plus an additional 
1911's in 45 and cash will be discussed.



Transactions will occur FTF in the DFW area at midpoint between parties. Thanks for stopping by. If you have any questions or want to see more pics PM, email, or text is best.Don’t work too hard.

Other parts are various USGI. It is an original USGI with no import marks and came from CMP a while back (hand picked). It has Austrian markings on trigger and slide to add to its history (See more at http://www.bavarianm1carbines.com/index.html. It has a low 5 million series serial number so was made towards end of WWII. Barrel is dated 1944. Stock is dark walnut with the usual nicks and dents for a rifle that has been to war and back.

I am selling it with two 30-round magazines and a carbine pouch with two-15 round magazines (15-round mags are loaded with amm). It also includes the sling and oiler.

Will also make available to buyer additional 15- and 30-round magazines and several boxes of carbine ammo at very reasonable prices if desired.

I had no intent of selling but with the craziness in Colorado, I figured here is a chance for someone to get a great piece of history and with 15- and 30-round magazines legally at a fair price.

Prefer FTF but would consider shipping to FFL. This is a very nice example of this interesting remake of the famous M1 carbine. If you do your homework you will find that many consider this to be a better version of the original. Universal made improvements on the existing platform to work out some of the issues the original design faced. I have put a couple hundred rounds through it over the 10 years I have had it. Prior to this my grandfather owned it I believe since new and as far as I could tell he never used it. I looked new when I got it and still looks great. Properly stored and maintained. This ammo is next to impossible to find now as well so this could be a great package deal for someone. At this point I am not interested in separating the gun and ammo."
