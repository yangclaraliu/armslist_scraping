TWO-STAGE PISTON WITH ADJUSTABLE REGULATOR provides a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm with superior operating endurance. The two-stage piston provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The four position gas regulator can be adjusted for optimum reliability and superior operating endurance.

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles."

The gun is new and includes original box, one 30 round PMAG and paper work.

Model number: M6A1R5B16SL

Serial Number: 03-14XXX

FROM THE MANUFACTURER: The new M6-SL is a replacement of our base model M6 rifle of old. The SL, which stands for 'stretch-lightweight', incoroprates everything a shooter needs in a quality light-weight base model rifle. Price and weight were the most important factors when developing the SL. With the M6-SL, LWRCI has brought to the market the lightest factory piston driven rifle to date.

The SL comes standard with Magpul furniture. A MOE mid-length handguard, MOE Stock, and MOE pistol grip provide excellent handling characteristics, while minimizing added weight. The SL utilizes the 'stretch' or mid-length piston system, providing a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The most distinct feature of the SL is the barrel. The barrel still utilizes LWRCI's NiCorr surface conversion technology on a cold-hammer-forged barrel, but the barrel is of a smaller diameter to reduce weight.

The SL comes standard with the EXO (nickel-boron) plated Advanced Combat Bolt, one piece EXO coated carrier, and the EXO coated enhanced fire control group. The SL also comes standard with a Daniel Defense A1.5 fixed rear sight and a fixed A2 front sight post.

The SL is a great addition to the LWRCI family of rifles. It provides users with an extremely lightweight rifle that incorporates our patented short-stroke piston operating system, has all of the advanced coatings that make our rifles the best in the world, and does so at an entry level price."

It's a 7+1 capacity.  That's 1 more then the ruger/taurus/diamondback/kel-tec/hellcat style pocket pistols.This is a variant to the Walther PPK  or Makarov pistols. James Bond style. It breaks down and functions just like a PPK/Makarov.  Quick and easy to brake down and clean. This ones made in Turkey and imported by Firearms Center of Victoria Texas. Its small and could be used as a concealed carry pistol but large enough to be comfortable in you hand and accurate. The PPK design features a fixed barrel, meaning the barrel stays attached to the frame when the slide is removed. This ads to the accuracy of the gun. Most pocket pistols or even alot of full size pistol barrels flop around when the slide is open. That means when you fire the gun the barrel could tilt upward while the bullet is leaving the gun. This gun is in very nice condition. Blue slide with a brownish color frame. Comes with a nice leather belt holster. Like I say perfect concealed carry gun. Reliable and accurate so you can carry it and not have to worry if its going to work when you need it. It features a safety/decocker that allows you to keep a round in the chamber with out having to worry. I buy sell and trade, so let me know what you have.

Specs:
The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 7 rounds of 12 gauge 2.75"" shells each, for a total capacity of 7+7+1=15 rounds. The reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in.

Buyer must be legal to own firearms in Colo.  Will need to see CO I.D. and sign BOS.

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.  $4750 OBRO"

This rifle was never sanded, the walnut is naturally that light. Its commonly encountered on Argentine 1909s. The bore is pristine possibly unfired I have never shot it. The rifle is all matching minus the bolt. The cleaning rod does match. Its pretty close to mint. However, It has two problems. When I got it the bolt was turned down(Which I had corrected), and the stock was relieved to accommodate the bolt. You will be able to see detailed pictures of this modification. When my gunsmith corrected the bolt the handle snapped off and he did an excellent job repairing it, the bolt was non matching anyway. A good woodworker should be able to repair the stock with little effort, these rifles are pretty hard to find.

I'm building a shadow box of military ammo so all of these would need to be FMJ and prefer to have NATO stamp on them. Donations would be GREATLY appreciated but I understand some of the rounds are quite expensive. I am willing to pay a fair-slightly higher price. Ideally, I only need one round and one empty brass case but hey, beggers cant be choosers. If you reload any of these, even better. One with no powder would be perfect since these will never be fired."

This auction features a New In Box IMI Uzi Model B chambered in 9mm. The firearm was originally chambered in 41AE and we had it converted to 9mm by simply changing the barrels. The barrel was installed and the firearm was tested by a professional . This is a true pre ban, Israeli made, IMI Uzi. The gun is new and in great condition. This auction includes original box (plastic case and cardboard sleeve), one original 20 round 41AE magazine, one 25 round 9mm magazine, two magazine loaders, dummy barrel, 41 AE barrel, sling, sight adjustment tool, manual and promotional materials.

The Israel Military Industries (IMI) Uzi was a revolutionary weapon in that it was the first to use a telescoping bolt design, in which the bolt wraps around the breech end of the barrel. This allows the barrel to be moved far back into the receiver and the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip. The Uzi uses an open bolt, blowback-operated design. The open bolt design exposes the breech end of the barrel, and improves cooling during periods of continuous fire. Used by the Secret Service from the 1960s until the 1990s, the Uzi is known as one of the most compact, yet versatile, personal defense weapons of the past forty years. This Uzi is a new in box pre-ban Model B in that was originally chambered in 41AE and has been converted to fire 9mm. It's been stored and is in excellent condition.

Below is what I have found out about the build of the rifle:

When NoDak Spud started, they didn't have a manufacturing license, so they the receivers were marked DCI (Dan Coonan Industries). Dan manufactured the FAL receivers for FAC and Harlan was the sales manager at FAC. When FAC went bankrupt, they had a cooperative relationship for a while. Now DCI is closed and is now Coonan Inc., making FAL receivers and 1911s. Nodak now has their own manufacturing license and makes AK receivers, as well as Uzi and AR Retros."
