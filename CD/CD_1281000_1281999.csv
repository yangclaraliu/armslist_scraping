2,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1281002,For Trade:  Swap 31 .410 shot gun shells 3” #6 shotgun shells for one box of any ammo I shoot.,"So. Side - 55th and Seneca, Wichita, Kansas",Offer,"Listed On: Sunday, March 17, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I had a .410 my dad bought me a 40 years ago. My shop was broken into and they took it. I will not buy another. I shot more birds with that gun growing up than all my other guns I’ve owned together, haha. Any way to make a long story short, I have 31 rounds of .410 #6 shot, all are 3” long shells. They are about half and half Green Remington and Red Federal. If I remember right they are all 11/16 once – 1135 fps rounds. Anyway last time I bought any they were about 16.50 a box of 25. At that rate 31 shells should bring 20.46 at Wal-Mart price. Here a while back, when you could still buy ammo at Cabelas, I was buying 9 mm, .380 and 9mm Mak. all for between 11.00 - 17.00 dollars a box. This isn’t one of those, hey! you want to pay double for some ammo listings. If I still had a .410, I’d keep them, but I don’t, so all I want to do is swap for 1 box of any ammo to shoot in any of my guns and I don’t care what brand it is. Here is the list I’d trade for. .9mm, .380acp, 9mm Makarov, .45acp, or even a few boxes of .22lr for my wife. I’m in So. Wichita and would meet you half way anywhere in town, or you can stop by my Shop. Send me a e-mail, or call REDACTED. I don’t care which size it is I shoot them all, so first box that wants to swap, it’s a done deal. Thanks."

A curious tale of two young men and their purchases of Colt Woodsman pistols. In 1939 a young fellow in Northern California purchased a new 6+ inch Colt Woodsman and a year later, in 1940, another young fellow in Southern California purchased a new 4+ inch Colt Woodsman.

They both kept them until, late in life, they passed them on to family members to keep. Those families both moved to Myrtle Creek, Oregon, and purchased houses next door to each other. It was not until years later that they both realized the fate of those two pistols. They originally had been separated by 100s of miles and a year of birth, and now they are only 100 feet apart after all the intervening years.

Both of these Colts pistols are in .22LR, the shorter one having been shot and carried more than the longer barreled one. Both are in very nice condition, shoot great, and would make a great addition to any collection. Grips and magazines are the same for both pistols.

The larger one, from 1939, has a barrel length of 6 and 5/8 inches, the smaller one, from 1940, has a barrel length of 4 and ½ inches. The smaller one also has a removable trigger shoe installed. Both pistols come with a factory 10 round magazine, and there is an extra non-factory magazine. Both pistols come with their original grips and there are two additional plastic aftermarket grips. Both pistols also come with leather holsters – the larger holster is in very nice condition and dates from the same era. The smaller holster is in poor shape, good for a pattern or can be used in a display.

The pistols are being sold as a set, along with the extras as a part of the set. I can not separate the pistols or the extras – it is a purchase all or nothing sale. Asking price is a reasonable $1,300.

These are for sale only, not for trade. If you are interested and need more information or more pictures, please call Ken at REDACTED. If you wish to purchase, I am located in Myrtle Creek, just south of Roseburg a few miles, and just off of I-5 at milepost 108."

#1) Ruger 10/22. Comes with 1 'standard' 10 rnd mag, 1 clear/transparent butler creek 10 rnd mag, hotlips speed loader, Powerline 3-9x32 scope and hard case. Wood stock is in very good condition. The bluing on the end of the barrel is worn/speckled (don't know what caused it, but this is how it came to me). $350.

#2) Mosin Nagant (Moh-seen Nagaaaan) Made in 1943 in the Izhevsk arsenal. Refurbed in the mid 50's by the arsenal. Fully stamped, un-restored original finish/patina. Matching numbers. Does not appear to be force matched. Less commonly seen thru-bolt in the stock wrist. It's not rare by ANY stretch of the word, just not seen quite as often as the 'non bolt wrist' stock. Comes with cleaning rod. A non # matching electro pencil-scribed serial number bayonet. Must have been a random grab from the crate. This is a wartime stock, no bushing in the stock sling hole, and only a minimalist bushing on the foregrip.  It is in great condition for an 80 year old milsurp rifle. Obvious use/carry on a 1-10 scale (1 being unissued perfect condition) It gets a solid 6.5 in my book. This is a CAI import & in my opinion in remarkable condition considering it came from them. $200.

I put ONLY 20 rounds through this weapon to ensure functionality, then cleaned and lubricated it up. Its brand spanking new!!  Colt is a perfect mil spec weapon with a lifetime warranty; high end stuff here.

Included with the weapon is a beautiful Bushnell red/green dot scope with 4 different sight reticles.  You can select a red dot for higher light situations or green for lower light with 10 different brightness settings, and 4 different reticles to choose from; everything from dots to circles. I also purchased a 1/2 picatinni riser so the colt flip up rear sight and front sight align perfectly through the scope.  If you dont want the scope and riser mount, I'll knock $100 off the price, I can mount it on other AR's I own, but im already taking a loss on it as is.

Sale includes all original boxes, paperwork, plastic, two 20 round Colt magazines, and sling.

I collect only high end guns and this one fits the bill beautifully.  Between the gun, tax, and scope, im not making much, or anything, for that matter on this gun.  Suppliers are squeezing dealers right now, so even a stock 6920 model is going to run you well north of $1500 -1600.. This is a great buy for the money, and im not price gouging at penny.

Buyer must have a PTP/PTC and be willing to sign a bill of sale.  Cash only and buyer must pickup locally please.

BadasSKS On 'Roids. Lotta Bang For The Buck. $750
Sorry........,just shot Frosty out in the front yard with this. He wasn't doing anything wrong poor guy....,just mad 'cause I can't keep my new toy (I have to mention I was also thinking of some of the economic decisions being made for us by our wise officials. Just got this thing all decked out and had to pay or a truck repair. I digress....Frosty ain't doing so hot
anymore because this thing works AWESOME!!!
Comes with...............,
-Strikeforce Desert Tan Folding Stock
-40 round Tapco magazine
-Sun Optics receiver mounted see through SKS scope mount.
-Sightmark Holograph Sight with 4 reticle selection ($160 one, not one of the $40 economy ones)
-100 rounds of ammo
-The piece of mind that you can fight off the ""zombie invasion""when TSHTF
-The piece of mind that all the stores that I know of have plenty of cheap ammo for this IN STOCK
-A few stray ""Dremel"" marks where I modified the stock to accommodate the scope mount.
(not ugly-but then again, no one ever claimed an SKS was pretty to begin with)
-Shoots great! (did I mention Frosty?)
-The nice warm feeling of knowing that this isn't in the hands of a pinko commie anymore and is
now owned by a PATRIOT that'll use it for whatever he feels he/she must because the 2nd Amendment says it's your RIGHT!
If you think this costs more than you want to spend, that's fine. You can find plain ones on Armslist or in the stores for anywhere from $375-$500 depending on condition. But if you want this one, that's been well used and broke in, but has had a nice new stock kit, a really cool ""Holo-sight"" and a really big magazine AND 100 rounds of ammo,then it's gonna cost you $750. If you don't like it....you're free to write ""hate emails"" from yer mommy's basement because THIS IS AMERICA!!! I can then delete them and laugh at your sad, poor self.
Seriously....,if you want this, email me stating your intention to buy, a number that I can call or text, and be prepared to show a valid form of ID and sign a Bill of Sale, because I'm ONLY SELLING to a LEGAL, law-abiding CITIZEN! Thanks for playing....,and next time......get out and vote because this crap is getting ridiculous!"

Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability.

It will go with the factory CASE, 2 MAGS, cleaning TOOL, HOLSTER, MAG HOLSTER and all papers. I can also include a MILT SPARKS VERSA MAX 2 leather IWB holster which was an 8 month wait and $100. The gun is like new. let me know if you have any questions. I live in Columbus and have my CCW.


The Springfield Armory Lightweight Champion Operator 1911 is an all-business pistol for carry or combat. It has a black hardcoat anodized aluminum frame for light weight, and a forged steel slide with an Armory Kote finish to minimize holster wear.

The Cocobolo hardwood grips feature the Springfield Armory logo, and complement the black finish of the pistol very nicely.

The frame is constructed with an integral universal accessory rail for lasers, tactical lights or other accessories. (Please note that a Picatinny or 1913 rail is not the same as a Glock style rail, and devices made for the Picatinny or 1913 rails will not fit on universal rails. See photos).

The sights on the Champion Operator are combat style with rounded edges. Three tritium dots on the sights make picking up targets in daylight or darkness equally easy.

The pistol has a 4"" match grade bull barrel with a fully supported ramp. The trigger is match grade as well, with a pull weight of 4.5 to 5 pounds. The trigger is slightly longer than on most 1911's, allowing most shooters to place the pad of their trigger finger directly on the trigger face.

An ambidextrous safety allows right and left handed shooters to operated the lever easily.

At just 31 ounces, and just 7.5"" in length, the Lightweight Champion Operator will be a comfortable gun to carry in a holster or pocket, and its features will make it easy for every shooter to use.
