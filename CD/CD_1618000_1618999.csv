Original rear sight removed, Williams adjustable rear peep sight for full length sight radius. I added a rubber butt pad for length, but can be removed. 
Spring-loaded bolt, like SMLE, very fast and smooth operating. 
All matching Serial #'s. Made in 1968. Finish mostly removed from bolt, looks stainless.
Has a removable 10 round magazine, also can feed M1a stripper clips. 
Finish on the gun is outstanding for it's age, wood is good as well, not all dinged up. 
Very bright/clean bore and barrel. 
Only thing missing from the gun is the front top handguard. I never saw a need to replace it but if you want one, they are very available and cheap. 

Ishapore's are not cheap copy's, they were made for the Indian military to stand alongside their FAL's in the same caliber. 
There are only 1 of these currently on Gunbroker, and the bidding started at 450, and that's without a rear peep sight.

Much has been written about the benefits of PCCs [ pistol caliber carbines ]. Here is a quick summary of why the PCC excels for close contact fighting indoors, and why in my opinion, it's the best overall weapon for home defense:

Muzzle blast - Whether you stick with the stock configuration of a
16 inch barrel, or shorten the barrel length after getting your SBR
approval (which you should do if your state allows that), the muzzle
blast from a PCC just doesn’t compare to a rifle/shotgun. ""Tame"" is
an understatement. I'll trade the devastation of a shotgun blast for
retaining my night vision in the fight.

Noise - It's inconvenient to lose your hearing during a fight.
Firing a rifle/shotgun indoors is something best avoided if you can
help it. If your hearing isn't important, so be it...but the ability
for you and your family to hear and communicate over the roar of
shotgun fire might come in handy. If you don't have the opportunity
to compare the sound of shotgun/rifle/PCC/pistols indoors, shoot them
side-by-side outdoors. It's not at all the same but it will give you
some idea. In class I've found that PCCs seem tame even next to
suppressed AKs.

Ease of use - In my opinion, a PCC is easier to shoot than any
other platform, pistols included. This is especially true for other
family members. The Storm in particular is a very light weapon. It's
handy and compact, soft shooting and very gentle to handle. As much
as I appreciate the therapeutic properties of the rough edges of an
AK, not everyone in my family does. Easier on the hands and body is a
shooting and fighting benefit for most people. I would not hand my
mom a Remington 870 if I could help it. But a Berretta Storm? You
bet. I'd give it to her, get a beer, and watch the fun.

Recoil - Virtually non-existent when compared to shotguns and many
rifles. Easier to get multiple rounds on target. Low recoil also
helps with...

Accuracy - The low recoil in conjunction with the additional
points of contact on the stock make the PCC a very accurate platform.
In terms of accuracy, anything you can do with a pistol, you can do
easier with a PCC. The strength of the pistol is its small size and
concealability, which is not an issue with a bedside gun. Accuracy
indoors is also easier than a rifle in my opinion, given the points
mentioned above.

Fun - This is a serious consideration in my opinion. Something
that's fun to shoot will get more training time, and more training
time equals more proficiency. Maybe you prefer shooting a 12 gauge
870 to a PCC...but does your wife? Your kids?"

I purchased this rifle a few months ago and have not fired it.  It has everything original, including box and plastic that rifle was wrapped in (neither shown in pics).

The SR-556C is based on the 5.56mm NATO caliber and represents their shortest and lightest version of the SR-556 rifle platform.  The SR-556C incorporates a flash hider which is machined integrally into the barrel to reduce total length and weight.  Also the SR-556C includes fluting in the barrel under the forward hand guard rails to reduce weight.

From the factory, this rifle includes:
* Soft case
* 3 Magpul 30 rd mags
* Other hardware (see link below)

I'm also including 2 additional Magpul MOE Gen M2 mags that I ordered from Ruger

It took me a while to find one of these ""C"" version rifles.  Hate to sell it, but if I haven't fired it by now then it's money tied up that could be going to something more useful.  That being said, I don't HAVE to sell it.  Just thought I'd see if anyone would be interested in buying one of these and putting it to use.

Might be interested in one of the following as a partial trade:
* Kahr CW9
* Kahr P9
* S&W M&P 9MM SHIELD

Will not ship rifle. Local sale only.  Please contact me using button.  Leave a phone number with instructions to call or text and I'll get back to you.  If making an offer, please indicate what the offer is.  Will not respond to anything unreasonable.

It's easily the most accurate pistol I've ever owned, and by far the nicest and most reliable. However, I've always had an obsession with belt-fed weapons, and I'm putting this up here to see if anyone's interested. I'm probably crazy to want to go from an affordable-to-shoot, high-performance custom 1911 to a monstrous and unwieldy belt-fed, but oh well.

 The Baer has been broken in, about 700 rounds through it, and comes with all the original stuff - three mags, patch, certificates, DVD, everything EXCEPT the little cardboard box. The original wood grips have been replaced with Hogue wooden grips taken from an Ed Brown, but other than that, everything is original. Also throwing in a Galco Concealable belt holster (black) and a Blackhawk CQC leather IWB holster (brown).

What I'm looking for:
NO RPD'S. Other than that, my only specification is that it be a beast. M1919's, M53's, MG34's, PKM's, Goryunovs, DPM's, things like that. Belt-fed and/or tripod mounted weapons are preferred, but I'll consider anything. Oh, and I guess it goes without saying that I only want semi-autos. I'm totally cool with shipping (to FFL dealers only), and will help out with the shipping of yours as well.

Product Information

MidwayUSA teamed up with Lee Precision to custom design a cast bullet that would not only function from a suppressed AR-15 in 300 AAC Blackout subsonicly, but would not have problems feeding from a magazine and stabilize with the fast twist barrels. This bullet has a smaller meplat leading to a long gentle rounded tangent ogive to ensure that the bullet will feed from a magazine and be less sensitive to bullet seating depth. This bullet also has a boat-tail design to help increase the ballistic coefficient, reducing drag helping the bullet to overcome air resistance in flight. Some reloaders have even reported that they can seat gas checks on the boat-tail to help reduce leading when loading this bullet in other calibers. The tumble lube design of this mold is perfect for shooting subsonic loads out of the 300 AAC Blackout. 

Lee Bullet Molds are a great choice for reloaders looking for a quality mold at an affordable price. Lee machines their mold blocks from aluminum making them rust resistant. Aluminum molds heat up and cool down faster than iron or steel molds and good bullets can usually be produced only after a few casts. In addition, aluminum blocks are one-third the weight of iron or steel mold blocks offering the bullet caster less fatigue during extended casting sessions. To ensure the best possible bullets, mold block are CNC Machined for unmatched roundness and size control. Weights given are Lee's weights with suggested alloy; actual weight may vary due to the alloy mixture used. 

Technical Information:

Material: Machined Aluminum Mold Blocks and Hard Anodized Sprue Plate

Features: Tangential cut off which helps to eliminate the nip at the sprue cut off

If you are thinking about buying an AR-15 in Maryland right now, you know how terrible it is.  60-70 day waiting periods for the Maryland State Police to approve your transfer because they are hopelessly behind, and the gun stores not even taking regulated transfers from out of state.  After 7 days you can legally complete a transfer even if the MSP hasnt returned paperwork.  So, rather than make you wait 70 days like the stores, if you want this rifle, we go down to MSP, fill out the background check for a regulated transfer to obey all laws, and after the 7 day wait period we will complete the transfer.  If I think you are shady, I will politely decline to sell it to you.  But if you are not shady, here is a way to get a FANTASTIC AR-15 and bypass all the lines while being 100% within the law.

I reserve the right to refuse sale to ANYONE, for ANY reason, at my discretion.

Now on to the rifle.    

Up for sale is a Bushmaster XM15-E2S.  This was my first rifle, bought in 2009 and everything that could be upgraded was upgraded.  I bought it new and proceeded to carefully research all the best upgrades to do to it.  I added extras thoughtfully and carefully with an eye towards increasing ergonomics and function while keeping the weight as light at humanly possible.

The entire rifle has been treated with FROGLUBE as a lubricant, and it runs very smoothly.  I dont know how to describe it other than ""smoothly"", meaning that the bolt carrier rides back and forth with minimal effort.  Many AR's feel gritty or bumpy when you rack the charging handle as the bolt carrier isnt riding on the rails perfectly and the spring catches and gives you odd pressure.  This one is super smooth.

My goal was to build the most modern AR possible as well as the lightest one possible.  This rifle has more than you need, everything you want, and nothing you dont want.  It has been loved and cared for, but is not a safe queen.  

Happy to meet for a test fire at On Target.  Buyer pays range time and ammo, I have some brass cased PMC so they will let us shoot it in the range.  Only asking 50c a round of 5.56, which is 25c under the going rate, so you know im not ripping you off on ammo.

Obviously, she is in pretty rough shape (there is rust present, some pitting, dings dents and scratches, bore is OK with sharp rifling). The gun appears to be fully functional and the cylinder locks up pretty tight. I have not shot this gun, but the timing seems on and the firing pin isn't worn down/broken. 

I bought this locally and have decided it doesn't have a place in my humble S&W Victory collection. $225obo takes it home (with 6 rounds of ammo)."

I have Springfield xds I picked up a month or two ago that I am trying to get rid of. It has 50 rounds through it and was cleaned after. It is in 95 percent condition except for the usual wear from shooting and carrying a bit.

Comes with everything it came with plus talon soft rubber grips I put on it. They can easily be removed if you decide you do not want them. Also included is a crossbreed copycat holster that is very comfortable. Will sell just the gun if absolutely necessary.

Looking to get 525 for it, buyer pays transfer. Ftf in Bucks County preferred, will drive a bit within reason if necessary.  Also may consider shipping

OUR TERMS;
Buyer must be 18 years old for long guns and 21 years old for handguns plus you must be legally able to own or possess a firearm. You must secure a current FFL in your State of residence and in your area for us to ship the firearm to. I will only ship this firearm to an FFL. I will need a legible copy of his FFL with dealer ID, signature and expiration date. If I can't read it or it is not clear and legible I will not ship the firearm. Please have them put the buyer/owners full name, home address, home phone number, and his information on the FFL for our records and so I can match the buyer to the FFL and to the firearm.

I am a Federal Firearm Licensed Dealer. You must abide by all Local, State and Federal Laws and it is YOUR responsibility to know your local laws before bidding. Not my responsibility! There will be a 25% re-stocking fee if the firearm cannot be delivered as agreed on any canceled or returned item after payment.

You should have any firearms or accessories examined by a Gunsmith before use. We are not responsible, nor are we liable for any damage to persons or property. If you buy out of State there is no sales tax charged on our end but Washington State sales tax, (8.6%), will apply on the full amount of the purchase including all shipping, insurance and handling charges if you buy in Washington State.

Your FFL can send, (P.O. Box 2043, Vashon, WA 98070), fax, REDACTED), or e-mail, (REDACTED), the copy of his FFL, with the information to me but the firearm will not be shipped until I receive this information and check it out.

The PF-9 is manufactured in Cocoa, Florida by Kel-Tec CNC Industries. Featuring extensive use of CNC (Computer Numerical Control) manufacturing techniques, its six main components consist of the barrel, slide, frame, grip, trigger group, and magazine. The barrel is manufactured of AISA 4140 steel hardened to 48 RHC, and the slide is constructed of the same steel. The frame, which houses the trigger group, consists of a solid machined 7075-T56 aluminum billet. A transfer bar system connects the hammer and trigger. A hammer block safety is incorporated which helps prevent accidental discharge if the pistol is dropped. The long double-action-only trigger pull provides an additional safety feature. The pistol includes a slide hold-open feature which locks the slide in its rearmost position after the last round is fired. The grip is made of DuPont ST-8018 polymer and holds the steel, 7-round, single-column magazine.[3] The sights consist of a fixed front blade and a windage-adjustable notched rear sight. Three white dots highlight the sights for optimum visibility in low-light conditions.
The PF-9 uses many parts originally designed for Kel-Tec’s P11 and P3AT models, and is in fact a compromise between those pistols. From the P11, the PF-9 uses a slightly modified barrel, trigger, ejector, and front sight. The P3AT parts used in the PF-9 include the extractor and various springs. The grip is available in a variety of colors, while the slide is available in blued, Parkerized, ceramic (Cerakote), and hard chromed finishes. The PF-9 is shipped with an extended magazine floorplate, an allen wrench for adjusting the rear sight, and an owner's manual."

Basically, I would rather sell this to someone for a good price than trade it in.  Have to pick up new gun on hold by Friday.

For Sale:  Walther P99 QA 9mm  

Original case, parts, cleaning rod, manuals, and manuafacturer's target and brass shell all are included.
* 2 - 15 round magazines
* 3 backstraps to adjust grip size
* 4 removable front elevation sights at different heights
* Trigger lock

What does the QA mean?  I had to order this particular model when I bought it because I wanted this functionality:

(From the Walther manual)  ""The Quick Action (QA) Trigger of the P99QA differs from the standard P99 by offering a constant trigger pull for every round fired.  If you pull the slide rearward and release, with a loaded magazine in the well, the gun will be laded and ready to fire.  Once loaded, pulling the trigger will move the striker to the rear and allow discharge.  Depressing the take down button will decock the gun and render it unable to shoot.  With the striker decocked, the gun will not fire when squeezing the trigger.  If the slide is slightly moved rearward on a decocked gun it will go into a ready to fire mode.""

I am the original owner of this handgun.  I've literally fired only about 5 magazines (75 rds) using it - and haven't fired it (though its been cleaned) in years.  I carry it on occasion but am looking to get into something more concealable for the summer.

Will consider the following as trade:
* Kahr CW9
* Karh P9
* S&W M&P Shield 9mm

Will not ship this handgun. Local sale only and buyer must have permit or CCW permit. Please contact me using button. Leave a phone number with instructions to call or text and I'll get back to you. If making an offer, please indicate what the offer is. Will not respond to anything unreasonable."

Taurus PT-22 semi-automatic – Ultra light ""pocket pistol."" This sharp little carry gun has blue steel finish and black polymer grips. Purchased in February for conceal carry back-up. Have shot about 100 rounds though it; works great with hi-speed ammo (eats CCI Mini-Mags like candy). Very clean, original Taurus box, manual, lock system, AND TWO Additional TAURUS FACTORY MAGAZINES included. Taurus small frame semi-automatic pistols offer security and reliability you can count on. The PT22 pistol features blow-back action and tip up barrel for safety and convenience during loading and chambering the first round. Each model utilizes low profile fixed sights and is made in the U.S.A. If light and fast are your priorities, the PT 22 is the pistol for you. The Uncle Mikes IWB holster is a left-draw, but perfect for wearing behind-the-back for right hand draw – the PT22 fits perfect there, in a pocket holster, or in an ankle holster.

I avoid the high priced ammo, like most smarter folk. However, I do have to admit that I am concerned about the listing below, as this person is really trying to incite some bad shizzle.

While I agree that gouging is despicable, what this person is suggesting is really counter to many of the principals we all stand for:

- Creating a registry of ""offenders"" - seriously?
- Who decides what ""gouging"" is? This person? Should we include many of the dealers at gun shows selling their ammo for more than usual? These, that many of us call our friends?
- It is one of the conditions of the free market - to allow people to TRY to sell ammo at ridiculous prices and find no one will buy it, WITHOUT regulation. 

However, also in a free market, you can look to OTHER sources, such as MGO, Facebook groups, etc. where those groups can decide whether to monitor or not what is ""gouging"". Armslist is not the only place to look. 

On Gunbroker.com, you will find that ammo is selling at a much more reasonable rate than the gougers on Armslist. 

If this person is so concerned with price gouging and posts almost every day, good for him. However, to suggest the course of actions he has, he must be a liberal. And have nothing better to do. I can respect taking a stand, however not at the cost of our liberty.

Don't bother replying to this post. I just wanted to share my concern and created a fake email that will not be used again.

Please ""Spam/Inappropriate"" the following post if you agree. And you are welcome to disagree with me to. That is the beauty of the country we live in.

-----------------------------------------------
RE: FOR SALE: LIST OF GOUGERS

""Due to the current state of gouging I think that an email or phone number list of these fine people ought to be listed(maybe even a pic). So any of you with this information why not share it. Maybe if they get enough angry calls or are bothered enough we can prevent these low life jobless rip offs from running out at all hours of the day and night to buy it all up and try to resell it to us, then those of us who actually shoot and use ammo can get it. Certainly not advocating any sort of violence or anything like that, but ripoffs tend to stop when there outed. Thanks and have a nice day."""

Trades are welcome I would prefer a $500-1,000 trade and to have the rest in cash but I will consider all offers.

There are only 3,000 miles on the bike but I am riding it for the time being until I sell it.. Both tires are like new with only 1,000 miles on them. The bike has never been wrecked, but there are a few dings and scratches and something green in the paint that is either something splashed on the tank or some kind of discoloration caused by gas getting on the paint. There are no cracked fairings or bad road rash, but I do think the bike has been tipped over in a driveway or parking lot. There is slight scuffing on the tips of things like the front break lever, right bar end, and exhaust.

This is a great starter bike, I have had two of these over the years. Do not be afraid to buy this as your first bike. I will be happy to work with you to show you the basics of riding for the first time.

The Chiappa 1911-22 model is a rimfire, semi-automatic pistol chambered in .22 LR. It is a straight blowback pistol in .22 Long Rifle only, with a fixed barrel solidly attached to the frame.

The Chiappa 1911 is constructed from Chiappalloy and steel components featuring wooden two piece grips. Polymer is used for the magazine catch, mainspring housing, non-rotating grip safety filler, and the body and follower of the 10-round single-column magazine. 

It is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun. Safety features include the traditional left-side thumb safety and a gun lock on the right rear side of the slide. A third safety feature is the gun’s automatic trigger safety, which blocks the trigger until the slide is fully forward into battery. Finally, the hammer features a half-cock notch. The front sight is a fixed sight and has been designed to allow extra material so that it can be filed to adjust for the individual shooter. 

The Chiappa is a fixed barrel blow back design that maintains reliable functioning with minimal friction. The reliable return of the slide in combination w/ fixed front and rear sights maintans a constant return and quick, accurate follow-up shots. It includes two 10-rd magazines.

AWC VALKYRIE TI 22 SUPPRESSOR.

The Valkyrie TI is a super light-weight titanium suppressor. The AWC Valkyrie has an interchangeable rear mounting system, which allows you to swap between multiple host weapons regardless of thread pattern. 

This is AWC's nicest titanium can, and it is made from solid titanium stock; it is not made from titanium tubing like others who use cheaper methods that don't give as nice of a build quality. This AWC model uses a solid welded fully machined blast baffle. It’s forward purging design means gases cool faster while moving forward more efficiently.

The Valkyrie offers unbelievably accurate suppressed shooting. The Valkyrie is far and away the BEST 22 CAN ON THE MARKET and is of course also suited for the 17 HMR and 22 magnum in other firearms. The mounting systems you can change between are (universal): 1/2 x28, 3/8 x24, P22, SIG Mosquito, 3/8 x24 Tang & Custom. Because of the AWC rear mounting system, it is very easy to change the can from one thread pitch to another. Best of all, the AWC Valkyrie never has to be cleaned!

That means when they are all gone, they are gone.  Limited supply, and this one comes with everything you would ever need already!

I am selling this beautiful AK rifle because I am really wanting to fund a different project and there is no other way.  I know what this stuff is worth, and if anyone offers too low I simply won't dignify it.  This is not cheap Century Arms crap.  Arsenal makes the best factory AK rifles, period.

Up for sale is an Arsenal SLR-106F.  It has the 100-series folding stock mechanism, and is chambered for 5.56 NATO (can shoot .223 Rem just fine like all other 5.56 rifles).

Here's what you get on top of the original factory rifle:

- Texas Weapon Systems dogleg rail cover, gen2.  This replaced the dust cover and is used to give pic rail across the top for sights.  It is hinged and locks in place, rock solid and good to go.
- Ultimak railed gas tube, for mounting lights or whatever else you want
- Bulgarian style flash hider.  Cuts down on muzzle flash (the factory brake spews flash)
- Sling from OST
- TWELVE thirty round magazines, and an additional TWO 20 round magazines for a total of FOURTEEN mags.  You can't find these anywhere, and when you can they are crazy expensive.  This means all you need for this gun is ammo.
- Like new Bulgarian bayonet
- all factory parts to return it to factory if desired
- Aimpoint M2
- TWS BUIS peep rear sight
- Custom Kydex belt mounted magazine carrier.  Was made by Dale Fricke Holsters.
- Surefire tac light with offset mount
- AK sight tool


My starting asking price is: $2400

I am not in a huge rush to sell, so if I can't get a REASONABLE offer, oh well.  I will part off the optic if you wish to purchase the entire package without the optic, and the price will reflect this.

No other parting.  No trades.  I have a specific project in mind and it is the only reason i am selling this.

I have more pictures and can take more at any time.  Feel free to ask to see anything.

Price for everything without the Aimpoint is: $2100."

882,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1618882,For Sale:  Principals of our United States of America,"West Side, Michigan, United States",$ 999,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 14, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"To start, I don't deal much on Armslist but find it interesting to see what is available. I avoid the high priced ammo, like most smarter folk. However, I do have to admit that I am concerned about the listing below, as this person is really trying to incite some bad shizzle.

While I agree that gouging is despicable, what this person is suggesting is really counter to many of the principals we all stand for:

- Creating a registry of ""offenders"" - seriously?
- Who decides what ""gouging"" is? This person? Should we include many of the dealers at gun shows selling their ammo for more than usual? These, that many of us call our friends?
- It is one of the conditions of the free market - to allow people to TRY to sell ammo at ridiculous prices and find no one will buy it, WITHOUT regulation. 

However, also in a free market, you can look to OTHER sources, such as MGO, Facebook groups, etc. where those groups can decide whether to monitor or not what is ""gouging"". Armslist is not the only place to look. 

On Gunbroker.com, you will find that ammo is selling at a much more reasonable rate than the gougers on Armslist. 

If this person is so concerned with price gouging and posts almost every day, good for him. However, to suggest the course of actions he has, he must be a liberal. And have nothing better to do. I can respect taking a stand, however not at the cost of our liberty.

Don't bother sending hate mail. I just wanted to share my concern and created a alias that will not be used again.

Please ""Spam/Inappropriate"" the following post if you agree. And you are welcome to disagree with me to. That is the beauty of the country we live in.

-----------------------------------------------
RE: FOR SALE: LIST OF GOUGERS

""Due to the current state of gouging I think that an email or phone number list of these fine people ought to be listed(maybe even a pic). So any of you with this information why not share it. Maybe if they get enough angry calls or are bothered enough we can prevent these low life jobless rip offs from running out at all hours of the day and night to buy it all up and try to resell it to us, then those of us who actually shoot and use ammo can get it. Certainly not advocating any sort of violence or anything like that, but ripoffs tend to stop when there outed. Thanks and have a nice day."""
