I bought a 25 piece lot of the FDE 20 round mags a few weeks back along with another lot of 30 round mags for myself and friends and I only have a few of each left! I found out very quickly when I listed the 20-round Pmags online that they're typically MORE sought after for range shooting due to their lower profile which is a much better platform for bench rest shooting (So I've been told). Along with my 30 round mags I've been watching both Local and Internet gun retailers selling what Pmags they have left in stock and they all appear to be selling for between $75 and $100. If the high capacity magazine ban happens, Pmags and generally ALL other 20,30, and UP ""high-cap"" magazines will start selling at around $100-$125 EACH!! That info was available from the last time a mag ban went into effect. Don't hesitate guys/gals and call me @ REDACTED if your near the Hartford, New Haven, Derby, Waterbury, Naugatuck, Wallingford area and ill gladly meet up face to face to put these magazines in another fellow gun enthusiasts hands.

The gun shoots the 5.7x28 round. It's basically a shortened 5.56 round made for a pistol. The clips even load like an AR15 magazine. When shot the bullet acts like a rifle round so it gives it excellent range, excellent accuracy, and excellent stopping power with no recoil and 20 shots. They've been wanting to limit this pistol to military use only for a while now so better act quick before it's banned along with the 2nd amendment. I will take trades or cash offers. Don't ask me how much, or ask what i want to trade for. Make offers! I prefer things unique."

I bought a 25 piece lot of the FDE 20 round mags a few weeks back along with another lot of 30 round mags for myself and friends and I only have a few of each left! I found out very quickly when I listed the 20-round Pmags online that they're typically MORE sought after for range shooting due to their lower profile which is a much better platform for bench rest shooting (So I've been told). Along with my 30 round mags I've been watching both Local and Internet gun retailers selling what Pmags they have left in stock and they all appear to be selling for between $75 and $100. If the high capacity magazine ban happens, Pmags and generally ALL other 20,30, and UP ""high-cap"" magazines will start selling at around $100-$125 EACH!! That info was available from the last time a mag ban went into effect. Don't hesitate guys/gals and call me @ 347-559-4656 if your near the Hartford, New Haven, Derby, Waterbury, Naugatuck, Wallingford area and ill gladly meet up face to face to put these magazines in another fellow gun enthusiasts hands.

It shoots very well. Lock up, timing, and bore is very good. It comes factory with adjustable rear sights and factory wood grips. Id say it's just short of being new which is great for an old gun. It's really a beautiful piece.

I am selling one of my two ( so nice I bought it twice ) HK USP Compact 40 S&W Variant 7 Law Enforcement Modification DAO with a bobbed hammer, since I recently purchased a USP Expert.  In wake for the '86 FBI shootout in Miami, the 40 S&W was developed to pack the energy of most 45ACP loads to replace 9mm, yet still allow high capacity and more compact form factors.  The LEM V7 is not a true DAO, since once the slide is racked it acts like a SA, but the hammer rests forward like it is uncocked and the trigger pull is very light.  If you aren't familiar with HK LEM, checkout: http://pistol-training.com/articles/hk-lem-vs-sig-dak  The pistol I am selling is not the one for carry, so it has only very light wear.  It comes with night sights, soft sided case and 3 hi-capacity 12 round magazines, so you get 12+1 .  If you aren't familiar, the V7 LEM does not have a safety, but it is easy to add one.

The subject of this review is my own Bushmaster XM-15-E2S that was made in Windham, (I got mine!). It is an A3 model with an A2 style fixed buttstock, handle sight,  inch heavy barrel with 1 turn in 9 inch twist rifling, bayonet lug, birdcage flash suppressor and it came with a 30 round magazine.
This Bushmaster rifle is chambered for .223 Remington and 5.56mm NATO rounds and is marked as such, so both may be safely used. I don't recommend that these rounds be used interchangeably in any firearm that is not specifically marked for both. There are many that believe that the .223 Remington and the 5.56mm NATO round are the same but in fact they are not. According to Small Arms Manufacturers Institute, Inc, (SAAMI), it is unsafe to fire 5.56mm NATO rounds in firearms chambered for .223 Remington. If you do a little Google searching around the Internet you can find the technical information related to that subject if it interests you. Be careful and only use the ammunition your firearm is designed to fire safely. new in box  trade value 1700  sig"

Why ""Colorado Caliber""?  The 10mm is the perfect caliber that can double as a home defense weapon and as ""woods gun"" in the event you encounter any problems with black bear or mountain lions.  It is also a popular choice for hunting with semi-auto.

778,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1108778,For Sale:  Gun Ban Bills SB 5737 & Diane Feinstein's Gun Ban Bill,"Washington, Washington, United States","$ 50,000,000","Listed On: Wednesday, February 20, 2013",Rifles,Colt                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"WA state SB 5737 is a bill to ban ""assault weapons"". Originally, the wording  of Senate Bill 5737 included an annual inspection at your home: 

“In order to continue to possess an assault weapon that was legally possessed on the effective date of this section, the person possessing shall ... safely and securely store the assault weapon. The sheriff of the county may, no more than once per year, conduct an inspection to ensure compliance with this subsection.”

http://www.thehighroad.org/showthread.php?t=703933

Meaning the police would have the right to come in to your home an inspect your assault rifle to make sure you were complying with their law.

However, it seems the offending paragraph has been removed and the bill now seeks to completely outlaw simultaneous possession of semiautomatic or pump action rifle (!), pistols and shotguns ""capable of accepting a detachable magazine"" AND ""any magazine capable of use with that firearm that contains more than ten rounds of ammunition"" at the same time.

Read paragraph (2) and decide for yourself:

""NEW SECTION. Sec. 2. A new section is added to chapter 9.41 RCW
 to read as follows:

(2) No person in this state shall possess or have under his or her
control at one time both of the following:
(a) A semiautomatic or pump-action rifle, semiautomatic pistol, or
shotgun capable of accepting a detachable magazine; and
 (b) Any magazine capable of use with that firearm that contains
more than ten rounds of ammunition.

(3) Subsection (1) of this section shall not apply to any of the
following:
(a) The possession of an unloaded assault weapon for the purpose of
permanently relinquishing it to a law enforcement agency in this state. (SB 5737 p. 6)

Apparently, this combination of a semiautomatic (or pump action) firearm (rifle, pistol or shotgun) and a magazine of more than 10 rounds constitutes an ""assault rifle"", and is therefore bad.

Also, while the bill says it is OK to carry what they apparently consider ""assault weapons"" to and from a ""licensed, lawfully operated shooting range"" or target shooting event, it makes no mention of carrying and using such rifles and pistols during a hunting trip. By default, that seems to be illegal.

This bill was sponsored by Ed Murray, Jeanne Kohl-Welles and Adam Kline:

Please contact them and voice your support of the 2nd Amendment. Remember, it is your pump-action assault rifle they are trying to ban.

Also, Diane Feinstein is at it again. She hopes to ban all ""assault weapons"" which are defined as  “semiautomatic, centerfire, or rimfire rifle that has a fixed magazine with the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds,” except for tubular-magazine .22s. Also, any “semiautomatic, centerfire, or rimfire rifle that has an overall length of less than 30 inches,” any “semiautomatic handgun with a fixed magazine that has the capacity to accept more than 10 rounds,” and any semi-automatic handgun that has a threaded barrel.

Further, her bill would require the owners of existing “assault weapons” to register them with the federal government under the National Firearms Act (NFA). The NFA imposes a $200 tax per firearm, and requires an owner to submit photographs and fingerprints to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE), to inform the BATFE of the address where the firearm will be kept, and to obtain the BATFE’s permission to transport the firearm across state lines.

I am running out of ammo cans so they are going to be limited...can't promise they will still be available. Plenty of ammo is still available. I have also decided to accept a discreet credit card payment using Square on my phone. This will add 2.75% to the price. Up to you. Price is firm.

Furthermore, this is first run combat ammunition, which is almost completely unavailable on the civilian market. It's not a bunch of ""out of spec"" rounds, thrown into a box and sold at Guns and Ammo for $800. Because of this, I am not going to budge off the price. Thanks."
