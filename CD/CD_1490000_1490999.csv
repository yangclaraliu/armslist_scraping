The Mini-Revolver series by North American Arms is available in 22 Long Rifle with a barrel length of 1-5/8"", offering a lightweight concealed carry pocket gun with a 5-shot capacity.  Using the half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely away from live or empty chambers without chance of accidental discharge. The steel frame is fitted with a handy locking black holster grip with a pocket clip and fixed blade front sight. The holster grip unfolds and locks to become the handle of the gun. Press the release button and the mini-revolver folds back into the grip. For added safety, when the holster grip is folded, the trigger of the gun is completely enclosed making it virtually impossible for the gun to be fired.

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the 6920 carbine is less than 32"" collapsed in length and weighs only 6.91 lb - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's 6920 carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components

- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher mounts directly to the Carbine without modification
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation

Primarily magazines, ammo and tactical gear. My rifle is outfitted with a Tapco Intrafuse stock so it has picatinny rails and could accomidate a scope, flashlight, etc. I would really prefer magazines (and make up the difference with ammo or??) What I have to offer, in trade, is a 20 guage H&R single shot shotgun. I have only fired it twice and it as been taking up space since then. I have a full box of shells and a box of slugs to go with it. Theres nothing wrong with it, I just don't shoot it. It would be a great shotgun for a kid or to convert to a home defense weapon. They sell a stock kit for these that is really cool for around $50 which is what I will probably do if I don't get any takers. I value the shotgun around $120 so just looking for a trade near that but I am flexible. I want to trade because my wife will skin me if I spend any more money on guns! Lol...Thanks!"

This is virtually new as only rounds through it were to test fire for function.  This is the ultimate home defense shotgun.   This has a door bleacher muzzle break and a Blackhawk recoil reducing pistol grip stock.  The stock on this is awesome!  You can literally shoot this like a pistol and not break your wrist... It takes most if the recoil into a spring type buffer!

I bought this new from a local gun store and is a safe queen (humidity controlled).  I have more money in this than what I am asking, so I am firm on the price.

This comes with the original stock, box, papers, etc.

Prefer local FTF deal.  Must see valid IN DL but won't take down your info.

From the Manufacturer: Armalite .308 High Cap Drum Magazine: Serious firepower in a small package. The X-10 is a .308 caliber 50 round single stack compact drum designed for Armalite .308 rifles. The magazine easily loads and unloads by operating the front hand wheel. Designed to operate in automatic and semi-automatic applications, it employs a larger hand-wheel and double spring for increased reliability. Unique to this magazine's design is a patent pending feed device that allows the magazine to run massive spring pressures without effecting the firearm's bolt operation. The durable body is constructed entirely of aluminum, and finished in a friction reducing ceramic coating. All internal and operating assemblies are made of black oxide steel and aluminum. Comes with a lifetime warranty and includes an instruction manual. US sales only. PLEASE do not attempt to purchase if you live in one of the ""Constitutional Free-Zones"" such as NY, NJ, HI, CA, Chicago, etc.... or similar areas that have had their 2nd amendment rights stripped, as I cannot ship to you if you exist in those locales.

Known officially as: M3, sniperscope, infrared, set no. 1, 20,000 volts. Made by american optical co. Buffalo, NY 6-23-51. Made to be mounted on a special M1 carbine known as the M2 carbine making the whole setup a M3. 

Very good condition. Really nice for how old it is. How does it compare to others? I don't know. I've never seen one that wasn't in a book or on the internet. This is the only one I have ever seen. Very rare, very cool piece of American Military History.

What is there and what isn't. This comes with the IR scope, IR Light, Foregrip/ Handle with the trigger, power transformer box, all necessary original wiring, 1 tube, original rubberized backpack(nice), and original chest. As far as what is missing? I'm really no expert but I think there was a tool set and more tubes. These are not there. And of course no .30 carbine. No rust anywhere and looks to be the original finish. Some scratches on the scope but not bad. A little corrosion on a small copper piece behind the light source. And it looks like the red filter is a little rough. The outside plastic of the light source is fine, its the red filter inside. I have not taken this apart or tried to clean any of it. 

Because this is so rare I did not want auction it, I wanted a lot of people to have a shot at owning it. Same with gun broker. I found it in Mn I would like a collector in MN to give it a good home. So I figured the only fair way to do it wold be to take offers. So, if you want it, take a shot at it and email me your best offer. If you know what it is, you know what its worth, and how often you can find one.

As far as trades go... I might, might, take one of the following as partial trade with cash. 1. Ruger .44 carbine semi-auto. Prefer older tube fed. 2. Ruger No. 1 in 270 win, 280 rem, 30.06 or 303 brit. 3. HK usp Tactical all black. Of course these guns must be nice.

Of course all cash is always nice. FTF meet. Leave your name and number or I will not get back to you.

It has been reworked by PW arms (importer) who installed a new barrel, stock, and bolt. Essentially, this is a new gun. It has not been fired since it was reworked but i did fire a primed case so that i know it will fire. This rifle is not c&r eligible since there is no date stamp on the receiver. This has a 10 round box magazine that is fixed. It fires 7.62x39 round, same as the ak47.

The sks rifles are a phenomenal bargain. They fire the same round as the ak47 and are just as reliable. The sks is heavier than the ak47 so it has less felt recoil and stays on target better than the ak47.This gun shoots any type of ammo you want to feed it-brass, steel, boxer primed, berdan primed, russian, bulgarian, american, etc. 

The bayonet stays attached to the rifle by using a spring loaded collar that you pull down to engage the bayonet. This gun is California legal and will need to be transferred through a ffl dealer. Accessories included are: sling, leather ammo pouch, oil bottle, and barrel rope.

About the Handgun:
The striker-fired PT-24/7 pistol features an injection molded polymer frame, a frame-mounted manual safety lever, a visible/tactile loaded chamber indicator and a dust cover Picatinny accessory rail. Handling characteristics of 24/7 pistols are enhanced by ergonomic design attributes which Taurus calls 'Memory pads', consisting of various grooves which promote proper consistent hand placement for superior handling control. In addition, a secure grasp of the pistol grip is afforded by a high adhesion gripping surface. An option on selected basic 24/7 pistols and standard on Pro models is a soft, ribbed, non-slip, hand-conforming grip which Taurus calls the ‘Ribber’."

First is A 1907 Australian Bayonet. Fits the British rifles of the ww1 era. Original leather/metal sheath. Push button attachment still works. excellent condition. Better condition than any I've ever seen online. 


The second is A WW2 German Nazi army Officer's Dagger. Ivory handle, original metal sheath and all engravings intact. Has original belt loop up top, not on bottom. Handle is cracked and chipped, and blade is in great shape. Was denazified, meaning the swastika was taken off the bottom of the war eagle on the hilt. Probably done before it was brought back to the US. Pretty good shape overall. Very rare. Ivory handle is usually associated with higher ranks, much rarer than the similar plastic handled daggers. this one is dated between 1936-1938 I believe.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
This model is designed to provide physical indication if there is a bullet loaded in the chamber. The product is designed with a lever mounted on the top of the slide. The lever is marked as Indicator in red lettering. When a bullet is chambered it pushes the lever upward and out of position. The operator will visually see the lever as it is raised up. Also the operator will be able to feel the indicator as being out of its normal resting position as it will not be flush with the top of the slide, thus warning the operator that the firearm is loaded.

Enhanced Trigger
Kahr’s new enhanced trigger will be featured on Kahr models with external safeties and loaded chamber indicators. The enhanced trigger has a shorter length of pull compared to the Kahr standard trigger. The new enhanced trigger has a 1/4” length of pull with an approximate 7.5 lb. trigger pull weight compared to a 3/8” length of pull for the standard trigger. The trigger pull weight for the enhanced trigger is the same as the standard trigger, approximately 7.5 lb. 

External Safety
This model has, in addition to the internal safety, an external safety that will prevent the firearm from firing when the safety is in the safe position. The product has an external lever with two settings. When the lever is pushed completely up and the red dot is fully visible, the firearm is in the armed position and ready to fire with the pull of the trigger. When the lever is pushed down, and the red dot is hidden the firearm is in the safe position and will not function with the pull of the trigger. The safety works in the following manner. When the lever is in the down (Safe) position the connecting cam on the lever pushes the trigger bar out of position, disconnecting it from the cocking cam. If the trigger is pulled in the safe mode, the cocking cam will not release the striker and the firearm will not fire. When the lever is pushed up (Fire/Armed position) the cam moves out of place and the trigger bar moves up, again connecting with the cocking cam. The firearm is then ready to fire with the pull of the trigger."

The brass is from factory ammunition fired by me or my family.  I was getting into reloading with my oldest son several years ago, but he moved up north and I just don’t have the time.  A large portion of this brass has been de-primed, with a small portion of it having been re-primed.  It has been in storage, and while the primers are probably still good, I make no guarantee.  There may be a small percentage of brass picked up at the range that may or may not have been previously reloaded.  All brass has been run through a tumbler to clean it up and inspected for split / cracked / crushed cases.  There may be dings, dents and/or slight imperfections found on the cases.  These flaws can be easily removed upon resizing or will be shot out upon firing.  I throw in extras in case I miss any bad ones.

Smith and Wesson 500ES (Emergency Survival). It has the rare 2 3/4"" barrel. Definitely a hand cannon! It actually shoots pretty good. Id say it has about the same recoil of a 44mag. The weight definitely helps it out. I also have a set of LEE reloading dies and a few empty brass.
The top picture shows the 500 magnum round with a 325gr bullet. You can get bullets up to a 700gr. Next to it is a 500 magnum shell, a 44mag, and the one that looks little is a 357mag shell.

Paint is heat resistant to 1200 degrees. I got the barrel used and it had tool marks so they were filled in and sanded smooth. The barrel is stainless and the filler that was used was not an exact match which is why it was painted. Has standard follower and spring. The trigger guard is a Czeck military winter guard. I liked the that it is over sized to allow gloved shooting. Still has military trigger installed but is not bad. I have shot it about 22 times. Just test, sight in, and shoot my gong. I have been planning on upgrading everything (stock, trigger, bed it) but have become obsessed with my 25-06. I just don't know when I'll get back to it. Don't really need to get rid of it's just taking up room in the safe right now. I just want it to get some use instead of waiting on me to get back to it. Email with questions or offers. I will not answer emails asking how much. Just offer."
