.223 / 55 Grain Ballistic Reticle w/ Thumb Screw Mount

The Trijicon 1-6x24 VCOG  (Variable Combat Optical Gunsight) is a rugged variable powered riflescope that accommodates close quarter battle (CQB) and long distance marksmanship. It features superior glass quality and light gathering capabilities with zero distortion. The bullet drop compensating and ranging reticles allow for the shooter to quickly and accurately estimate range and apply the correct hold. The first focal plane reticle allows the subtensions and drops to remain true at any magnification. With a forged 7075-T6 aircraft-aluminum-alloy housing, the VCOG is an exceptionally durable and nearly indestructible sighting system. Robust enough for any application, the VCOG utilizes a single AA battery, commonly found across the globe and offers 6 adjustable brightness settings for the LED reticle. When powered by a lithium AA battery (like the one provided), it boasts a considerable battery life of 700 hours at setting 4 (constant on). An integrated dial fin allows easy rotation through the magnification range and a constant eye relief means no head or stock position adjustments are needed. Waterproof to 20 meters (66 ft.).

1 Thumb Screw Mount

1 Lithium AA Battery

It's a model MPC-C that sells for around $900 new at Cabelas. I bought it used but I've had it apart and inspected it thoroughly and can tell it was well maintained by whoever had it before me. It was well oiled and the oil was in the right places. There was very little wear and doesn't look like it's had very many rounds put through it. When I took it out and shot it, it fed everything I put through it without a single glitch. The finish is as close to new condition as you can ask for on a used rifle. I've decided to build my own AR the way I want it and no longer need this one.  The red dot in the picture does not come with the rifle. I need it for one of my other projects. I just haven't had time to take it off yet. This is your typical store bought rifle, nothing extra. I feel like the price is fair at $650. I might consider a straight up trade for a Marlin 45-70 lever action. I would also take $450 cash PLUS a Smith and Wesson M&P compact 22LR. Other than that, there's nothing else I'm interested in at this time. I prefer to sell to Texas License to Carry holders only. I will not knowingly sell to anyone whom I believe is attempting to make a straw purchase. As unbelievable as it sounds, I had to turn away one buyer who came right out and admitted that he wanted to buy it for his son because his son was not legally allowed to own a firearm. Don't test me on this. I'm too old to spend the next ten years in prison. You must be able to legally own a firearm, end of discussion."

If you want to buy one outright just make a reasonable cash offer. I have an FN FNS-40, a S&W M&P .40 Shield, and a Ruger LC9s. All are striker fired. The FN is a full size duty pistol that comes with factory case and 3 mags. The Shield is a compact that comes with one 6 round flush, and one 7 round, extended grip magazine. The Ruger Is also a compact and comes with two 7 round magazines w/the flared grip extenders. The Ruger has some holster wear. All have been cleaned same day, after EVERY trip to the range. I am willing to do 2 or even 3 for 1 if the offered pistol is of greater value and is something I want. I also have over 5000 rounds of 22LR ammo, 475 rounds of 12 gauge 2-3/4” target/game shotshells, a couple hundred rounds of 7.62x39 steel case non-corrosive, and a 50 round box and 20-ish loose rounds of .40 cal ammo to add to any trade to even things out. I can send more pics on request. I’m mostly just interested in 9mm but will consider a few others. At the top of my trade list is a HK VP9, VP9SK, or any of the hammer fired 9mm HKs, or a Sig Sauer P320. I After that I’m pretty much open-minded and will respond even if only to say no that I’m not interested. I don’t have any interest in Taurus, other than maybe a Judge or .44 magnum, so please don’t bother with those. I also don’t like cowboy style revolvers or Hunting rifles. I’m not a hunter. I do ask that you Please be willing to negotiate, because if I like something and you offer what I believe is too little of an offer, I will counter offer with what I would consider fair. You should do the same if you like what I have but feel like the trade is not quite fair. I’m usually willing to come to some kind of agreement unless I’m just not interested in your offer.I didn’t know I needed to add a disclaimer but recent interactions on armslist suggest I do. YOU will pay for YOUR FFL background check. End of discussion, unless I OFFER to pay in order to strengthen a deal. Don’t try to spring it on me last minute after we settle on price. My pistols are all in used condition. I don’t have time to worry about if it has a nick somewhere because you think you can devalue my guns by picking them apart and pointing out real or imagined cosmetic flaws. Look at the pics, if you want a close up, just ask. None of mine have any major damage, and I’m up front about any known holster wear, but they are used and may have tiny nicks or scratches if you pick them apart and look real hard. You want a pristine, never fired gun go to a gun store. Sorry for my rant but apparently it needs to be said.My name is William and you can text me @ 808936228zero, or email me through armslist. I prefer texts for faster response as I don’t check my emails too often."

I chose the parts and corresponded the barrel and the bolt to avoid headspacing issues that normally plague these kind of ar15's.This is really a one of a kind rifle. Not many choose to go this route. One of my main reasons for having built this was that I wanted to be able to shoot cheap steel core ammo that goes for $0.20 per round. This gun has functioned flawlessly for all the 60 rounds I put it through. No misfires or shortstroking on the gas system. I have an enhanced firing pin installed in my BCG to counter light primer strikes. This gun will also come with all accessories like the 4-16x scope and travel bag. I really want to keep this gun but I need the money. I am not flexible on the pricing because it took me a alot of time and money to have a proper gun put together and these guns do cost this much especially with a very nice optic.

This is the best example I have seen in years on one of these with just a few minor scratches usually they have a ton of holster wear, that’s why I added it to my collection, however I’m moving to a smaller place and it’s time to part ways. I’d say the gun is about 90% condition. This gun is double action only. Prices on the older smith semi autos have been rising as they become more and more harder to find.

I purchased this rifle in 2006 and has been in a case hanging in a closet all this time. Today this rifle without accessories sells for $260 maybe less on sale but never lower than my price I'll bet. It cost $35 to transfer ownership atb both local Gun Shops so $235 seems to be a fair price for a wonderful carbine.

Model 8401 ships with two, 10-round BX-1 magazines.   Accepts all 10/22® magazines.   Molded, one-piece chassis and adjustable buttstock assembly are manufactured with glass-filled nylon for strength, stiffness and stability, making a solid foundation for accuracy each and every shot. Adjustable buttstock features a flat Picatinny bag rider making it easy to affix a rear monopod. A molded-in window provides a tether point for your squeeze bag, and a metal QD pocket makes it easy to secure a sling   Quick-Fit adjustable Precision Rimfire stock allows length of pull and comb height to be quickly and easily adjusted to get proper fit over a wide range of shooter sizes, outerwear and shooting positions. Indicating marks molded into the chassis help you quickly return to a previous position.   Big-Gun bolt throw adjustment enables shooters to change from a rimfire 1-1/2'' bolt throw to a short-action centerfire 3'' bolt throw, reducing the chance of short-stroking your bolt in competition.

Oversized bolt handle for positive bolt manipulation (same as the Ruger Precision Rifle®).   15"" free-float handguard is made of hard black anodized aluminum and features Magpul® M-LOK® slots on all four sides, for improved scope clearance and easy mounting of M-LOK-compatible rails and accessories.   18"" target barrel is cold hammer-forged from 1137 alloy steel to create ultra precise rifling for excellent accuracy. Barrels can be replaced easily by a competent gunsmith using AR-style wrenches and headspace gauges.   Threaded barrel (1/2""-28) for standard muzzle accessories, like the Silent-SR® suppressor, comes with a factory-installed thread protector covering both the threads and crown."
