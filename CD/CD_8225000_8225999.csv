This gun is in great used condition and is absolutely beautiful. The wood is flawless with two minor nicks. The metal on this gun is perfect. The gun has had custom work done by the well known Richard Patty. The porting was done by him as well as the forcing cones have been lengthened. This will make somebody a great gun. The gun comes with a slightly higher rib, factory chokes. and everything that would come in the factory box from Browning. Also included with this is a set of 8 rhino ported chokes."

First order of business, ergonomics. Anyone who's picked up a CZ 75 for the first time gets it — it just has to feel right in the hand. With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that 'brick-in-the-hand' feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was. Next up, trigger. So many striker-fired pistols fall short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10's trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb. pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. It may have taken a while to come to market, but we feel the wait has been worth it. With CZ reliability, engineered ergonomics and a bevy of features both familiar and new, the P-10 C is the complete package. This model comes with a threaded barrel, suppressor-height sights, and an Urban Grey frame.  4.61"" cold hammer-forged threaded barrel, 1/2x28 TPI Maintains the classic CZ grip angle Mild palm swell, deep beavertail, and 3 interchangeable backstraps allow it to fit a wide variety of hands Trigger was designed to minimize creep and stack, and breaks in to a 4.5-5 lb. pull Urban Grey fiber-reinforced polymer frame Oversized trigger guard allows use of gloves Suppressor-height night sights accommodate a muzzle device, and provide low-light targeting Compatible with P-07 magazines Includes two 17-rd. magazines and 3 interchangeable backstraps  TEXT ME AT SIX ZERO TWO 448 seven seven 89"

What he didn't disclose to the shooting public at large and me in particular, was that these 6.5 Grendel PPU cases are under a worldwide recall for the last 2-3 years for several different types of failures and, according to PPU-USA should not be reloaded. Vapor Trail knows of the recall and possible danger and, after discussing this situation, feels that their disclosure was sufficient. The possibility that extreme harm could come to someone from a failed PPU Grendel case is, somehow, insignificant to Vapor Trail implying that getting the sale was more important than safety. Since no one can safely reload these cases I am offering them FREE to anyone who will sign a statement that the cases will only be used for artsy craftsy projects and will NOT be used for reloads under any circumstances. Only a shipping charge of $7 will apply. The agreement must be signed by the recipient before a notary and returned prior to shipment.Courtesy of Vapor Trail Firearms business practices you can get 201 PPU 6.5 Grendel cases, that's $85 worth, for for only $7 in shipping charges.

In 1868 a large order was placed with Remington by the Egyptian Government for the No. 1 Remington Military Rifle to be chambered in the "".43 Egyptian"" cartridge, governments at that time considering it a matter of national prestige to field arms with proprietary cartridges. Before the order could be delivered, Egypt (which had had close ties with the French since the Napoleonic excursions and the building of the Suez canal), ""defaulted"" so that a large part of the order could be sold to France as she was greatly underarmed during the Franco-Prussion War of 1870-71. It is estimated that some 13,000 such rifles were delivered to France at that time. However, the original order was again placed and by 1876 the last of some 60,000 rifles were delivered.
