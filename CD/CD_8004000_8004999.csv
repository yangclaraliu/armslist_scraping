I was told that these parts are actually solid gold and not gold plate I CAN NOT VERIFY THAT. However, it is very possible. In 1971, gold was selling for about $40/ounce. The previous owner was well off, and obviously spent a lot of money on this handgun.If the trigger and other parts are REAL GOLD, just the gold alone COULD make this gun worth at least $1300 or more, the current price of an ounce of gold."

It will handle the effects of the harsh environments as well as stainless. The action was trued and magazine changed to a single stack. It has a 26"" Shilen match grade stainless barrel with muzzle brake. The stock is a custom H-S Precision with a length of pull of 13 7/8"". It was built by Dick Wagaman of Dick's Gunsmithing in Lakeville Minnesota for me. The .378 is a very hard hitting round, even at long range and this one is very accurate. Price is $2100 with a Leupold VX-3 3.5-10 in Burris Signature mounts or $1800 for gun only.

I’ve exchanged a few positive emails with some good people. Yes I know, I am selling at great prices. Just for fun, I’ve also exchanged a few emails with people trying to send me worthless cashier’s checks in the hope that I would spend a lot of money to give them some of my property. Don’t send me questions about my best price. If you want to make me your best offer, go ahead although I’ve already priced my items to sell and more than reasonable price. If I said that I wanted $200 for an item, then I want to $200 for an item. Your offer of $50 cash isn’t really an offer. So..........I bought this gun new around 2007. I’ve upgraded the slide rod to fullsize, plus recoil system with Wilson Combat parts. I changed out the grips. In the picture you can see that I am also including the original parts as well. It has always been a good shooter. Not sure the upgrades helped any. It may have originally come with only 1 mag, because the 3 others that go with this gun, are stamped differently. I only have shot ball ammo in this gun. No issues to feed / extract with cheap or the more expensive ammo. I don’t know about how well hollow points might work. There is some wear marks here and there. I’ve recently been shooting it a lot more. Looks like it got loose in my range bag and has some new marks on it. Back when I got it, the parkenized finish on the barrel visible through the slide window area, already looked rough. I’ve called Springfield back then and again recently. They told me this was normal and had no advice on how to make it pretty, so I polished it up. Looks great now. The GI sights work well enough, but to change the sights out to something more modern, I am going to have to send the slide back to Springfield or I can just sell it and buy one with different sights. I recently bought the same size gun in a double stack. I’m not that motivated to sell this one, but if you want it, email me. Sooner or later I am planning on buying a SA XDE 9MM. If you have one and don’t like it, we can talk trade plus your cash. And for those who didn’t already know this, the main spring housing assembly DOES NOT use a cap pin. If you remove the main spring housing, be sure to not let the main spring shoot across the room. Even though the mainspring housing accepts a cap pin, you must not put one in it or you will figure out quickly that something is now wrong with your hammer action. Don’t ask me how I know.

For sale: one Nice USED Interarms Virginian Dragoon in .44S&W Magnum ( 44 Magnum ). Stainless steel. 7-½ inch barrel.
These tank-like revolvers come with different engraved quotes. This one says, “Sic Semper Tyrannis”, which is the Commonwealth of Virginia’s motto, and happens to be one of my favorite expressions of freedom. I bought this during the eight years regime of a recent wannabe tyrant, so it has special meaning. ;) Interarms was a firearms manufacturer in Northern Virginia, not far from where I used to live.
It hasn’t been fired much, and comes with the original box.
Here is what someone had to say about the Dragoon on the web. I am quoting him -with reference- to give him credit:
  “ ..The dragoon no question, better built and stronger than a black hawk, far better trigger due to not having a striker system and timed not to cut a rut around the cylinder. The dragoon uses a cylinder pin lock to allow for 6 rds carry much better system than the striker in my opinion and it has engraved dots over one chamber to mark it if you wish to carry 5. they came in 45 --44 mag --41mag and 357 .. ruger is too focused on profit to build a revolver that is timed and will maintain its appearance to suit me. but then i'm old enough to remember real quality.. “ [torpedoman], on Castbullits.com.
$550 or first reasonable sounding offer. Will also consider the combination of cash and ammo.
No waiting, No sales tax, No shipping charges. No FFL transfer fees. ________________________________________________________________________________  Buyer agrees to quickly show me a valid TX Driver’s License and CHL first and sign a simple Bill of Sale. -> Nothing besides our names/signatures and the gun info will be on it. I’d be more than happy to send you a copy so you can see what mine looks like. A Bill of Sale will protect us both."

Serial number may vary from the one shown in the pictures.
