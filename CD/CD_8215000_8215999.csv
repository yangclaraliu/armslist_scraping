It has a 24 hp briggs and a 48 inch deck. I have 3 mowers and am thinning the herd so to speak. This comes with more aggressive ag type tires and 1 year old set of gator blades and for the right deal a new battery. The mower is my back up mower for when it gets really wet which is the reason for the aggressive tires(new turf tires are something like 200 I believe). It is also the reason the hours are low. Has the typical cosmetic wear, but its a Scag and is built unbelievably tough just like my Deere which is my primary mower. I replaced the charging system last year and upgraded the starter solenoid to an automotive type one. It has a nice adjustable seat with arm rests and as all Scags I've seen a very finely adjustable height for the deck.Trades :: I will happily consider all types of firearms trades. I am especially interested in a trapdoor, lever gun, revolvers - especially SA cartridge guns, and the obvious fun modern sporting rifles. Absolutely no Glocks though, I will consider most everything else. Trades plus cash or just a cash offer, lets talk and see if something works where everyone is happy and gets a new toy."

We have used this a couple times and it is really great but ended up getting a newer one that will allow us to get video at 2,200 yrds away. In this set up you will see it all comes in a pelican case. your have your camera with charging equipment and a long range antenna. so you set up your camera at the target and point the antenna twords where you will be shooting from. then you take the pelican case to where your shooting from and power on the box. this will allow you to boost your singnal to your camera from your tablet or phone. download the target vision app and your off to have a great shooting day. in the app it allows you to mark your holes. it also allows you to shoot with a partner and you can mark there holes as well. this was a fun camera system but like i said earlier you can go up to a mile. at about 1,800yrds the camera can get glitchy. so thats why we ended up getting a newer one so we can shoot up to 2,200yrds with a .338 Lapua. $500 OBO dont be afraid to make an offer.
