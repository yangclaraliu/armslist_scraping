This AMAZING piston driven, fully ambidextrous rifle was a three year project costing thousands to convert into a G36 semi-auto build. I accomplished some of the work myself, but much was done by some very talented young gunsmiths in the local area. I have fired approximately 1000 rounds through this rifle without a single stoppage of ANY kind! It's ridiculously fun to shoot, extremely comfortable and accurate. She simply runs like a top all day long! There are other conversions of this type out there, but none quite like this customized one-of-a-kind beauty. 16 3/4"" SL8 profiled heavy duty barrel including the flash hider (permanently attached.) 36"" overall length. Folding stock for transport only. Will not fire with the stock folded. Total weight: approximately 9 lbs.

This rifle is fully U.S. 922R compliant with five critical U.S. made parts:

Piston
Piston rod
Bolt
Trigger
Magazine floor plates (both magazines)

Comes with two thirty round double stacked H&K magazines, a Harris bipod, Magpul MBUS vertical foregrip, Magpul MBUS folding flip-up/backup iron sights and an EOTech reflex holosight with a 3x Gen 2 magnifier on a low profile upper rail. 

The original grey receiver was finely ""Dura-coated"" black and other parts have been Dura-coated as well to match the tone. There is some minor wear on the brass deflector and some minor wear on the cheek weld and trigger. All internal parts are in excellent condition.

Comes with a Blackhawk 3-point tactical sling, a Tac Force rifle case, a box of several various parts and 100 rounds of Federal 55 grain .223 ammunition.

Estimated value: $7,000. Sale price: $3,500. (Final mark-down)

This price was dramatically reduced as there is little or no market for a ANY semi-auto .223/5.56 for more than $5,000.00.

MUST PRESENT A VALID ID AND BE ABLE TO LEGALLY PURCHASE A FIREARM AT PURCHASE.

Well I want another one. They're good rifles. But the catch is that I don't want to pay double (I.e. $1200+) what someone else did just cause they happened to be in the right time at the right place to find one and now they're trying to profit selling for double. You don't go buy a brand new car, use it, then sell for a twice retail. So I want another one and I have cash money. Unless you have a whole lot of stuff (I'm not going to pay you labor for installing parts either, a $50 handguard does my warrant a $200 price increase) I'm looking to spend around $800. So actually you still would end up profiting I guess, depending on what you have. Are there any sane rational people left on armslist or has this site gone to the wolves and thieves?"

The bullet engineered with the competitive shooter in mind. Hornady began with a bullet legendary in its accuracy - the Hornady XTP - and redesigned it as the perfect competition projectile. While the XTP uses folds and a cannelure to aid in expansion and increase terminal performance, expansion is meaningless in competition. So, the folds and cannelure are gone from the HAP (Hornady Action Pistol) bullet. Because jamming can cost a competitive shooter the match, Hornady placed the HAP's pure lead core inside a copper jacket that protects the nose, ensuring smooth feeding. And like the XTP, the core of the HAP bullet is cold swaged from pure lead to give it amazing consistence, balance and stability in flight."

This is also not a 6.5 creedmore, but a 6.5 grendel (armslist did not have that option)

I have a custom built 6.5 Grendel made with only premium mil-spec components. I have only put 200-300 rounds out of this barrel, so it is very lightly used. It has been regularly cleaned/lightly oiled. 

This weapon system was built with, and features the following components (all listed are included in this auction):
20"" Sabre Defence fluted barrel with a 1 in 9"" twist rate(verified)and a matching Sabre Defence bolt
Daniel Defense upper receiver
Daniel Defense Omega 9.0 free float quad rail
A premium flash hider
Adams Arms piston system (runs cleaner & cooler)
Badger Ordinance extended charging handle
Harris Bipod adaptor
Harris Bipod (extendable 9-13"")
EGW Scope rings
Bushnell Elite 4200 6-24x50mm Illuminated mil-dot reticle scope w/ sunshade (lifetime transferable warranty)
Butler Creek flip up scope covers
Sinclair Scope level


This upper receiver group also comes with three 25 round C-Products magazines and a Midway USA soft case. I have shot a few .5"" groups at 100 yards with this upper (likes ammo in the range of 120-123 grains). I did not low ball ANYTHING in putting this upper together and the quality shows when you handle this thing... and to top it all off, I custom painted it with a combination of Duracoat & Cerakote (Cerakote base on the barrel and scope, Duracoate base on the upper receiver itself). Sabre Defence (at the time when I got the barrel) was known as one of the premium barrel manufacturers and was highly recommended.

You can push this thing out to a mile and still have more ft. lbs. of energy than a .45 cal. round has at close range. That's one thing I love about the Grendel round so much. I just happen to be getting ready to move to Alaska where there will be some very large game and I need a bigger rifle. Another thing that is a huge benefit to the 6.5 Grendel is that you can put it on any AR-15 lower receiver! So if you normally have your .223 upper on your lower and are planning on going hunting, just change out uppers and you are good to go!"

Here is some details from optics planet: 
Nikon M-223 1-4x20 offers high quality and peace of mind, for accuracy when it matters. These Nikon M-223 Riflescopes are all engineered for the 223 Rem./5.56mm NATO round with 55-grain polymer tip bullet. With Nikon's latest reticle and adjustment technologies, the Nikon M-223 8485 Riflescope integrates the same level of quality as their flagship Nikon Turkey Pro Riflescopes. In addition, the Nikon 8485 Riflescope from Nikon is waterproof, fogproof as well as shockproof and this Nikon riflescope is nitrogen filled and O-ring sealed.

The M223 1-4x20mm is the ideal Nikon riflescope with a super-wide field of view and newer Point-Blank Reticle which allows for rapid-fire precision out to 200 yards. If you are looking for reliable shooting accuracy, the M 233 1-4 x 20 gives you a new level of shooting confidence. Designed for AR carbines and popular 3 gun competitions, the 1-4x20 with Point Blank reticle features an extremely large exit pupil for low light performance and a super wide field of view. The all-new Point Blank reticle technology means incredibly accurate and fast shooting from zero to 200 yards thanks to thick reticle posts and purpose-designed 3-MOA center dot for instant targeting on paper or steel plates."

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today's infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.

T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its' superior ballistics.

Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E)
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets its' additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960's was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.

5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.

Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking."

Got that squared away and I've had no problems since.  It is a fun gun to shoot.  I'm only selling because I just bought a Vector and I need to put a little cash back in the bank account. 

Thought that I'd add that this HK is probably the best ""tacticool"" .22 on the market. Everything that is supposed to be metal is metal. No plastic junk like on the Mossberg and its built a lot better than the Colt. I looked at all three and this was the closest you'll get to a .223/5.56. The mag release works and the ejection port cover works just like the real deal. Unless you buy a .22 conversion for your AR, this is the AR .22 to own.

It appears to be in very good shape and well cared for, no holster wear, internals look great, standard sights, one magazine with a Pierce extension on it. Now includes 20 rounds of Hornady Critical Duty 175 grn hollowpoints as well. Looking to trade straight across for a similar condition 3rd Gen Glock 26 in 9mm only. Can add cash or any of the items listed here - http://www.northwestfirearms.com/part-accessory-classifieds/109065-whole-bunch-holsters-stocks-grips-other-gun-stuff.html - for a gun with night sights or extra mags or ammo.

Looking for a face-to-face transaction anywhere within an hour or so of Salem.

Thanks!"

Im very very very impressed with this trigger system. Timney has a lifetime guarantee on all their trigger systems. Im only selling this trigger because I'm selling the rifle that the trigger is installed in and the Timney trigger is not part of the deal. I would install it on my other AR but I already have a Geissele trigger installed in it.

I will have better pics soon. Im leaving the trigger installed until I sell the rifle on Thursday. 


Factory info:

Self-contained module is ready to install in your small-pin AR and deliver an exceptionally smooth, crisp, creep-free single-stage trigger pull that feels more like a traditional bolt action than a combat rifle trigger. 100% drop-in—no gunsmithing, fitting, or adjusting required. All components are captive in the lightweight, aluminum alloy housing. Hammer is wire-EDM machined from S7 tool steel that combines hardness to resist wear with superior impact resistance to withstand heavy use without chipping or breaking. Other components are EDM cut from A2 tool steel, then heat treated to Rc 56-60 for long service life. Precision-ground engagement surfaces ensure superb reliability and a crisp, clean hammer release. Installs using your rifle’s original hammer/trigger pins; proprietary design eliminates pin walkout."

 Product Description
 MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver is one of the most recent AR-15 Lower Receivers to hit the market. The MAG Tactical Systems AR-15 Lower Receiver is about 35 percent lighter than a standard aluminum receiver, and it is not plastic! The MAG Tactical Systems Generation 4 Lower is made of a proprietary magnesium alloy. The patented coating process that MAG Tactical Systems owns gives their lower extreme corrosion resistance characteristics.
 The MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver incorporates a machined in triggerguard that is larger than a mil-spec trigger guard, which allows the trigger to be accessed with thick winter gloves.
 The MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver front and rear pivot points are reinforced to avoid breakage of the receiver even when high torque is applied when it is in the break down position
 Today’s warrior has been looking for a lower receiver that has the low weight and high feature list that the MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver has to offer.

The Bushmaster facility in Windham was closed and the employees were laid off. Soon afterward the original owner stepped back into the picture. He still owned the facility as he had been leasing it to Freedom Group since selling Bushmaster in 2006. He also had a 5 year non-compete agreement that was expiring soon. He must have felt as I do, that no one can make these rifles better than the folks in Windham, Maine so he decided to put another company together and put the workers back in business making these fine rifles. The new company was named Windham Weaponry and commenced manufacturing operations over the summer of 2011.

 This Federal American Eagle Ammunition is genuineLake City Ammunition Plant overrun ammunition. This tracer ammunition is loaded to military specification and is perfect for providing the shooter with immediate feedback through trajectory visualization by allowing the bullet path to be seen. Tracer ammunition is a great choice for banging away at steel targets, casual plinking and high-volume blasting sessions. The military uses tracer ammunition as an efficient tool for signaling they are effective for use as pre-arranged signals between units and individuals; they also can be used to designate targets. Tracers burn very bright and very hot they may catch surrounding vegetation on fire so they should only be used where there is a limited chance of the shooter starting a fire. This ammunition is loaded with a delayed ignition tracer meaning it will not ignite for 50-100 yards. This means the tracer is not burning up barrels prematurely causing damage to expensive firearms. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer-primed, reloadable Lake City brass cases. 

Please Note: While the 5.56x45mm NATO will fit in a .223 Remington chamber, the 5.56 is a military round that runs at higher pressures than its .223 counterpart and is not recommended to be fired in a .223 Remington chamber."
