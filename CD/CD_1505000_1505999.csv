MagPul ACS-L stock is quite nice (with storage). MagPul MOE grip with storage as well. Otherwise, this is a great platform for someone to learn AR basics on. Has the GI style A2 sights and a very smooth/crisp trigger which came from DPMS via Brownells. The Quad rail is made in California from MilSpec Aluminum, then GunKoted to match the rest. This gun will be a tough beater or something that no one else has at the range.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin."

Taurus has expanded its popular Tracker series of revolvers with the 405.

Taurus has made its name by producing revolvers that are both economical and innovative. Guns such as the Raging Bull and Judge opened up new potential in revolver design, power and performance. A new revolver shows that Taurus still travels that same path. The 405 is a snubnose chambered for .40 S&W.

Built on the same-size steel frame as the 992, the Taurus 405’s .40 S&W chambering and 2-inch snubnose barrel were chosen with another purpose in mind, namely, self-defense. Large-bore, snubnose revolvers have always had a small but passionate group of followers. Revolvers in that class are usually chambered for .41 Rem. Mag. or .44 Spl., but modern defensive loads in those calibers are hard to find. One could argue that greater bullet mass and increased bore diameter more than make up for outdated projectiles, but the 405 offers the big-bore enthusiast the opportunity to carry a snubnose revolver chambered for a round that’s available with the latest modern bullets.

This pistol was a very limited edition from TALO in late 2010 through early 2011. The run was never completed and only a few of these pistols were made. This one has factory Metrolight night sights and a Glock grip plug installed. I had a Glock Armorer install a 3.5 lb trigger kit including the connector and all 3 springs over the weekend. Its actually a little less then 3lbs I think. I have a couple of other Glocks done exactly the same way and this one has the lightest trigger. The factory trigger parts are inlcuded. This gun also includes 2 hi-cap mags, the box and all factory accessories. 

These EXO Glocks are extremely hard to find especially brand new. The chance of you walking into a gun dealer and them having one are almost impossible. The last few Glock EXO's that sold on Gunbroker went for around $700. And thats without the extras that are on this one. Im asking $795 or best offer. As we all know Glocks are a little hard to come by right now with most dealers only having a couple if any at all. I personally know several friends of mine that are dealers that have been waiting months on their Glock stock orders. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or offers. Im not interested in any trades at this time and low ballers can go on to the next listing. Thanks for looking & GOD Bless."

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension 

M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver

In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels. 



T-Marked Upper Receiver 

The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission. 



USGI 1/7 Twist Rate 

The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics. 



Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel 

BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.



Chrome Bore and Chamber 

One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning. 



Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish 

Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base. 



5.56 NATO Chambers 

The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo. 



Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases 

Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets. 



Government Barrel Profiles 

Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems. 



HPT / MP Inspected Barrels 

Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

This pistol was a very limited edition from TALO in late 2010 through early 2011. The run was never completed and only a few of these pistols were made. This one has factory Metrolight night sights and a Glock grip plug installed. I had the Glock Armorer install a 3.5 lb trigger kit including the connector and all 3 springs over the weekend. Its actually a little less then 3lbs I think. I have a couple of other Glocks done exactly the same way and this one has the lightest trigger. The factory trigger parts are inlcuded. This gun also includes 2 hi-cap mags, the box and all factory accessories. 

These EXO Glocks are extremely hard to find especially brand new. The chance of you walking into a gun dealer and them having one are almost impossible. The last few Glock EXO's that sold on Gunbroker went for around $700. And thats without the extras that are on this one. Im asking $775 or best offer. As we all know Glocks are a little hard to come by right now with most dealers only having a couple if any at all. I personally know several friends of mine that are dealers that have been waiting months on their Glock stock orders. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or offers. Im not interested in any trades at this time and low ballers can go on to the next listing. Thanks for looking & GOD Bless."

You understand that your personal protection game plan requires true knock out power. You also understand that you could find yourself in legal jeopardy by using deadly force. Here’s why a TASER is your best option: Only TASER provides the non-lethal power to knock out a violent attacker for a full 30 seconds from up to 15 feet away. That gives you plenty of time to escape from a dangerous situation without having to resort to deadly force. That’s right, TASER offers the same tools the police use to take down hostile criminals"

Really Crazy Story!!! 
I bought a single shot exempted XDs from some scammers known as CWS Tactical, AKA Cold War Shooters, AKA Country Wide, AKA CWS Clear Water in Highland CA (All of the aliases show that they have been in trouble before.) STAY AWAY FROM THESE CROOKS they tried to sell me a different gun than what I had bought paid for and to their suprize took pics of before my 30 day wait period. Not sure how that would have been possible being the serial numbers would not have matched. These A**HOLES did not even say sorry nor refund my money and I ended up having to do a credit card charge back on them. DOJ is already on this...

Point of story?
Not looking for any funny crap this time. I have money to spend and want the XDS that I pay for that's all private or dealer sale at any FFL except CWS Tactical...

The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.

It includes an original EOTech 502.A65 holographic sight with it's box, tool and cleaning kit, 1-30 round FN factory magazine, lock and manual.

The concept of the FS2000 allows accesories to be added while respecting the ergonomics, balance and the smooth lines of the rifle. This enables it to meet the present and future requirements of different types of units in a wide range of missions. The FS2000 can be comfortably and safely used left-handed without modifications and thanks to the forward ejection, the left-handed shooter is not at risk from cases, gas or debris, the safety and firing selector, the magazine catch, etc, are easy to manipulate left-handed.

Bullpup design gives a very compact rifle with a full-length barrel. Light, with excellent balance (the center of gravity is positioned over the strong hand), and with a smooth outer shape, the FS2000 is easy and comfortable to carry. Firing selector and magazine catch are easily accessed."

It includes an original EOTech 502.A65 holographic sight with it's box, tool and cleaning kit, 1-30 round FN factory magazine, lock and manual.

The concept of the FS2000 allows accesories to be added while respecting the ergonomics, balance and the smooth lines of the rifle. This enables it to meet the present and future requirements of different types of units in a wide range of missions. The FS2000 can be comfortably and safely used left-handed without modifications and thanks to the forward ejection, the left-handed shooter is not at risk from cases, gas or debris, the safety and firing selector, the magazine catch, etc, are easy to manipulate left-handed.

Bullpup design gives a very compact rifle with a full-length barrel. Light, with excellent balance (the center of gravity is positioned over the strong hand), and with a smooth outer shape, the FS2000 is easy and comfortable to carry. Firing selector and magazine catch are easily accessed."

My understanding is that the Maverick 88 is the same as the 500 except the safety is near the trigger on the M88 instead of near the tang. Also, the for-end (pump) can't be replaced on the M88 with a fancy aftermarket one, The 500 can. 

I purchased this M88 used from Gander a few months ago. It has some minor pitting on the part that connects the magazine tube to the barrel. This M88 is my second one. I have had excellent luck with both, and I use them. I'm selling this one to fund another project. A new 500 will cost you $350 before tax and without the extras.
