here's what Cabelas says about this ammo:
""By replacing costly brass cases and copper jackets with aluminum and nylon, USA-made Herter’s aluminum-case handgun ammunition keeps cost down while preserving clean-shooting reliability and accuracy. Sized to incredibly precise tolerances, the nonreloadable, aircraft-grade aluminum cases cycle smoothly. Premium-quality, round-nose lead bullets are coated with a Total Nylon Jacket (TNJ) to replace expensive copper jackets. TNJ bullets are inherently accurate, and cycle fluidly through semiautomatics. As an added benefit, TNJ bullets eliminate hard-to-remove copper and lead fouling. Made in USA. Per 50."""

First is an original 1943 dated nagant PU sniper which is a bring back as it has no importation markings. The only drawback I can see is the previous owner stated the scope had a very worn finish so he reblued the scope. Not really a big deal as the finish on the gun is still original but it was worth mentioning for full disclosure. Rifle is very accurate and shoots well the price is $700 and that price includes the 
Sealed tin of ammo. It's Very hard to find bring back originals as most are reproductions. Second I have a Mauser 24/47 sniper that I
Purchased about 10 years ago that was dubbed a Balkan war sniper They were sold around 2002-2003 as imported. Some came with bases and even scopes but mine was purchased as just the gun with the holes already drilled into the reciever as was done by the army who fielded it as a sniper. Once I received the gun I sent it off to a
Mauser guru who builds guns back to orginal WW2 sniper spec and he completely redid the rifle from top to bottom at the cost of $1200. He basically did about everything you can do to a rifle to make it more accurate from bedding the stock, to action job, to trigger job. He also tru cut the chamber for accuracy as well as trimming any wood that made contact with the barrel and trimmed the barrel bands so they no longer touched the barrel as well. He then topped it off with a vintage weaver scope that looks identical to the ww2 German scopes and added quick release rings for easy scope removal. The results are the rifle shoots half inch 100 yard groups all day long with off the shelf hunting ammo. This rifle is not only a nice example of a WW2 sniper it is also an amazingly accurate shooter that will out shoot most modern snipers. I have tons of money invested into this gun and it shows with not only performance but looks as well. Price is $1000 for just the
Gun or $1125 with 350 rounds of 8mm ammo. Will sell everything as a package for $2000. I will also include an additional 3 post reticle scope. Prices are pretty firm as I have close to $2000 invested in the Mauser alone. E-mail, call, or text REDACTED."

This pistol was a very limited edition from TALO in late 2010 through early 2011. The run was never completed and only a few of these pistols were made. This one has factory Metrolight night sights and a Glock grip plug installed. I had the Glock Armorer install a 3.5 lb trigger kit including the connector and all 3 springs over the weekend. Its actually a little less then 3lbs I think. I have a couple of other Glocks done exactly the same way and this one has the lightest trigger. The factory trigger parts are included. This gun also includes 2 hi-cap mags, the box and all factory accessories. 

These EXO Glocks are extremely hard to find especially brand new. The chance of you walking into a gun dealer and them having one are almost impossible. The last few Glock EXO's that sold on Gunbroker went for around $700. And that's without the extras that are on this one. Im asking $765 or best offer.

It has holster ware but is in perfect working order. I was going to send it in to Colt to get refinished but they won't accept anything new until July. The price is $250 to get refinished from Colt. This gun is over 50 years old and I would say was carried on daily basis for some time. It truly is an amazing and historic gun. Since I have had it I have only fired about 30 rounds threw it, it is accurate at 20meters and in very good working order. It has the plastic grips which at first concerned me until I read that Colt put plastic grip on the Detective from 1947-1954. That means the grips are original. I am asking $600 but I will not be offended by any offer, worst case I say no.

Gun comes with box in like new condition, fired maybe 200 rounds during two range trips. Was going to be for concealed carry (weighs only 26 oz) for wife, she wanted something smaller for the pocket book. Only thing I really used was the gun lock. If I can find a new/unused one laying around, I can substitute that.

Comes with two magazines, case, tools, etc.

With the gun, if you want it, I have up to 300 rounds of .22LR available.  Open bulk (baggies or open 525 box) .06 for Federal (which this gun likes) or CCI Blazer (untested with this gun)  $0.10 a round for boxes of 50 - (200-300 available).   I have to know BEFORE you come for the gun.

I have a new generic rail laser (NIB) for $25 if you want, I have to know BEFORE you come for the gun.

=================================

Terms: You have to have a GFL (Georgia concealed carry permit) that is current. We do a bill of sale, GFL to GFL. No exceptions, period.

DHS is buying up 1.6 billion rounds (750 million .40 S&W) using our tax dollars borrowed from China, enough for a 100 year war in Afghanistan. Which is causing this shortage, along with insane gun restrictions. So ... before we even talk or shake hands you have to say:

""I didn't vote for Obama because he sucks."". No exceptions. PERIOD.

Otherwise you can go back home. I don't need or want your money.

If you are a criminal and thinking about something stupid, don't bother. I live between two police stations and you have to pass one at my business address (Avondale) or house to get here.

Continuing to thin my collection.

Here is a very nice Ruger SP101 in .357/.38 caliber. It has a 3"" barrel length with a spurred hammer. The slim frame and size of the SP101 is designed for personal protection and carry purposes versus it's larger cousin the G100. It currently wears a brand new Hogue Monogrip. The original factory grips are also included. I do not have the box or manual. I do not know an actual round count. I bought this handgun used. It is in excellent overall condition and appears to have had more safe time than actual use. Please email me with any questions.

Real Bushmasters... not fakes or knock-offs (yes... the Chinese do make them) or the ones made by the new company that bought Bushmaster. Uppers and Lowers match up nice and tight with no slop whatsoever. BCG has great ""staking"" and cocks the hammer with the bolt, not the firing pin like some ARs. BCG has the THICK lower end about 1"" (one inch) almost like a Full-Auto carrier and is nice and heavy. Compared it to the S&W and it had better staking and a little bit more weight to it. These rifles are ready to rock... pick an upper and head out- Or take both???

And for all you haters out there that say, ""mines better than a BushMaster, or lighter, or faster, or whatever.... "" if you're comparing your rifle to a Bushmaster then obviously Bushmaster is the standard that other rifles must measure up to and I've never seen Bushy in a Wal-Mart- S&W, DPMS...= yes, Bushy... =No (Colt is the TOP of the line, not the standard- if it was, no one could afford an AR... just saying)... My Bushy's have NEVER jammed, stove-piped, or even hiccuped and I'll swear that on a stack! Of coarse I only run steel-case ammo because brass through an Assault rifle will get you killed and I have the casings to prove it (from my AK not my Bushy's) (the 40 rounds of Brass was a gift)

****Cash Price is Firm...

What I do not have currently is 7.62x54r to feed my new m44 and .223/5/56 to feed my ak. I'd like to turn some of my
9mm stash into some rifle ammo. What I'm willing to deal:

-2 boxes (100rds) federal 9bple-115gr +p+-cash value of $65
-3 boxes (150rds) of federal 124 gr +p hst-cash value of $90
-2 full boxes. 1 partial box (~135rds) of hornady critical duty 135gr standard pressure-cash value of $80

So, I'd sell the ammo for the prices listed above, or would trade for an equivalent amt of rifle ammo (i.e.-$90 worth of ammo should = 1 spam can of 7.62x54r). The 223/5.56 trade ratio woud have to depend on the quality of the ammo. I have 5.56 ak so it will eat anything, steel or brass. I'm not interested in your $1per round ammo. I'd like to think since I have high quality 9mm ammo here (over .50 a rd) we'd use the same type logic in valuing each others ammo. So for example, I'd probably be willing to do a 1-1 swap for m855 or m193, not for 1-1 for wolf or tula plinking ammo...

Hands down the best AK made. Completely imported and customized by Arsenal Las Vegas. I wanted the best AK Platform, and this is it. AR's have already made a comeback in stores, but this rifle is not in any store across the country. Go look for yourself. This is the only TRUE Arsenal sgl-31 94 I have seen on armslist in the sate of NC. This is a highly valuable platform, made for a firearms enthusiast that understands what he is getting. It is not for your typical guy looking for a typical AK. Please look else where is you want a bargain, or an entry level CAI piece of junk. This rifle has only been touched by the best AK builders in the US, Arsenal Inc. You get what you pay for guys!! If you want to spend $800 on a CAI Romanian POS that was built from used parts and has canted sights and twisted receivers, then be my guest. But if you want a true AK that has been built by the best, then this is it!! This is a rifle you can trust your life with, a rifle that will increase in value over time, and a rifle that will make you happy every time you look at it. 

 I'm going to be honest and straight forward, just so there is no misunderstanding. I will probably not negotiate much at all, nor will I even consider Low Ball offers! I can't even decide for sure if I want to let it leave my possession. I am honestly just seeing what kind of interest I get and any offers I receive. I have no problem hanging on to this beautiful rifle. 

 Okay, now that you have an understanding from where 
 I'm coming from. I will gladly talk about the rifle itself. First off, the rifle is in like new condition. I have only shot maybe 6-7 magazines through it. Perfect working condition!
 I have upgraded this thing to be an operators dream! and it features:
 **Ace Push button side folding stock (skeleton model)......................$200
 **US Palm Battle Pistol Grip............................................................$25
 **Midwest Industries Rail...............................................................$140
 **XS Night Sights..........................................................................$120
 **Magpul Angled Fore Grip (AFG)...................................................$30
 **Tapco G2 Trigger.......................................................................$35
 **Krebs Custom Hammer and Trigger Retainer Plate.......................$15
 **Famous AK74 Muzzle Break........................................................$00
 I will include 8 Bulgarian Circle 10 magazines if the offer is right. These are $50 each, straight from KVAR. That's $400 worth of magazines alone!

 I also have a full spam can of 5.45x39 ammo (1080) rounds!

 So, with the upgrades and the magazines, that's a total of $965 just by themselves!
 Now you can see how much I have put into this rifle. Like I said, I will be just fine keeping this rifle and letting it increase in value. 

 Like I said, it has been upgraded to an AK Enthusiasts Dream. 

 I'm not putting pictures up, only because I want people to respond that are genuinely interested. If you think you want to fork up the cash, or have an item I have listed below, please let me know and I will text you photos.

Chambered for .30WCF (.30-30) the rifle was made in 1919. It has a saddle ring on the left side of the receiver, and a 20” round barrel ( we think the barrel has been cut down). The rifle has seen a lot of use during it’s long life, and that is reflected in the condition. Most all of the original blue finish is gone, the rifle has lots of ptina, freckling, and even some mild pitting on the barrel. The wooden stocks have been sanded, and they look pretty good – overall, the rifle rates about 70-75% condition. The bore has strong visible rifling, however there is also some pitting. The lever action works smoothly, and trigger pull is smooth as well. So…not a “perfect” 94 Winchester, but on the other hand it’s an honest gun that has not been messed with, it will display nicely, and the price is reasonable"

Condition: The pistol has 1139 rounds through it (I keep a log). There is some holster wear on the slide and a small scratch across the safety leaver. The pistol is 100% reliable. I keep it well-lubricated and it runs very smooth. I have never run it dry, but have fired ~160 rounds between cleanings and it keeps going. I am the first and only owner. When I do my part this pistol can hit milkjugs at 100-yards. The gun seems most accurate and runs the smoothest with 230gr Golden Saber, but I’ve also shot various Hornady, PMC, and WWB loads with decent accuracy and no cycling issues.

Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
