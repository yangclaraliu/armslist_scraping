This due in part to the fact that the propellants used in the loading of this ammunition were engineered to minimize muzzle flash.

Special Note from Hornady Manufacturing:
 •We are making a running change to the TAP ammunition. This includes changing from Blackened Nickel Cases to Bright Silver Nickel cases. Using the Silver Nickel cases has all the advantages of Blackened Nickel and the added benefit of being able to see the cartridges more clearly in low light conditions as well as when checking for loaded chambers.

WTB O/U 12g,"Victorville, Riverside, California",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, June 27, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hi folks, I'm selling a highly collectable S&W model 1, 2nd issue, made between 1860 & 1868. These are few and rarely found in good condition. This one is good enough it can actually be fired but of course this is a valuable collector piece and is respectfully retired. The timing is good, springs are still strong, teeth on the cylinder are in great shape, etc.. As you can see, the nickle plating on the cylinder is mostly gone but for maybe 20%. The rest of the gun retains I'd say around 90% of the nickel finish and definitely shows it’s age but is obviously all original. Overall this is a great piece for the collection. The grips are in great shape as well. I tried to get some good pictures here and of course feel free to ask questions. Being an antique, this does not require an FFL.  Value is $400.

Also is a Victor D/S action .22 revolver and it's also in great condition and shoots fine.  The frame is finished in Titanium Dura Coat and it comes with a holster, 80 rounds of ammo and a hard case.  The Victor with accessories is valued at $200.

I'll pay cash and/or trade for a suitable shotgun to use at the trap range.  My first choice is a 12gauge over/under but will consider others. 
I also have several types of ammo that I'm willing to barter with as well, and I do mean at normal store prices, not inflated, low-life, scumbag, scalper prices.

Like new has only had 150 flawless rounds through it. The Sig P290RS chambered in 9mm is the better, updated version (made January 2013) of the Sig P290 and one of the biggest upgrades is the ability to have a true double action trigger that gives you the ability to re-strike if necessary. It has a stainless slide, Sig Night Sights, an 8 round and 6 round factory mag, box, and all paperwork. I am also including a nice upgrade, a very nice Stainless guide rod (I will also include the plastic factory guide rod as well). 
This pistol is an awesome piece and I really do hate to sell it, but I need the money for some other projects. I can ship this handgun but I will need a valid copy of your gunshop's FFL and it must ship to the address on the FFL. Please add an additional $40 for shipping. Otherwise I will sell face to face at a gunshop for transfer (buyer pays transfer fee, my dealer charges $25) I also have additional 6 round mags new in package for $40 each.

This gun has matching numbers (i.e., bolt, bolt carrier, gas tube, and dust/receiver cover). The gun has Chinese wood upper and lower hand guards. And also has the thumbhole ATI Fiberforce stock set. However, I'm throwing in a new Russian wood laminated butt stock, however it's the one that was made for a milled receiver AK-47. But it will fit the Norinco MAK-90 stamped receiver like mine(if you decide to install/mount it later-but need to comply with the 1994 AWB weapon's law, which needs at least 5-U.S. made parts in/on the gun to make it legal - if you want to install a pistol grip and regular butt stock). Sorry, I don't have the Chinese thumbhole stock that usually comes with the gun. In addition, the gun has a pinned on flash hider. Overall, the gun is in excellent plus condition. However, there are a couple of small holes in the receiver. Someone (not me) drilled a couple of holes (pictured) in the receiver to install a scope mount. Both holes are not all the way through the other side. Just on one side (left side). But it does not look bad. Whoever drilled the holes did a really good job. Thought I'd mention it so there won't be any surprises. Although, it does not hinder or affect function wise. This gun is in really excellent shape, and the bluing is in excellent condition also. The scope mount and the base (rings included) will come with the gun. It's one of the early Chinese made scope mounts. It looks really nice and has a blued finish, and all steel. I believe it's one of the early Red Star brand from China that was imported back in the late 80's or early 90's. Just email me with any questions. I can email some more or close up pics if needed. You must be at least 18 years or older to buy this gun. Local (Kentucky) sales only. Thanks for looking.

There are only traces of the original plating, though enough to determine it is a nickel gun. The balance of the gun is void of finish and drifting to a light patina. There is mild erosion throughout and some mottled aging. There are some tooling marks on the hammer, and someone has replaced the base pin screw, apparently it required being re-drilled and tapped. The gun has a great frontier appearance. The screw heads are worn but serviceable. The markings are light. Overall, this handgun rates in about Good condition. 
  he left side of the barrel is etched “Colt Frontier Six Shooter”. The left side of the frame is marked “Pat. Sept. 19, 1871 / "" July 2,-72 / "" Jan. 19,-75”. The top of the barrel is marked “Colt’s Pt. F.A. Mfg. Co. Hartford, CT. U.S.A.”. The underside of the frame, back strap and trigger guard are marked “80378”. The loading gate is assembly numbered ""5200"". There is a ""Ca"" on the left forward trigger guard bow.
 The grips are one piece smooth wood. The fit is very good, though just a bit shy. There is scattered marking and the finish is a dark oil. There is general wear at the edges and a possible light sanding. There are no splits. The grips rate in about Good overall condition."

It is new and has never been fired. I bought an Adams Arms Evo Ultra Lite complete upper. This is a piston driven system that can run longer and shoot more rounds before it fails than a regular AR. Do the research. No dirty gas goes back into the body to make it cycle. The barrel is a Voodoo 16 inch barrel. This set up is the lightest piston upper made.  The model number is UA-16-M-EUL-556. I have the original box too. There are cheaper models, but this is the best they offer. 
The lower is brand new as well. It was built with a Spikes Tactical lower. It has an m-4 6 position adjustable stock. I also changed out the grip to a Hogue grip and it feels good. Have a look and email me with any questions. 
The scope is brand new. It comes with a preinstalled green laser that is very visible in daylight. The sight picture in the scope can glow red or green in 5 brightness settings, or not. It has a 2.5x - 10x zoom. You sight it in at 100 yards and to shoot at 500 yards, turn the knob to 5 and it compensates for the bullet drop for you, also 2,3,and 400 yards. 8don't need to sell it and I'm ok with keeping it. I read up a lot and did my research to buy the best. If you don't agree, then don't buy my rifle and keep looking."

Trijicon Bright & Tough(TM) Night Sights are three-dot iron sights that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive, they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and cushioned within silicone rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights feature a unique shock-resistant design. Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicone rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil. Green lamps are warranted for 12 years from the date of manufacture.

Professional installation recommended.

Because the slide is so short there was no room for the bushing to go when the slide went back. Therefore a larger bushing was made that slips over the barrel lugs during recoil, and the barrel diameter was belled to match. Another reason is with the shorter slide and barrel, the barrel angle would be too steep for the slide to function properly during recoil. A straight barrel would wedge the slide back during recoil. The shape of the bell keeps the barrel angled properly for slide function, and then realigns the barrel to the slide as the slide closes; there is a considerable amount of torque in a barrel and this is more evident in a short barrel. This barrel is beautifully bright. The ejection port is opened way out for trouble free ejection. Why put a series 80 on a frame size 70. A challenge I would say. A single action with polished receiver and trigger job. The grip is surrounded with a molded rubber grip sides and front. Rubber checkered easy grip under the grip safety. This is built on a series 70 size Federal Ordinance Frame.( mostly known for the VietNam era M-14) The safety is left side with a high grip safety. It took alot of time and work to make this series 80 fit atop a basically series 70. But it works and it works well. Easily concealed, plenty of knock down power."

The extra mag is a 7 rounder with the grip extension, which is nice seeing as Springfield only gives 2 5 round mags with the gun.  It also comes with a leather IWB holster which is hard to find for this firearm.  This gun sells for roughly 560 new, and after tax and background check you'd be paying about 610.00 plus you get the mag and holster.  So you're looking at almost $700.00 for everything.  I keep track of the rounds fired through all my guns and My records show only 120 through it so it's essentially not even broken in yet.  I don't really need to sell it but I don't shoot it or carry it so low balls will not be considered.  After all, it is still a cool gun to own and hold once a month even if I don't shoot it.

It is extremely reliable & has functioned 100% flawlessly no matter what ammo I run thru it. I've put around 500rds thru it with various brands & kinds of ammo (fmj, lead ball, hollow points...etc...), NO ftf's, NO fte's, NO issues whatsoever. I'd trust my life to it right now if I had to without question.  I'd take this over ANY Kimber,  Period.  If I ever buy another 1911 45 it will be another one of these.  

 My reason for selling is it's the only 45 I own so I'm thinning my semi-auto handguns down to the 9mm Nato/Luger round. 
   I will absolutely NOT sell the ammo without the gun so save us both the time & don't ask.  

 I will consider selling just the gun, mags & holster for $550 but would much prefer to sell it all as a package. 

  The gun is is excellent shape. Comes factory with one of the best match grade triggers I've ever used & it is very accurate as well. One factory mag & one Wislon Combat mag.  The holster is an excellent holster made of horsehide & Kydex. I bought it from a local company here in FL called  RBHolsters... very comfortable & stable.
    The ammo included is as follows:
  250rds of Aquila 230gr brass cased FMJ
  500rds of Winchseter white box brass cased FMJ 
 120rds of Federal Premium 230gr Hydra-Schok JHP Personal Defense 
 56rds of Federal Premium 165gr Low Recoil Hydra-Shok JHP Personal Defense.

   That's 750rds of quality brass cased FMJ's & 176rds of personal defense hollow points.
  750 FMJ's @ $.50/rd + $375
  176 Hydra-Shoks @ $1.25/rd = $220

     $595 worth of ammo + the gun & holster for $550 comes out to $1,145...   
   I'll sell it all for for $950cash FIRM. Must be at least 21, FL resident & not a felon. ccw preferred but not necessary.    Text me @ 772-214-82one4 if you are interested.

ATN Thermal Imaging Has Gone Digital!
 ATN is proud to introduce the newest line of ThOR Thermal Weapon Scopes. The most advanced night vision technology available is brought to you by the premier company dedicated to providing night vision systems at affordable prices. The new ThOR line is rich with features and options making it the best value of any comparable system on the market. This model is lightweight and small enough to fit in the palm of your hand, yet it’s rugged and durable.
 The entire system is built in the USA, utilizing Mil-Spec Lenses that make the ThOR battleworthy for most any mission, operation, or outdoor activity. Each system features a digital menu that gives you a variety of options and adjustments allowing you to customize your system. You can select a number of reticle options as well as choose a reticle color best suited for your specific application. No more black reticles on a black and white screen – ThOR features a color OLED display giving you a sharp color reticle every time. Or switch to full color mode and overlay it with either a black, red, blue, white or black reticle depending on the conditions and the environment.
 Ever have problems with a scope not being able to hold zero? The ThOR has no screws or springs that can create targeting errors. With all digital controls, the ThOR will NEVER allow your reticle to move off base.
 The new ThOR Thermal Weapon Scope provides provide amazing image quality through total darkness, fog, or smoke. Darkness, camouflage or bright lights will not affect the sensitivity of these units. All units have feature E-Zoom to expand your optical magnification. They’re Ideal for nighttime hunting, force protection, border patrol, police SWAT and special operations. And they feature a video-out connection and cable which will let you capture your nighttime operation on video. These units are priced like no other thermal devices in their class – as much as half of what you would expect to pay! No other product is comparable in value or price. The ATN ThOR functions equally well as a weapon scope or a handheld viewer. Once you experience Digital Thermal you may not want to use anything else again!
