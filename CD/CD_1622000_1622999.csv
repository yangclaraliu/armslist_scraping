There has been a strong push to restrict the import of these shotguns. Money only, no trades. CCW should be provided on private transaction so I can ensure you're legally allowed to own this weapon. This gun won't be on the market long."

This one is in Flat Dark Earth. NO OPTICS OR RINGS ! 

It may be related to the Model 82A1/M107, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough. 
Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor. 
The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold. 
Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. A titanium barrel key and fully chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability. 
Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle's rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is easily adjustable from either side. 
The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning. 
Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference."

The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.

The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot."

335,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1622335,For Sale:  BUYERS BEWARE  (Just providing information here),"Paola, Kansas City, Kansas",FREE,"Listed On: Tuesday, September 24, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"BUYERS BEWARE:
I am writing this in hopes to protect any potential buyers of ammo from a company Called American Bullet.   Based on my research, the company has two names, Highpoint Manufacturing/ American Bullet.    One year ago, the company contacted me via a blind sales call asking me to try and sell the ammunition that they produce.   Based on the prices they sold it for, and what I could get other brands for, I was leery to purchase any, but hey, new company, I will give them a shot.  I purchased 2 cases of ammo from them, one case of 9mm and one case of 40 S&W.  I took them to the range with a friend and we shot them up.  Based on our shooting, we could not determine any huge benefit of this ammo with a higher price point compared to any other ammo we have used in the past…….  
Fast forward to January 2013, Sandy hook, talk about gun control, weapons ban, magazine restrictions….  And yes, ammunition is disappearing off the shelves faster than they can they can take it out of the case.  People are buying up ammo, charging 5.00 higher… if not more for a box of standard target ammo…  This is where American Bullet comes in…  I am unable to get any ammo from my local guys, it is all allocated and my customers are getting desperate for ammo.  I called the American Bullet company and got the current price list from the sales department, and the order began.  First were the co-workers at my full time job.  In two days we had 33 cases of 9mm, 40S&W, and 45acp ready for an order.  I called and emailed my sales rep the order, and was given the total….  Contract accepted.  Bonus was, any order over 10 cases was free. Estimated time of completion was given to me at 6-8 weeks.  Well worth the wait!
With the first order out of the way, I decided to extend this deal to the public.  I was seeing folks sell the cheap stuff on different sites for the same price point of the good stuff so another 20 cases were sold to buyers from the local area.  The price went up a bit on this order due to the 2013 price increase…  5%   not bad, but still better than any other price if you could find it.  So in late January, another order was placed and was allowed to be added onto my existing order.  I continued to offer this deal on ARMSLIST through February 2013 with the knowledge of another price increase coming up at the end of March.  My sales rep at American Bullet made sure that I knew this so that I could get in another order before March 31St 2013.  An additional order was place and it was also allowed to be added on to the order and the price we provided with a total amount due and the shipping was still free as I had up to 70 cases, (70,000) rounds of ammo on order.  At no time during any conversation with the sales rep did they say that the ammo would go up after the order was completed.

Fast forward to May 10th 2013.  After waiting more than 12 weeks, being patient with them, passing on the excuses of short amounts of powder, primers….  I get an email from American Bullet advising me that the price of the ammo has changed and that the free shipping was no longer available….  Thinking that this was talking about any future orders, I called the company and talked to my sales rep and was in total shock when she told me that her President and CEO are now requiring all ammo to be priced out to the new price sheet that was provided and that it would sell for the new price no matter when the order was placed.  I was in total shock.  After doing the Math, I found that it would require an estimated 5-6000 dollars to complete the order.  So after 12+ weeks, American Bullet has managed to make 10 cases if my 70+ case order.  I emailed the company and told the CEO and President of the company that they had broken a contract, and that I would keep the order only if they would honor the original negotiated prices and provide me with the free shipping they promised…. In the event that they were unable to comply with my request, I would cancel all 70 cases…  After 5 days of waiting, and numerous complaints from my buyers who decided to complain about the poor customer service, I got an email from the President and CEO of American Bullet. ( You can read what they had to say in my other Add, in addition to my reply back to them)  
In a nut shell….After getting numerous hateful emails and phone calls, American Bullet decided to cancel my order, and told me that they were no longer able to maintain a respectful and trusting relationship with my Company.  
I am not telling you what to do here folks, I am just providing you with the information allowing you to be the judge of your own decisions.  American Bullet Breached a sales contract with me for 70+ cases of ammo.  They wanted me to go back to my customers and demand an additional $6,000.00 dollars in order to complete the order…  After thinking about it, it would have been more than that as they only had 10 cases of my 70 complete.  So if the order took another 12 weeks to complete, it could have been even more.  Buyers beware…..

On the Behalf of my customers who put faith in me to get them bullets, I apologize for failing you.  I have contacted the BBB and another complaint Board on your behalf.  I encourage each and every one of you to use extreme caution when purchasing any ammo.  If you got in on the American Bullet order and  you feel that what American Bullet has done to you is wrong, I encourage you to take 15 minutes of your time and file a complaint against the company so that others may think twice before making an ammo order.  
I told the owners of American Bullet that with today’s social media that the word would get out soon about what they pulled here…  I have seen it start just by this web site…  I have had non buyers contact me and urge me to post a warning to all…  So again… 
BUYERS BEWARE……..

I have not shot this on paper, but it has been reasonably accurate when shooting random stuff on the range. Ring securing top hand guard has loose tolerance and slides off easily (see pic)...this is a minor problem that a layer of tape where the ring goes will create a tight enough tolerance for it to stay on by itself..comes with a bag full of stripper clips, probably at least 20, some yugoslavian, some authentic german.

Battleline Industries: S.A.P.R 
(DOES NOT INCLUDE SOPMOD) 

The Stock Attachment Precision rifle or S.A.P.R. (pronounced “Sapper”) was developed by Battleline Industries as a lightweight attachment for the current LMT SOPMOD M4 stock utilized by SOCOM. Weighing in at just 17.5 oz, the S.A.P.R. balances the weight of the rifle and gives the operator the flexibility to adjust their rifle stock to enhance their marksmanship skill set and personal fit for delivering precision rifle fire from an M4 carbine or other weapons platform that utilizes an AR-15 style carbine stock/buffer tube adapter. The S.A.P.R. cheek piece elevates vertically for proper eye height and relief when using scoped optics and has an adjustable shoulder pad section that moves vertically and rotates 360 degrees for optimal positioning and comfort. 



A key feature of the S.A.P.R. is the proprietary cheek piece that rotates 90 degrees left or right for an AR/M4 based weapons platform where the user has the stock fully collapsed while using body armor and needs to perform an immediate action because of a stoppage, allowing free movement of the charging handle regardless of the cheek piece height. The cheek piece can then be rotated back into its original position without any shift or loss of initial adjustment. In addition to this feature, the operator can rotate the cheek piece out of the way if the primary optic goes down which allows the user to get a lower “cheek weld” to use the back-up iron sights on the weapon system.



NOTE: The cheek piece will not obstruct any weapon system with a side charging handle.



The S.A.P.R. is proudly made 100% in the USA and is compatible with these weapon systems with the correct AR-15 carbine stock / buffer tube adapter and LMT SOPMOD stock."

If any of you have ever owned any AR rifle, you know boththejoysof shooting, and thedread in cleaning thatcomes along with it. Say goodbye to the dread and experience nothing but joy now!

The SIG716 uses a gas piston operating system thatpushesa metal rodto therearwhich in turn engages the bolt carrier and cycles the action. Not only is this system incredibly reliable for extended firing, it makes having the carbon buildup all over your weapon's key components a thing of the past. It takes little more than removing the rod, wiping it down, and getting back to business. I know that's a little oversimplifying, but if you'veeverspent hourswith pipe cleaners, carb cleaner, star chamber tools, picks, toothbrushes, etc. trying to get your AR clean, you will definitely appreciate the piston system!

Like new. Ive only shot 50rds through it but didn't have a single failure. Polished internals. Very solid stock. Not a rattle or wiggle anywhere on the gun.
$600 is a little but less than what I paid for it then I spent 6hrs polishing and assembling the kit. The action is smooth as butter. You won't be disappointed. Shipping available at seller's expense

This usually means you will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened.

Hello and Thank you for checking out our auction. Up for auction is a brand new in box Barrett M107A1 CQ .50 BMG with a 20"" barrel. Mounted on this beast is a Japan Vortex Razor 5-20X50 ILL. 
A whole new legend.
It may be related to the Model M82A1, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. its titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. A titanium barrel key and fully chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle’s durability.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is easily adjustable from either side.

The M107A1 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that’s optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

Features:
Suppressor-ready muzzle brake.
Lightweight quick-detach bipod with modular feet. 
Accepts M1913 accessory rails.
Thermal cheek guard.
Modular hand-grip mounted on M1913 rail.

(1 extra mag with extention + Remora IWB holster) Holds 6+1. Gun is perfectly light. only weighs 10.1 ounces. I've had it for several months now. NEVER BEEN FIRED! Only used it as a carry. I actually really like it because I can literally drop it in my pocket if I want. For anyone who likes glocks or Kahrs its very similar. It was actaully designed by one of the guys who use to work for glock. Extremely concealible!  

Most of the time I use my Remora holster (Included in sale)which is really nice because it was only $25.00 and it doesn't use a clip, it's extremely grippy. It tucks pefectly in your waiste band and as long as it's slightly snug I can draw the gun and place it back with out it falling or even moving. 

I also have an extra mag (db380 only comes with one) that has ring figer extention. Adds so much more control and grip. I only carry with that one and leave the factory one loaded in my pocket.

Whether you are buying your first AR rifle, or need an affordable yet
accurate plinking gun, the Panther Oracle is for you. Built to bridge the
gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets, this introductory level
carbine features a 16' light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with
Picatinny Rail, heat dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible,
six-position Pardus buttstock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs.
The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice
on the Picatinny Rail. The 16"" barrel, although light, provides plenty of
velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. The Pardus stock
makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter.

All models feature sleek lines and a scratch resistant, non-glare military
black finish with high impact grips. The polymer frame used on the 9mm
compact offers the shooter several advantages. First, it will decrease the
weight of the weapon. Secondly, the forgiving nature of the polymer will
decrease the felt recoil when firing the weapon. The polymer frame that is
used by Hi-Point is a very high tech, durable material that will serve the
shooter for decades to come. Item# 13237 includes a hard case and item#
56875 includes a holster. Also comes with Ghost ring site.
