Fun ammo for collecting or shooting in your Mosin Nagant or PSL rifle. These were manufactured in 2012 by Sadu of Romania. So, they are newer manufactured by a military ammo producer. These rounds are full metal jacket, non-corrosive, and are copper washed steel cases. You get the best of both worlds - new production by a military contractor without being old corrosive ammo! The primers and case neck are sealed for waterproofing. These rounds start tracing bright green and turn to a bright red trace. Lots of fun to shoot at night or on a cloudy day.The rounds are $20 for 10 rounds. If you buy 50 rounds, the price is $75 and $1.50 per round for any rounds over 50. I would also consider trades for reloading components and equipment (9mm, .45auto, .223, 7.62x39) I am willing to meet in the western new york area to sell/trade.

The front sight post dot has been painted a bright blue and had a clear coat painted over that, to aid in differentiating between front and rear sights quickly and help to align the sights well for beginning shooters. There is mild wear on the bluing of the chamber's exterior. Included with the pistol are one 7-round magazine and one 9-round magazine. Both are Ruger-manufactured. The grip on this pistol has been modified with the addition of a set of Talon rubberized (non-abrasive) grips, which have begun to slip just slightly. If desired, you will be able to remove this feature with a blow-dryer and light application of nail polish remover. For an additional $50 (Total price $300), I will include an Urban Carry G2 (Brown). At the time of this posting, this holster retails for $65 (shipping excluded), and has shaped to the form of the pistol well. It was carried daily (never against bare skin) for approximately six months. At the time of this posting, this pistol retails for $331 (before tax) at Bud's Gun Shop."

This rifle is their A-15 model which means no forward assist or dust cover. This rifle was purchased new during the beginning of the Obama administration just cause. Over the years a houge grip and forend I had laying around was put on as well as some flip up iron sights. It also has a yankee hill muzzle break that was given to me that I had no use for. I had and still have no use for this rifle and it just sits in the safe taking up precious room for another rifle. I already have a few quality AR's and like I said I bought this just cause I couldn't pass it up. I needed this one like I needed a hole in the head. I believe only 2 mags were put through it in all this time so it's damn near brand new still and in fantastic condition, great for the beginner. I also have the stock forend and grip as well which are junk but you can have them along with the 2 steel mags that came with it. I'm looking to purchase another rifle and need room in the safe and its priced to sell accordingly. If not, I'll simply disassemble, throw it in a box and move on with life. Thanks for looking. Can send more pics to serious inquiries. Will not ship. Prefer to deal with CHL holders, if not a holder then a bill of sale verified with I.D. WILL be required period!

This is an extremely accurate pistol to 15 yards, especially given the short 3.2 inch barrel, so it is an exceptional concealed carry defensive weapon. After shooting a number of small, easily concealable pistols, I found the felt recoil on the PPS to be the best of all the single stack 9mm I tried, including the Glock 43, the Springfield XDS etc... I actually have a second PPS I am keeping, so this is in excellent condition, with less than 400 rounds fired through it and it has been immaculately maintained with SLP 2000 products (degreaser, bore cleaner and EWL) and polished with a silicone impregnated cloth. You will be hard pressed to find a better maintained used pistol. Comes with originial box, extra backstrap, owners manual and the ever popular and totally useless gun lock (in an unopened package, of course). FFL to FFL transfer required. Cash (if in NH) or USPS money orders only. Absolutely no personal checks, cashier’s checks, bank checks, bit coin or other alternative forms of payment. If shipping is necessary, buyer pays actual shipping costs.Do not offer a trade. I have enough guns already, and I will simply delete your email. Thanks for looking."

Unlike most of the guns coming into the US today, this was made with a Polish barrel which is hammer-forged and chrome-lined. The finish is perfect, baked on paint over parkerization and the laminated wood is beautiful. Never fired, the only thing I did to this gun was to add a laminated pistol grip to match the handguards. I have the original plastic/bakelite pistol grip if you want it. Includes 3 European pattern 30rd AK magazines and the case shown. If I find some more mags, I will include them as well.  As an FYI, the individual part serial numbers on the Vector guns do not match (a couple people have asked) this was the norm.  The only two exposed s/n are the top cover and the receiver, so you'd have to take apart the rifle to notice the rest. **For face to face sales, this is a rifle.
