Caliber: 9 mm (9 x 19 para)
Condition: Terrific!
Frame: All METAL for those who appreciate a REAL gun! No plastic here.
 
Bersa has been one of the best defensive pistol bargains on the market for several years now. Includes factory box, original paperwork, etc.
BOASTS TOP-NOTCH FEATURES TYPICALLY SEEN IN PREMIUM BRANDS
 
STRONG CONSTRUCTION: An improved Browning Petter barrel-locking system. This provides highly reliable feeding and dependable ejection, which allows it to run flawlessly right out of the box. Goes hand in hand with the reliability so important on a pistol designed for self-defense.
High cap magazine holds 13 rounds for 13 + 1 capacity, packing a lot of firepower for such a compact package like the Thunder 9.
WORKMANSHIP AND QUALITY: Built with such toughness and reliability so that the Argentine police and military have adopted it. The frame is all METAL, a fact that distinguishes it from the wave of plastic guns coming at us from everywhere these days. The gun expert will appreciate the authenticity of an all-metal gun in a sea of plastics.
Extremely convenient ambidextrous controls for safety, decocker, slide stop, etc on both sides of the frame.
Tried and true 3 dot sight system that’s so easy-to-pick-up and point. Front and rear sights are milled into the slide the metal, the old fashioned way where quality and workmanship counts. Windage adjustments are possible by drifting the rear sight or the front blade sideways in their dovetails.
Located on the right side of the slide, the gun’s external extractor throws empties clear with alacrity. A loaded-chamber indicator above and behind the ejection port can be checked visually or by feel to determine whether or not a round is chambered and ready to fire.
The Picatinny rail machined into the metal frame makes it easy to add quick-targeting accessories like lights and lasers.
Magazines insert smoothly into the well, and eject sharply when the release button is pressed. If you ever need a combat reload, this is a real plus. Further, the magazine release button is deeply checkered for positive operation.
The slide and frame fit snugly together—no shake or wobble is evident. The Thunder Pro Ultra Compact functioned smoothly, thanks to the full-length guide rails inside the frame that hold the slide securely for a tight lockup and consistent operation.
 
ERGONOMICS AND HANDLING: The comfortable, hand-filling grip has finger grooves, making it much easier to stay in control during rapid-fire strings. Checkered polymer grip coupled with finger grooves up front made this gun very comfortable in my hand. It also points very naturally.
Full AMBIDEXTROUS controls all around:   safety and decocker are on BOTH sides of the gun for easy operation. The thumb-operated safety and extended slide release are ambidextrous and easy to reach.
This Bersa offers a solid, hand-filling grip, thanks in part to its double-stacked 13-round magazine. That aids in control, making it easy to hold the gun on target. The follower spring is nice and stout.
Mag has an extended finger rest to ensure a firm three-finger grip. The features, fit and function all add up to a gun that give you plenty of bang for the buck.  
The polymer grip is checkered on all sides for a secure hold. Also note the rear slide serrations that are neatly and closely cut for great handling and a neat appearance. Upgraded grips have a diamond shaped pattern for a sure grip that’s incredibly comfortable.
Slide features a rounded muzzle for easy holstering.
Commander-style hammer.
The magazine-release button is also ergonomically located, and you can reach it without altering your grip on the pistol. While this control is located on the left side, it can be easily switched to the opposite side for southpaw operation. The front of the triggerguard is squared off and grooved to provide solid seating for the off-hand’s index finger, aiding a natural two-handed hold that helps stabilize your aim.
Disassembly is simple. Using your right thumb, rotate the disassembly. Now pull the slide/barrel assembly forward and off the frame. The guide rod has two full-length springs, one inside the other. This allows smooth, bind-free operation.
OPERATION: Once you fire the first shot in double action (DA), the gun shifts to single-action (SA) mode. The manual safety is actually a decocking lever. The SA trigger comes back smoothly, with noticeable stacking just before the hammer falls. Nice clean trigger break – just as it should be.
Hammer-fired like a real gun! It features the reliable, time-honored hammer and firing pin system that true gun experts recognize, avoiding the “tinny feeling” internal striker so common these days.
All these features and workmanship add up to a gun that is utterly reliable and extremely accurate.

About 1 year ago it was purchased. Cash only, No shipping, no trades.  More pics on request, camera kinda sucks.The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system (14.5"" barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31RCO features external adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without the caps. Mounting bosses are integrated into the housing by the eyepiece to allow the easy addition of a Trijicon RMR® (not included)."

The crisp single action trigger, hand reamed chamber, target crowned barrel and finely adjustable target sights mean the Buck Mark comes ready for fun straight from the box.

I will also be listing on other websites so it's first come first serve. I am willing to ship and I will accept paypal, USPS money orders, or cash. Paypal will be thru Goods and Services for your protection and for mine. For CT buyers - current house legislation may make this trigger illegal to posess, so keep that in mind.

Will trade for AR15 drop in triggers with cash on your end, let me know what you have - Preferably Timney."
