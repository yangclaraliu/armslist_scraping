Professionally built from a hand-picked, all-numbers-matching, unissued parts kit on a NoDak Spud receiver.  Numbers match all the way to the dust cover.  (Not actually made by Saiga, but I didn't want this mixed in with the 'Norinco's and 'Century's) Has the original chrome-lined, Communist-made hammer forged barrel that are getting so hard to find these days; condition of the barrel is absolutely perfect.  Rifle was Duracoated, but there are some honest wear marks and scuffs on some of the 'high traffic' areas.  I'm not going to lie and claim that it's a tack-driver, but it is honestly the most accurate AK I've ever handled: plinking from the standing position gave a group within the size of a soda can at 75'; someone with a little more skill should be able to do very respectably with this rifle.  Stock locks up nice and tight in open and closed position; some minor wobble when open, but it's an easy fix.  Includes four 30-round magazines, magazine pouch, drop bag, and front sight adjustment tool (not that it needs it).  In addition, I'll be throwing in 1000 (Okay, 995) rounds of Tula 7.62x39mm ammo to get you started."

They are just super accurate, with an awesome trigger and great lock up.
They were favored by law enforcement for 
	1. they have a great balance and feel. 
	2. They are easy to qualify with and 
	3. they are easy to carry and handle.  
The trigger in single action is made for target shooting, but the Double Action pull is what I really like on this gun. It stages  well and the drop of the hammer is just right for good D.A. control. 
I  carry this gun all the time and the high ride holster with just a standard T-Shirt. The holster is all leather and custom fit just for this gun. It is thin leather and it is easy to wear and conceal. 
I have had three different sets of grips on this gun over time and they are easy to find and cheap to buy. You can usually pick up any kind you want on e-bay, or the local gun store for 15.00-20.00. Right now I just have the old wood S&W grips on it and really like the way they feel in my hand.
I am really looking for a Ruger SR9 for my wife to shoot. She has the SR22 and I figured the 9 would be a good companion gun for it, but would be interested in similar guns. 
If you have a trade offer, put it on the table, I'll take a look at it and let you know.

This item also comes with one 30 round Gen 2 PMAG (with window) or one 10 round aluminum magazine (if high capacity mags are not allowed where you live). It also comes in a metal exterior, padded interior hard case. Since this is a pistol, not a short barreled rifle, NFA & Class III regulations do not apply. However, please verify this item is allowed to be owned where you live. Additional details are below. Feel free to ask any questions you have. Shipping is FREE anywhere in the continental US. I accept the following forms of payment: Credit cards (MC, Visa, Discover) with no fees, PayPal, money order, or cashiers check. Adams Arms’ proven piston system doesn’t vent hot gases and burned powder into the bolt carrier and receiver, so the gun runs cooler, with less fouling and wear on the action, and easier maintenance. Short-stroke piston shaft eliminates concussive gas expansion in the upper receiver for less violent cycling, smoother feeding, and reduced felt recoil. The receiver is forged from 6061 T6 aluminum and features M4 feed ramp cuts and a 13-slot Picatinny-cut flattop rail. The adjustable gas block allows three levels of gas release: normal fire, firing with a suppressor attached, or a single round fired without cycling. Picatinny rail on top of gas block accepts a variety of clamp-on tactical sights. It has a chrome-lined barrel chambered for 5.56mm NATO, with an A2 flash hider and a black Melonite® finish for superb wear resistance and up to 60% more corrosion resistance than traditional phosphate coating. We've also added a 4"" Samson drop in rail for any shooters tactical options. This creates the shortest, most reliable, and accurate complete upper.

 Reloading Brass: till its a;; gone.
 Price is:
 .380 ACP 100 rds 5.00
 9mm Luger 100 rds 5.00
 .38 Special 100 rds 6.00
 .40 S&W 100 rds 6.00
 .45 ACP 100 rds 7.90
 If you want it cleaned and polished, I will do it for .02 a round.

 I'll ship it to your front door by USPS priority mail. I use the ""if fits it ships"" priority mail boxes: You can ship twice as much 9mm as .45 acp in the same box, but generally as a rule:
 100-200 pcs will cost 5.80 to ship.
 200-2000 pcs will cost 12.65 to ship.
 1500-4000 pcs will cost 16.50 to ship.

 Your welcome to mix and match any quantity of any size. Example:
 500 pcs each of, 9mm, .40 S&W and .45ACP = 1500 pcs and would ship for 12.65.

 If you reload several sizes, than you will do well here, You can mix your numbers any way you want.

 Payment: I prefer PAY-PAL, but I have a store front business and take credit card orders over the phone every day but Sunday and if need be will take a money order. If you prefer a personal check that is fine also, but it will delay your shipment till it clears the bank. 

 Swap: I love to swap. I am a gun enthusiast, re-loader, hunter, and all around outdoorsman. I will swap you for any gun you are not using, or ammo you have no gun to shoot it out of anymore, or about anything else. I like it all. I am a fair trader and will give you fair market value on whatever you might have to trade. All you can do is ask, and I’ll I can say is yes, or no, but it doesn’t hurt to ask.

 E-mail me at: mwandrla@yahoo.com and I’ll be glad to give you any information you may want including my phone number to call me at.

Taught By an active duty Navy SEAL Medic 

Learn procedures that could save your life or that life of someone you love in one day. Learn the advanced medical procedures that are taught to today’s modern Special Operation Forces (SOF) including the Navy SEALs, SWCC, the Army’s Green Beret and Army Rangers, 160th SOAR and Marine Force Recon. These methods have been learned though out the past 13 years of fighting and are proven to work and are tried and true methods of advanced lifesaving medical care.  

Date/Time: Saturday, July 20th/9:00 AM- around 4:00 PM (I will be willing to stay later) 

Price: $125/person for standard classes (discounts available; see below) 

Class Size Limit:  10 

If you would like I can prove that I am an active duty Navy SEAL and provide copies of all of my credentials and certifications. I would be more than happy to prove that I am a real SEAL and not one of the many “fakes” out there. I would be more than happy to give you my class number and answer any and all questions to the best of my ability and even provide you with the answer as to whether or not your buddy or acquaintances down the street, who claims to have been a SEAL, is for real or is one of those “fakes”. 

Do you know what to do when someone you love is hurt and needs medical attention right away? This Basic First Aid Course will teach you the principles of TCCC and what you need to do when 911 is just too far away to provide help. 

A LITTLE ABOUT ME: 
Here is a little background on me. I am an active duty Navy SEAL. One of my specialties in the SEAL Teams is being the platoon medic. Some of the schools I have attended that are medical related included the Joint Special Operations Medical Training Center located at Fort Bragg, NC where I attended 13 months of medical training. During my time there I completed training in Combat Trauma Management, Advance Trauma Management, Advance Trauma Practitioner, Trauma Patient Assessment, TCCC, CPR, PEPP, Anatomy and Physiology, Pharmacology, Trauma I, II, and III. I also have attended SOT training in California. My medical qualifications include the following: EMT, BLS, ACLS, Special Operations Combat Medic, active duty Navy SEAL platoon medic, and being a Dive Medical Technician. I have worked in a number of different medical capacities including Tampa General Hospital in their Emergency Department, OR, Burn Intensive Care Unit, Nero ICU, Post-Op ICU, maternity ward, and their life flight. I have also worked on Tampa Fire Rescue responding to calls on their Advance Life Support rigs. I have deployed as the only medic for a SEAL platoon to countries where the most advance medical care and resources were what I carried on my back. I don't pretend to know it all....far from it. That is why I constantly have to be studying and trying to further myself but I can teach you how to provide first aid to yourself and your family that will work and is easy to understand. I am a small town country boy myself so I know how to make things understandable for those who do not have a prior medical background. I am sure you will not have a problem keeping up with the information. I enjoy medicine and I enjoy teaching others about it. I look forward to being able to help you better prepare yourself and your family for those emergency situations that we all hope will never happen but unfortunately do at any time. 




COURSE DESCRIPTION: 
This first aid course is geared towards the young and the old, the hunter, those how like hiking and the outdoors, the husband or father, wife or mother, or any individual who wants to know how to provide basic first aid to themselves, their family, friends, or the stranger on the street who just got in an accident. Do you know what to do if and when disaster strikes? You will be better prepared if you attend my Basic First Aid Course. There is no need for any prior medical knowledge as I know how to take all the medical “mumble jumble” talk and make is simple and easy to understand. This course, although basic, I will guarantee, will set you up for success in the event you or someone you know needs lifesaving interventions and 911 is going to take to long to arrive. Now I am do not intend to be able to make everyone who attends my course a paramedic or EMT. I am not saying you shouldn't call 911...of course you should, but sometimes you might find yourself in a remote, dangerous area and help is to far away. The facts are that if someone has massive hemorrhaging they can bleed out and die within 60-90 seconds....that isn't very long. I have set this course up in the same format that I teach my fellow Navy SEALs. It is based around a simple and easy to follow format. It has to be, we are expected to follow it while getting shot at. This is the important stuff you really need to know and really can't afford to do without. Now, before I go on I just want to be very clear that this course will not make you certified in CPR, BLS, ACLS, or any other form of life support. From a legal stand point I am not making you qualified to go out and preform any form of first aid to anyone. This course is for a group of people who personally want to learn the real hands on aspects of first aid and be able to know what to do one of your family members or yourself is in harm’s way. Bluntly put, you can either stand by and watch as they die or you can intervene and help and possibly save their life....this course will teach you how to increase their chances of survival but the choice of action is still yours....  

Topics to be covered in the Basic First Aid Course include: 
MARCH (the new move advanced ABCs) 
Pressure Points 
Pressure Bandages 
How to stop non-compressible bleeding 
Tourniquets: How and when to use them and proper placement and application (there is a little more to it than you might think) 
Improvised Tourniquets 
Hemostatic Agents 
Amputations 
Establishing Airways/Clearing Airways 
Advance Airways that are simply and lifesaving that even doctors don't do...more on that in the class 
Improvised Airways 
Breathing for a patient 
Chest seals 
Improvised Chest seals 
Needle Decompressions: How, when and where 
Fluid Replacement 
The major effect of Hypothermia and how to prevent it in different types of patients 
Patient surveys 
How to approach a trauma patient 
Blood sweeps 
Primary Surveys 
Secondary Surveys 
Maintaining a Patient 
Splinting 
C spine stabilization: How and when 
Improvised C collars 
Burns 
Crush Injury 
Working with an assistant

First aid kits: What you should carry; what works and what doesn't 
Tactical Medic 
All types of buddy carries 
CPR (I save this for last to clarify that although we will cover it and talk about it, you will not be certified in CPR when you complete this course although you will understand how to do it) 

As you can see that is a lot to cover in a day. Just one last time; notice that nowhere in that list is there a certification in for any profession or any sort of professional qualification. That isn't the purpose of this course. If you want to be certified in CPR which is always a good step and I would suggest the American Red Cross for certification. I will present and teach the material all Special Operation Forces in the US military learn from the Navy SEALs to the Army Rangers to the Green Berets. Not really a ""basic"" course but yet it is easy for everyone to follow and understand. As I have said, there is no need for prior medical experience but it never hurts. You will not find all the stuff you get from this one course anywhere else and learn all that you will in just one day. Also, you will have an opportunity to purchase first aid supplies directly from me at a discounted price. As for what you need to bring it isn't much. You will need the remaining payment due at the beginning of the course first thing in the morning. Payment is explained below.  
Also, bring water, sun screen and such. If you have any first aid equipment or supplies that you would like to train with you can bring them but it isn't necessary. 
Lunch will be provided for free and could be anything from a home cooked meal prepared by my wife (and she is an excellent cook as she has attended a few culinary schools in her time) to a BBQ also completely furnished by me. However, if you have any food allergies, or if you would prefer to bring your own lunch that is 100% acceptable just please let me know which you would like to do before the day of the class. If you want to have a good time, learn about Basic First Aid so you are better prepared when disaster happens, come join us and make new friends!  
CONTACT:  You can contact me to register for the next upcoming course at idblab@live.com or text or call 757-319-1709.  
PRICING:  $125 per person for group sessions (family discounts and military discounts available for 10%); $250 per household for private courses of instruction (contact me to work out the details) 
20% non-refundable deposit is required at the time of registering for the class; this deposit is only refundable in case of a weather day (see below); the rest of the amount due will be paid on the day of the class before we begin 
PAYMENT METHODS:  Cash, Personal Check, Money Order, Cashier’s Check, Silver, Guns, Trade/Barter, I am pretty open to this sort of thing and I am willing to pay you if the item you have to exchange is more valuable; let's see what you got and what we can work out 
CLASS SIZE LIMIT:   10 People 
WEATHER DAYS:   Since some of the hands on stuff takes more room for a group classes will generally be conducted outside. Weather permitting the classes will be held on the scheduled day. All deposits will be returned if we are rained out. Private classes should be able to be conducted inside if desired and could still take place.

The rifle has a Star-Gauged barrel with a very crisp, almost MINT bore, and one of the smoothest operating bolt actions you will ever encounter. The rifle is in great condition, some finish wear on the floorplate and very mild freckling on the buttplate, the overall finish condition is nonetheless still 95%.

Barrett Model 95 Bolt Action Rifle System .50 BMG 29 Inch Barrel 5 Round 
Match-grade, chrome chambered fluted barrel. Bullpup design. Sling attach points, air/watertight carrying case, one five round magazine, 1913 accessory rail, and detachable adjustable bipod.
The Model 95 may weigh in at a smaller class, but packed into its convenient bullpup design are the intense power of a magazine-fed weapon, the pinpoint accuracy of a bolt action rifle and the effortless functionality of a perfectly designed machine.

This compact rifle offers the velocity and accuracy of a 29-inch barrel in a shortened overall length of just 45 inches. Adopted for military use, the Model 95 is made for those who refuse to sacrifice accuracy for power.

Its buttplate, magazine well and trigger housing are unitized, helping to stiffen the steel lower receiver. the steel upper receiver is reinforced with an M1913 optics rail and supports the chrome-chambered, fluted barrel. the two can be assembled in less than 60 seconds without the use of tools.

Model 95 in action
The bolt carrier itself is a study in innovation. Designed for speed, reliability and safety, it slides effortlessly on machined-smooth parallel rails, transporting a large bolt that locks into the barrel extension on three lugs. The firing pin is driven by dual firing pin springs designed for consistency and lightning-quick lock time.

The only thing more impressive than the Model 95 rifle’s performance is the comfort with which it can be used. The ergonomically designed rifle rests on a lightweight front bipod and an optional adjustable rear monopod. This careful attention to usability allows the shooter to quickly and accurately fire five rounds, reload with a fresh magazine and get back on target in seconds.

The Model 95 provides the discerning shooter with bolt-action accuracy and magazine fed rate of fire.

The Model 95 is what you expect in a Barrett. Innovative. Purposeful. Rugged.

Manufacturer model #: 516.A65/1. It is the goal of Battle Blades to offer a unique, well thought out knife system for military personnel, gun enthusiasts, and outdoors men and women. Battle Blade. http://www.battlebladesknives.com/index.php#.UcsmbzSTiRJ When creator Kelly Van Orden came up with the idea for Battle Blades he had two goals in mind. The first was to create a foundation for veterans that will be set up with the profits from battle blades to give back to our service men and women. The Battle Blades Foundation will help veterans financially and with a variety of programs including ""Weapons for Warriors"", a program that will help veterans obtain sporting rifles and other sporting goods. The second goal was to develop a knife system for picatinny rails that would provide military users a valuable weapon for close combat and a way to cut netting or other lines that could potentially entrap soldiers in the field. By having the knife on the picatinny rail, it would be less likely that the user would become separated from the knife than conventional systems. Also we want to have a multi-platform system that will allow the user to carry his or her knife in a conventional belt/strap type scabbard as well as mounting system for ATV racks ect.

 This spire pointed all copper Barnes XPB bullet will fly very flat and penetrate very deep for an expanding bullet. This load can be used on animals as large as Bison or Cape buffalo. If you need an expanding load that penetrates super deep, I do not know of a better or more capable one. Plus we were able to safely drive it at a super high velocity.

We were also able to use a flash suppressed powder for those who may need to shoot a camp raiding dangerous animal in the dark. If you need your revolver for defense against wild animals, chances are it will happen in low light, when animals are most active—same goes for human criminals. No sense in blinding yourself with your first shot and becoming a blind victim.

As always, we use real world firearms to generate our advertised velocities. We believe that the industry wide duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory barrels to produce extra high velocities is dishonest to the customer as he/she will never be able to produce such high velocities under real world conditions, where it matters"

For those who aren’t up to speed, here you go: The XDm is the latest of the polymer-frame, striker-fired pistols, and it corrects some earlier designs, both Springfield’s and those of competitors. First of all, the slide does not have the proportions of a shoebox; it is angled, geometric, aggressive-looking and fully up to the task of handling any 9mm (or .40) load that comports with SAAMI specs. The angled slide is both easier to pack comfortably and easier to work, as the slide serrations grab back when you get a hold of them.

It is accurate due to the match-dimensioned chamber and bore and the snug, but not excessively tight fit of barrel to slide. Fully hardened, the barrel is not going to wear to a sloppy fit with less than a lifetime’s worth of ammo. Also, the barrel will not throw a hissy fit if you happen to use or load ammo containing lead bullets.

The magazines hold more rounds than comparable polymer-frame pistols. The full-size XDm in .40 holds 16+1 rounds.. To gain that capacity, the designers did not have to resort to overly large frame dimensions and even found a way to have interchangeable backstraps as well. For you southpaws, the magazine release is fully ambidextrous.

In short, the XDm is everything you’d want in a polymer-frame, striker-fired pistol, and the shooting public has realized that.

Less than 200 rounds fired. Comes with everything that came in the box when new. Gun is in amazing condition. 

Includes:
Crimson Trace Laserguard 
Crossbreed Supertuck Deluxe horsehide holster to fit with G36 with CT Laserguard
2 Pearce Magazine +1 Grip Extensions

Also included but not shown in the pictures are the 2 original magazine base plates and the Glock Magazine Loader.

The holster is in good condition and has been treated with high quality mink oil paste to soften the leather, keep out body oils, and make it easier to clean.
The CT Laseguard battery should have at least 90% of it's charge left. The Allen wrench for laser adjustment and removal, and the lens cleaning swab are included. 
The bore brush with handle has some discoloration from being used at the range to spot clean the barrel, but is in perfect working condition.

$750 is a very fair price considering what the gun is worth and the fact that the laser and holster, if sold as used on eBay, regularly sell for over $150 and $80, respectively. Crimson Trace and Crossbreed are both top-of-the-line names for quality and service. That, coupled with a .45 ACP Glock, make for a formidable concealed carry package. I am only selling because I need the money and have several concealed carry options. This one is my newest and in the best condition so I figured I could get the most out of it.
