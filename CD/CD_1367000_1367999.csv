This gun is unique in that it is in a semi-auto caliber (.40 cal S&W). Originally thought was that an off duty police officerwould be able to use like ammo as duty weapon thus resulting in not having to invest in differnt caliber ammunition that what he is used to shooting. Moon clips act as speed-loding devises and are actually faster to use than true speed-loaders. Brand new costs well over $400 not to mention tax.

REDACTED

The battle-proven P226 pistol platform has proven itself to be an uncompromising, combat-ready pistol, clearly demonstrating that when it counts, SIG SAUER is there.
And, for the first time, the United States Navy has granted SIG SAUER permission to sell the new contract pistol, designated the MK25, to the general public.

The commercially available MK25 is identical to the firearm SIG SAUER delivers under contract to the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC). Built to the Navy’s demanding standards, the MK25 comes chambered in 9mm, with a phosphate finish applied to all internal components, providing corrosion resistance in even the harshest of saltwater environments.

The engraved gold anchor on the pistol’s slide hints at its military origin, while the UID code on the right side 
serves as a genuine badge of authenticity. The true mil-spec 1913 rail is machined into the hardcoat anodized alloy frame, providing a solid mounting point for lights, lasers and accessories.

A reliable double-action/single-action trigger and two-piece polymer grips are included in the NSWC-specification package. SIGLITE® night sights, three magazines, and a card certifying authenticity come standard in the case.
The only other way to obtain an authentic MK25 pistol would require a Naval enlistment and training with elite forces.

Own a piece of American military history with the purchase of a SIG SAUER MK25 pistol."

This rifle is new in the box with all factory accessories. This is a current production model. Know your state laws. Do not bid if you cannot own this weapon. Shipping to Alaska or Hawaii will incur additional cost. The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers. The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with. Caliber: 7.62 NATO/.308 Winchester."

Walther PPS 9mm. 

Bought several 9mm pistols, tryin to figure out which would be the easiest for me to CC. Decided on a Boberg which is significantly smaller. As far as the condition, full disclosure: I bought this one from another gentleman on Armslist, who had bought 2 of these online. I picked this up from him immediately after he finished his transfer/background check. It was sold to him as ""brand new"" and it appears to be by the looks of it. I never fired it and neither did he. There is not a mark on it. It comes with an Davidson's Lifetime Replacement Warranty  that has not been filled out yet, which I believe cost an extra $50. Also comes with lock, 2 magazines, an extra back strap, hard case, and original manual and registration card.

You must be 21 and an Oregon resident to purchase this handgun. Will only sell this to someone willing to do a transfer at a licensed FFL. I will pay the $10 background check fee, and up to $25 for the transfer, if needed.

I am located in Grants Pass, but will be heading north to Portland for a couple of days this coming week.

This rifle is new in the box with all factory accessories. This is a current production model. Know your state laws. Do not bid if you cannot own this weapon. Shipping to Alaska or Hawaii will incur additional cost. The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers. The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with. Caliber: 7.62 NATO/.308 Winchester."

For those of you who don't know, the lower receiver is considered the ""firearm"" part of the AR15 and is what is considered pre-ban or post ban if a ban is passed.  So if you have the lower, you can always build it later and your gun will still be pre-ban (if a ban is passed of course).

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Features a Nitron®-coated stainless steel slide over a dark hard anodized alloy frame. Hogue® Rosewood Grips round out this package."

I have 152 brass cased 7.62 x 39mm rounds that I was told were tracers.  They were given to me in a loose bag a few years back by a friend who used to have his own firearm business.  They all have red marking on their tips and some are Winchester and some are IMI.  If you look at the pictures (sorry I couldn't focus on the names) the IMI have the silver primers and the Winchesters have brass primers.  I'm not sure if they've been reloaded or if they are just to different brands.  Since I am not sure if they are tracers or not, I have no use for them since I shoot at an indoor range where they would not be permitted.  

I also want to remind people, if you don't want this ammo or don't agree with what I'm asking for it, I respect that, but you don't need to send me snide emails saying so.  

I would prefer to trade, but if you want to make a cash offer, I'll entertain it.  Just remember, steal cased cheap 7.62 is about .35 a round, and these are brass cased and tracers (if you have a need for them)."

I took it home, cleaned it, fired 35 rounds through it, cleaned it again and haven't touched it since. The gun shoots the 5.7x28mm cartridge, a very capable cartridge that was designed by FN with the intent of penetrating soft body armor. The gun uses the standard Five-seveN magazines. The standard magazine holds 20 rounds, however, there are 30 rounders made and 10 round extensions to increase your magazine capacity to 30 rounds. The gun has a muzzle brake/compensator, non-reciprocating charging handle, and a picatinny rail on top for mounting a red dot or other optics. The gun utilizes the MAC design which means it is very reliable and built like a tank. It uses a straight blowback design which means that there is very little to go wrong. The gun is also very accurate (For what it is.) because of the low recoil nature of the round. The gun is also very fun to shoot. (I know from experience.) The bolt assembly is all CNC machined, further enhancing the gun's reliability. A hard plastic case is also included with the gun.

The price is negotiable, however, considering how the gun is pretty much brand new, I'd like to not take too much of a loss.
