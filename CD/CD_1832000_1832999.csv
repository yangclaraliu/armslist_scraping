I purchased this because I owned a pre-ban FEG AK-47 and the PA-63 made a for a nice companion firearm for it, both being FEGs and all.. but I sold the AK two years ago.
After purchasing it I mended the heavy trigger by replacing the hammer spring with one that is just heavy enough to impact every single primer, but not so heavy to break your finger trying to pull it, such as the stock hammer spring is. 
Upon testing it, the Double action pull is 12.5-13lbs and the single action pull is 4-5lbs. The stock Double action pull was somewhere around 5 million lbs.. so changing the spring made for a great improvement.
After replacing the spring I buffed out the entire gun frame as to remove the brushed aluminum appearance and replace it with a shiny mirror finish. In the pictures it does not show any serial numbers.. They are there, I assure you. I've edited them out of the pictures. The shiny mirror finish on the frame makes this gun look amazingly beautiful. The only other thing I have done to it would be to make the sights more visible by adding white paint which is made for sights.
This gun shoots very accurately. I have only shot around 90 rounds of 9x18 from it but I can tell you that it shoots just as well as my expensive handguns due to its fixed barrel."

I purchased a brand new, in the box ""Benchmade"" folding knife from the nice guys at Future Edge out of Minden.  It's a really nice piece...for a COUNTERFEIT KNIFE.  The owner, Neal Sprott, was a really nice guy to talk to.  Even said that he knows some of the same people that I do.  Well, bought my new ""American Made Benchmade"" and headed back to the Lake.  I emailed a picture to my son, who is an a avid Benchmade collector.  All I got back was, ""you got burned"".  I checked against the Benchmade part number on the blade and sure enough...not the knife I bought.  I did reach out to Neal at Future Edge, by way of the email address that he gave, but unfortunately...nada.  Hope you all had a better experience.  There were some ""real nice people there"".

Marked with ""S.N. & W.T.C. FOR MASSACHUSETTS"" on the lock plate, S. Norris and W.T. Clement of Springfield, Mass. produced approximately 11,000 of these on direct contract for the State of Massachusetts in 1863-1864. The rifle is completely intact and in really good shape.  This is the 3-band, 40"" barrel version.  In fact, I recently had a gunsmith in Bend, OR inspect the barrel and verify that it can be fired using correct procedures for this weapon.  All cartouches and marks are still clearly visible - even on the stock. I am not familiar with firing blackpowder, and even more unfamiliar with the correct procedure on how to fire this rifle.  For those of you who are familiar, if you wanted to purchase this rifle, I would definitely allow you to fire it before purchasing it - with me present of course.  There are some scuffs/scratches on the barrel where the bayonette had been fitted in the past, but I do not have the bayonette.  Everything works properly - even the sights fold up and down as they should.

NOTE:  The caliber on this ad says ""300 Blackout""  but I couldn't get rid of that in the editor.  It is a .58 caliber rifle."

This gun is from an estate sale, where I think the owner used each gun one time, cleaned the guns and then put them away forever, that's how mint this gun is. I tried to clean it and there was nothing to clean its fire ready.. I have no ammo so I'm selling it..

norinco is a top build ak47.. I think the thickest and most durable you can get

Comes with two 30rd mags / sling / muzzle break

EXTREMELY MINT. (The wood is even more beautiful in real life)

Couple updates: I found ammo for a good price and felt the need to test this machine of mayhem, I took this to the gun range, shot 60 rounds through it (2 clips) flawlessly PERFECT PRECISION, both clips work perfect. Cleaned it right after and it's now fire ready again. I have to say Norinco truly is the best quality AK you can get.

The gun has never been fired. It comes with all original contents and 20 rounds of hollow point bullets. I paid $500 for this gun. I was able to shoot one identical to it before its purchase and it is really an amazing little gun with a hard punch. WAY better than the LCP Ruger we had previously.

The Rem 870 when using the pisol grip style stocks is a much better design than the Moss 500 because the Rem 870 has a CROSS BOLT safety that you can engage without moving your hands away from the trigger assembly. The Moss 500""s or like style shotguns that have the SAFETY on the reciever and when set up with pistol grips make you move you hand away from the ready fire position to engage the safety switch on top of reciever. So for a Home ""D"" style pistol grip shotgun the Rem 870 is a wise choose. Remember seconds count in a emergency. Enough with my rant and about this gun...

833,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1832833,For Sale:  NEW Larue Tactical 20 rd .308 magazines OBR,"Warner Robins, Macon, Georgia",$ 100,"Listed On: Saturday, March 8, 2014",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have for sale some brand new Larue Tactical .308 mags.  Price is $100 each.  Details are below.
Some say it's the finest 7.62 mag ever developed. 
Even though these steel 7.62 mags were designed and produced as a factory magazine for the LaRue OBR 7.62 rifle, they'll fit just about any rifle that accepts M110-pattern magazines.

The cartridge guide rails along the side feature a unique horizontal-break near the feedlips. This design reduces cartridge drag as the extractor groove rides along the feedlips. The magazine seam is ""hidden:"" at the rear instead of being placed conventionally at the front, where it robs the magazine of precious internal capacity (very important if you intend on using handloads, or ammunition like M118LR with larger overall cartridge lengths). The seam is neatly laser-welded the entire length of the magazine to reduce build-up of grit and deposits that inhibit the magazine's ability to fall free. The slick, corrosion-resistant surface improves cartridge feeding, allows the magazine to drop free and makes cleanup and maintenance easier. 

Our followers are made of glass-reinforced polymer, designed to reduce tilt, and effortlessly feeds cartridges into the chamber with perfect alignment. They are hi-vis red, to take the guess-work out of quickly eyeballing whether your mag is empty (especially helpful in low-light conditions). 

The floor plates (also designed and manufactured in-house) keep the spring centered, and allow easy breakdown for cleaning and maintenance."

From the Ruger website: THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art. The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.
