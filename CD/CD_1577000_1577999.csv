This pistol has a extremely low round count and has been maintained perfectly, I am very OCD when it comes to my firearms and clean all of them after every range trip! The upgrades have all been added recently, there have been no major conversions or extreme modifications. All modifications were made to make a more tactical pistol and improve accuracy. Upgrades made : 3.5 lb trigger (ghost connector and trigger springs), extended slide lock, extended mag release, extended mag catch, and ghost grip plug. This Glock comes with 2 Glock factory and a hard case. I am looking to sell only no trades please, the sale of this Glock is to fund my other custom Glock build otherwise I'd keep this pistol because it is deadly accurate and super dependable. The price listed is for the Glock taken back to factory stock ( I kept and packaged all factory OEM parts). I have invested a few hundred dollars in upgrades so for the entire package (If sold as package I will give you all factory parts and receipts). So total package with everything listed $650 for taken back to factory Glock $500 (still would come with 2 mags and hard case). For best response please text REDACTED. More pics upon request. Thanx"

This ammo is ""factory blemished"" from Lake City and a great value. Most of the rounds are in perfect condition but some have minor denting. On the ""green tipped"" ammo, the color is only partial applied on some. We shot a couple thousand rounds this weekend and all functioned as flawless as you'd expect the Lake City ammo to fire! A great value!! Get it while you can. Go to our website and order today!

Features: Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.

I’m disapointed that they’re not going to take me up on the offer but their loss is your opportunity for a great deal.  
The Diamond Memberships allow you to attend any of the classes they offer as many times as you would like, whenever you would like for free.  If you look at the course list: http://www.frontsight.com/Courses.asp and the $$’s associated with each class, you can see that attending multiple courses could get expensive quick.  
Having a membership or memberships however will save you ton’s of money.
I attended my first class a few weeks ago and was amazed at how friendly and professional the instructors were.  I went with two of my brothers and some friends and the 2 day course was a nonstop blast.
I even learned a few new tricks for handling a pistol.
Bottom line:  Because I purchased a bunch of memberships, I was given a significant discount and now I have two left that I would like to find a home for instead of just sitting on them.
I would like to trade for firearms and am willing to consider all offers.  My preference would be .40  or 9mm handguns, 12 ga shotguns or .223 rifles but like I said I’m willing to consider all offers. 
Will also consider trades for a decent 10ft utility trailer.

- A1 MODEL
- 50 BMG
- SINGLE SHOT BOLT ACTION

This rifle is the newest incarnation of the wildly popular AR-50 chambered for the powerful 50 BMG cartridge. A single shot bolt action rifle featuring a unique octagonal receiver bedded down into a V-shaped stock. Designed to be an economical answer for the challenges of long range shooting, the AR-50A1 is amazingly accurate and with its massive fluted muzzle brake, it has a very gentle recoil. The AR-50A1 is a highly refined rifle which is a stark and refreshing difference that maintains its superiority over its competition.

Designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards, the P226® Combat performs like no other 9mm available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron® finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements. The P226 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights.

I have not shot this on paper, but it has been reasonably accurate when shooting random stuff on the range. Ring securing top hand guard has loose tolerance and slides off easily (see pic)...this is a minor problem that a layer of tape where the ring goes ail create a tight enough tolerance for it to stay on by itself..comes with a bag full of stripper clips, probably at least 20, some yugoslavian, some authentic german. I have been extremely happy with this rifle, just selling to create funds for other projects and it is also hard for me to find time in my schedule to go to gun shows to find reasonably priced ammo.

Not interested in splitting it up, must take the whole case. Cash only, face to face (no shipping). I would prefer to sell to a valid CCW licensee (like myself) but not a requirement. Must be at least 18 to purchase rifle ammo in the state of Ohio, NO EXCEPTIONS! Not looking for any trades at this time."

I received this from a estate and I know the owner who owned it the last 20 years. I do not believe he ever shot it in that period. Certainly has seen action. Serial number dates it to have been produced in 1944. 

Note, I sold this gun earlier this week not knowing it is a ceremonial gun and thus only capable as a single shot. The automatic action has been disabled. I have read that this can be reversed but I am no gunsmith and I am not looking for a wall hanger so if you are interested in the gun make me a offer. I would accept trades for hand guns.

The model is 32-22.  It was manufactured by Mossberg for the Western Field store brand from 1933 to 1935, and is a Mossberg Model 20.

Because this rifle is so old, it was made before serial numbers were required.  It does not have a serial number, but this is perfectly legal!

When I first got this rifle, it was little beat up.  The metal parts have been re-coated in Duracoat black.  It has sling swivels and comes with a pink paracord sling, but you can easily replace it with something else.  The stock has been carved with a squirrel, as this is a great gun for squirrel season.  (Coming up soon!)

This rifle will shoot .22 LR, .22 Long and .22 Short.  With .22 short, it's extremely quiet and perfect for pest/varmint control.

Everything works on this gun, and it's ready to go with accurate iron sights.  A great starter gun for your kid if they're just getting into hunting or shooting, or a great beater gun for keeping around for pest control.

$100, but feel free to make me an offer."
