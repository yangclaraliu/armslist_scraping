all i have done is completley dissassemble, and degrease all the cosmoline from the firearm and all the extras that came with it but there may be some in the actual barrel since i did not have the best jag to get it entirely out so it would not hurt to get the proper size jag,  to run a jag brush through it.  all i did was push the rod through with cotton to get as much as i could i can clearly see the rifling and the bore looks strong. it is not a recrown.
comes with a bayonet, a tool kit and the sling that they all come with.
was bought ""new"" i guess you might say from century arms international although it is a surplus rifle, it is in very good conditon.
it is a ww2 gun so i imagine its been shot, but it was packed full of cosmoline. and i mean packed, so it may have never even saw alot of action.
i myself have never fired the rifle, but it looks like its in great fireable condition to me.

About Operation Hat Trick Operation Hat Trick is a non-profit organization that was founded in 2007 to help veterans suffering from the visible and invisible wounds of war. The program is dedicated to Nate Hardy and Mike Koch, two friends and Navy SEALs assigned to Naval Special Warfare Development Group (SEAL Team 6), who fought and died together in Iraq in 2008 and are now buried together at Arlington National Cemetery. The organization that initially donated hats to Veterans Administration Medical Centers launched nationally in 2012, and Operation Hat Trick is now partnered with over 330 colleges and universities in all 50 states, 152 high schools, over 100 professional sports teams, and more than 100 companies like Sig Sauer. About the Sig Sauer OHT Special Edition MK25 The Sig Sauer MK25 is the service weapon of the U.S. Navy SEALs, and it has since been released that Nate Hardy and Mike Koch were both carrying MK25 pistols on their last mission. This special edition pistol features the Operation Hat Trick logo on the top of the slide, the OHT tagline on the right side of the slide: “They promised to defend, we promise to support,” and, as on all MK25s, an anchor on the left side of the slide. Each Operation Hat Trick Special Edition MK25 will also include a matching, engraved challenge coin and folding knife.

That’s a Gen 4 .45 ACP with the usual three magazines. It comes with Dawson adjustable sights with fiber optic front and rear. The medium beavertail blackstrap is missing, but it might turn up. The other three are in there but I run it with none at all since it’s a double stack .45.There is a factory installed minus connector in the pistol but I have a plus on hand if that’s too light for you. You also get all my .45 ammo. It’s not a lot, but it includes some Underwood and Buffalo Bore outdoorsman (17 rounds each I think), 20 rounds hornady critical defense, and even 200 rounds of hardball!You also get a Bianchi UM92 holster which fits this pistol perfectly. It’s a great package for anything outdoors and it would be a good competition gun as well. I am selling it to buy a nice revolver. It’s a great gun, but I already have another Glock and I don’t have a revolver that isn’t a snub nose. If you think I’m pricing too high, tell me what you would pay. The worst I’ll say is no.To all of you who aren’t in Fairbanks, I will only ship to an FFL and I will only take postal money orders. Shipping will be 75 dollars and will not include ammo."

There are some small dings and scratches and chips and someone has carved a small “W” on the left side near the receiver. The bore has some light pitting but is bright and has plenty of rifling remaining to make a good shooting rifle. The action is tight and really feels good when you work the lever with no play or sloppiness.
