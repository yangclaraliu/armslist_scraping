Selling my Smith and Wesson M&P compact in .40 S&W. Gun is in good condition. Unsure of exact round count, but I've put about 300 rounds through both barrels with no stoppages or issues. Previous owner said he put less than 200 rounds through it. There's some minor slide wear from carrying. It's been babied and cleaned regularly. Gun includes all original stuff (3 10 round mags and one 15 round .40 magazine with x-grip, 2 different styles of floor plates, 3 different size backstraps, hard case, tritium night sights). Gun is shown in the picture with the 15 round magazine and grip extension. There's a lot of goodies that I'm including, too. Firstly, the Storm Lake 9mm conversion barrel (MSRP $180) which allows the gun to shoot 9mm. One 12 round S&W M&P 9mm magazine. One Blackhawk magazine pouch that I use to store the 9mm barrel and magazine when not in use. Level 2 retention 5.11 ThumbDrive belt holster (like new) and Fobus paddle holster (used -very good condition). Snap caps included for dry fire practice. Willing to toss in some .40 cal ammo, too. I have somewhere between 50 and 100 rounds, most of which is defensive JHP ammo. No lowballs please, this is priced to sell.  I might consider a trade for a 7mm Rem Mag or .300 Win Mag, but I'm primarily looking for cash. Thanks for looking."

The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.From the very beginning of the design and development, computers have been used exclusively. All machined components are also made on modern high speed computerized equipment. Equally advanced quality control equipment and test procedures ensure a firearm with uncompromising quality in materials and workmanship. CONSTRUCTIONThe P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine.The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC.The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor.The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism.The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety. The functioning of the mechanism greatly surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer Dupont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard.The P-3AT is normally supplied with a 6 round single column steel magazine. Technical SpecificationsCaliber: .380 AUTOWeight unloaded. 7.2 ozLoaded magazine 2.8 oz Length 5.2""  Height 3.5""  Width .77"" Sight radius 3.8"" Muzzle energy max 250ftlbs  Capacity 6+1 roundsTrigger pull 5 lbs"

You have a used wasr that's worth 500. Ideally stock, no ""custom"" rifles. No IO, RAS, or any other fully domestic production akm. I'll up-trade with cash on my end for the right rifle. Again, wasrs and npaps are still sub 600 online if you have google-fu. Reasonable offer, wasr/maadi/AMD/npap/etc for my p07 and some cash on top puts the trade in your favor considering they are all used. Higher end AKs get a considerable bump obviously, with other guns on my end available for trade. Bulgarian kits, arsenal, polytech, vepr, etc. No, zastava and cugir are not even close, don't compare them. It does Mr Kalashnikov a great dishonor. Also, numbers matching examples are on my radar, so I'll entertain anything pertaining to those.I'm open to anything AK, except american production (unless it's the monkey made century, in which case I'll need a few good pictures to make sure the sights are on straight).Yes, I'm fine with shipping FFL to FFL."
