I built this gun to concealed carry, so it has been used like it was designed to be used.  It shows some very light firing and holster wear, but overall looks excellent.  The refinish was just done a few weeks ago, and still looks very good.  I spent a tremendous amount of time making sure the fits on everything are very good, and I think it shows.  The trigger feels great, and it will stack good ammo one bullet on top of the last.  All in all it's a genuine pleasure to shoot.

I have more fun building them than owning them, so I'm looking to get something else.  I will include the matching Remington Swiftlokt knife shown and ~370 rounds of Winchester White Box ammo for the right deal."

This is a nice handgun. I bought it last year shortly after they were first announced back in September with all the intentions to keep it forever, but have now decided to sell. The handgun retails for about $850.00 (this is the two tone one, the all black one is $100 less) The handgun comes with 10 total high cap mags. These mags sell for about $60.00 each at Specialty Sports. (that is IF!!! you can actually find them). Anyway I'm asking $1,200 for everything. That puts the prices @ $850 for the gun (3 mags in box), and $50.00 pr individual packaged mag(7). This deal is actually cheaper than retail if you think about it (NO TAX). If you want to buy the mags only and not the gun then I'll sell the mags separately at $65.00 each or $60 for all 7.

I am constantly looking for good deals on large quantities of new .45 ammo to resell at a reasonable fixed price, regardless of the brand of ammo. My intent is to hold the line at or below $30 per 50 round box during this weird shortage for as long as possible. Yes, I make a couple of dollars per box, I make no apologies for that, but a small profit enables me to locate other supplies and quickly purchase good ammo for resale.

I have no purchase limits, if it's in stock and you have the cash, I will sell as much ammo as you want. It might be a good idea to email or text message me first if more than 20 boxes at a time is wanted.

At this time I do not stock any other calibers other than .45 (sorry, no 9mm or .22), I have enough problems finding .45 to keep supplied. Thanks to all of you who have bought my ammunition recently."

For the second year in a row, CCI has down the volume with the Quiet-22™ rimfire round. Like its predecessor, Quiet-22™, this new cartridge generates 75-percent less perceived noise than a standard velocity .22 Long Rifle round. However, its Segmented HP bullet splits in three on impact, with each section creating its own distinct wound channel to bring down small game fast. (Part No. 0970).
FEATURES & BENEFITS
• 40-grain Segmented HP bullet breaks into three pieces on impact
• 75 percent less perceived noise than standard .22 LR
• No hearing protection needed
• Standard .22 LR Case

He lists himself as a “Private Party” while trying to sale handguns, which is a lie. He is a “Dealer” requiring Texas ID and paper work to sale you a firearm. If he would lie about this, what else would he lie about? Unless you want your named tied to a gun, and a paper trail that Uncle Sam can trace back to you go ahead and do business with him, but the Uncle Sam I know wants all my guns and my rite to have them. Frankly it’s none of his business what I own nor will it be. Just a friendly warning to those out there, and also to any other dealers doing unscrupulous business using this web-site, if I catch you I PROMISE to be a thorn in your side.

BY THE TIME OF U.S. ENTRY INTO WORLD WAR I, 843,239 OF THESE RIFLES HAD BEEN PRODUCED AT SPRINGFIELD ARMORY AND ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL. PRE-WAR PRODUCTION UTILIZED QUESTIONABLE METALLURGY. SOME RECEIVERS WERE IMPROPERLY SUBJECTED TO EXCESSIVE TEMPERATURES DURING THE FORGING PROCESS. THE CARBON COULD BE ""BURNT"" OUT OF THE STEEL PRODUCING A BRITTLE RECEIVER.[4] DESPITE DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE INDICATING SOME EARLY RIFLES WERE IMPROPERLY FORGED, ACTUAL CASES OF FAILURE WERE VERY RARE. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL CASES OF SERIOUS INJURY FROM RECEIVER FAILURE WERE DOCUMENTED, THE U.S. ARMY NEVER REPORTED ANY FATALITIES. EVIDENCE ALSO SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT IMPROPERLY FORGED BRASS SHELL CASINGS COULD HAVE EXACERBATED RECEIVER FAILURE.  IF YOU WANT TO READ MORE HERE IS LINK HTTP://WWW.VISHOOTER.NET/M1903.HTML

It is new in the box. It has never been fired other than the factory test round. I am not trying to sell this glock for $800 or $900 like some crazy people on here.  This is the best  deal you'll find on a new Glock. Production date is Feb 2013.  Reason for selling is I found a shot gun I'd rather have. The guy at the gun shop said Glock was 1,000,000 guns behind. I don't know if thats true or not but they are indeed hard to find. I will also throw in a box of personal defense ammo for $20 more. Your choice of ammo is below if you would like it.

BY THE TIME OF U.S. ENTRY INTO WORLD WAR I, 843,239 OF THESE RIFLES HAD BEEN PRODUCED AT SPRINGFIELD ARMORY AND ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL. PRE-WAR PRODUCTION UTILIZED QUESTIONABLE METALLURGY. SOME RECEIVERS WERE IMPROPERLY SUBJECTED TO EXCESSIVE TEMPERATURES DURING THE FORGING PROCESS. THE CARBON COULD BE ""BURNT"" OUT OF THE STEEL PRODUCING A BRITTLE RECEIVER.[4] DESPITE DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE INDICATING SOME EARLY RIFLES WERE IMPROPERLY FORGED, ACTUAL CASES OF FAILURE WERE VERY RARE. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL CASES OF SERIOUS INJURY FROM RECEIVER FAILURE WERE DOCUMENTED, THE U.S. ARMY NEVER REPORTED ANY FATALITIES. EVIDENCE ALSO SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT IMPROPERLY FORGED BRASS SHELL CASINGS COULD HAVE EXACERBATED RECEIVER FAILURE.  IF YOU WANT TO READ MORE HERE IS LINK HTTP://WWW.VISHOOTER.NET/M1903.HTML

Or how 'bout a bike that other's will go, ""Dude... where'd you get THAT bike!?!?!?""

Then this is it.... Complete Custom Build. Every part was ordered al-a-carte. I spent over $1000 plus time and labor putting this bike together 15 years ago.  At the time, Aluminum Frames and Forks were unheard of... now everybody makes them, but nobody made them like this...

All bearings from the headset to the cranks to the hubs are sealed. Bike has never been left outside, abused, or crashed. Rides like a Cadillac and with the long cranks and large front sprocket, one rotation equals one and a half rotations on a average race bike... this is one bad scooter!"

BY THE TIME OF U.S. ENTRY INTO WORLD WAR I, 843,239 OF THESE RIFLES HAD BEEN PRODUCED AT SPRINGFIELD ARMORY AND ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL. PRE-WAR PRODUCTION UTILIZED QUESTIONABLE METALLURGY. SOME RECEIVERS WERE IMPROPERLY SUBJECTED TO EXCESSIVE TEMPERATURES DURING THE FORGING PROCESS. THE CARBON COULD BE ""BURNT"" OUT OF THE STEEL PRODUCING A BRITTLE RECEIVER.[4] DESPITE DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE INDICATING SOME EARLY RIFLES WERE IMPROPERLY FORGED, ACTUAL CASES OF FAILURE WERE VERY RARE. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL CASES OF SERIOUS INJURY FROM RECEIVER FAILURE WERE DOCUMENTED, THE U.S. ARMY NEVER REPORTED ANY FATALITIES. EVIDENCE ALSO SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT IMPROPERLY FORGED BRASS SHELL CASINGS COULD HAVE EXACERBATED RECEIVER FAILURE.  IF YOU WANT TO READ MORE HERE IS LINK HTTP://WWW.VISHOOTER.NET/M1903.HTML

BY THE TIME OF U.S. ENTRY INTO WORLD WAR I, 843,239 OF THESE RIFLES HAD BEEN PRODUCED AT SPRINGFIELD ARMORY AND ROCK ISLAND ARSENAL. PRE-WAR PRODUCTION UTILIZED QUESTIONABLE METALLURGY. SOME RECEIVERS WERE IMPROPERLY SUBJECTED TO EXCESSIVE TEMPERATURES DURING THE FORGING PROCESS. THE CARBON COULD BE ""BURNT"" OUT OF THE STEEL PRODUCING A BRITTLE RECEIVER.[4] DESPITE DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE INDICATING SOME EARLY RIFLES WERE IMPROPERLY FORGED, ACTUAL CASES OF FAILURE WERE VERY RARE. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL CASES OF SERIOUS INJURY FROM RECEIVER FAILURE WERE DOCUMENTED, THE U.S. ARMY NEVER REPORTED ANY FATALITIES. EVIDENCE ALSO SEEMS TO SUGGEST THAT IMPROPERLY FORGED BRASS SHELL CASINGS COULD HAVE EXACERBATED RECEIVER FAILURE.  IF YOU WANT TO READ MORE HERE IS LINK HTTP://WWW.VISHOOTER.NET/M1903.HTML

Straight from the pages of history … the greatest conflict of modern times, World War II … comes the new Citadel M-1 carbine. Built to the exacting specifications of the G.I. model used by U.S. infantrymen in both WWII theaters of battle and in Korea, this reproduction rifle comes to you chambered in the fun and economical .22 LR cartridge.

Used by officers as well as tankers, drivers, artillery crews, mortar crews, and other personnel in lieu of the larger, heavier M1 Garand rifle, the M-1 carbine weighed only 4.5 to 4.75 pounds. The Citadel M-1, made by Chiappa in Italy, weighs in at 4.8 lbs. – nearly the exact weight of the original. Barrel length and OAL are also the same as the ""United States Carbine, Caliber .30, M1"", its official military designation."

It is chambered for the .223 Remington and features a 18"" barrel with AR-15 style flash hider. The Galil is a modified and improved version of the famous Kalashnikov (AK47) design. It was specifically manufactured to fire the .223 cartridge and to function flawlessly in the arid (and sandy) desert environment of the Middle East. The Galil was selected as the weapon of choice by the Israeli Defense Forces, beating out the M16A1, AK47, and HK33 among others. Other features include a milled receiver, wood handguard, folding carry handle, integral bipod, AK style safety w/ additional left-side thumb safety, and heavy duty side-folding stock. This weapon is in excellent overall condition. There are a few minor handling and storage marks but no rust or pitting. Looking at the internals, I cannot tell if this rifle has even been fired! Needless to say, the mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is likewise excellent. you can contact me via seccoalis@gmail.com, my loss is your gain...."

But I know prices for these things are high, and I need to be practical- I have no long range rifle, and I should.

I am mostly looking for a trade- Something long range.

I have TWO-  ONE HUNDRED  round magazines- I never shot through the second magazine-  I think the second one just needs a follower put in it- Which is a relatively cheap part 

Rifle is used- I'm nost sure how many rounds have been through it, it's been years since I have fired it, but as I recall this thing works good,  Again, I hate to see it go, but I need to be practical instead of just looking at the fun factor. The photo is just a stock photo. I do not know the round count- I bought it used,  I don't remember how many rounds I have fired. You are very welcome to meet me at the range and try it before trading though:)

Disclaimer
It's a shame I have to say this-
But- Some people seem to think very highly of the fact that they can come up with cash today... As if that takes some type of Super Human Feet that instantaniously cuts the price by a large amount......

So PLEASE- if you don't want me to laugh at your offer- Don't say things like ""I'll give you $500 cash money today!""....

There are just so many things I could mock about such a statement...

It's as if such a person thinks by adding the words ""cash money"" it makes his offer better...
because afterall in his mind ""cash money"" is twice as good as simply saying cash... or just saying money...

His offer is Cash money... His ""cash money"" spends much better than ordinary cash...

Or how about this genius- What other things do you think you are going to pay with other than cash? What else could you be offering? Teddy Bears? Food Stamps? Snowballs? Kittens? A Check perhaps? Who in their right mind is going to meet a total stranger and take a check and let the stranger walk away with an expensive rifle????

So when making an offer all you have to do is say the amount, it is a given that you are offering cash...

Again I am sorry I had to waste those 60 seconds of your life reading this, but the type of folk who use that kind of verbage are usually lowballers anyway, and I don't mind offending those types.

From the Remington site: 

Its speed, versatility, bone-crushing power and swift pointing characteristics couldn't be topped, so we added a host of upgrades to our Model 11-87 Sportsman Super Magnum to improve handling, sight acquisition and more. All models now feature rubber overmolded grip panels on the stock and fore-end for a sure hold in all weather conditions and a black padded sling, with other enhancements on individual configurations. These shotguns tame the biggest, baddest, 3 1/2"" 12-gauge rounds with a soft-shooting action and our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil pad."
