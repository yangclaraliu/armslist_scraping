Have you recently come of age and want to begin your journey into firearms, but don't know where to start?   I offer a personal trainer experience with a wide range of firearms to test out. I'll train you personally on each firearm and walk you through the steps of using the gun safely and helping with technique. This is a very friendly and personal experience. I know that if you walk into a typical gun shop/range today you may run into abrasive and sometimes rude associates. My goal is to make this a comfortable experience to help guide you into a proper purchase. You don’t know what’s right for you until you try it out for yourself.
 
This is similar to a personal trainer at the gym. I meet you at a shooting range of your choice with the proper firearms (up to 4 of your choice). You purchase the amount of ammo you wish to shoot, pay for range time (typically an hour), and targets from the shooting range. Expect the payment for this to be around $100-$200. This will depend on what you wish to shoot and how much ammo you intend to go through. After the session, before we exit the gun range my fee will be due. This will be agreed upon before. $75/hour, $15/gun rented.
 
Please email me for more information and for a list of available firearms.
Thank you"

At the heart of the 686's quick and instinctive shooting are opposing trunnions (projections) mounted on the receiver walls where the barrels pivot, thus eliminating the need for bulky underhooks to form a hinge. As a result of this more compact arrangement is a instinctive pointing, low-profile line of sight; the recoil is directed straight rearward to the shooter's shoulder instead of up into the shooter's cheek, allowing rapid target and sight acquisition for the second shot. The thumb operated safety/barrel selector switch enables you to choose which barrel to fire first, depending on either the load or the choke tube. An oil finished, select walnut stock and fore-end, with finely cut checkering, and the scroll-work that embellishes the receiver, make the Silver Pigeon I a highly functional masterpiece of fine arms. Hard chromed bores and Beretta's Mobilchoke® interchangeable choke tube system minimize pellet deformation to deliver tight, consistently uniform patterns.

Much of the 725's innovative design was focused on the low profile receiver that positions the barrels lower in the receiver for natural point ability. The 725's low profile receiver also improves recoil control by pushing the gun straight back into the shoulder instead of the muzzle jumping up, which makes getting an aimed, second shot off quicker. The Citori 725 features the FireLite mechanical trigger design that delivers a light, smooth pull. By not relying on inertia to reset the second hammer, a mechanical trigger ensures you get an immediate second shot, without worrying about your gun unexpectedly doubling. The Citori 725 Field comes with a gloss, oil finished, grade II/III checkered walnut stock, and a ""white"" steel receiver with high-relief engraving, protected from corrosion by a durable coating process called ""nitrided,"" offering similar protection as bluing. Barrels have a high-polished blued finish. All metal components are machined to exact tolerances, and wood-to-metal fit is extremely tight. The pistol grip and forend on the White Lighting are rounded to further facilitate the lightning speed one can shoulder and instinctively get on target with this exquisite hunting shotgun. Browning's Inflex Technology recoil pad utilizes directional deflection to pull the comb down and away from the shooter's face, creating greater comfort and allowing for faster follow up shots. The Browning Citori 725 Sporting comes with 3 Invector-DS choke tubes and Vector Pro lengthened forcing cones that minimize shot deformation and maximize pattern uniformity. The Browning Citori 725 Field Over/Under Shotgun is a highly functional modern firearm, utilizing the most innovative designs to give upland bird hunters and clay target shooters a competitive edge.

So, I bought a cheap RAS47 - literally the cheapest one I could find (does not even have a optic rail mount) so I could throw the Bumpski on it and have some fun. Fired about 150 rounds through it with the Bumpski, cleaned it, and haven't touched it since.I had to upgrade the stock grip to a Magpul grip as the one the came with it was not compatible with the Bumpski. I also changed the handguard just for aesthetic reasons, but I could not change the gas tube guard as the Magpul version does not fit from the factory (you have to grind down the Magpul plastic a bit to make it fit), so I just left the stock one on there. The polymer stock that came on the gun was immediately removed and never used. I still have all the original parts.I'll offer the rifle in 100% original config (stock, handguard, pistol grip all from factory), with regular stock and upgraded Magpul bits, or as is (with the Bumpski). The picture shows a mil-surp metal mag (Romanian I think?), but the rifle came with a PMAG, so I'll include either one in the sale (just let me know).

Includes Uncle Mikes Tactical Case with three ammo pouches.$875.00. OBO - Serious inquiries only please. Text my cell 302-391-4871. (In NW Ocala, FL)About the Police Magnum Tactical w/ Folding Stock:• 870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.• All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.• All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.• Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.• A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.• A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.• Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.Differences Between the Police 870 Magnum & the Express 870 (credit to www.rem870.com) For detailed explanation of how to change an Express into a Police go here: http://www.rem870.com/2013/08/13/10-steps-to-upgrade-your-remington-870-express-to-police-version-2/• The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks.• The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.• The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.• The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization.• The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.• The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.• The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.• Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express models."

Shoots good.  Never been in the woods. 3 x 9 scope came on the rifle. The Marlin 336 has been a staple among lever-action guns for the past few decades. Read on to learn everything you wanted to know about the Marlin 336.
The Marlin 336 (also known known as the Marlin 30-30), is perhaps the second most popular lever action rifle in history, trailing only the venerable Winchester 1894 (which was also chambered in .30-30 Winchester).
There is a good reason why the Marlin 30-30 is so popular: it is a reasonably priced, utilitarian, powerful, accurate, and easy-to-use rifle. These qualities have helped make the Marlin 336 one of the most prolific hunting rifles in the United States. As a result, countless deer, elk, bear, and feral hogs have fallen to this great little .30-30 rifle over the years.
One thing that sets the Marlin 336 apart from most other lever action rifles is the fact that it ejects from the side of the receiver instead of the top, a rare feature on a .30-30 rifle. he Marlin 336 a great “woods gun” for hunters who need to take a fast, short-range shot on a big game animal."

The top/right mag in the picture has a spot on the right side where there was a spot of light rust before I took care of it, but it left a mark in the finish. Magazines like these haven’t been imported into this country in almost 25 years, and are in excellent shape, unlike some beat-to-death surplus mags that have turned up in the last few years. They load and shoot smoothly, looking very good while they do so. $250 cash takes them all, which is more than fair for what they are.
