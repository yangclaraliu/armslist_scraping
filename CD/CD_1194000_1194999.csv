This swat .556 folding stock has a couple selling options. #1 take the the rifle itself and 1 pmag or take the rifle with a 3X Primary Arms ultra compact 1moa/1moa-red scope. Info on scope. It's a $200 scope that had a designated non illuminated cross hair/1moa .556/.223 calibrated scope in 3x. I researched and tested this scope compared to the ""exact same Burris $500 version"" I was shocked when I found out that all parts are made in same warehouse. The glass/crystal made same. The only diff is primary's is assembled in that warehouse that Burris parts are made and Burris part ship here and get put together. Glass crystal clean scope had been mounted and sighted in a a 100yrs zero. I never would have bought a cheap optic if I didn't test it. $200 to me is cheap for optic however I feel it beats the famous Burris compact 3x by far maybe it's just mine but glass/crystal (by that I mean this is crystal lens not regular glass$ is more clear then the 4 Burris one I tried. I don't care if I sell it I'm just at sighting my opinion. 

The Sig Swat- if u still reading you know that this is. Sig away 1/7 twist Crome all over. Basically brand new. To me it's percent mix between a M4 and AK's durable reliable action. This thing doesn't mess around smooth trigger pull and literally ejects shell casings about 5 foot farther then my custom BCM will not jam! Folding stock is a excellent option as well. 

Trades: multiple .40 call quality striker fires glock 27, S&w M&P. also looking for someone with a Vltor CVSA Mid length hand guard in any of the 3 colors as possible partial trade. One of those sells for $230 and I could order now but would rather not place a back order. 

Serious buyers only. I don't care what happened at the Capitol as I am smart enough to judge character myself. CCW permit hold might get a discount small but deff fist dibs and a little brake. I have ammo to throw in and some pmags but that's would be extra. Gun comes with original box and 2 30rnf mags.

I bought this with the intention to build a second rifle, but plans have changed so no reason to hold on to it when someone else can use it. Would Prefer to trade to a handgun of some sort. But will consider other guns as well. No muzzleloaders or bows please. Just not into them.
From Mag Tactical:
MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver is one of the most recent AR-15 Lower Receivers to hit the market. The MAG Tactical Systems AR-15 Lower Receiver is about 35 percent lighter than a standard aluminum receiver, and it is not plastic! The MAG Tactical Systems Generation 4 Lower is made of a proprietary magnesium alloy. The patented coating process that MAG Tactical Systems owns gives their lower extreme corrosion resistance characteristics.
The MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver incorporates a machined in triggerguard that is larger than a mil-spec trigger guard, which allows the trigger to be accessed with thick winter gloves.
The MAG Tactical Systems 4th Generation lower receiver front and rear pivot points are reinforced to avoid breakage of the receiver even when high torque is applied when it is in the break down position

Then you list a 29.99 ""TACTICAL"" scope and foregrip you bought off ebay for an Airsoft gun! Come on now,if it says TACTICAL in the name and its on Ebay, its Chinese junk and will not increase your gun value 200.00 when you paid 29.99 free shipping. Another thing I do not understand, how is a gun ""NEW"" with 150 rounds shot through it? Drive a car off a lot put 150 miles on it and try and sell it as new, Good Luck! And for all the sellers who say, thats what they are selling for new. One they are probably an NEW gun at a gun store and again you are a Dumba$$ if you paid that for one.

Therefore, unless you have a S&W Performance Center built M&P .22 or perhaps for some reason put a real ACOG or Leupold scope on a .22 you are way over priced. Hope this helps some people out here looking to find a nice gun and a FAIR price. If you really want one that bad, I bet any off your local guns stores will next day you one in if you tell them your willing to pay 100-200.00 over eretail for the gun.

I made the ads for the most common overpriced items and used the average price I saw being asked.  So now that I know that NO ONE is actually paying the money, I wonder why these people are still asking these prices?  Do I just have bad luck and is everyone else actually getting attention?  I doubt it.  

It's a free country and you are welcome to ask whatever price you want for your belongings, but isn't enough enough at this point?  I just saw a PSA AR15 with about $600 worth of upgrades and extras asking over $3000!!!!! Ridiculous!!!!!  

Maybe I'm just naive enough to think people would be too smart to overpay by that much.  This website is such a useful tool and a wonderful idea, I just hate to see it cluttered with bullshit and abused by those thinking they can rip off their brothers in arms.  Such is life I guess.

They are hard to find. Don't overpay for a Bushmaster. CORE 15 is new to the AR market but they are making an amazing rifle. Please do your own research and you'll will see what I have learned about them. The term mil spec is over used in my opinion but CORE does use manufacturing process's like MPI to ensure the highest quality parts. No i don't work for the company but I was sold on their guns. I was originally going to buy a Bushmaster and hadn't heard about CORE 15. After looking at their rifles it is was a no brainier between the two. It's not a Colt, but for the price you can't beat them. Their current price is $1299 and the wait is at least 6 months minimum. I have listed the specs from their website. It does come with one 30 round PMAG. This gun has been used only 3 times for coyote hunting. It has less than 50 rounds fired throug it. I'm only selling it because I need the money for a down payment on a new house. I'm firm on the price, I love this gun and will not let this gun go for cheap, so please no low ball offers. It does come with a Bushnell red dot sight and case. If you don't like the camo paint job it's easy to remove to the original Black Rifle.

I believe these to be .303 British tracers, 12 rounds with headstamp H (up arrow) N (indicates that the cartridges were made by the Royal Ordnance Factory, Hirwaun, South Wales, UK. This factory was set up as part of the 1939-45 war emergency expansion plan. It was involved in the production of .303 cartridges in only a very limited way and is known to have manufactured Tracer G Mk 2 (in cases dated 1943 and 1944)). The headstamp also bears the number 44 (for 1944 manufacture) and the letters GII, which indicates a Tracer G Mk 2 (""II"" being a roman numeral 2)

One round is similar to the above, but its headstamp is a BE, for Royal Ordinance Factory, Blackpole, Worchester, UK, and it is a '43.

The bullets are unmarked, but they do have a red annulus around the primer indicating that it is a tracer. There is a tight crimp between the case mouth and the bullet.

The 13 rounds are in good to average condition for 70-year-old ammo, with some light corrosion, and are packed in what I believe is the original cardboard box -- though it has absolutely no markings.

Also included are two rounds of post-war ball ammo, a FN '51 and a POF '64.

I make no promises about the viability of this ammunition, though WW2-era ammunition is often just fine -- your mileage may vary. These would also likely be of some interest to a cartridge collector.

Fellow firearm enthusiast, please help clean up this site from price gougers. Start flagging the overpriced items. We should be sticking together and fighting the folks attacking our second amendment rights here in Colorado, not taking advantage of each other.

When you see these gougers, and they are apparent flag them. They are not trying to make a fair profit but are doubling or tripling the price, simply click on the flag option, click overprice, and hit ok.

This message will likely be flagged by them within minutes and will disappear, so please help out. Copy this message and repost yourself later today and various times during the week.

If we show a uniform voice, they will eventually keep their hoarded stashes or come down in price.

Barrel:  A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system.   The Special ultra lightweight profile barrel  has a conventional .750"" gas block diameter, is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.  The weight of the barrel splits the difference between our light profile and our pencil barrel.    Barrel is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider.

Some of us buy ammo for bringing kids into this sport, like .22LR. If you keep paying $70/box for a brick of .22 then people will keep selling it for that. This makes it hard for anyone to get by. 

REFUSE to pay these astronomical prices and the prices will come down. This price gouging is ridiculous and you all should be ashamed of yourselves, both for selling it like that and for buying it at these enormous prices.

But I don't see your point. The people on here trying to turn guns at ridiculous prices aren't hurting me a bit. I read the ads, I don't buy the guns. If it bothered me to read the ads, I wouldn't read them.

But now this point does bother me..... These ads offend you. You get on here and raise hell because these people offend you in some manner. Gun grabbers want my guns because my guns offend them. Me having a gun offends them. Damned if I can figure out why. I've never done anything to them, but still they are offended.

I'm long winded I know, but here's the point. We as a people have to quit wanting to think for the other guy. We need to let the other guy think for himself. It made America great in the past, might still work. If we flag people today because WE think their prices aren't right, WHO are we going to flag tomorrow? Are we going to flag some guy because his guns  to cheap? Too old? Too used? This is a dangerous road to start down because it leads to exactly where we are now. We have this idiot in the whitehouse who believes we don't know what's good for us. He has to do our thinking for us. If we are old enough and still FREE enough to buy or sell a gun, we are old enough to figure out what we want to pay for it.

Having said that, I still defend your right to have your opinion and hope you accord me the same right to me."

Make no mistake gun-grabbing representatives like Andre Thapedi won't rest until they strip you of your constitutional rights and House Bill 132 does just that.

This ""Assault Weapon Ban"", House Bill 132, will be up before the House Judiciary Committee again this Wednesday at 8 am in RM C-1 Stratton Building.

Anti-gun committee hearings on this and other gun-grabbing legislation  will continue throughout the week.

Subject: A Dangerous Decoy... 

Dear Fellow Patriot:

The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals rightfully ruled the Illinois ban on concealed carry is unconstitutional. 

So, you might think Governor Quinn, Rahm Emanuel, and the big city gun-grabbers would be disappointed. 

You may even think that relief is finally on the way for law-abiding gun owners. 

Please. Don’t make that mistake.

The sad truth is, elitist lawmakers are perched in Springfield loaded with plenty of anti-gun comebacks.

While the court ruling is an opportunity for gun owners in Illinois, there’s work to be done first. 

And it starts this week. 

You see, your Second Amendment rights are under assault again! 

Recently, Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy was caught saying that your right to keep and bear arms is “dangerous” and that he believes the second amendment limits citizens to ""smooth-bore muskets.""  

Unfortunately, many in the ruling class believe as McCarthy does. The political powers that be in Illinois are firmly entrenched in decades of anti-gun groupthink.  

Beginning today, many of them will be gathering in the Illinois House Judiciary Committee to discuss dozens of anti-gun bills… and Concealed Carry. 

Committee hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow and Friday. 

And the radical left is hoping to use the anti-gun climate, fueled by recent tragedies, to push as much gun control as they can get away with. 

The truth is, Governor Quinn, Rahm Emanuel, and elitist legislative leaders aren’t disappointed at all. 

They think the courts handed them a blank check to enact more rigorous infringements on your Second Amendment rights. 

If gun owners like you don’t turn up the heat, Illinois could end up with MORE gun control along with new concealed carry bill -- not less. 

We’re talking proposals like: 
*** Taxes, fees, and surcharges so expensive that only the wealthiest could afford one, and restrict the right to only the politically connected;

*** The requirement to demonstrate “good cause” or “need” for a permit, or to prove to the government that you are “suitable” enough to excessive your rights;

*** Optional permit issuance -- which would give a sheriff or issuing authority the ability to deny you your right to carry for any reason whatsoever, (i.e. skin color, political beliefs) with a sham appeals process, and;

*** Government-mandated training requirements that would force you to shoot like an Olympian, and pay another massive fee in order to take an eight hour -- or longer -- class... annually.

On top of that, the legislature is also considering: 

HB-132 -- A massive new so-called “assault weapons” ban!

It would: 
*** Outlaw possession, delivery, sale, and purchase of semi-automatic firearms, attachments, .50 caliber rifles, and .50 caliber cartridges;

(This includes rifles AND pistols as well as virtually any accessory;)

*** Ban the possession of magazines that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition;

*** Force the complete registration and/or confiscation of thousands of lawfully-owned firearms within 60 days; 

*** Strip you of your Second Amendment rights for being the victim of firearms theft if you fail to report it within 72 hours, and;

*** Fine you $25,000 and throw you in jail for one, three, or even seven years for even the slightest violations.

Other bills would: 
*** Impose additional restrictions on the already burdensome and unconstitutional Firearm Owner’s Identification Card (FOID);

*** Impose a universal firearms registration scheme through the use of background checks, and;

*** Invade your private health records in an effort to label you “mentally ill” and take away your gun rights.

The quandary of relying on the judicial system is that even when the ruling is good, they often open up the floodgates for something even worse. 

But you and I know that these restrictions are anything but “reasonable.” 

They're just a part of a backdoor scam to impose yet another de facto repeal of the Second Amendment in Chicago and throughout the entire state. 

That’s why your action is needed now more than ever. 

Please do the following two things... right now! 
1.) Contact the House Judiciary Committee members. Urge them to pass a clean “Constitutional Carry” bill with absolutely no burdensome regulations attached.

(Click here to find out who represents you.)

Demand they reject all anti-gun proposals including so-called “assault weapons” bans, magazine bans, mental health labeling scams, and universal gun registration and background checks.

Make no mistake. Anti-gun lawmakers will use concealed carry as a very dangerous decoy... unless YOU speak up.

That’s why YOUR action is so crucial. 

Contact your elected officials and tell them to OPPOSE all anti-gun legislation and support a clean Constitutional Carry bill today. 

Please act now! 

For Freedom, 

Dudley Brown
Executive Vice President 

P.S. Governor Quinn, Rahm Emanuel, and the Chicago gun-grabbers are ecstatic. 

They think they’ve been handed a blank check to plunder your Second Amendment rights once and for all. 

But they’ve underestimated YOU. Committee hearings start this week. 

Will you help me stop the anti-gun legislation and fight for a clean “Constitutional Carry” bill with absolutely no burdensome regulations attached?
