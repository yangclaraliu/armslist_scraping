Well balanced with a slightly longer or equal barrel length of most in the Makarov family. Designed after the Walther PPK (The famous James Bond handgun) with some improvements. Side button magazine release. Comes with two magazines, in its original box as shown. The images are of the actual unit.

What I really like is the fit in the hand. It is double acting, which is perfect for CC or home protection. It is a point and shoot gun with all of the most popular safety features. It weighs only 21 oz. vs. the PPK which weighs 23.5 oz. and again, feels more balanced and conforms to the hand."

If you paid more than that for a bare ak, you were grifted or you bought into the bullshit upped market value crap people are pushing. 

I purchased an ak-47 + accessories 1-1/2 years ago for only 550. It was a Romanian underfolding ak-47, the accessories it came with; a Romanian/ Chinese hybrid metal 75rd drum (79.99 with purchase of the gun, -10 from the real amount), bayonet, cleaning rod, sling, 3-30rd east german block steel mags, oil can and cleaning kit. The furniture on the forend was plastic. If you purchase a plastic furniture ak, get new furniture. Plastic is shit. It melts if you go shooting for fun with it, lots of rounds = molten plastic forend, wooden furniture = on fire or smoking. Get an aluminum quad rail that doesn't really touch the barrel much. 

Don't buy into horseshit. Anything over 600 for an ak, ignore them and buy a different gun. NIB means they just bought the shit, and are making a profit. BTW illegal. If the gunstores they purchased these guns from knew they were selling this they would report them to the ATF. You would no longer be able to own guns. Pay 10,000 fine and possible jail time. Fight the bullshit and let these fuckers rot with there stupid ads."

It has wood furnishing but is missing one of the shell holders which is a less than $20 part off of Brownells or Cheaperthandirt and is easy to install.

If that sale falls through then Iwill contact the second person, and so on.....please don't waste your time and mine with silly lowball offers.

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the 6920 carbine is less than 32"" collapsed in length and weighs only 6.91 lb - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's 6920 carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components 
- Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm) 
- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness

This gun was made in 1996 and is an ex-Swiss law-enforcement weapon. The slide is the heavier milled stainless steel part instead of the earlier stamped one, and has the Swiss canton regional crest(Vaud) on the left side. The sights are tritium but glow very faintly, so I painted over them with white paint.Since it was a duty weapon there is some finish wear, but this doesn't affect anything. In fact I think it gives the gun some character. This gun was made in 1996 so it avoids the problems that some newer post-2004 Sigs have with QC. It was made at a time when Sig made nothing but the best. I carry this gun every day and trust my life to it.

""The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun manufactured in Turkey by Ucyildiz Arms. The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar. The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed. The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer hand guard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer. The MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round metal detachable magazines and 3 internal chokes. The magazine release button mimics the M16 rifle location. The manual safety also duplicates the M16 style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip. The top of the receiver has a carrying handle and integral picatinny rail for mounting rear sights, or any optical accessories. The MKA 1919 12 gauge shotgun is appropriate for all levels of hunting and sporting enthusiasts."""

Since its introduction in 1993, the Ruger Vaquero® has dominated the cowboy action shooting world and earned its reputation for rugged reliability due to its strength and mechanical superiority.

The 'I' stands for innovation! Smith & Wesson purchased the Thompson/Center Arms company and uses their plant to manufacture these barrels from 4140 carbon steel. The receiver and bolt are also made of this same material.  The list of innovations goes on to include an over size trigger guard which accomodates gloves, and 'E-Z Turn' bolt which can be removed without seperate buttons to push, a cocked indicator that can be seen and felt in low light conditions and many other features a shooter will appreciate.

The matte black synthetic stock has molded in, no-slip checkering on the forearm and the flared pistol grip. The 'S&W' logo is prominante on the grip cap, the recoil pad, bolt handle and the receiver. This gun comes in a S&W hard case that is lined with eggshell foam with all factory paper work.
This I-Bolt has been factory checked and modified by Smith & Wesson, to correct the recall defect. (Google: 'I-Bolt recall' for more information)
