I have 3 or possibly 4 guns for sale. The first two are Ithaca double barrels. They're both field grade guns and both are 12 gauge. Neither one is immaculate but they're both in what I would consider good condition and are very solid old guns. The two are almost identical. The finish is worn in areas but there is no corrosion or anything of that sort. I usually see these on gunbroker and other armslist ads for $600-$900 in what is similar to this condition. Asking $500 a piece for these. The other gun is a Remington model 1900 Double Barrel 12 Gauge. This one is in even nicer shape than the two Ithacas and is an extremely nice swinging gun. These are coming back in the sport of Cowboy Action Shooting and from what I see online, this one is probably worth around $650 or so. Asking $550. It's hard to find guns as well built as these anymore. I would just like to sell them in order to make room for others guns. I have a few pictures but can take better ones. Just text me if you want pictures or have any questions about the guns. My number is 540-560-0164. Only trades I would consider at this time would be a Folding AK 47 or a .44 Magnum of some sort. Thanks"

Originally chambered in 7.5 French, this 49/56 was rechambered by Century Arms International to 7.62x51mm NATO (evidenced by receiver markings) and actually functions well unlike other 49/56 rifles botched by CAI. Also, this rifle has a factory French military coat of green paint, suggesting military service in the First Indochina War (Vietnam War (ish)), which is extremely rare. Have only seen 3 others with the same coat. For those unfamiliar with the 49/56, it strips kind of like an SKS. Threaded barrel/gas cutoff for grenade launcher attachment still intact, grenade sights also still intact. Magazine is a standard 49/56 magazine slightly modified to accommodate 7.62x51mm cartidges. Comes with one magazine, however if you want more, I can show you how to modify existing 49/56 ones to work with this one. Buyer pays FFL/shipping if out of my area. I'll throw in ammo for local buyers, this rifle prefers steel cased ammo to make up for the pressure difference between 7.62x51mm and 7.5 French. I live in the Angleton area, will go as far as Lake Jackson, Manvel, Needville, or anywhere else in between. Text (281) 967-1547 for more info. More pictures available on request."

The etched reticle requires no illumination, but a CR2032 battery illuminates the center through 5 red brightness settings and 5 green brightness settings. The scope is extremely durable, designed to handle heavy recoil and extreme weather conditions, with a 3-year warranty. A 1913 Picatinny mount is included, but this versatile optic is also able to accept ACOG, quick detach (QD), and standard bases for AR15 and AK 47 platforms.

It is sporting a Fab Defense GL Shock Stock with cheek riser and interchangeable butt pads to change lop and soulder postion. 6 position tube, non folding. It is extremely hard to change positions still as it has been in this one position since new. It is very tight and has to be for the buffer to work correctly to reduce recoil. It has a 100 dollar Bec Inc scope with Red and Green IR/BDC. Rails, bipod are generic but solid and 4 prong flash suppressor is Tapco if I remember right. Fab Defense ergo grip as well. Will come with one 30 round steel mag while I try to find my Tapco mags. My dad passed away Thursday night after a long battle with cancer and I am selling this rifle to help my step mom with final expenses. I just had my 2nd cancer surgery last month myself and the bills are litteraly coming in daily so money is non existant here at home right now. I have around 1200 invested in this rifle. The Fab Defense parts cost about 400 alone. I forgot to mention that there is also a Fab Defense 90 dollar recoil buffer in the buffer tube which is also FD and was another 60 dollars or so. I am obviously looking for cash for the bills as stated above but will take part trade of that helps. Trades are listed below. I am near Newport. The rifle is papered to me. I have had it for several years but had to borrow money against it for gas money to get up to OHSU yet again so it is now papered. Thank you for looking.Rifle is a CAI import and was made in Romania in 2007. It is obviously the new series WASR with zero issues unlike the ones we all had back in the 70s and 80s. These look and run great. Round count is unknown as I bought it second hand but I have run close to 500 rounds through it over the years now myself.     Rifle is certainly not pristine as I have had it in and out out of my trucks and Jeep and had it all over my property defending it from an ever invading army of Pepsi cans and several coyotees as well. I have several more pics available if you would like to see more. We are limited to just 3 on Armslist and that is hard to make a decision based on just 3 pics. NOTE****   To the man who made a cash offer within the first 30 minutes of my ad being listed and I turned it down, give me a shout. I have a counter offer for you. I deleted your email that night so it's up to you."
