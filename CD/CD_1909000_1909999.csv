This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable nickel-plated brass cases. This is top of the line, American-made defense ammo designed for Law Enforcement and now available here! It doesn't get any better than this for personal protection.

Winchester made the ""Black Talons"" that were labeled ""cop killer"" bullets and after a fury of media backlash simply made a little tweak to the ammunition and now here they are again. LEGAL.

Winchester Ranger 9mm T-Series 127grain +P+ Hollow Points. This is the *MOST* powerful 9mm ammo you can buy! If you thought 9mm was hard to find right now, these are nearly impossible. 

The T-Series (Talon) is designed to be one of Winchester's highest performing loads with it's nickel plated case, reverse taper jacket design, and reliable expansion through a variety of barriers.  Winchester has set the world standard in superior handgun ammunition performance and innovation for more than a century.

I have two vltor lowers that just came in. They were originally going to be used in plans for a 300 Blackout and a 6.5 Grendel build for my father. Due to circumstances out of my control those plans have been scrapped for the time being. Vltor makes some of the best products I've ever used and their lowers are no exception. Once you have the opportunity to try their proprietary oversized mag release you'll never want to operate a standard AR again. They also come with an 3 position integrated QD side saddle sling plate. This plate can be removed if you want to run a UBR without any effect on the lower. Another thing I might add is their tolerances are beyond perfect. Retail is $380, with shipping and other costs I have over $425 invested in each. As you all know the market is flooded with run of the mill AR products at the moment but not tier 1. Last I checked Vltor was still running a 6 month wait and I don't know of any dealer with stock. The occasional Gunbroker auction I've seen is still reaching the high $500's.

Will ship through FFL on your dime. For FTF I require valid drivers license and signed bill of sale.

Vltor's site description:

The new Vltor Lower Receiver Assembly is machined from a 7075 forging, it is marked with the well known Vltor ""V"" and Gladius on the right side of the magazine well. The Vltor lower receiver also features unique grip enhancing cuts on the front of the magazine well, an oversized mag release button and the Vltor ""side saddle"" sling plate - featuring three positions to mount a quick disconnect sling swivel. The lower receiver comes complete with a Vltor receiver extension tube, standard carbine buffer, spring and A2 grip.

Note: The oversize magazine button and sling plate are proprietary and require machining of the lower receiver to fit - these parts will not work on a conventional lower receiver."

My cost is $1144. I know the price has dropped since I bought it. So my asking price would be what you could get one new, without the extra goodies.

$800 FTF for Wisconsin residents, $850 shipped. Check or money order. Check would have to clear before shipping. Not clear on shipping procedures, so I'll just ship from FFL to FFL. I don't think I need to ship from an FFL, but I'd rather err on the side of caution.

Don't want to part it out at this time. If I do part it out, most of the accessories will be at or near the listed prices.

The pictured Streamlight is not included, btw.

Barely used, I haven't even registered it yet. Cleaned, fired, cleaned again. This is the new version with the checkered fore-end and the little tabs that stick out to protect the safety from accidentally disengaging.

Hammerli Model 850 CO2 Air Rifle- The most powerful CO2 Air Rifle in the world! German quality and loaded with features, the RWS 850 AirMagnum is so much fun to shoot that you'll have a hard time putting it down. Let's start with the all-weather stock. You can take this gun anywhere and not worry about a fragile finish, because it's made from a durable polymer. It's ambidextrous, too, with a raised cheekpiece on both sides of the Monte Carlo stock! This CO2 rifle uses an 88-gram AirSource cartridge, giving you about 200-250 shots before you have to change cartridges. The fiber-optic sights will help you acquire your target, but feel free to mount a scope on the 11mm dovetail rail. (Umarex also makes a dovetail-to-Weaver mount) The checkering on the pistol grip and forearm will help you get a good grip while you plow shot after shot from this 8-shot repeater. This gun is everything you ever hoped for in a CO2 repeater!

The fun never stops with this rifle! Ideal for plinking, shooting targets and spinners.

RWS is known for standing behind their guns, and their warranty has always been viewed as the best in the business. We've recommended some pellets to help you get the most from this airgun, so please check out the accessories tab. Made by Umarex for RWS."

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

One is a Ruger 20 rounder and the other is an aftermarket 25 rounder (an odd number, I know). I can leave on the butt stock mag pouch or take it off. I sort of like being able to grab the rifle and have 45 rounds right there, but it's your choice. The only other thing of note it the muzzle break I added.

 Product Information

 Shop more Aimpoint products The Aimpoint PRO (Patrol Rifle Optic) was designed with the input of current and former professionals to create the most dynamic Red Dot sight available. Featuring band-pass lens coating, the PRO is compatible with every generation of night vision devices and provides a crystal clear 1x image for quick target acquisition in close quarter situations. The modular QRP2 mount securely attaches to standard picatinny rails and includes a removable spacer that provides optimal height for co-witness with iron sights on carbine style weapons. Additionally, the QRP2 incorporates a torque limiting knob to completely eliminate over tightening. You won't need to worry about turning the battery on and off with the PRO. The 3-year battery life allows you to turn the unit on out of the box and leave it on for an always ready sight. Other features include a see through ocular lens cap and standard objective flip-up lens cap that are both recessed to prevent impact damage, a rugged 30mm tube, threaded objective bell for use of ARD (Anti-Reflective Device), 4 Night vision settings and 6 daylight settings, battery and adjustment cap retainers to prevent them from being lost in the field, and a ten year pesronal use warranty.

Low round count, great condition with slight holster wear on the leading edge of the slide. This pistol has been carried a few times, but has mostly sat in my humidity-controlled safe.  This 85F has the best single-action trigger of any 80-series Beretta I've owned; you won't be disappointed.  It will come with (2) genuine Beretta single-stack 8-rd magazines. 

If you're not familiar with the 80 series Berettas, they're a medium-sized blowback design that was offered in .22, .32 ACP, and .380 ACP.  All of the 80 series are DA/SA and the 'F' design added a decocker to the safety.  Beretta even offered a tip-up barrel variant (the 86) for people who weren't strong enough to rack the slide.  The sights are clear and easy to use, and due to the size of this series, recoil recovery is rapid.  Accuracy is substantially better than most .380's due to a longer sight radius and excellent trigger feel.  Most people feel that the Beretta 80 series are the highest-quality .380 that has ever been produced.    

I also have (2) spare genuine Beretta magazines for the 85F and 86FS pistols I'm selling (one is new in wrapper, and one is new without wrapper), and they'll be available to the first buyer who wants them at $35/ea.  Beretta USA prices these at $48.50/ea, and is out of stock.  Here's a link:  http://www.berettausa.com/products/85-84f-84fs-/-86-magazine-380auto-8rds/

Price is cash only. I'm not interested in shipping in connection with Armslist ads, so please don't ask. People who ask anyway will be ignored, as I've already answered the question in the sentence before this one. Legal face-to-face sales to VA citizens only, so please have your driver's license with you. If I get a bad vibe about you, no sale -- simple as that."

Up for sale I have my Chinese SKS.  As far as I know, it has not been shot.  I bought it from a surplus sale, modified it, and it's just been sitting in my room.  I don't have any use for it as I have other guns now.  So, I decided to sell it.  

I have added the following:

ATI Dragunov Stock
NC Star gas tube
NC Star receiver cover
Murray's firing pin(you need this to avoid slap firing, and misfires)

I left the bayonet on it, because I did not want to machine it off.  It can easily be removed though.  It's honestly a really cool gun.  It looks badass, but I'm just not interested right now.

WILL TRADE    *5 and 1/2 inch Barrel Model*.    Box, paperwork, lock...all of it, just like it came. Gun is in great shape....has two magazines.  Eats everything. Cycles and fires every and all ammo, bulk or otherwise. Is ridiculously accurate. Has the S&W sites and also has the picatinny/weaver optics rail on the top for mounting a magnified, holographic or red-dot type scope...if you choose. Dead accurate if you don't choose.  I have had a 2x -7x  42mm   pistol scope on here and it is deadly and a whole lot of fun.  It's the accuracy of a match grade .22 rifle in the size of a pistol. This isn't the first (early) model 22a, which had only 2 slots/grooves in the top optics rail, this is the newer model with many grooves/slots in the optics rail. This is the revised Sport Series pistol and it is the perfected edition of the S&W 22A.  I am wanting to get a different .22 pistol for a different purpose. I want something smaller but not too small. I have my eye on the Walther p22. That's what my wife can shoot comfortably. It's not as accurate but I would trade the S&W for a Walther p22, but if I do, the Walther has to be reliable. Some of them are outright junk and I won't except that for trade. I will seriously consider one that eats anything and is totaly reliable. Some of the Walther p22's are junk and they do nothing but jam and must be fed CCI mini-mags or higher velocity or they won't operate, while other p22's will eat any ammo that you give them and are pretty much trouble free. I also would consider a GSG 522 if it was trouble free. My gun functions perfect and I would want a trade that has very few hiccups/jams, also.  The GSG .22 rifle looks like it would be fun to take to the range."

UNIQUE REVERSIBLE BACKSTRAP (FLAT OR ARCHED) that allows shooters to quickly; customize the size and feel of the grip, without the use of separate inserts or special tools.

INTEGRAL ACCESSORY MOUNTING RAIL provides space for mounting lights, lasers and other tactical accessories. 

OTHER FEATURES: Though remarkably similar in size to the popular SR9, the SR40’s custom slide design reduces recoil and slide velocity, making it more comfortable to shoot than many of its competitors. 

ALSO FEATURES: Ships with two fifteen-round, flush-fit magazines, magazine loader and hard plastic case.

It's not original to the gun and actually it's not even supposed to be on the gun at all. I removed the screw to find out its sole purpose is to keep the wood stock from bowing away from the receiver. It was an add-on and doesn't do much for it's value.

Based on the information I have, this gun was manufactured between 1924 and 1935.
