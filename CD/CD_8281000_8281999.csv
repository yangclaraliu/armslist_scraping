It is Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

It's also mostly imported from Romania. This is Century, but they barely touched it so it's good. Not like an I.O. or an RAS47. It's not Arsenal level, but it'll do the job it needs to do. Throw 7.62x39mm downrange with the force of a thousand angry Russians.It comes with 2 magazines, one 40rnd and one 30rnd. No failures to feed or anything from either, though I notice some jank with the 40rnd. Works fine at the range but use the 30rnd if you want to rely on it for home defense or something. Also comes with all the 7.62 ammo I have, which is something like 400 rounds.

The S&W Model 1 was the first revolver ever produced by Smith & Wesson, introduced in 1858. It was the first commercially successful cartridge revolver to be made during an era when cap and ball were the norm. Effectively lethal at card table distances, it was extremely popular with officers on both sides of the civil war and later in the frontier west as a vest pocket self-defense weapon. The S&W model 1 is a 7-shot .22 short cartridge black powder pistol. This pair dates to the end of the civil war and shortly after. One was made around 1864, the other in 1868. Also included in this collection is a model 1840 Emerson & Silver Co. NCO officers sword. The hilt has the “10” proof marks stamped on it and the scabbard has the DFM inspectors initials mark. The blade is factory unsharpened. The markings on the hilt were either worn off or intentionally scrubbed off. I have heard that some of these were illicitly sold to the South and had the US markings removed so this could possibly be confederate used.More pics up on the gunbroker listing:https://www.gunbroker.com/item/768068790Asking $1,900 Able to accept cash, debit or credit (No fees).

The ENVIS is USAF approved for flight survival vests. It is a lightweight night vision pocketscope that fits in one hand for direct viewing. It can easily convert a standard still or video camera into a high quality night vision recording device.
