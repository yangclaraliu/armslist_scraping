Trade for:  I was offered several firearms trades, some with cash and the only one that really interested me was an offer for e new Mossberg 500 with two barrels in the box and $250 cash. Unfortunately, that meeting time was being pushed back more and more, so doubt apathy set in.
I would consider a partial trade for a 12g, preferably one with a cantilevered, fully rifled barrel, but open to all except single shot. Would also consider a partial trade for a good 22 revolver, preferably a double action.

And since he wants 5.56 only, and not 223.  we can guess that he has a firearm chambered in 5.56.  well lets see, with the leade in any 5.56 weapon being about .162 and that of a .223 being only .082 to .085 depending on the manufacture, its safe to say that .223 will fire out of a 5.56 chambered weapon, its the other way around that gets people in trouble one in every 35 million rounds unless the gun isn't cleaned.  the only other difference is the thickness in the wall of the casing itself, 5.56 is thicker, leaving slightly less space inside actually creating higher pressure than that of a 223 creating a longer range and slightly flatter shooting round.  its safe to shoot either round out of either weapon.  Not to mention that if the gun was produced in the past 12 years, all 223/5.56 style guns are made to the same standard, its simply how they are labled because people will buy 1 of each thinking they are being safe, 223 modern if you will is technically 5.56 standard, and they are already rolling the rounds over so they will be identical.  

So lets stop trying to trade a $6.60 coin for some ammo, its not silver gold or any other precious metal, its bronze, not even semi-precious in the eyes of the companies that you can buy real precious metals from.  unless he wants to trade me.....10 rounds?  then I'll see if I can sucker someone into buying something worthless on ebay."

I recently acquired an Arsenal AK in 7.62x39 and have no need for two AK rifles. This rifle is in great shape and I have always kept it clean and greased with Mobil 1 synthetic grease (same stuff I use in my Garands).

With this package I also have almost 2000 rounds of 5.45x39 ammunition. It is surplus ammunition, so the rifle should be cleaned after use, but that's a lot of ammo! I also will include 5 bakelite 30 round rebuild kits and an AK47 OD sling. The rifle does come with an installed bullet button to conform with all laws. The metal and wood are both in phenomenal shape.  Local sale only!

Please email for information or if interested. Price listed is non-negotiable and includes everything; rifle, mag rebuilds, sling, ammo."

271,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1408271,For Sale:  Greek Mannlicher Schoenauer Breda 1903/14/27,"Elk Grove, Sacramento, California",$ 450,"Listed On: Saturday, April 6, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Hey all,

My collection is getting a bit weighty (have to shove the safe door to close it), so I decided it's time to sell off one of my rifles.

This is a Greek army Mannlicher Schonauer rifle. Cross of St. George crest along with Y1903/14 clearly displayed on the receiver. None of the numbers on this gun are matching. Serial range is Z501X. Number on buttstock reads H3X54, top of bolt body reads ""18"" and there is an ""09"" on the safety. ""Breda 1927"" clearly visible on side of receiver, although there is some dark pitting in this area.

Circle with St. George cross inside stamped on left side of buttstock. Wording around cross symbol is hard to read but most of the letters can be made out.

There is a ""fletched arrow"" on top of the barrel band as shown in pic.

The bolt head and ejector both have a ""K"" stamped on them.

the number ""88X7(triangle) is stamped on the bolt body at the base of the bolt handle.

There are five-pointed stars stamped on the magazine follower, the underside of the rear sight ramp and the top of the rear sight base, and also on the bolt release.

There is a tiny cross inside a circle stamped on the back of the cocking piece.

This rifle appears to be in fireable condition, although I have never fired it. The metal has some blueing left, although there is extensive light pitting on the bolt body and the left side of the receiver, as well as some light surface rust on the right side receiver just behind the stripper clip guide. Most of the metal has gone over to a brownish patina, verging on purple in some spots. The cleaning rod is missing as is the bayonet. The sights are standard European cloverleaf style, and all the gradation numbers are present and readable on the rear sight ramp. Firing pin protrusion looks good. Bore is very dark, with sharp rifling and heavy frosting in the grooves. The crown is worn but termination of rifling is still visible. The bolt is buttery smooth, smoother than any rifle I have ever handled. Better that a Krag.

Buttstock: The stock is a very deep brown. The buttstock and both upper handguards are the same color. There are numerous scratches and small dents all over the wood, and there is a deep gouge, about the size of a quarter, on the top of the buttstock right by the buttplate. None of the scratches or dents appear to be recent.

Basically this thing has probably been used by the Greek army til WWII, then used by Partisans against the Nazis, then used by some shepherd to shoot at wolves, and the condition reflects that use. I don't know how it ended up here, but there are no import markings. I bought this in a FTF transaction in 2001.

I am selling this rifle, because I prefer to collect guns that I can also shoot, and the ammo for this one is just too hard to find. Also I feel like this gun has earned it's retirement

I would like $450 OBO

Cash FTF or USPS money order preferred, I will ship upon payment clearing. I am located in Sacramento, California.

I am also willing to consider trades of firearms, ammo, or reloading equipment. Please let me know what you have or make an offer. Worst thing that can happen is I say no.

I am willing to ship anywhere in the U.S., insured, cost included with purchase of rifle. I will ship insured USPS Priority Mail. Rifle will ship in a CMP hard case.

I will ship only to a C&R or FFL. I am a C&R holder myself, so I will include a signed copy of my license with the rifle.

Please send me a PM if interested, and thanks for looking.

It always gets cleaned and lubricated after use. Only issue is that it does have some wear on the front of the slide from holstering and carrying, this gun is used.

The Steyr M series pistols are universally loved by those who shoot them. It has a very low bore axis and is superbly ergonomic, making it comfortable to shoot with minimal felt recoil. It also points naturally so aiming becomes quick and instinctive. The trapezoidal sights naturally lead your eye toward the front sight post more quickly and easily than partridge sights.

I went out of my way to find this gun, it is a great alternative to the polymer glock style handguns. If you find glocks to be uncomfortable in your hands you must have this, its sad for me to sell it but i just put an LWRC rifle on lay away and i want to pick it up!

LNIB Winchester 1885 .375 H&H Magnum single shot Hi-Wall falling block rifle. Bluing is flawless as is the beautiful walnut stock. This rifle has had less than 20 rounds through it. It shoots incredibly soft for a .375 H&H Magnum – due to the massive 28” octagon barrel (recoil is not much more than my .30-06). Comes with Leupold rings and bases (over $100 value) also have a set of Weaver bases for it, original box and papers, and 5 and ¼ boxes of ammo (over 100 rounds – $300 value). This is the lightest caliber rlegal for use in hunting Africa’s Big Five and would make an awesome single shot ELK rifle!

I'd really like to trade for a gun, cash on my end. Glocks preferred. Only interested in modern guns for the most part.

Or, I will take $375 shipped (Paypal preferred, but will consider FTF if you're close). Considering it is like new and has the rings installed I think $375 is fair. 

Reasonable offers considered."

It comes with a factory mag, case, all original paperwork and extras. It has fired less than 300 rounds. I had been looking for a Mosquito for my wife as she cannot tolerate the recoil of my XDm 40 but wanted to join in my passion. I mentioned this to my brother told him that if he found a good deal, get it and I would take it. A few days later, he called and told me he had picked up one. This was after I already purchased this one and had a gunsmith check out pistol, polish the feed ramp and true the breech face. I only needed one so I am just trying to get some of my money back. There is nothing mechanically wrong with this pistol as it feeds and shoots great. The only issues found are that some of the digi camo coating in the valley of the rail has been rubbed off. There is also a small spot on the inside of the slide. Both can be seen clearly in the pics. Let me know if you have questions. Face to face only.

AT-47 AK 47 7.62X39
XTREME MFG. AT-47

This rifle was the most interesting to me personally because it was crafted from a Ukrainian parts kit in my home state of Pennsylvania. It has a beautifully machined receiver and barrel and is carefully assembled in the quaint town of Grassflat, Pennsylvania. (They are distributed by ATI in Rochester, NY) Because the receiver is machined from a single billet of steel, it has a slightly different look (although it has the standard Soviet-Bloc wood furniture). Apparently the more precise construction gives this higher barrel pressure and better bullet velocity. It achieved the best 100 yard score (76.50) from the bench. [It is currently priced at $899 MSRP from ATI]

ANECDOTAL:
Broker—While I liked the smooth action, tightly controlled recoil, and accuracy – I thought the stock and grip too small and a bit awkward.

Mac—The good news for my friend is that Xtreme is designing a completely USA crafted AK with an adjustable stock (that’s a story for another day).

Deacon—The all American AK has been a long time coming. Since enactment of Bubba’s infamous assault weapons ban, perfectly good weapons have been mutilated overseas, stripped of the essentials and imported piecemeal to be rebuilt with selected U.S. components to make superior or inferior rifles depending on what side of the argument you choose to take. Having fired Soviet Bloc milled units in the past, I was pleased to see this rifle introduced by Xtreme Mfg.
The inherent greatness of the AK has been its low cost of manufacture, the simplicity of the machines needed to stamp out the parts by the score and readily field a combat ready weapon. Tolerances are loose by design and while this built in “rattle” provides us with a weather proof rifle, it also leaves us wanting for accuracy. The 7.62 X 39mm round has been badly maligned as being inaccurate. It ain’t the round, it’s the marriage of receiver, bolt and chamber that seats the round, properly spaces the projectile and preps it for our hands to send on its way. I have a friend in the North East who has been hunting deer for years

with what he calls “Russian rounds” from a Savage bolt action with a Douglas Barrel he had chambered for the 39mm. He takes a ribbing for using the stuff but everyone enjoys his venison stew and that’s where the laughter stops.
It seems from all objective results that Xtreme has tightened tolerances and given us a solid receiver that will shoot on par with any AR upper chambered in the same round. If they pass on importing foreign furniture and sights and build entirely from U.S. components we’ll all benefit.
Made in America. You have to love that. Sure there is room for improvement but the folks at Extreme are listening to the guys in the field and tweaking as I write.Gun Reports Home >> Special Reports

The Remington Golden Saber High Performance Jacket is designed for law enforcement and personal defense and successfully combines match-type accuracy, deep penetration, maximum expansion and near 100% weight retention. This handgun ammunition is built around the hollow-point bullet design and the spiral nose-cut feature permits mushrooming at lower velocity without sacrificing penetration or terminal performance. The High Performance Jacket is made entirely of cartridge brass, which releases energy over longer distances while mushrooming. The cases are nickel plated for reliable feed, function and extraction. Primer and mouth waterproofing are standard.

This rifle was the most interesting to me personally because it was crafted from a Ukrainian parts kit in my home state of Pennsylvania. It has a beautifully machined receiver and barrel and is carefully assembled in the quaint town of Grassflat, Pennsylvania. (They are distributed by ATI in Rochester, NY) Because the receiver is machined from a single billet of steel, it has a slightly different look (although it has the standard Soviet-Bloc wood furniture). Apparently the more precise construction gives this higher barrel pressure and better bullet velocity. It achieved the best 100 yard score (76.50) from the bench. REDACTED"
