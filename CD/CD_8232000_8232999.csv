The P320 X-Five 9mm incorporates all of the most important features to maximize accuracy, shootability and ergonomics while maintaining the modularity of the standard P320 platform. The X-Series grip module is exclusive to this line and features a deeper trigger guard undercut, a higher back strap and an extended beavertail to ensure a higher grip for better recoil management. It also comes standard with a removable grip weight for improved balance, as well as a removable magazine funnel and extended slide catch lever to facilitate faster reloads. Like all X-Series P320s, the X-Five has the straight trigger that breaks at 90 degrees for an even better feeling pull. The 5"" bull barrel and lightened slide pair perfectly for match-grade accuracy and are equipped with Dawson Precision® Fiber Optic front and fully-adjustable rear sights. Additionally, the rear sight plate can be easily removed as a unit and replaced with a ROMEO1 optic, which means every P320 X-Five pistol is optics-ready right out of the box. Each P320 X-Five includes four (4) 21rd steel magazines."

The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

FN Forty-Nine is a modern service handgun, intended primary for police/security use.
It is recoil-operated, locked breech firearm that uses improved Browning linkless locking principle. The gun is striker fired, and unlike many other striker-fired guns, like Glocks, Forty-Nine is a true DAO gun, with availability of re-striking the misfired cartridge simply with another trigger pull. The striker is completely at rest until the trigger is pulled, so gun is safe. It has no external safety switches or decockers for simplicity and readiness to use.
The frame of the gun is made from black polymer, the slide is made from stainless steel. Gun also has accessory rail on the frame under the barrel, for quick and easy mounting of the laser designators and flashlights.
