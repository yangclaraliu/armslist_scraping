I just got two of these finally, and only have use for one right now. I've got the other one built in a AR15 pistol. I installed a partial Rguns lower parts kit. It has the safety selector, fire control group, pistol grip, and front pin installed. I have the rear pin, spring, and detent.

Has exactly 10 rounds of 45 and 2 round of 410 bird shot through it for a function/accuracy test. Since it has a rifled barrel, it spreads evenly up to about 10 yards. After that, it continues to spread like a normal shotgun. Buck shot and slugs will go well past 10 yards. 

I originally bought it for a trip to Texas. Plans changed and I ended up not using it. Would be a great truck/car defense gun, snake gun, home defense gun, etc. Not to mention, 410 and 45 colt are among the few calibers readily available still. If you look enough, you can find it for $6 a box- cheaper than 9mm, 40 cal, 45 acp, etc. 

This model was $649 at the Nashville Armory this past weekend. $599 on sale at another gun shop in Nashville. I've gotten several cash offers already... please, trades only.

This rifle was the most interesting to me personally because it was crafted from a Ukrainian parts kit in my home state of Pennsylvania. It has a beautifully machined receiver and barrel and is carefully assembled in the quaint town of Grassflat, Pennsylvania. (They are distributed by ATI in Rochester, NY) Because the receiver is machined from a single billet of steel, it has a slightly different look (although it has the standard Soviet-Bloc wood furniture). Apparently the more precise construction gives this higher barrel pressure and better bullet velocity. It achieved the best 100 yard score (76.50) from the bench."

If you require any additional info from me I will be happy to provide.

I'd like to start with a message to the people who whine and cry daily in personal ads which are nothing more than a soap box for their unstable emotions and personal opinion...go to school and take economics 101. Boxes of .22, 223, and 9mm wouldnt be selling at what you feel are inflated prices if we could all walk into a store and buy unlimited amounts of ammo or order it online at 2012 prices. This isnt a local issue. Do you complain about gold prices and does anybody listen or care about your personal opinion? Would you feel better if I sold my 223, .45, .40, 9mm, and .22 for gas money and lose out on making a little profit or would you prefer that I just give it to you for free? Get real and grow up! Things will get better and the market will stabilize before you know it. I strongly suggest thay you prepare and stock up for the next time this happens. 

AMMO FOR SALE:

***500 round bricks of .22 for $50

***1,000 rounds of 9mm for $450.00. 

***500 rounds of .40 S&W $275.00

Call me a price gouger and go cry to somebody who cares about how you didnt stock up in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 but please do not waste your time complaining to me. I paid for the ammo plus tax from my hard earned pay checks. You want 2011 prices but you seem to forget about taxes we all paid and the smart investment that we made. Be prepared next time. You know who I'm talking about! 

Real buyers feel free to contact me and we can talk about pricing options and negotiate like people do in a free market and in a free country. I would consider shipping if you pay extra for shipping, my paypal fees, and my time. My prices are not firm. Thanks!

Brand new in box, unfired. These are $409 plus tax at the store I got it from. there's nothing wrong with the gun, it's just not what i need at the moment!

This gun gets really good reviews everywhere online, i suggest checking some of them out. I have no doubt that this is a good, reliable gun. Comparisons found it to be as reliable, or even more reliable than the Glock 9mm that it is VERY similar to. (Glock sued S&W for the sigma design that this gun was derived from). The SD9ve is said to improve upon Smith and Wesson's Sigma and SW9 pistols, the predecessors to this gun. 

I've heard people gripe about the trigger, but this is the newest iteration of the pistol with the best trigger. It was the Sigmas and SW9s that had the stiff, rough trigger pull. It's fairly heavy (called a ""self-defense"" trigger, i think it's about 8lbs. if i remember correctly) but not so heavy it's hard to shoot. I personally like it, as do others i know who own SD9VEs. Serves as a safety feature as this gun is meant to be carried loaded for self defense. Great for a CCW if you want something you can fit your whole hand on. Stainless slide and black polymer frame.

Includes two 16 round original mags, a cable lock, original box and paperwork (everything that comes with it brand new!). Made in the USA!

Open to trades and cash offers- I paid $409 plus tax, but i realize i won't get all of that out of reselling the gun. That said, i see no reason to take a large loss on the gun- i'm not desperate for the money. i just want to see what else is out there! Thanks for looking!

Its a 3″ 20ga with a 26″ smooth bore barrel with a modified choke, and an extended turkey choke ($40 alone). I also have a saddle so you can mount a scope on it for turkey hunting.
2nd barrel is a cantilever rifled barrel with 2-7×32 Bushnell scope included.
The gun is laminated wood and comes with a synthetic shurshot pistol grip as well which you cannot find anymore. The Shurshot grip converts this gun into a true deer and turkey gun. You can switch to the regular stock when hunting everything else like upland bird, small game and waterfowel!
They sell the 12 or 20 ga combo for about $500+ tax = $565 without a scope and the rifled barrel has iron sights. A cantilever barrel is $300 plus over &100 for a cheap scope. The saddle you can mount for turkey is over $60 alone. Sureshot stock is $80. Well Over $1100 spent. This is a deal for anyone who wants an all in one shotgun with low recoil."

I WILL NOT SHIP OUT OF STATE, LOCAL SALE ONLY.

This is a late 1957 Smith and Wesson .44magnum (4 screw) prior to the 1957/1958 ""model"" designation. This is NOT A MODEL 29, but one of the .44mags produced between 1955 and 1957. The current grips are from a 60s-80s Model 29. The firearm is in good condition, and has safely and very accurately fired 300 rounds during my ownership. At 10 yards, all 6 shots in single action end up making one very big hole.

Condition- There is some holster wear on the end of the muzzle and at the crane/frame. There is some discoloration of the bluing on the barrel, but nothing that is noticeable unless you place the firearm under light. In the photos there are some scuff marks and in the barrel photo there is some residue. The firearm was coated in Riggs firearm grease for storage and has not been cleaned yet (as it remains in storage). 

What is included in the price-

Pre-29 .44magnum with model 29 grips on gun.

Second set of new production SW N frame target grips (2012) valued at $70 dollars (to order from site)

The Model 63 is single or Double Action and fires
22 Long Rifle, making it quite affordable to use. It is an ideal gun to teach with, having low noise and negligible recoil. It also is fun and affordable to shoot.
The new Model 63 weighs of 28.3 oz, has an excellent fully adjustable J-frame rear sight, a black front sight, and the S&W key lock system, which locks the hammer from movement. This feature is useful in those jurisdictions where the law requires it, or to anyone who wants to secure the gun from unauthorized use.
The Model 63 is built on S&W’s smallest frame; the round-butt J-frame. It makes for a very handy, yet reliable, rugged, and accurate revolver. The single action trigger pull is typical Smith & Wesson; a crisp 2 lbs, thirteen ounces. The double action is very smooth, and measures just under eleven pounds. The round-butt finger groove hard
rubber grip is very comfortable."
