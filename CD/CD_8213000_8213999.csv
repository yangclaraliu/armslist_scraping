Once fired Lake City brass fully processed and ready to reload. We go the extra mile to ensure that you are receiving the highest quality brass available for reloading. Our brass is sourced from US Military ranges from ammunition made at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant. All brass is hand inspected, cleaned, de-primed, fully swaged to remove the military crimp, sized and trimmed using carbide cutters to meet SAAMI Specifications. All brass is cleaned twice using stainless steel media to fully clean primer pockets and flash holes.

If requested, we can ship cases fully primed for an additional fee. 
All cases are shipped USPS priority delivery, flat rate for $14.95 additional to sell price.

This is from our final QA inspection process to indicate cases that have been pulled and final checked for specifications before shipping. The blue dye is Dykem which is a machinist dye that adds no material thickness and does not interfere with the reloading process.

The front sight is a green fiber optic. The pistol is chambered in 22lr comes with 2 10 round magazines. The end of the muzzle is threaded 1/2x28. The mk 4 is famous for the Simplicity of taking it apart if you've ever tried to take apart a mark 2 or Mark 3 and somebody told you they can do it without cussing and swearing they're probably lying or really really really really really good at it with the Mark 4 you leave the magazine in the gun put the safety on then press the button in the rear and it lifts up for easy access to clean. And then when you're done you just snap it back into place. You can text me at REDACTED or email me.300 Blackout 18in Wilson Combat Barrel .Upper build 300This is a bill that I did about 2 years ago I probably have less than a hundred rounds through it it was super accurate with 120gr Nosler ballistic tips but that was reloading I was getting half inch groups at a hundred yards if even that. Now I know I don't have a picture on here Armslist has this rule one gun one picture but if you are interested I will email or text you a photo it's a standard stripped A3 upper with a 02 light 15 and 1/2 inch handguard with a silencerco ASR muzzle brake the thing feels like it weighs 3 lb and when you shoot it there is absolutely no recoil. I will include the bolt carrier group and charging handle. Even if you're not into the 300 blk for a hundred bucks you can pick up a two to three barrel and have yourself a really nice light upper

Advances in manufacturing allow Springfield to take the XD(M)® series to a whole new level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, Springfield Armory® created what’s become one of the most popular polymer pistols on the market. The angle and depth of each contour in the XDM grip has been calculated for maximized control and usability, and the new trigger has the shortest travel of any polymer pistol currently available along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. Your total XD(M)® experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. the rugged Multi-Use Carrying Case is as durable as the XD(M)® it houses. Springfield XDM Features Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.   (M)ould-Tru Backstraps: With the three interchangeable backstraps, Springfield has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.   (M)ulti-Adjust Rail System™: A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter’s hand position.   (M)elonite®: Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

I believe in being fully upfront with everything I know about a product I'm selling. The gun for sale is the second TP9SA I have owned. The first one went back home to Century Arms twice. The first time was for stove pipes, failure to feed, failure to eject. I sent it back, where the springs were replaced, things were poked on and ""fixed"", and had it back in a few weeks’ time.   Hoping it was now all I had read this gun could be, I eagerly took it out to the range. It was now an ejecting son-of-a-gun! The problem now was that it was ejecting straight into my forehead. Ever had a hot 9mm casing get lodged between your glasses and your skin? Not fun.   So back it went again. This time, I got an entirely new gun out of the deal. Took it out yesterday, and got about what I expected. Overall, its better. It jams maybe once every 10-20 shots on average, and more or less ejects to the side, although it will throw a few at your head. Yes I know you’re supposed to put at least 400 rounds through it before it settles in, but I’m just done with it. I've had enough, and I’m looking to move to something else, hence the low price.  Aside from the gun, I’ll throw in the last 50 or so 9mm rounds I have left. Are you a gunsmith? Know a good one? Feel like dealing with Canik? This may be the right gun at the right price for you. The original warranty is not transferable, but I haven’t registered this gun with them yet; you may be able to.   Please reach out with any questions, and thanks for looking."

Custom G34 (9mm) with the Dragonfly slide.  I have replaced the Zev barrel with a Storm Lake 6” ported barrel (six ports).  I decided to leave in the Glock OEM trigger components for reliability. There is stippling along the frame where needed and it is not overly aggressive.  Honestly, it is just right.  The slide is also pre-milled for a Trijicon RMR micro red dot sight.  Sights are Zev’s own with blacked out rear, pushed all the way to the rear of the slide and a front red fiber optic.  Both front and rear sights have serrations to break up any glare.
Pistol is used but certainly not abused with about 500 rounds through it…just lots of dry firing and draws from the holster.  Finish on the slide is impeccable and there is no wear on the frame.  Comes with one OEM 17 round magazine.
This pistol is highly customized and ready for 2 and 3-gun matches (or just about anything else for that matter) as is, though there are plenty of other changes one could make.  It’s nice to have options.  Pistol with upgrades costs on the order of $2000 and they sell new for this price all day, every day (see here: https://www.omahaoutdoors.com/zev-g34-g3-17-gun-dfly-dlc)."

510,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8213510,For Sale:  World war 2 Japanese Type 2 Rifle,"Clarksville, Clarksville, Tennessee","$ 2,250","Listed On: Monday, April 9, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For your consideration is this Japanese type 2 Paratrooper Rifle. The primary difference between this rifle and the Type 99 was the fact that it had a bolt that locked the two pieces into place rather than being made of a single piece. The purpose for this was to allow the Japanese paratroopers to carry them in a bag while they jumped and then piece it together on the ground. There were only 24000 of these types of rifles made throughout the duration of the war. Compare this to the millions of K98s, M1 Garands, Nagants, and even T99s and you can understand why it’s a unique bird. The rifle still has a full imperial Chrysanthemum as well as it’s original anti aircraft sites. Both halves Match however the bolt is ~50 numbers off from the remainder of the rifle. This is commonly seen on rifles brought back from the Pacific Campaigns as it was common procedures to confiscate the bolt while in transit back to the states. Once back they often just grabbed a random bolt assembly from a large group of readily available ones. This rifle displays well and will be a great addition to any advanced World War 2 firearm collection. I can send additional detailed pictures upon request. Will consider trades for an original WW2 era German Luger or other WW2 era firearms"

Found in shed of property I bought. Looks like its never been fired, and that's probably a good thing because its a plastic rifle. No rust on the metal parts, and looks brand new, but most of it is plastic. Looks like they tried to make it look like wood grain, but didnt do a great job. Now I'm beginning to see why Remington went out of business. I had the box, but my wife was afraid it was full of spiders, so we threw it away. I feel guilty for even trying to sell it because with Remington out of business, you'll probably never find parts for it. It might make a nice wall hanger if you put it up real high in low light so folks can't tell its plastic, or you could take the firing pin out of it and let the grandkids play with it. I feel bad even putting a price on it, but I figure it's worth 25 bucks for the time it took to write this ad. Price firm, no low-ballers. If anyone knows about this old rifle, please let me know."
