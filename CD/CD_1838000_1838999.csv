I own another Superior Arms AR that's identical to this one, and it is a fantastic rifle!

This particular rifle was acquired as part of another deal, so I have not fired it myself. But looking it over it appears to have been fired very little, maybe less than 200 rds. It is clean, in like-new condition. I would have thought it was new myself until I noticed the SLIGHT wear on the bolt carrier.

Lock-up of the upper to lower receiver is TIGHT (usually an indicator of quality of fit and accuracy).

I am selling it for $950 OBO together with carry handle and an Aimpoint CompM4 clone. If you don't want the carry handle, I'll knock $40 off the price.

The Aimpoint is a clone and not the real deal, but it LOOKS EXACTLY like the real thing. It came on another rifle, and while I prefer a real Aimpoint (of course), I did use it for a couple of trips to the range, and it worked fine!

Sorry, but the 30-rd mag in the pics is not included thanks to the liberal gun haters and their pointless law.

Of course, now this will have to be sold in compliance with the new background check law.  I have a dealer I prefer to work with in the Littleton area, so give me a call at (720) ONE-SHOT or shoot me an email and let's make arrangements."

The scope remains mounted on the upper receiver, maintaining scope zero. the rifle’s M1913 optics rail has a 27 MOA taper to take full advantage of the scope’s elevation travel.Barrett BORS System:This constantly adapting ballistics computer puts science at your fingertips. From environmental factors to the angle of your rifle, BORS instantly takes care of the data work so you can focus on the task of putting lead on target.The Barrett Optical Ranging System (BORS) is an integrated ballistics computer that mounts directly on the riflescope and couples to the elevation knob. drawing from thousands of tables and taking into account a number of real-time external factors, it automatically gives the shooter the exact yardage at which a bullet will hit. In other words, it’s like having an army of ballisticians behind every shot.Once the distance to the target has been estimated, the computer can be put into action by simply turning the elevation knob until the LCD displays the target’s range.
Three internal sensors automatically calculate the ballistic solution. BORS compensates for temperature, change in barometric pressure and aiming at an upward or downward angle. BORS even determines if the rifle is canted.The BORS kit includes the proprietary Barrett Ballistic Software* that’s pre-programmed with a library selected by Barrett. It also includes a BORS data cable that allows the user to program custom loads on a personal computer and transfer them directly to BORS.No Trade and payment must be PayPal or Check.."

The Sig Sauer P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of
the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The
P250 is available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP,
380ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove
the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice.
This allows an immediate change in caliber and size (subcompact, compact
and full). After any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy
and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible
ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating
different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for
each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.
The 250 modular shooting system is globally-engineered to deliver the
reliability one would expect from Sig Sauer.

(NO MANUAL SAFETY/DECOCKING LEVER) The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing full power loads. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability. Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

It is the commercial model and has Brittish proof stampingson the slide, receiver, and barrel. My best guess it that it was a private purchase and the person joined the Canadian military early in the war and went to England that route. 

The gun it self is in good shape, the barrel is not shot out. The finish is probably an older reblue, all markings look great and crisp. There is a very light pittig spot on rhe slide. At somepoint Iin its life some one added vintage target sights. The slide was not altered and originals could be reinstalled. I am not sure about the magazine if it is original to the gun. The pictures should answer any other questions. I have more photos.

I have no problem with a bill of sale and am a CCW holder. Thank you for looking and have a great day"

The term ""longrifle"" (or long rifle) refers to a type of rifle used by civilians and the military. It is characterized by an unusually long barrel, which is felt to be in large part a unique development of American rifles, and was uncommon in European rifles of the same period.

Kentucky long rifles played an intricate  part in American history. These rifles were known for their accuracy and were used in the Revolutionary war, War of 1812, Mexican American War & Civil War and the French Indian wars alike. Additionally, many were carried by early pioneers for hunting and protection.

This rifle is a one of a kind and has original hand carvings in the stock making this quite the conversation piece. It has the markings of ""Golcher"" and it's a 40-45 caliber

This is indeed a long rifle! At 5'2"" long this antiquated percussion cap rifle will look great in your collection or above your fire place for that ultimate rustic look!

Please note: It reads the caliber at ""300 blackout (7.62x35mm)"" at the top of the page. For some reason I am unable to remove this?  the caliber of the gun mentioned above is 40-45 cal

This is a super high performance 45 GAP loading and gives the 45 GAP some serious muscle. The long-for-weight all copper Barnes bullet will penetrate deeply for such a light bullet and will give low recoil, which aids in fast follow-up shots. Expect roughly 12 to 14 inches of penetration in living flesh and bone.

This load utilizes a flash suppressed powder, which gives the shooter an important advantage as most shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is most active. Firing to save your life in the dark is likely if you find yourself forced to fire at all. Blinding yourself with your first shot, leaves you very vulnerable.

As always, we have used real world pistols to generate our advertised velocities. We feel the industry wide duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory barrels to determine advertised velocities is dishonest to the customer as he/she will not be able to reproduce such false high velocities in the real world, where it matters."

I recently purchased a SA Lightweight Champion Operator. This is an OFF CA Roster firearm, however is perfectly legal to transfer to anyone in CA.

The gun is bran new in box with not a single round fired at all. It comes will original box, papers, 5 magazines ( 2 seven round mags, and 3 eight round mags ) I have decided to let the gun go as I have my eyes on something else. I had to pay extra to obtain this firearms out of state and legally register it here in CA. This is how I have established my asking price. The gun is an amazing piece and not having a single round fired is a steel of a deal. It comes with a factory holster and dual mag pouch. I am including some pictures from SA's website, and 1 picture that I took recently. This gun has a 4 inch barrel and is AWESOME FOR concealed carry. Gun also comes standard with TRIJICON night sights! big time plus!! :) 

Price is firm. I know that this gun will not last long and someone will take it off my hands seeing that it is an off roster 1911, that is NOT EASY TO COME BY! 

Feel free to text Bryan anytime with any questions or if you would like some more pictures. (714) nine 1 three 3152. 

The only trade I would consider is a SIG P220R Carry or FULL size SIG p220 in same condition, used is fine too, however I will be asking for cash on top on your end. 

PRICE IS $1,400.00 if you think you can get this cheaper in California, please don't tell me about it. I know none of us like our price being beaten down as an attempt to get a lower price. 

Thanks for looking any questions feel free to ask guys Bryan."

I purchased this gun for a female friend.  She's intimidated by it and I already have several 9mm's so I am selling it.  It's a great little gun.  Nice sights, feels good in your hand, multiple safety features, configures as both a compact and full size depending on magazine used and it shoots well.  Of course, the laser makes it relatively fool proof.  Put the red dot on your target and squeeze, the gun will do the rest.  Face to face, cash only sale.  I will not ship."

Great little pistol for those wanting a small pocket carry and/or have hand strength issues and can't operate a traditional slide.  The flip up barrel allows the loading of the first round easily.  Same style as the Beretta Bobcat guns.

Thank you for looking. Please no email about your opinions on price. I really don't need or care to hear about what a great price your cousin's neighbor found at a gun store in whatever city. If there is some great deal you know about, then buy it. If my price isn't right for you, then simply move on. If you want a new, quality firearm with the privacy of a transaction with another private citizen, then this might be the firearm for you."

Cash only, Face-to-face transaction required, must be 21 years old, legally allowed to own a firearm. Many people prefer to buy from private citizens vs. a gun store for various reasons, including privacy. My obligation is to be reasonably assured you are legally allowed to own a firearm.

Thank you for looking. Please no email about your opinions on price. I really don't need or care to hear about what a great price your cousin's neighbor found at a gun store in whatever city. If there is some great deal you know about, then buy it. If my price isn't right for you, then simply move on. If you want the best deal ever, then drive to every gun store in a 100 mile radius and then try Gunbroker.com and various others. If you want a new, quality firearm with the privacy of a transaction with another private citizen, then this might be the firearm for you."

Comes with one 24 round magazine, and all wood furniture.

This thing is sweet, but unfortunately I'm in need of the money so I'm selling it for $400 firm!

GSG is the only company currently licensed by Mr. Mikhail Kalashnikov (Original inventor of the AK-47) to make functional firearms, and they take this reponsibility seriously.

These rifles function and disassemble almost exactly like the ""big boy"" 7.62x39 versions of these rifles, so they make great trainers/learners/backups. 

Not only is the 7.62 far more expensive than the .22lr cartridge, but at least locally for me .22LR is a lot easier to find.

I will throw in 100 rounds of HV .22LR with the AK at the full asking price of $400 firm!"

Thank you for looking. Please no email about your opinions on price. I really don't need or care to hear about what a great price your cousin's neighbor found at a gun store in whatever city. If there is some great deal you know about, then buy it. If my price isn't right for you, then simply move on. If you want the best deal ever, then drive to every gun store in a 100 mile radius and then try Gunbroker.com and various others. If you want a new, quality firearm with the privacy of a transaction with another private citizen, then this might be the firearm for you."

The hour meter says 2300, but I pulled the valve cover to make sure the rack was free before starting, and it looked new in there, not just clean. Takes 29gallons of oil and 130 gallons of coolant, all fuel looks good. Has a 70gallon integrated tank, and weighs about 6500lbs. It is currently on my trailer, which is very stuck in my yard. A telehandler will be needed to remove it, and place on your trailer. I can get one up here to do that, but will need a non-refundable deposit in order to do that since it'll cost around $500.
I would like to get $3500 for the generator, loaded on your truck/trailer in Poulsbo, WA. I can get a 20' flatbed in and out of here with my truck's horrible turning radius, and a previous resident got a dump truck and backhoe trailer in and out so access isn't bad. The generator is 3'w x 6't x 10'l, so it'll fit on a 7k rated trailer of just about any size.

Unlike some other more fickle rifles (ARs) this will gobble and .308/7.62x51 you feed it - from hunting/match grade to Russian.

Thank you for looking. Please no email about your opinions on price. I really don't need or care to hear about what a great price your cousin's neighbor found at a gun store in whatever city. If there is some great deal you know about, then buy it. If my price isn't right for you, then simply move on. If you want a quality firearm with the privacy of a transaction with another private citizen, then this might be the firearm for you."

I have a very clean Stoeger M2000 TACTICAL. This is the cheaper set-up of the Benelli M2 Tactical, and uses the same inertia system. I have installed a aftermarket improved actuator (charging handle), which is a whole lot easier to get ahold of. Very sweet gun for the price, and half that of the Benelli. Prefer FTF."
