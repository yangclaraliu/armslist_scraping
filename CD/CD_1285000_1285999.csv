Introducing the XD-S. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers
all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.
At only 1""  wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry
strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag
pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a
top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and
usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S,
the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol.
Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be
inserted into the pistol.

The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
FACTS:
You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
The permit is valid for 5 years
We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

This is one of the ""Original"" Kimbers... and most Kimber guys will tell you, that these were the best in terms of quality in 1911 (far better than the Kimbers of today, which are awesome). The newer Kimbers are still great but, like I said, most folks who know about these pistols agree that the early originals were far and away, the best. The only reason, this one was picked to sell, and I mean the only reason.... is because I NEVER shoot it. I am getting no use out of it as it just sits in the safe. I think its to pretty to shoot... lol!

For sale is an Original Kimber Classic Stainless with lots of extras! I am the second owner of the pistol and I personally have only shot a total of 5 rounds out of her. She is a true safe queen! The previous owner had shot only 300 rounds total (for you non-math guys that 305 total rounds ever fired out of this pistol)... This pistol is very much Minty and the Barrel is 100% perfect! I would classify this pistol overall as 97%

This Classic Stainless comes with the original Kimber box/plastic blue bag/and paper work! The pistol has had the sights changed out to make it that much better! As it sits it has Adjustable Dawson rear sights with a Dawson F/O front sight! It has a Wilson Combat extended mag release and a Wilson Combat Magwell and Mainspring Housing! All nice upgrades for this pistol! Additionally, this was sent back to the Kimber custom shop for a full tune including trigger job that breaks like glass right 2.8- 3lbs (better than both my Gold Match and Team Match Kimber pistols)... really, its flawless! They also put a light 500 buff on the flats of the side to set it off and give it that custom look most folks want in a Kimber! To add to that, I will include 4 1911 magazines for this baby! I have at least 30 pics of this pistol broken down from every angle you would want! Let me know if you would like additional pics... Honestly, you don't need them, the pistol is just that nice!

I am asking $1450.00 for the package (I will not separate), which is as fair as you are going to find one with the add on's, features, and condition! The original Kimbers are very hard to find these days and to get a safe queen in this condition is nearly impossible! I am FIRM on this one so lets not waste time with offers.  I have it priced to sell and set at what I am willing to take.  Additionally, don't bother with the trades... Again, dont waste your time with Nagant, SKS, or any panic prices of 12 dollar Pmags.  There is 100% no interest on my end!! 

I am in no hurry to let this one go and if I must, its going to be on the terms and price I have listed above.  If I can not sell locally, well... no problem, I will just throw it on Gunbroker and I will get what I want out of it there! I always like to give good local folks first crack at what I have though!"

I have for sale a brand new, never fired ""Draco"".  It's an AK-47 pistol that shoots normal ak47 ammo and accepts normal ak-47 magazines.  Power of a rifle in a pistol platform.

This Draco has been duracoated and the wood has been refinished.

Century Arms stopped importing these over a year and a half ago so the value will only go up.  This is also an Off-roster gun so I cannot ship it unless you are law enforcement or an licensed gun dealer.

VERY RARE.  Show it off.  Shoot it. Keep it.  Never sell it.  Value will only go up.

Yours for only $1499"

Pistol is in like new/mint condition showing no wear (99%).  And yes, it has the hex bolt through the receiver above the trigger assembly.  

WHAT IS INCLUDED:  The P1 pistol with 6 magazines (holds 8-rounds each), several additional new recoil springs (different poundage settings) and a black tactical carrying case.

OTHER INFORMATION:  For those not familiar with the Walter P1, it is virtually the same pistol (but manufactured with an aluminum frame) as the famous WW II German P38 pistol.  This particular model (my copy that I'm selling) is a tack-driver of a pistol - exceptionally accurate and a pleasure to shoot.  I've put approximately 100 rounds through it and was keeping it as a collector's issue (I originally had two, sold one and was going to keep this one).  This pistol can compete with the best of the modern day models.

REASON FOR SELLING:  I'm a retired Marine, cutting back on my collection of pistols and rifles.  Here's a chance for somebody to own a superbly firing piece of history.

PRICE:  $450 USD (Cash only - no checks or trades please).  

METHOD OF SALE:  I prefer a local sale and potential buyers must have a valid Pistol Permit (that has not expired), and/or a valid Concealed Carry Permit.  We would then fill out a formal bill of sale and I'd make copies of your Drivers License and Pistol Permit and or Concealed Carry Permit.  NOTE:  If this is an out of state sale, you will pay for shipping up front and I will only ship to an FFL Dealer.

METHOD OF CONTACT:  The best way to contact me (quickly) is to call my mobile at REDACTED anytime between 9 AM and 10 PM EST daily (I live just south of Raleigh, NC off of highway 401S).

This is one of the ""Original"" Kimbers... and most Kimber guys will tell you, that these were the best in terms of quality in 1911 (far better than the Kimbers of today, which are awesome). The newer Kimbers are still great but, like I said, most folks who know about these pistols agree that the early originals were far and away, the best. The only reason, this one was picked to sell, and I mean the only reason.... is because I NEVER shoot it. I am getting no use out of it as it just sits in the safe. I think its to pretty to shoot... lol!

For sale is an Original Kimber Classic Stainless with lots of extras! I am the second owner of the pistol and I personally have only shot a total of 5 rounds out of her. She is a true safe queen! The previous owner had shot only 300 rounds total (for you non-math guys that 305 total rounds ever fired out of this pistol)... This pistol is very much Minty and the Barrel is 100% perfect! I would classify this pistol overall as 97%

This Classic Stainless comes with the original Kimber box/plastic blue bag/and paper work! The pistol has had the sights changed out to make it that much better! As it sits it has Adjustable Dawson rear sights with a Dawson F/O front sight! It has a Wilson Combat extended mag release and a Wilson Combat Magwell and Mainspring Housing! All nice upgrades for this pistol! Additionally, this was sent back to the Kimber custom shop for a full tune including trigger job that breaks like glass right 2.8- 3lbs (better than both my Gold Match and Team Match Kimber pistols)... really, its flawless! They also put a light 500 buff on the flats of the side to set it off and give it that custom look most folks want in a Kimber! To add to that, I will include 4 1911 magazines for this baby! I have at least 30 pics of this pistol broken down from every angle you would want! Let me know if you would like additional pics... Honestly, you don't need them, the pistol is just that nice!

I am asking $1450.00 for the package (I will not separate), which is as fair as you are going to find one with the add on's, features, and condition! The original Kimbers are very hard to find these days and to get a safe queen in this condition is nearly impossible! I am FIRM on this one so lets not waste time with offers. I have it priced to sell and set at what I am willing to take. Additionally, don't bother with the trades... Again, dont waste your time with Nagant, SKS, or any panic prices of 12 dollar Pmags. There is 100% no interest on my end!! 

I am in no hurry to let this one go and if I must, its going to be on the terms and price I have listed above. If I can not sell locally, well... no problem, I will just throw it on Gunbroker and I will get what I want out of it there! I always like to give good local folks first crack at what I have though!"

So I recently met an older war vet in a gunshop. He had a Smith 66 no dash that I just had to have because it was sorta rough and would make an excellent shooter. Well time comes to buy it and he says I'll only sell it if you buy this 19. I was excited to have two k frame shooters until I looked at the model 19-5.

He proceeds to tell me that another war vet buddy of his put 6 rounds through it and then stored it away. As I open the original box I found this

Grips: Not a single scratch or blemish. The checkering is so sharp it feels like stippling on a polymer wonder. It also has the original quality control sticker on the bottom of the grips.

Blueing: Absolutely amazing and I cant find a single flaw anywhere. No scratches! Its so nice I took off my wedding band to handle it.

Lockup: The cylinder doesn't move at all.

Turn Line: Doesn't have one.

Extras: It come with the original box, original cleaning kit, 6 ol skool CCI 357 Mag rounds, misc Smith paperwork.

If you love old Smiths, collect, or just want a badass 6 inch 19-5 this is for you. It's just to nice for me, I prefer tools so if they get scratched who cares. I mean this thing is sexy.

I will have pictures up asap.

Please be 21+ and have a valid I.D. I would also prefer it you have a valid permit to purchase/permit to carry, for peace of mind more than anything. That's not a definite deal breaker, but if you come up to me with a sniffly nose and the shakes, you can bet I'll turn you away. In other words, no shady characters...

This company is different from the Remington we all know. They made these 1911's specifically for WWII from 1942 - 1945. This particular one was made in 1945. The side is stamped with ""united States Property"" and ""US Army"". All markings in frame and slide are correct. The pistol is in amazing condition and was probably never even issued. Also comes with the US issued military leather holster that is in very good condition. A very neat fact about this gun/company was that the Chief of Research and Development for Remington Rand was the leader of the Manhattan Project which for those of you who don't know, was the project that designed and invented the atom bomb! Now that's a neat piece of history! Ive pasted a link to the most similar item like mine that sold on Gunbroker. I think mine is in better condition and mines comes with the holster. The one on GB did not. That being said, the price is firm and is a great deal. http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?"

Now on to what comes with it. The gun will come with 11 30 rd mags, 1 Pmag, 6 Israeli polymer mags (very nice) and 4 USGI mags with grey followers, and I am also throwing in 500 Rounds of Hornady .223 ammo, all new un opened, and all brass FMJ. Again this is not some over inflated gouged price, and I certainly didnt buy this with the intentions of selling for profit.  Please be reasonable with your offers, low balls will be ignored. Can send pics on request, but I promise its brand new and looks no different than the pics you will find online."

It will come with everything you see in the pics including the 5 - 30 round magazines that are new in wrapper... The reason there are two grease gun lowers is because one is built in with the pistol grip and the other utilizes the factory stock.

It has two Grease Gun Lower Receivers (shown below) and the factory lower.  One of the Grease Gun lowers is aluminum and the other is polymer (like the factory USC lower).

I have never shot it and I am selling to fund other projects.

I have had a few people ask me so I will add this into the for sale ad. These lowers and conversion kits require minimal, if any, fitting. Mine are pretty much drop in. If you have any specific questions feel free to ask.




I know the process of selling a firearm over state lines and if needed I can ship to your FFL from my FFL for the cost of my transfer (I will pay shipping...).  So this is a deal that extends beyond Texas.

Methods of payment are Paypal, Certified Cashiers Check, or Cash for face to face, and can be discussed further in email.

I am asking $2,650 shipped to your FFL for this new set up. This is a good price since these range from (with less accessories) $2,500-$4,000+....

I am pretty firm in the price. Reasonable offers can be considered and though it is not preferable, I am open to trades...

If you have any questions, let me know! Don't hesitate to communicate!




******PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A PANIC PRICED SALE!!!  These HK USC rifles new, unfired (as this one is), go from $1,800-$2,000..the grease gun lowers are very hard to obtain and they can sell for $300 easy if new and unfired (as mine are)....the 5 magazines are all new in wrapper (as shown).******"
