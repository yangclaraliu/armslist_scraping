I got the gun in the condition you see the gun in in the picture but the gun has been mainly put up in a safe since I got it about a year ago and I've handled the gun with surgical gloves on the few times I've handled the gun shortly after I got it and I've only fired one 165 grain Federal Hydra-Shok round out of it a few weeks ago to see what the recoil would be like since I have never fired it and I must say this is one of the nicest pistols I have ever owned and shot and it is dead accurate. It comes with Novak green dot night sights that were on it when I got it which still have plenty of life left in them but are a little dim, 4 Smith and Wesson magazine's with black followers that are in good condition overall, 59 rounds of hollow points ( 1 full box of Hornady Custom 200 gr XTP, 1 full box of Federal 165 grain Hydra-Shok and another box of the same ammunition minus 1 cartridge and I'll add another full box of Federal 185 grain hollow points when I aquire them from a police buddy of mine) and I also have a Black Tandy Leather Company shoulder holster I'm including in the ""package deal"" as well.Just to mention this now, do a quick Google search and look at what this gun has gone for in the past and goes for now in better or worse condition than the one I have and actually pay attention to the condition of the guns if there happens to be multiple pictures of them and look up what the magazines go for as well and you can decipher what's fair for me and what isn't before you try to contact me.I'm not expecting to get a ridiculous amount of money for everything but everything I have isn't necessarily cheap either and never was and I have no problem holding onto this gun for a long time because it will continue to go up in value and I really appreciate this gun for what it is and the history behind it.

With a distinct focus on the needs of the shooter the all new Hudson H9 is not simply a new contender in the firearms industry, with 7 patents pending, it is a pistol that is engineered to advance.                 MOTIVATED BY THE PAST  Mankind’s collective experience as soldiers, as frontiersmen and as firearms enthusiasts have contributed to where we stand today. Taking cues from its legendary predecessors the Hudson H9 does not stray from its roots. From its steel frame, to its straight-pull trigger, to its striker-fired design the H9 will feel instantly familiar with any firearms enthusiasts.     INSPIRED BY THE FUTURE  We live in a rapidly evolving world, yet pistols have remained relatively unchanged for the better half of a century. At Hudson we see opportunity in the future, an opportunity to rethink and improve upon the process of building a pistol. Every detail and every feature of the Hudson H9 is purposeful leading to a pistol that is practical in its delivery yet advanced by its design.             1911 STYLE TRIGGER  The trigger can make or break a pistol so why not have the best? The well-tuned 1911 style trigger found on the Hudson H9 offers a short take up, a crisp release, virtually no overtravel and a tactile but short reset. The patent pending integral trigger safety is engaged instinctively and doesn’t take away from the smooth straight pull trigger that allows the shooter steadier and more consistent follow-up shots.                       STRIKER-FIRED DESIGN  Patent pending striker and sear design is optimized for less wear and tear of parts. The lack of a hammer spring also allows a more slimline and higher grip on the pistol giving the shooter more control while diminishing felt recoil.               LOW BORE AXIS The H9’s unique design is not simply aesthetic. The unconventional nose of the pistol allows for the barrel and recoil spring to sit drastically lower and closer to the hand than heritage designs. This, coupled with its striker-fired design, creates an extremely low bore axis which reduces torque about the wrist when firing and contributes to unparalleled precision in the shot process.          UNRIVALED MODULARITY From purists to mavericks and everyone in-between the Hudson H9 has been designed to accommodate any shooter, allowing them to tailor the shooting experience to their own unique style.      CONFIGURABLE SAFETIES The H9 comes standard with a trigger safety, but for 1911 purists or for those who just want an added measure of assurance we offer patent pending thumb safeties that can be equipped for left, right or ambidextrous shooters.     INTERCHANGEABLE GRIPS For some it’s about function and for others it’s about style. Either way, the Hudson H9 makes it easy to change the look and feel of the pistol quickly and easily with interchangeable grip panels.     AMBIDEXTROUS OPERATION The H9 features ambidextrous slide releases and a reversible magazine release.     ACCESSORY RAIL With the accessory rail equip the H9 with aftermarket lights or lasers to better suit your needs making the pistol versatile in any situation."

It will probably feed resized empty cases. Has the long trigger, oversized beaver tail safety, skeleton hammer, ambidextrous safety, full length guide rod, Wilson extractor & titanium firing pin, EGW O/S small radius firing pin stop (the original John Browning 1911 design, reduces recoil), and Pachmayr grips. I am the original owner. I had the work done when I got the gun new thinking I'd go IPSC pistol shooting with it. It ended up being the tightest, most accurate 45 I've ever owned and I've had a bunch so I decided to keep it that way. All work was done by Bryan Murphy of Murphy's Guns in Tucson. At the time he asked me where I got it as it was the tightest fitting, slide to frame, factory 45 he'd held. Gun has never been fired without a shock buff. Comes with 7 magazines 2 OEM's, 1 GI, 2 Mecgars, and 2 Chip McCormick Shooting Star 8 round. the CMC's and the 8 round Mecgar are fitted with the new Fobus Immortal springs, OEM's and the GI are running CMC Rocket wire springs and I'll throw in some spares. Also comes with the 3 holsters shown. I'll throw in a box of hardball and 10 shock buffs. Probably not more than 1500 or so rounds through it it's entire life. Finish is nearly perfect aside from the idiot scratch and the common slide torque wear on the right of the frame. This price is firm. Local cash face to face sale only, NO SHIPPING and I will need to see an AZ ID. I can meet in the 32nd St. and Greenway Rd. area. More pics are available if interested.

Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier. This technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment.ALL NFA RULES APPLY.

We then brought in another black gun aficionado, who knew workaday guns and business. We soon began to buy CNC machines to create better tolerances for the some of the pieces we were assembling in house. We then bought more machines to manufacture other parts. With more CNC machine purchases we began hiring even more passionate employees. We were creating our own parts at a fraction of the cost, which allowed us to pass the savings on to our customers. We now offer a great selection of firearms and parts that are built here in Texas for the most discerning firearms enthusiast and professional. From Military/Law Enforcement to 3Gun participants we are sure to have some thing that will meet your needs and budget—and we can do for as little as half the cost of other manufacturers.    We currently manufacture all major components except for: barrels, BCGs, Stocks, LPKs and other springs and pins.

Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier.

Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier. This technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment.ALL NFA RULES APPLY.

Only shot less than 200 rounds by the previous owner (I have not shot this gun). Previous owner bought this gun brand new, and had it professionally customized. I’m the second owner.  Customized by Edwards Custom Gunsmithing here in Lexington. He specializes in CZ 75 guns, and does excellent work. It is a 2017 production gun. Comes with the usual factory items (i.e., case, paperwork, owner’s manual, cleaning rod and brush), and six mags (1-18rd CZ, 5-17rd Mec-Gar). It also comes with the following, an extra custom CZ aluminum grips (pictured), 1-Kydex IWB holster, 1-Kydex OWB holster (not pictured), extra brand new set of CZ cocobolo grips installed. All the factory parts are also included (pictured). This CZ 75 has at least $400 worth of custom work done to it. It has the defensive carry package parts from Cajun Gun Works. The custom work done includes modifying and refinishing the left external safety, a trigger job (trigger pull is so smooth), a floating trigger pin, a 12 Lb recoil spring, has an extended magazine release button, and an extended slide stop. Also has the TruGlo PRO TFX night sights, and a CGW 10X barrel bushing installed. I like this gun a lot and it is set up for competition. But I don’t compete and it’s too nice for me to shoot. Got this gun out of impulse trade...lol. I’m more of a collector than a shooter, and I need funds for another project. So off it goes. Overall, the gun is in mint condition. Must have a CCDWL to buy this gun. Face to face deals only. No shipping. Meet within the surrounding counties only. Package sell only. Will not separate the extras from the gun. $950 for all (cash). Cash price is FIRM. No low ball. I have over $1,300 invested on this gun and the extras. Low ball offers will be ignored. No calls or texting (I’m not giving out my number to a total stranger). I need to know you first. There are too many scammers out there. I’ve been burned before. Corresponds via emails first, and then will exchange phone numbers when time to set up a meeting.

Was purchased used from an FFL. Shot it for a little while but haven't for probably nearly a year since i picked up my Ruger Precision Rifle in 308.  I don't have any information regarding its previous level of use, however the rifle IS in functioning condition. The only issue with the rifle is what appears to be- and i could be wrong, but i dont want any disappointments- a bit of surface rust forming on the barrel. Its a slight discolored/rough patchy spot, and i am assuming it is rust. Otherwise it appears to function nicely and all. I put about 30 rounds through it with zero issues; not much, but the thing is fairly expensive to shoot, so, like my RPR, i tend to shoot it far less than my AR's.. May need to be zero'd in as i removed and put back on the sight. The Bushnell Scope is a 3-9x and is included, but seems to just be your typical cheapo scope that comes with rifle packages. Rifle has an Accutrigger on it (Note big sticker on stock).
Looking to get 450 for the Rifle with sight. Bipod not included.
Also available, either as a package with the rifle or AFTER the rifle is sold, is 180 rounds of Wolf Military classic 145gr FMJ steel case as well as 10 rounds of Federal Power-Shok 180gr soft point ammo. 65 cents a round for them all (Paid over 1$/rd for the Federal, and about .75+ for the wolf with shipping).
Located in East Brunswick, but may be able to meet at my warehouse in Newark, as well.Cash is king. Would consider trades (Sorry, no P2P's right now)."
