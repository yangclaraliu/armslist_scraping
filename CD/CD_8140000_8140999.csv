The customization was done in original order, not afterwards. I have looked at gun shows and on line for the last fifteen years and have never found one like this. The Enforcer is the closest but not the same. Fajstead’s doesn’t even list it in their book of gun values. This piece reaches a level of sublime craftsmanship and performance. The Schuemann 4” Match Barrel with three ports machined is perhaps without equal in terms of accuracy and the gun will basically handle any load you put through it and is literally a tack driver. Because of the machined ports the gun shoots like a 9mm. Has adjustable combat target sights with grooved ambidextrous safety as well as grip safety. The grips are stunning with a Black Widow engraved in them as well as on the slide. If you were to order the barrel alone from Schuemann Barrels the price is $350.00. Comes with Original box, two 7-round Chip McCormack magazines and gun lock.
This is one beautiful gun and is one you will treasure for a lifetime. It will continue to increase in value as time goes on. Additonal photos sent upon request.

It’s never been fired- only chambered. The mag pulls have been removed and the scope he had on it has been removed- but the laser/flashlight combo will be included as well as the pressure pads. They work- I tested them today. My wife has decided she wants to buy a house and I need earnest money- so I’m selling this brand new AR-15. Has a Rogers super stock. Case is standard issue- got it on a 300 blackout custom job- just throwing it in for good measure. Comes with Mag in picture. I see these rifles on Buds listed for 449- but good luck finding one at that price because they are sold out on every website I can find. If you can buy it for 449- go ahead and buy it online- but they just aren’t avaialable. With that being said- I’m going to let everything go for 600- which is less than what I have in it. This includes 80 rounds pictured in the case. Those were 40 bucks- got them yesterday. This is a steal for a never shot weapon and all the accessories- so dont offer any less. This price is very, very firm. First person with a valid Georgia drivers lisence that will drive to my house in Gainesville gets it. If I haven’t posted anything saying it’s gone- it’s still available. No trades. As I said- I would keep it but I need the cash for the house purchase. Also, make sure your wife doesn’t go house shopping when you’re working.  Thanks guys. I appreciate it."

It' had professional trigger work, and stock bedding. I topped it with leopould 1 piece base and rings that hold a 30mm body NC star 2.5-12 dual illuminated scope with target turrets. Yeah I know NC star say what you want but this glass has changed some minds and no I'm not offering it to them because I like this rifle too much to offer the friends and family discount. I also have just shy of 200 rounds of ammo for it. Mostly high end commrcial but a few mil-surp tracers and odd ball rounds mixed in from previous 308's I've owned. This rifle hasn't ever fired cheap or tracers rounds. Just throwing it in because I won't have any further use for it. The bi-pod in the pics is not included unless otherwise specified in a trade. A cash sale is possible but I know where I'm posting and all the vultures out to make a buck off me can suck donkey nuts.

The rifle features a 24 inch heavy fluted barrel with a muzzle break, a one piece picitinny rail, digital camo AccuStock, AccuTrigger, and an all steel construction 10 round detachable box magazine by Accurate Mag Company.  In addition to that, I have a 6-18 Vortex Crossfire II scope with a level attached, a cheek riser, and an imitation Harris bipod.  I zeroed the rifle at a hundred yards last August, cleaned it, oiled it, and put it away.  The only adjustment I never made to it is on the magazine feed lip.  I never bothered to buy the adjustment tool because I feed the ammo by hand one round at a time when I shoot long range.  The mag feed lip probably needs to be opened up about 3 thousandths or so to get the cartridges to feed more smoothly.  The adjustment tool costs about 25 bucks.If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  If the ad is up, the rifle is still for sale.And thanks for your interest."

These are the standard caliber classics made from 1978-1985. The standard chamberings were 22-250 Rem, 243 Win, 6MM Rem, 30-06 SPRG, 7MM Rem Mag and 270 Win. The 270 Winchester is the only rifle NOT available in this sale. What makes this group of Classics unique is they are all 1st year run as evidenced by the iron sights and ""Q"" barrel code.  According to The Remington 700-History and Users Manual, page 123, ""In its first year (1978) it was equipped with open sights and chambered for six popular calibers (listed above)....sights were discontiniued after 1978 and this cost savings was passed along to the customer."" All of these rifles, IMHO, are in VG to excellent condition, I can provide more pictures and you can be the judge. For more information or pictures CALL, no texts or emails, too many tire kickers and scammers that waste my time, call (580) 320-3521. If no answer please leave message and I will return your call. For FTF, picked up in Ada, must have ID and be willing to sign BOS. For out of state purchase shipping/insuranse can be easily arranged to your FFL. The 6MM Rem and 7MM Rem Mag both have nice VX-2 & 3 Leupold scopes, if not interested in scopes deduct $300 from sale price. Please see my other listings for nice Remington, Ruger, Marlin and Winchester lever guns. Thank you."
