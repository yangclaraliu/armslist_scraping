The two serials found on Lee Enfields (on the receiver ring & bolt) are both matching.It has a walnut stock with the original raw linseed oil finish and the very sought after early war long distance ""ladder sights"" that were used before the British adopted the cheaper flip peep sights. This rifle features a very shiny barrel with strong grooves, a nearly mint condition stock and locks up quite nicely. This is not the commonly found Canadian Enfields or Indian Ishapore rifles found in America; it is a British original. This rifle is valued at $700 but I am primarily looking to trade. Very accurate and easy to perform a ""Mad Minute"" on. This rifle was very well taken care of, cleaned & oiled after every outing and was actually placed inside it's own protective case before being placed in the safe to keep it free from any dings, scratches, etc.I am willing to ship this firearm for a trade but for cash deals, I would like to do face to face. You are entirely free to inspect this rifle upon a face to face transaction and I will bring a bore light for you to see the barrel's great shape.

MK1. This rifle was produced by H.M. Co LTD. The H.M. ""^"" stamp is featured on the receiver ring, bolt and stock. The two serials found on Lee Enfields (on the receiver ring & bolt) are both matching.It has a walnut stock with the original raw linseed oil finish and the very sought after early war long distance ""ladder sights"" that were used before the British adopted the cheaper flip peep sights. This rifle features a very shiny barrel with strong grooves, a nearly mint condition stock and locks up quite nicely. This is not the commonly found Canadian Enfields or Indian Ishapore rifles found in America; it is a British original. This rifle is valued at $700 but I am primarily looking to trade. Very accurate and easy to perform a ""Mad Minute"" on. This rifle was very well taken care of, cleaned & oiled after every outing and was actually placed inside it's own protective case before being placed in the safe to keep it free from any dings, scratches, etc.I am willing to ship this firearm for a trade but for cash deals, I would like to do face to face. You are entirely free to inspect this rifle upon a face to face transaction and I will bring a bore light for you to see the barrel's great shape. Please do not contact me asking what my ""bottom dollar"" is."

Looking to move quickly, contact info at the bottomHello,i am looking to sell my brand new, never fired CZ 805 Bren 11” pistol rifle. Chambered in 5.56×45 and using the ubiquitous STANAG magazine from the AR15/M16, it easily accepts optics and lights on its top and bottom Picatinny rails. Two-port muzzle brake helps keep the pistol solidly on target and reduces recoil and muzzle flip. I have another SBR CZ 805 Bren and I love it. It’s close to the top of the smoothest pistol AR’s that I own, along side my Scar L and KAC SBR.  It retails for $1,800.00, but I paid $1,650.00 when I purchased it. Cold hammer forged, muzzle threaded 1/2x28. The weight is 6.7 lbs and overall Length is 22.75 in.The S1 uses a short-stroke gas piston operating system. “Short-stroke” means the gas piston moves a distance shorter than the length of the cartridge. The stainless steel gas tube and gas block are mounted above the barrel and use a two-position regulator with settings for regular use and a wide-open port for extreme conditions. The S1 uses a reciprocating charging handle that can be mounted on either side of the receiver and also serves as a forward assist when encountering a partially chambered round. The magazine release buttons are ambidextrous, and a plastic shell deflector is mounted at the rear of the ejection port to protect the faces of left-handed shooters (which really helped me since I am left handed). The trigger has a very smooth travel of about 0.5 inches and a pull weight of 5.63 pounds according to my Lyman digital trigger pull gauge.As CZ puts it, the S1 has proven a popular short-barreled-rifle (SBR) candidate for customers wanting to convert it to an NFA firearm. I agree fully. Because of its size, weight and caliber, the S1, wearing a folding stock and other 922r parts, would be slick. ** Also to add, I have a brand new 922r kit for sale along with it if anyone is interested in making it an SBR in the future. This extra kit costed almost $300, and took me MONTHS to find at the time. Places were claiming they had them in stock and I couldn’t find it anywhere. Please note that this will cost extra if you are interested. I am willing to work out a deal for the entire package, or just the pistol itself. I have some important bills that came up currently, so I am looking to make a good deal with someone (as long as you don’t completely low ball me with some ridiculous offer). I will entertain all offers as long as you are being  considerate at the fact that I won’t be low balled. I could use the free space in my safe, the extra money for some very important bills, but I’m not willing to give it away. I would rather keep it before I do that.Fastest way of contact is texting my cell, REDACTED. I get a ton of calls a day, so please text me first, or leave a voicemail.** I will add pictures of how it looks stock (no the optic is not included), as well as what it looks like as an SBR if you are interested in the 922r kit with it that I will sell for cheap."

Looking to move this quickly or willing to trade for certain Sig’s, Kimber 1911’s, or Glock 19/26. Contact info at the bottomHello, Looking to sell my HK USP .45 Tactical since I really don’t use it ever since I’m always using my suppressed FNX .45 tactical, and my HK Mark 23. I had some unexpected important bills come up, and I’m looking to work out a deal with someone to sell this. I’m not interested in being low balled either, I can always keep it. Just trying to free up some space in my safe, and use the extra cash for bills. This gun has been a blast. It comes with the hard to find green o-ring as well. Shooting it suppressed is even better. So much lighter than my HK Mark 23 too. This pistol doesn’t even have 1000 rounds through it either, maybe not even 500 rounds. Comes with 3 magazines, and a very nice soft authentic Heckler & Koch carrying case.For those who don’t know, the USP Tactical models are designed for users who need the features found on the HK Mark 23, but in a more compact and lighter weight pistol. USP Tactical pistols approach the precision found on the Mark 23 by adding an extended threaded barrel with a rubber O-ring, adjustable trigger, and adjustable target-type sights. The .45 ACP model of the USP Tactical is constructed on the USP45 frame. ** Features & System Characteristics:- Threaded O-ring barrel with polygonal bore profile- High profile target sights (to clear suppressor)- Match grade trigger- Adjustable trigger stop- Target sights with micrometer adjustment for windage and elevation- One piece machined, nitro-carburized steel slide- Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes- Patented HK recoil reduction system- Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish- Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame- Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves- Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines- Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories- Ambidextrous magazine release lever- Extended slide release- Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator- Patented Lock-Out Safety device** NOTE: the suppressor is not included. That suppressor belong to my Glock and FNX Tactical.** Best way of contacting me is by texting REDACTED. I get a ton of calls a day, so please text me prior to calling or leave a detailed voicemail. I have other firearms I am selling as well for good deals. Check out my other posts."

This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.Arsenal's Exclusive Milled And Forged ReceiverEach SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria.

Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal's meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.Summary: SAM7R-51 | 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, Arsenal, Inc.'s US made hammer forged and machined trigger that features a wider trigger grip for more comfort on the shooter's finger and a Bulgarian Warsaw Pact length buttstock, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.FEATURES:100% new-production parts and components.Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier, and double-hook triggerCold hammer-forged 16.3"" barrel from Arsenal's Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technologyHard-chrome plated bore and chamberRemovable 4-port muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads.Arsenal, Inc.'s U.S. made hammer forged and machined Wide triggerSubstantially extended service life over other types of assemblies.922(r) compliant with US or imported magazines.AK scope rail."

This extra weight helps to smooth the function of the AR15 by slightly delaying the unlocking of the action allowing pressure in the chamber to decrease, resulting in easier, more consistent and reliable case extraction. The extra weight also causes the bolt to move forward with more authority, stripping and feeding the next round from the magazine into the chamber more reliably. This can be especially helpful if the rifle is dirty or under lubricated.  Weight: 3.7 ozhttps://www.spicetac.com/products/ar-15-h-bufferSee also Carbine Buffer and H2 Buffer"

This extra weight helps to smooth the function of the AR-15 by slightly delaying the unlocking of the action allowing pressure in the chamber to decrease, resulting in more consistent and reliable case extraction. The extra weight also causes the bolt to move forward with more authority, stripping and feeding the next round from the magazine into the chamber more reliably. This can be especially helpful if the rifle is dirty or under lubricated.  Weight: 4.5 ozhttps://www.spicetac.com/products/ar-15-h2-bufferSee also Carbine Buffer and Heavy BufferSee all SpiceTac AR-15 Parts"
