As you know, New Gun Laws Took Effect in CO July 1! 
Here's what I've learned that the news is not disclosing---

State law limits the amount the FFL Dealer can charge for Background Checks to only $10. It's basically a tax; the store must turn it over to the State.
The store must retain records for 20 years
The store must inspect the weapon; deeming it safe to operate.

I believe Corral Pawn on Main St. in Trinidad is doing the BGCs.
I was told Artic Shooting Supply, on 6th St, in Pueblo is doing them. 
If you prefer, paid in full first, I will agree to ship UPS OVER-NITE to your FFL Dealer for Transfer.

They are only sporadically made and are often totally unobtainable.
The box was fairly typical of Tanaka's other revolvers, except that the background to the photographic artwork on the lid was bright red, rather than the usual dark background.

The silver finish on this gun is nothing like the stainless finish on the S&W 629s, being a bright, highly polished chrome finish....The weight and balance of the gun is good and there is nothing visible on the gun that one could describe as a fault or blemish.
The hammer cocks to two positions, half cock to permit rotation of the cylinder for loading and full cock, for firing. Of course, being a Single Action revolver, the SAA needs manually cocking before each shot, like a springer. This is achieved simply by pulling back the hammer.

On the barrel's left side is the legend ""COLT SINGLE ACTION ARMY .45"", with ""COLT'S PTFA MFG. CO. HARTFORD CT. U.S.A."" on the top of the barrel. There are a couple of small proofing marks on the left side of the trigger guard.
There are Colt logos on the grips in the form of a rampant horse in an oval raised section and there's a small Colt horse logo next to the patent marks. If you turn the gun upside down, you will find the only Tanaka mark right on the front of the frame, where it reads ""ASGK""/""MFG.TANAKA"".
The foresight is tall and clear, but the rear sight is a simple groove in the top of the frame, making the sights rudimentary at best.
The overall finish is excellent. I could not find anything that looked like a brush mark or pitting and the consistency of the mirror finish chrome effect across the various parts and materials appears 100%, even under varying light conditions, which are often expose even very minor flaws.

o load extra BBs, over the standard six cylinder openings, you need to remove the magazine stored in the extractor rod, which is done by depressing the 'screw' at the front (on the underside) of it. You can then fill the magazine with BBs and replace the extractor rod.

The grips are black plastic, replicating hard rubber, The hammer certainly is metal, as is the trigger and cylinder.



As I have come to expect of Tanaka revolvers, the SAA seems to have all the main features of the real revolver accurately replicated, with the exception of removable shells.

The BBs can be pushed into open cylinder mouths and extra ones can be stored in the extractor rod (more on that later), whilst the gas is put into the cylinder (as on all other Tanaka revolvers I have seen) by opening the moving piece of the frame and using the, provided, gas can extension. You need to half cock the hammer to get the cylinder to rotate, as with the real thing and there is an evocative click each time the cylinder moves on a notch.

To load extra BBs, over the standard six cylinder openings, you need to remove the magazine stored in the extractor rod, which is done by depressing the 'screw' at the front (on the underside) of it. You can then fill the magazine with BBs and replace the extractor rod."

The LG-660 laser sight is an engineering marvel for Smith & Wesson M&P Full-Size pistols. Interchangeable between calibers, the LG-660 Lasergrips® directly mimic the look and feel of the original grip, with the tactical impact of laser sighting. Activation is in the rear of the weapon on this model, instinctively springing to life when the pistol is held in a natural firing grip. The LG-660 received the Academy of Excellence Award for ""High Tech Product of the Year"" in 2008.

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

 Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

 The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
 The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

It is a 9mm Double Action Only concealed carry gun. It is a RS version of the gun, which stands for Re-Strike.  If you for some reason have a light hammer strike, you simply need to pull the trigger again, unlike most semi-autos where you have to rack the slide back, which costs you seconds in an emergency. This feature brings a semi-auto closer to the reliability of a revolver. Very hard to find right now, as it is one of the smallest 9mm's on the market, about an inch shorter in length than the S&W shield, and shorter in height.  It comes with Sig Nite Sights, an integrated laser that can be removed if you don't want it.  It comes with a flush fit 6 round magazine, and 2 -  8 round extended magazines, and a sig holster.  I have all of the info, and original box.  Only has 150 rounds through it for the recommended break in.  Not that much bigger than a Bodyguard .380 or a Ruger LCP.

The M4-style adjustable stock, A2 grip and Mil-Spec controls won’t make headlines—but the new chamber should.

The upper receiver is fitted with a 16-inch heavy barrel. It’s formed from 4150 and chrome lined. Surrounding the barrel is the new DPMS M111 modular free float tube. It appears to have been inspired by the RAHG forend developed by DPMS’ Freedom Group-cousin Remington Defense, and joins a trend toward modular handguards that allow three sides to receive various-length rail segments. The user can choose to place rails anywhere along each side, or nowhere for tube-like handling. Not only do mounting screws lock rail segments in place, but strips of serrations cleverly work to better secure the add-ons against recoil that can loosen torque-set screws."

Above is just a couple of his email addresses.
He will email you with one email telling you your gun isn't worth much and go off on you like a pshyco.  Yes PHSYCO!!!  Just the time he spent stalking my ads and the emails he sent are beyond comprehension
 Then he will email you with a different email trying to trade you or buy that same item.  Then when you say no he throws a fit. 


These are the guys that need the background checks!!!!!!
