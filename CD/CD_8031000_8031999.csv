Gun is like new and in excellent shape. Comes in its original hardcase w/ all the factory accessories: papers, lock, 2 15 round mags. Extras included are the brand new TruGlo Trituim night sights I just had installed. $140 after installation (original sights included) and an extended 17 round mag w/ adapter plate to give you a larger grip which cost me $50 after shipping. I’ll admit, I don’t like the way my pinky hangs off with the original mags but it fits perfect with the extended mag. I’ve got a full size model as well and the extended grip makes it fit the same as my full size. I put 100 rounds through it after I had the sights installed to make sure they were sighted in good and it shoots on a dime. Awesome shooting gun. Like I said I’ve got a full size, don’t really care to get rid of it, just seeing what offers I get on it. The best way to reach me is by text at REDACTED. Only trade interests are other handguns. I like anything from Glocks to 1911’s. Thanks. Also has a new holster and double mag holster."

I am the second owner of this rifle. The original owner claimed it has had a professional trigger job and stock bedding done. He was able to rattle off the name of the shop and gunsmith that did the work, but I do not have proof. I can say the trigger feels great, and this rifle is an absolute tack driver. I also have just shy of 200 rounds of assorted ammo I can include and separating the optic could be considered as well. Just depends on the offer. The bipod is not included or available in the trade. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this rifle, I'm only considering trading it because I've owned this rifle for a few years now and have only put 60 rounds down range with it. I think it' time to put it in the hands of someone who will use and enjoy it and gain something I will use and enjoy more."

Elegant in Blue or Stainless, this small, single-action-only could be found under a cummerbund or a pair of bibs. It's what you have been asking for! No revealing lumps or lines makes concealed carry easier than that larger capacity gun you already have. Cool, neat and ready to go-the Taurus Slim will be your companion for a long time to come.     Taurus Security System (TSS)s     ""Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.""     Loaded Chamber Indicator     Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.       Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.       Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.       Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.       Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.       Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.       Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.       Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.       Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.       Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.       Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.       Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.       Also includes: One, 30-round Magpul® PMAG®.

This gun has no mount hole for a stock, one can be added easily, but this is my CQB firearm so it's built perfectly for its purpose, still has a very similar range to my longer barreled AKs. The only reason I am parting with my one of my favorite AKs is because I have my eye on a new project, so I am a very motivated seller, can meet at a local ffl for a legal transfer asap, comes with one parts kit empty 30rnd mag, and a 10 round mag. It has never once jammed, or had a FTE, FTF, well maintained, cleaned when needed, and kept in dry Gunsafe. If you think my price is high you are wrong, this is literally the exact price of the original firearm+the upgrades minus $100 because I am ready to sell fast. I have better photos, and more info if needed, comes with original box. And I will thow in 100 7.62x39 rounds.  Will go fast!"

Unlike many other shotguns sold in the US, the 1919 is very light, ergonomic, and magazine-fed. The 1919 uses a conventional gas-operated action located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. The magazine release button and manual safety duplicate the M16 style and the top of the receiver has a carrying handle and integral picatinny rail for mounting rear sights, or any optical accessories. Every MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round metal detachable magazines and three internal chokes.MKA 1919 Shotgun Semi-Auto 12 Ga. 2-3/4"" & 3"" 18-1/2"" 6-1/2 Lbs.
