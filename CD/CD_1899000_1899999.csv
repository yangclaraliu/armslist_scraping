The short-recoil action Double Auto came in three versions, all 12 gauge  – the standard model, with a steel receiver: the alloy-framed Twelvette, which I had, weighing 6 and 3/4 pounds or so, and the stripped down Twentyweight, a 6 pound wand.

It also came in different receiver colors: black,gray, brown and green.

Browning advertised it as “Tomorrow’s Gun Today” and it looked like no other shotgun. It had a safety on the back of the trigger guard convenient to left and right handed shooters alike, and a pivoting forearm that latched to the bottom front of the receiver. If you unlatched the forearm and swung it down, you could slide the barrel off, leaving the gun instantly taken down into two pieces.

A lot of people look at the Double Automatic and see a solution in search of a problem. My more charitable view is, the Double Auto was an attempt to put a truly light and spirited bird gun in the hands of hunters for much less than the cost of a double and with a little less recoil.

In a way, the Double Automatic, with its radical-for-the-time styling and unusual features, was sort of the Benelli Vinci of the 50s  The Double Automatic lasted from 1955 to 1972."

Description: Brookside Memorial Park: Prefer Selling Two (2) adjacent plots near a beautiful Old Oak, in the highly desirable ""Lakeview"" of 680, Spaces 1 & 2. Space #1 is positioned towards the Lake, which is enjoyed by the Ducks and other birds. Brookside Memorial Park is one of Houston's largest and most beautiful cemeteries you will ever come across. It has some of the most beautiful landscape, which consists of enchanting 500+ year old Oak trees, a pond with a calm variety of Ducks, Geese and other birds swimming about. Shade from the trees allow you and your loved ones enjoyment, while visiting the loved ones who reside in this one of a kind cemetery. It is maintained by the staff at Brookside, which I must say they do a great job. It is located off Hwy 59 and Lauder Road. The Cemetery asking price for these beautiful plots (with easy access by the street, no getting out of your car and having to walk some distance to get to your loved ones) is normally over $5,000 each. 

We are asking Buy price is $4,000 each, ($7,500 for Both). If you can't afford to pay cash for them, but need to set up some plots for the future, I will consider a trade or combo Trade + cash of certain High end Rifles or combination of certain pistols (to be discussed, so let me know what you have to offer) or we will consider Land with utilities near Palestine, Texas. If traded, the Trade Value will be $5,000 each or $9,000 for Both . We have other burial places, so this is the reason we are selling.
Thanks for looking! If trading a gun, Proof of residency required and if the buyer is out of state or needs shipping, then firearm must ship to a FFL dealer in your area and applicable shipping/handling charges will be covered at buyers expense. Be willing to show Texas DL or give DL # from other states and sign a BOS or BOT."

This unique rifle started life as a USGI M1 Garand and has been rebarreled in .308WIN and modified to accept M14 or M1A magazines. It also utilizes the gas system from the Beretta BM59. 

This may be as close as you’ll get to an M14 built on an authentic USGI forged receiver. 

I’ve had no problems with this rifle; it feeds reliably, recoil is soft for .308, and it’s more accurate than I am. Obviously, this was built from a 60+ year old rifle, so it’s not “new”, but the barrel and stock are new, all parts were re-parkerized when the rifle was built in late 2012, and it has since fired only about 250 rounds. I wish I could hang on to this, but I already have another Shuff's Mini-G and need some cash. 

Features: 
- accepts GI or Checkmate M14/M1A mags 
- new production ~17” BM59 barrel by Standard Parts, LLC 
- new production BM59 Muzzle brake by Standard Parts, LLC 
- new production BM59 gas cylinder by Standard Parts, LLC 
- Schuster adjustable gas plug allows reliable feeding with almost any loads 
- bolt hold-open latch/mag catch (bolt stays back on last shot or can be activated manually) with laser-etched Shuff’s Parkerizing logo. 
- new American Walnut stock 
- More info and video from Shuff's Parkerizing: http://shuffsparkerizing.com/services/shuffs-bm14-garand/

Included with the rifle are the following accessories: 
- 2x 20-round magazines (1 USGI marked, 1 Checkmate) 
- 1x 10-round magazine (Checkmate) 
- GI web sling 

These rifles are available from Shuff’s Parkerizing for $2500 with no magazine. 
For this one, I’m asking $2200 shipped, or a few bucks less for a FTF transfer in the Knoxville area.

The only partial trades considered right now would be a CZ 527 in 7.62x39, a reliable USGI M1 Carbine, or a quality 2-7x35 optic, preferably with BDC reticle.

This rifle is a stainless steel, synthetic stock ADL model 700. The rifle was bought for a specific hunt last summer which it performed superbly on, and now since I will not go on another hunt like that any time soon, I would like to pass it on. The rifle has been fired 18 times (sighting and of course once at the animal) it has been kept clean and in a climate controlled safe. It comes with RCBS reloading dies and 22 remaining custom loaded rounds. The rounds are loaded in Remington brass, with 200 grain Nosler Accubond loaded with Retumbo (92.5 grains) at a velocity of 3012 FPS. The rifle condition is as stated earlier nearly new, the bases are professionally mounted by Remington and the stock has a 3/8 inch recoil pad spacer (needed for a custom length of pull - I have long arms) the space is easily removed by simple backing out the recoil pad screws and then simply returning it all to factory a new state. The gun comes in the original box as I kept the box knowing that I would need the rifle for just one hunt. If you have any questions feel free to call or email.

5.56 NATO (223 Remington), 16 in, 6 Point Collapsible Stock, Black Finish, 30 Round Detachable Magazine

This rifle was built for the price conscious user who is looking for a good quality and inexpensive AR15 style rifle for range practice and/or home defense. They were able to do so by changing some features that should NOT upset the majority of target shooting users out there. The barrel used is made in house – 16″ without m203 cuts, melanite coated inside and out, 1:8 twist rate, and 5R rifled. The 5R rifled barrel designs have been in use by Thompson Center, a S&W owned company, for a long time in order to produce an inexpensive and very accurate product. Those looking for a milspec rifle, this isn’t the one for you, but melanite has proven itself a durable, corrosion resistant, uniform coating that can be considered more accurate than chrome lining. Other differences on the Sport models include: an upper receiver lacking a dusk cover and forward assist, a lower receiver with integral enhanced trigger guard, LMT style removable rear sight and A2 style front sight, chromed gas key and bolt carrier and other standard A2 styled parts. For those budget conscious shooters out there looking for a rifle that offers good quality with a low sticker price, the M&P15 Sport rifle may be just what you’re looking for.

I bought this unfired, un- issued SKS and put it in the safe, only fired maybe 200rnds total to test fire after each of the mods were done to ensure complete reliability.
I searched out & purchased the Chinese surplus olive drab canvas covers,mag pouch & sling to keep all this NEW equipment clean, new & complete. Given the gun grab attempts I also ordered enough ""all new parts"" and still in cosmolinespare to keep this weapon operational even if they manage to stop importation of these weapons..
This is a 922r compliant SKS that is as nice as they come, Very accurate shooter, completely outfitted for hunting, home defense or war! ha

Mods:
Threaded barrel muzzle to install flash supressor/compensator
Hard Mounted drilled & tapped  Choate scope mount
4 O clock to 8 O clock ramp feed bevel job to eliminate the potential for stove pipes or jambs
Drop Free bolt mod to enable the removable Hi Cap magazine or install one handed (no more need to open bolt to insert mag)
Clean Crisp Trigger job to remove that gritty trigger pull that the SKS's are known for
Installed ""cheese grater"" hand guard for better cooling
Polished bolt carrier & lapped receiver rails for smoother operation and reliability
Wood stock modified to accept detachable Hi Cap magazines
Front Sight post replaced with Precision ""Cross Hair"" Sight Post (nice, see pic)
Installed a 922r compliant gas piston

Magazines:
1 PreBan rare 50 rnd metal magazine
2  30 rnd metal magazines
1 Tapco 20 rnd magazine
1 75 rnd metal drum magazine
All magazines are custom fit to this rifle including the drum and all rapid fire reliably
despite most peeps opinions of the drums they are the best ""rapid fire"" mag for the  SKS, the drums are single stack unlike the double stack banana style clips and will feed MUCH faster without jambs or stovepipes, these drums can reliably handle full auto

The conversion barrel allows you to shoot 9mm out of your Glock 23, 32, 27 or 33 (works as an extended barrel for the 27 & 33) Good for gen3 AND gen4 Glocks. Both the barrel and the mag have been to the range only 3 or 4 times before I decided I liked shooting 9 and picked up an m&p shield. The magazine is a factory Glock 33 round magazine not a cheap knockoff.

The Smith & Wesson 686+ has the more versatile round butt grip frame that
can accommodate a wide selection of aftermarket grips to suit any hand
size. With its intermediate size and weight, it is comfortable to grip by
its finger grooved grip. Its overall configuration allows for a good
position of the trigger finger around the narrow smooth trigger. The
narrow, smooth trigger allowed the finger to roll over its surface,
preventing the tendency to pull the sights off target during the long
double action stroke.

I have an OLD remington 700 in 30-06 also and even though the winchester shoots much better, the remington has more sentimental value. I chose the 30-06 because it can pull double duty as opposed to the .308 that the ""Tacticool"" kids like to play with. Ballistically the 30-06 is FAR superior to the .308. If you handload you can load the 06 down to .308 ballistics or you can approach .300 mag power. Ill also throw in some ammunition.

Interchangeable Spare Bodies
The Minotaur MTAC is the ultimate level of deep concealment on the market today. This ""hybrid"" holster combines cowhide leather backing with a Kydex half-shell mounted on the leather. The leather backing provides the desired comfort achieved by leather holsters. The Kydex half-shell provides the reliable, consistent draw and re-holstering capabilities that make Kydex holsters so popular.

Interchangeable Spare Bodies -- One holster for all your guns!
The Kydex half-shell (also called ""Spare Body"") on this model is interchangeable and can be swapped out for different handguns. Click here to see more on our Minotaur Spare Bodies.

Adjustable Cant and Ride Depth
The clips on the MTAC can be re-positioned to ride higher or lower on the holster. This allows the cant (angle) to be adjusted more or less depending on user preference. The ride depth can also be adjusted in the same manner.

Interchangeable Clips
The clips can be swapped out for different styles, colors, and belt widths. For more information on available clips, please see our Mounting Options page.

Leather Backing Notice
Leather is a natural material and shades may vary from hide to hide. We do fit check EVERY holster with the actual pistol. Due to this fit process, there may be small scuffs on the inside of the holster. This is normal and caused by the fit process.

My shotgun here is very well put together and is a great setup for HD.  I have also smooth out the action.  I've put 200 rounds down range of various types of ammo (target, high brass, 00 buck, etc).  This thing is amazing with the reduced recoil (if you shoot shotguns, trust me, you'll notice the difference).  You'll definitely appreciate it as I have.

I spent over $1800 for this setup (I bought everything new) so for your consideration, I'll like to get $1500 for it.  I'm not price gouging.  Go online and piece it together and you'll see.

Locals only, will not ship.

Please make sure you are able to legally purchase/own a firearm as the transfer will be done at my expense at a FFL Dealer.

***Please note that I do not know if the FFL Dealer will need the buyer to have a PTC/PTP as this is a shotgun***

Quote from www.AK47world.com ""Which brings us to WHY STILL in 2011 - imported Chinese MAK-90 AK-47's like the Milled Receiver MAK-90 or Stamped-Receiver NHM-90 Rifles or stamped-receiver Chinese MAK-90 rifles offer the BEST Values in AK-47's - as Chinese MAK-90 Rifles offer 'Double-hook Trigger & Hammer Groups and 50% thicker 1.5mm receivers than the thinner 1mm receivers used on Romanian AK-47's that only have 'Single-Hook' trigger groups - as Chinese triggers feel much better when shooting - due to the 'Double-Hook' hammers also used in Milled Bulgarian AK-47's - like the SA-93, SLR-95, SLR-96, SLR-100H, SA-M7 & SAS-7 Rifles.""

Unless someone just wants to WASTE $$$ on a bayonet lug or flash-hider - the best Semi-Auto AK-47 variants ever imported into the U.S. are these foreign arsenal built AK-47's:
    1. Bulgarian SA-93, SLR-95, and SLR-96
    2. Chinese Norinco MAK-90/NHM-90/NHM-91/MAK-91
    3. The Hungarian SA-85M 
ALL of which represent a MUCH BETTER VALUE than a lesser-quality Romanian WASR-10, Century Arms GP-75, Century Yugo M70AB, Saiga or VEPR Russian-made AK-47 Rifles!

These guns are virtually identical with slight differences. Apparently Armalite was the original developer of this firearm for use in the war. It was then sold to Charter Arms and they built it for some years until selling it to Henry. The Charter Arms is used and I will take 200.00 for it. The Henry has never been fired, comes with an extra mag and I will let it go for 260.00 . These are pretty cool guns, they completely disassemble and store in the stock for storage, fitting in a packpack or other go bag. They will even float if dropped in the water, I have never tested this but seen it online. My prices are firm. Thanks for looking"

I've only shot it to sight it in. It's pretty much brand new, but I'm kinda wanting multiple guns or possibly a gun plus cash. This rifle is a true beaut and if you know anything about the caliber, you'll know how bad*$$ this package is. 

Here's what's included in the package:

Howa 1500 22-250 $700.00
Blackhawk Talon Stock $260.00
Nikon Scope $400.00
Bipod $65.00
Sling $30.00
140 Rnds of ammo $250

The scope is zeroed in and it's a Nikon so it speaks for itself. The bolt action is smooth as butter and the trigger is as light as a feather, my guess it 2-3#. You can shoot a dime from 200 yards away without a problem with this thing. Hate to let it go, but I'd like to increase my gun collection as it's my only firearm. Estimated trade value: $1,705

NOTE: Pictures aren't mine, but it's the same exact thing pretty much. If you show interest, I'll e-mail you pictures if you'd like.

ALSO: I'm not looking to get exactly what I spent through a trade. I'd just like one or few things through the trade of almost equal value. Depending how much I want to trade, I might not even care, like if it were a Smith and Wesson 500 or 460."
