This is a blem model. If you aren't familiar, Dan Wesson decides some guns have a blemish somewhere in the finish. But they are very very picky, so usually you can't even find the blemish.

In January of 1960, the model 742 was introduced in grades of A, ADL, D and F with calibers in .257 Roberts, .270 Win, 300 Savage and the BDL versions. […] “Quality materials and sound manufacturing practice went into the making of this gun. The receiver was expertly milled and finished cut to design specifications. The barrel was forged and rifled by skilled barrel makers. The coloring vats added a dense gunmetal coating to the metal parts. […] “The ‘Woodsmaster’ Model 742 was the latest in Remington’s line of outstanding autoloading high power rifles. This gas operated rifle was designed for rugged hunting use and built to Remington’s rigid standards using quality materials. The Model 742 is take-down in design, meaning the barrel and action parts could be removed for maintenance and care. Two grades were supplied…Standard and the new BDL ‘Custom Deluxe.’ Standard grade listed both rifle and carbine length models. “A five (5) shot capacity was available in both models, counting four (4) cartridges in the detachable clip magazine and one (1) in the barrel chamber.” -Remington Owner’s Manual   This rifle is in great condition with very few signs of use and none of damage. It is the Carbine model, chambered in 30-06. It comes with 1"" Weaver scope rings already mounted.   More detailed information can be found in the owner’s manual here."

I’ve exchanged a few positive emails with some good people. Yes I know, I am selling at great prices.

If I said that I wanted $200 for an item, then I want to $200 for an item. Your offer of $50 cash isn’t really an offer. Anyway......Colt 1903 Type III .32 manufactured in 1919Serial number 29841XOne of my great uncles by marriage, left this gun to my dad and my dad left this gun to me.It was stored under less than ideal conditions 50 years or so ago, because it is heavily pitted. No that is not an elaborate design, that is heavy pitting.It’d didn’t have any sentimental value to my dad as far as I know, but he hated for me to shoot it. I think he thought it was worth much more than what I am listing it for or maybe he just appreciated something that was that old and still shot well (as long as I didn’t shoot it too much).Now that he’s passed I’ve shot it a lot more.I wish that it looked better, but it doesn’t.I want one of the new reissue models but they are well over a $1000.00.I think I will just attempt to sell it.

The P1 differs from the P38 only in the alloy frame.  This Cold War specimen was built in June of 1962.  The round count is very low ; there is no evidence that it was ever carried.  The finish is excellent ; the bore is a mirror.   The holster is very nice and of good quality , marked BMVtgd150 ; I believe it is of German origin.  The second magazine is in the holster pouch.  I have put 150 or so rounds through this Walther ; function was flawless.  Common Winchester White Box 115 gr 9mm is a good ammo for it. More images available via email if requested.  Given the fact that this a complete ""rig' , (pistol , spare magazine , and holster) , coupled with the superb condition , I have priced reasonably at $495. Trades considered :Older revolvers , Beretta pistols of open slide era.Local ftf is fine , so long as I.D. is provided.  Carry permit strongly preferred.  I reserve the right to refuse sale.  Shipping to FFL can be arranged."
