The truth is, the standard Mil-spec 8620 bolt has a number of factors limiting its performance, not the least of which is that the life expectancy of such bolts is only about 6,000 rounds. In fact, standard bolts will start to show stress cracks on the locking lugs adjacent to the extractor cut after only 3,000 rounds. Cracking at the cam pin hole and weak extractor spring tension only add to the problems of the Mil-spec bolt.

The material used in these standard bolts is also not the best choice by today's standards, but if you remember the old story that explains why “Mil-spec never dies,” that applies here as well; they make them this way because they’ve always made them this way.

The latest edition JP EnhancedBolt™ is made from SAE 9310 high-grade steel. This material makes for an extremely hard surface with a tough, ductile core resistant to structural failure and a life expectancy far exceeding Mil-spec 8620-type bolts. SAE 9310 is the same type of steel used in the transmission gears of Formula One racecars, and the high-load application of a bolt assembly is ideal for this state-of-the-art material; the results of actual full-auto endurance torture tests prove it.

The design of the JP EnhancedBolt™ addresses many other fine points, the most important of which is the utilization of a standard configuration extractor. Most users want the ability to replace extractors and other parts with commonly available Mil-spec parts instead of being dependent on proprietary parts that can be difficult to acquire. Therefore, this new bolt will accept standard extractors, pins and springs."

Finished with a QPQ hardcoat process to yield incredibly hard and lubricious bearing surfaces.

Weight: 6.25oz with key installed.

Manufacturer description of the JP EnhancedBolt:
To satisfy customer requests, we now offer the new JP EnhancedBolt™ with great life expectancy while utilizing a standard configuration extractor.

The truth is, the standard Mil-spec 8620 bolt has a number of factors limiting its performance, not the least of which is that the life expectancy of such bolts is only about 6,000 rounds. In fact, standard bolts will start to show stress cracks on the locking lugs adjacent to the extractor cut after only 3,000 rounds. Cracking at the cam pin hole and weak extractor spring tension only add to the problems of the Mil-spec bolt.

The material used in these standard bolts is also not the best choice by today's standards, but if you remember the old story that explains why “Mil-spec never dies,” that applies here as well; they make them this way because they’ve always made them this way.

The latest edition JP EnhancedBolt™ is made from SAE 9310 high-grade steel. This material makes for an extremely hard surface with a tough, ductile core resistant to structural failure and a life expectancy far exceeding Mil-spec 8620-type bolts. SAE 9310 is the same type of steel used in the transmission gears of Formula One racecars, and the high-load application of a bolt assembly is ideal for this state-of-the-art material; the results of actual full-auto endurance torture tests prove it.

The design of the JP EnhancedBolt™ addresses many other fine points, the most important of which is the utilization of a standard configuration extractor. Most users want the ability to replace extractors and other parts with commonly available Mil-spec parts instead of being dependent on proprietary parts that can be difficult to acquire. Therefore, this new bolt will accept standard extractors, pins and springs."

ELIMINATE ALL DOUBT.
Compact, accurate and completely trustworthy, the REC7 is designed specifically for situations in which there’s no room for error. Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life.

This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine.

The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance.

The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face.


The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance.

At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance.

The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 hardcoat anodized. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle."

I would be really interested in a Remington .308 and lower grade AR combo trade. Open to offers though. I wont take 5 pistols or anything like that for it. I will need a long gun to replace this one, it must be semi auto. AR-15 in .223/5.56 or .308. The scope is a Nikon P-223 with a BDC designed for the 55 grain bullet out to 600 yards. It is very accurate as long as you have the fundamentals required to shoot precision to begin with. It comes with a Troy Industries single point sling attachment and a single point Blackhawk sling. It will also come with a set of A.R.M.S flip up sights and Blackhawk bi-pod. Has about 360 rounds through it.


You are bidding on a brand new LWRC M6A2 PSTR 14.7” barrel rifle (with pinned flash hider). Own the LWRC….the FINEST piston AR on the market!!! This is NOT an NFA weapon! Pinned flash hider results in the overall barrel length reaching the BATFE required 16” minimum. 

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories. 

The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. 

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

Passive retention: 

Fobus Passive retention system allows an instinctive and quick draw, and is proven to be the most effective way to draw.

The holster mechanism acts like a spring on the guard area and holds it firmly in place.

Rubberized Paddle:

FOBUS™ introduced a supportive backing for most of its holsters to tighten the attachment to the body and maximize comfort.

This backing significantly betters the agility of the paddle and improves the way the holster is secured to the body.



How to use:

Tighten your belt

Place the holster on your hip and make sure the paddle is pushed all the way down on your belt.

Draw fast and decisive, in an upwards motion as if you were in a real critical situation.



A few warm words about Fobus:

Established more than 25 years ago, FOBUS™ is Israel's largest manufacturer of holsters and accessories for small arms. 

FOBUS™ holsters and pouches were designed and made especially for the Israeli security services and SWAT teams.

FOBUS™ holsters are mold injected of RX18 polymer, a compound of polymers designed for durability and high performance in tactical use.

By using a passive retention system, a safety strap or mechanism is no longer needed; our design ensures safe carrying of the gun, accurate fitting and a quick draw when needed."

This is a Hi Standard W-105 Durango .22 cal 9 shot 4 1/2 barrel western style swing-out cylinder revolver that looks like a single action action revolver.  The High Standard, 22 lr caliber ""Durango"" is somewhat scarce with a brass plated grip frame and the rest of the gun is blue
The blueing is really good, not alot of brass showing and the wooden grips are great.  

I did a little research and found that these pistols don't come up very ofter. Gun-broker history shows 3 sold all at $300 at up and on other site they seemed to go $350 and up. RIA sold one at auction (with the box) for $1000!

It comes with the original case and 2 magazines. It has had less than 25 rounds through it(thanks to the ammo craze right now!!) If interested email me and we can go from there... BTW just throwing this out there this would be the perfect gun for a lady and i know youre saying right now what lady would want a full sized steel frame hangun... its simple the weight of the gun greatly reduces recoil and adds to its accuracy...

Not just for zombies anymore

While it would be a lot of fun for our marketing department to sell the Camp 10 as the ultimate zombie-whacking tool, the truth is, it actually has a lot of other uses that you just might find to be of a more immediate nature than zombie defense. Not that we’re ignoring to the coming Zombiepocalypse, mind you. We just think that the Camp 10 makes a pretty awesome camp knife and that it does a great job of whacking campsite or other outdoor chores down to size in very short order.

From clearing brush to making kindling, the Camp 10 is the ideal outdoor and survival tool. Cut, chop, slash, hack, split, scrape—just about any task you ask of it, the Camp 10 can handle. The full-tang Camp 10 is made of carbon tool steel for toughness and wear resistance. A basic black powdercoat protects the steel and makes maintenance easier.

You’ll like the secure, contoured grip of the Camp 10, too. The handle has a built-in hand guard and is drilled in both front and rear so you can attach a lanyard either place—or both—for carrying versatility. Of course, if a zombie does get up close and personal with you, then yeah, you’ll be pretty glad to have a Camp 10 in hand, too.

I inherited this great revolver from my uncle who bought is new in the early '70's.

It is a High Standard W-105 Durango 9 shot western style .22 revolver. These are double action pistols that have a swing cylinder and have the appearance of a single action.

The High Standard, 22 lr caliber ""Durango"" is somewhat scarce with a 4 inch barrel, brass plated grip frame and the rest of the gun is blue. The blue is in good shape, it doesn't show much brass, and the wood is really nice.
The durango doesn't come up for sale often and in doing a little research I found the 3 in gunbroker history all sold for $300 and up:

http://www.gunbroker.com/Revolvers/Completed/BCI.aspx?Keywords=durango&Timeframe=1

 and guns in this shape on other sited went for $350 or more. At RAI auction a really nice example in box went for over $1000!.

Selling to switch to a BPS 10 with a longer barrel.

Must meet in the Tulsa area. $900 cash buys it. All 3 chokes alone are easily worth $125, one brand new Patternmaster goes for $100. You will simply not find an SP-10 in this condition at a price like this anymore. 
Someone sent me messages arguing and complaining about the price. I do not understand why, because this is an extremely competitive price when you add in the chokes and compare it to SP-10s on gunbroker."

If you're interested in the gun and the ammo, we can work out a fair price.  The only reason I'm interested in trading is that I want something a little smaller for cc.

This is a complete setup, nothing more to buy. All you need is the ammo.
What I am offering:
- Kahr CM9 9mm Pocket Pistol with box, paperwork, and 6 round magazine.
- Armalaser laser sight. What's nice about the Armalaser is that it is touch activated when your finger touches the front inside of the trigger guard. No buttons to push, activates when you are ready to fire. Perfect setup for CCW.
- Two 7 round magazines with extended finger grip.
-  Custom fitted Theis brand IWB hybrid holster for CM9 with armalaser.
- Don Hume IWB holster for CM9 with armalaser.
- Done Hume OWB holster for CM9 with armalaser.

I am looking to trade for a full sized pistol in 9mm or .45. Glock preferred (Glock 17, 19, 21, or 30), but others may be considered.

Retail value of this Kahr CM9 package is $725, so I'm looking for a trade of equivalent value.

I inherited this rifle from my father several months ago. I have fired exactly 15 rounds since getting it, just to make sure it works properly, which it does. Overall the rifle is in decent shape. It does have some slight surface corrosion on the barrel and a nick in the front iron sight (re-bluing or duracoating the barrel would make it look brand new again). Neither of these have any impact on the performance or functionality of this weapon. Has a 5+1 internal magazine. Comes with nice scope rails, a 3-9x40 scope, and a very nice leather sling (scope and sling not shown in the pics). Also comes with 65 rounds of Hornady and Remington interlock softpoint hunting ammo. I just purchased this ammo several weeks ago for over $30 per box, so there is about $100 worth of ammo alone.

According to the barrel markings and serial #, this rifle was manufactured in either 2004 or 1974 as Remington reuses it's date stamps every 30 or so years (according to their website). I'm leaning toward the 2004 date because of how good of shape the rifle is in, but I could be wrong.

987,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1734987,For Sale:  ERMA Deutfches Sportmodell,"Simpsonville, Greenville, South Carolina",$ 600,"Listed On: Saturday, June 8, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a WWII bring back ERMA Deutfches Sportmodell, this gun has been in my family since it was brought back from WWII and is in good condition.  The stock is in good condition and as you can see from the pics there is a piece of black electrical tape wrapped around it.  I removed it (and replaced it) and there is no damage or cracks to the stock and can only imagine that it was put there grip possibly.  The bolt barrel and bluing are all good and fully functional.  Leather strap is a little dry but in very good shape also.

As you can see there are numbers stamped into the stock and as I was told these are rack numbers for storage.  These guns were designed by Mauser as a training rifle for the German/Nazi military and are meant to simulate the handling of the Mauser K98 but disguised as sporting rifles.

Post WWI Germany was prohibited from the manufacture of arms and only permitted to produce small caliber arms for sporting purposes thus these guns have Sportmodell on them.

The serial # is 5508 and has Kal 22 Lang (22 long) FURBUCHSEN as well as GmbH-Abt Gewehrfabrik-ERFURT written on the barrel.  

The gun as been appraised at between $700-800!
