At the first of the ban there was not a proper way of debanning and different importers did different things. This one does not have Mak90, SP or Sporter electo penned or stamped, the only things that makes this not a pre ban is a number of importers were struck out as some importers didn't want to deal with the ban and the bayonet lugs have been ground off. Original Chinese furniture and the bluing is excellent, no rust or pitting. A very, very nice rifle. Call or text 918 371 six250."

Includes one (1) like new top-of-the-line 25 rd PRI all steel construction magazine with Magpul anti-tilt follower. Best 6.8 mag on the market! Willing to accept credit card payment thru discreet Paypal transaction with buyer to cover any PP fees. Buyer to pay actual shipping fees to the FFL of their choice. Contact me with questions or to see additional pics (I have many to send).Note: Like new genuine Trijicon ACOG is not included in the sale, but is available for purchase separately with or without the rifle. Features: The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance. The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face. The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance. At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance. The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 Class 2 hardcoat anodized and Cerakote finished. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension.(REC 7, AR10, AR15, COLT, BUSHMASTER, DPMS, ROCK, ARMALITE, S&W, DANIEL, STAG, LMT, LWRC, SIG, RUGER, PWS, HK, TRIJICON, EOTECH, NOVESKE, MAGPUL, TROY)"

Bought for the wife but doesn’t fit her hand well. Has a Tagua fitted leather conceal holster too. Few rounds to prove it functions fine to the buyer. I dont have time to haggle and will take a little loss but 240 is low as i can go. Its worth that all day. The holster is 40 and thats 200 for a stainless automatic with no scratches or bad spots. Somebody said they wanted reasonably priced conceal carry? Here it is. If not save your money and get a sig or HK for 7-800 bucks.

While this pistol has a long, heavy trigger pull and a short sight radius, it is possible to be accurate with it with practice and good technique.  There is very slight, but normal, wear on the inside of the slide.  All in all, this pistol probably has between 200-500 rounds through it.  I am the original owner and have kept it well maintained. 
If you end up buying, please bring a copy of your TN driver's license (address blacked out please!) with you when we meet.  At that time, we will both fill out a bill of sale, I will provide you with a copy of my driver's license (address blacked out as well) and we will both take home a bill of sale to serve as proof of purchase.  According to state laws, I can only legally transfer firearms to other Tennessee residents.  So please don't contact me if you are a KY resident."

New in tube.  Retail price $100.00 The Rem Choke tube system is used on a number of Remington shotguns including the Model 870, Model 1100, and Model 11-87.
 
 
Patternmaster's EXTENDED RANGE tubes extend out the end of your barrel 1 1/2 inches and has an effective range out to 70 yards. The difference between the Patternmaster EXTENDED RANGE and Patternmaster LONG RANGE is the length the tube sticks out the barrel. (Long=1 inch vs. Extended =1 ½ inches) The added length is to accommodate a 3 ½ inch shell and still achieve a Full pattern. You will see a patterns similar to a Full constriction choke on paper with a 2 ¾ or 3 or 3 ½ inch shell, but because of the patented ""stud ring"" inside the tube, there is a much shorter shot string. This shorter shot string will allow more shot on target all at once so your down range energy is sure to kill instead of cripple. Pick your favorite shot size to use which can range from 8 to BB Non-Toxic/Steel and Lead 8 to 000 Buck.. Patternmaster tubes are made of Carpenter Custom 630 (aircraft quality) 17-4ph stainless steel and are heat treated to the optimum level for best performance.
 Note: Testing done by Ballistics Performance has determined that ammunition with velocity of 1550fps and below will achieve the best results with the Patternmaster Classic and the Code Black Tubes. Not for use with ammunition containing flight control wad or slug ammunition.  
Patternmaster’s 12ga Remington tubes will interchange with Remington 870 and 1100 (NOT 887)
