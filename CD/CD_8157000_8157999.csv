Or if you were able to travel back to 1984 you'd be legit cool without being white trashOnly 105,xxx miles on itNew wipers, recently aligned, fresh oil and a new battery.New tabs -good through April of 2019.Comes with extra set of new spark plugs, oil filter, CD din kit, Kenwood CD player, adapter harness (not installed)Great daily beater, weekend warrior, or average joe's car show top contendor. I use this for work when my truck is broken and now my truck is fixed so it's time to go. Plus my wife fucking hates it.THE BADCold start - I guess these old V6's are cold hearted bitches. (fuel pressure regulator or intake seals are a common issue? ) Summer time warm-up is great. Winter months equate to sitting there freezing your balls off making it idle high until it's warm. Once she's warm she runs great though.Headliner is starting to come down, wear some sunglasses if youre cruising down 35w with the windows down- those little orange foam flakes will blind the shit out of you. Also - one of the sunroofs makes a slight whistle noise at 75+mph and above. Although slight- still very annoying.THE UGLYThis thing is soooo cool looking, but before I owned it - some hoodlums stole it using the ole ""chicago punch"" to the steering column, cops chased them, they bailed, the van kept going and abruptly stopped in a picket fence. So there is a broken corner light, dented fender and scraped door on the one side.Ignition is still punched out. Will come with a ""Club"" (remember those commercials in the 90's?) and two keys - once of which is a long screwdriver. The other is a slightly shorter screwdriver.Again- I use this thing about half the week and travel around the cities for my occupation. I trust it for most of the stuff that I do.$1,000.00 firm."

The bow comes with a very high end sight with a 4x magnification lens, a specialty ""super peep"" with several different apertures so you can change them out to your liking, 6 carbon aftermath arrows, a carbon fiber target stabilizer that is short enough to used with a hunting bow but long enough to help keep you on target at the range, several screw on weights for the stabilizer, and a high end wrist release. I'm throwing in the plano case as well for free. I paid about 1600 dollars for all of this, I'm asking 950 or best offer. Here is a break down of what I paid:Bowtech carbon Icon - $750Axcel AccuTouch Carbon sight x-31 ( sight has presets from 20 to 80 yards, no guessing when aiming) -$350 Docs Target lens 4x power - $105Specialty Super Peep with multiple sight sizes - $606 Carbon Aftermath arrows - $50TrueFire buckle wrist release (this release is phenomenal) - $115Carbon fiber 12 inch stabilizer with weights - $80Case - $40I paid about 1600 dollars for all of this, I'm asking 950 or best offer.
