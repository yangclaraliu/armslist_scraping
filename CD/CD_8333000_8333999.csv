The rifling is sharp and the bore shiny, I suspect it might have been unfired when I bought it, and I've only put 20 rounds through it, myself. The trigger is crisp and light, the action smooth and positive. As the picture shows, it has a sling and swivels installed. The sling is well worn - a leftover from another rifle I used the have - but serviceable. I have a set of Winchester factory scope mounts for it, and a Bushnell Banner 3-9x50 with 1"" rise rings, all included with the sale.There is absolutely nothing wrong with this rifle. I got out of rifle shooting for a few years and tore up my shoulders pretty bad, and now I just can't handle the recoil anymore. My loss, your gain!Not interested in trades, unless you have something plus cash on your end that really grabs my eye. Honestly, cash is preferred. Willing to meet within reasonable distance.

Long considered the Rolls Royce of revolvers, the Python required much hand fitting by skilled craftsmen and was always an expensive revolver to both manufacture and to buy. This revolver wears the 6-inch vent-rib barrel and has the white-outline adjustable rear sight and red ramp front sight. It is constructed of stainless steel. The stainless surface has been after-market polished and looks very good for the most part. There are a few light marks visible that could be improved with a bit more polishing. There is no rust or any pitting. The factory original checkered rubber grip with gold Colt medallions are in excellent shape. This revolver functions well and exhibits good timing and locks up solidly. The bore is excellent with bright, sharp rifling. If you've wanted a stainless Python but didn't want to pay the $3000+ cost of a like-new example, this could be just the Python for you! According to the serial number, this Colt was manufactured in 1985.Buyer pays $20.00 shipping."

Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning.   SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip.  
Features
-Compatible with all weapons that accept standard STANAG 4179 compliant magazines
-Reliable functioning due to mechanical simplicity and high-quality non-binding coil spring—no lubricants required
-Long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance
-Easily seated in weapon with bolt forward
-May be kept fully loaded for extended periods without spring fatigue

The barrel has stampings "" model A, Sweden, and a Nitro and crown symbol on it.  From what I know about it, it's very, very rare. It has had the barrel custom done with both sites removed and a Leupold scope mounted, trigger work done, and is practically bremish free. I am posting a pic off the net of it now, but will update actual photos tomorrow. I would like to trade this for an AR15 or something more tactical in the same price range. I am tentatively valuing the rifle at $650.00, although I think it's worth more due to it's rarity."
