This ammo is made in Russia by Barnual and is similar to Wolf & Tula brands except that Silver Bear uses a zinc plating process on their cases rather than a sprayed/dipped lacquer. This gives them a brushed nickel appearance that I assume is intended to provide more resistance to corrosion and perhaps to aid in smooth clambering/ejection from your pistol? 

I used a fair amount of this before I sold my Russian MAK and it functioned reliably. It was clean burning leaving little residue. Plus it was just as accurate as any of the other ammo I tried - even the big name brand varieties. It was also $6 - $10 less per box than any of the American made stuff I could buy at the time. So it's a good value for the money.

Cowboy Action, Bullseye and Combat Shooters should love this one! TITEGROUP has it all, low charge weight, clean burning, mild muzzle report and superb, uniform ballistics."

Please no offers of anything other than silver and/or cash.  I'm in Newport News and will meet in NN, Hampton, York county, or Williamsburg ONLY.  Can't hold it for any time. First with the cash gets it.

The free float rails are designed to fit all the tactical gear that you can carry. Unlike many ARs, this is a standard feature which you won't end up spending more to upgrade the rail set-ups. It has an efficient autoloading direct-impingement gas system for ejection of spent cartridges and auto reloading. No forward assist is necessary for a rifle this smooth. It does have a dust cover, a large trigger hole, and nice charging handle. The blued barrel is 16.25"", rifled for 1 in 9"" and ends with the muzzle-flash suppressor. The receiver, magazine release, and charging handle are all well designed to make use and maintenance reliable and easy. The upper and lower separate easily with two pins for service and cleaning. The receiver accepts 5.56 Nato ammunition as well as .223 Remington brass or steel casings. It has a 31 round capacity and is a real front-runner in the AR style market. Colt also makes a good quad rail set-up like this, but is generally much more costly. Mossberg redefined affordable with .223s and the .22lr. They have been around over 90 years. They must be doing something right. Mossberg offers their one year manu. warranty on this product. I have additional 30 round factory Mossberg magazines for sale"

Described on the Magpul website as follows:

Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

The upper receiver, lower receiver, bolt, charging handle and trigger are all from RRA. I put a Mag Pul CTR stock (buffer tube assembly too) a Hoge Ergo grip (came with the lower package from RRA) and a Yankee Hill quad rail. The barrel is 16"" and fluted with low pro gas block. I think I have covered everything. It is 5.56 NATO chambered. 

I have shot this so as to ensure that it is functioning correctly before selling. Some people like to say they only put 3 rounds through it, but I don't feel that is an accurate test of the functionality of the gun. I put about 90 rounds through it to test its accuracy and zero, as well as a mag dump to ensure the bolt and ejecting system is working properly. Like I said, I just want to make sure it is a good quality weapon before selling it to someone.

Not incredibly firm on the price so I'll listen to offers, but don't low ball me. You know about what I am looking to get. NO TRADES.

From Mystery Ranch:

Using every trick Dana has up his sleeve, the Kodiak is truly a beast of a pack with the ability to carry 7000 cubic inches of gear weighing up to 120 pounds. The Overkill Guide Frame combines the added stability of the Overkill Yoke and the comfort and weight transferring ability of the Five Segmented Lumbar Wrap with the absolute best internal framing. A classic top loading design with dual draw cord shroud increases weather resistance and allows for upward expansion. The Daypack Lid separates top load into two compartments for better organization and load control. Built-in shoulder straps convert the lid into a day pack complete with ports for a hydration reservoir. The SpeedZip sleeping bag compartment can handle the largest winter bags while remaining easy to close. Plus it can be sucked flat to reduce the size of the packs volume for smaller loads. Side zippers provide great access into the pack. From backpack hunting in Alaska to extended missions and expeditions all over the world, one word describes the Kodiak- overkill.

Following the import ban in 1989, the Chinese developed an AK which met the ""sporting purposes"" clause. (The earlier AKs were banned because of their ""evil"" features: pistol grips, folding stocks, threaded muzzles and bayonets.) The new model was basically an AK with a wood thumb-hole stock and no bayonet lug.More MAK-90 rifles were imported from China than any other model of semi automatic AK type rifle from any other country. MAK-90s were made to shoot 7.62x39.The bore is chrome-lined. I am in lake mary florida."

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer

The crown is as flat as I could get it however I would have a professional gunsmith level it off or at the least get a crown tool for yourself. The bore on this rifle is very good. I refinished the stock. It originally was spray painted green when I bought it but quickly sanded and hit it with a walnut finished and sealed with 3 spray coats of shellac. Has the trigger mod done so the pull is around 7-10lbs. Love mosins, but this one has to go to someone who wants to finish it.

From the company website:

Zeiss's Victory 8x26 T* PRF Laser Rangefinder is an enviable 8x26 monocular built to the incredibly-high standards that come with the Zeiss Victory name. As an optical unit it is a world-class 8x26 monocular, and electronically speaking it is an intelligent rangefinder device geared towards hunters and shooters. Its rangefinder capacity, in clear twilight upon sharply-angled light-colored objects, can approach 3/4ths of a mile-a simply phenomenal statistic. But in any light, it compares favorably to any other laser rangefinder monocular.

For hunters' special needs, the T* PRF features a Ballistic Information System (BIS) which gives the adjustment in the shooting impact point ('holdover') for up to 6 different bullet drop profiles at distances of up to 500 meters (546 yards).


    • Brilliant T*-coated optical quality worthy of Zeiss' ""Victory"" name 

    • Extensive measuring range to 3/4ths of a mile (1200 m) 

    • Built-in inclinometer gives hunters holdover values for up to 6 ballistics profiles 

    • Scan mode allows continuous displayed measuring ranges (every 1.5 seconds) 

    • Waterproof, rubber-armored fiber resin housing 

    • ±3.5 Dioptric correction 

    • Twist-up eyecup with 4 stages accommodates nearly any user 

    • Yields a whopping 2,000 measurements from a single CR2 battery (@ 68°F/20°C)

I’ve had it to the range twice – once to sight in the iron sights, and once to sight in my optic - and to a tactical carbine class. It was meticulously cleaned and lubed with Frog Lube after each shooting trip. There isn’t a single scratch on it. It’s action is as smooth as a sewing machine! Calls are fine, texts are best. Text literally anytime – early morning or late night with questions and offers. Can meet in SLC and Ogden.

Price is pretty firm. For the right buyer, I have other tactical goodies I can throw in as well. I just need to sell it all ASAP!

Thanks for looking!

The ACOGs are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium-illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night. Bindon Aiming Concept (BAC) models feature bright daytime reticles using fiber optics which collect ambient light. The ACOG combines traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed. The ACOG has many features which are very advantageous for military use. Designed for use with the M16 family, every feature of its mechanical and optical design was chosen for a single purpose: to provide increased hit potential in all lighting conditions -- without failure prone batteries.

I am selling this lot for $200.00 which is slightly below the MSRP of $29.95 per box of 20. This ammunition is VERY rare as most of it is bought up by various law enforcement agencies before it finds its way to the civilian market. These rounds are designed to zip through glass or car doors and then expand once it meets flesh. Guaranteed to turn your AR into a self defense powerhouse! Please forgive the upside down pictures as I have no idea how to flip them! You can reach me at REDACTED. Now a few words from the manufacturer;   This match accurate load is our heaviest TAP® offering in 223 Rem. It can be used in 10.5"" barrel firearms that have either a 223 Rem or 5.56 NATO chamber. The 75 gr. bullet offers deeper penetration than the 55 and 60 gr. TAP Urban® bullets yet still penetrates less than most law enforcement pistol bullets. This bullet penetrates barriers with minimal deflection and breakup thus delivering more energy to the target. Whether fired through a barrier or not, this bullet generates very large and consistent wound cavities, serving as an ideal choice for 223 Rem sniper applications."

The pistol is practically brand new, as I've only put 40 rounds through it at the range there in Bellevue. I'm getting rid of it because I'm not a fan of the trigger (should have test fired a 19 at the range before I bought one haha!). I never realized how biased I am in favor of my XD's trigger feel. 

I also have two holsters that I bought last year. One is a polymer police-style design that the gun clips into really securely. Great for open carry, but I never open carry. I paid $75 for it and have never used it. The other is a Galco leather holster. I've concealed carried with that one half a dozen times over the past year. It's really soft leather, so there is absolutely ZERO holster wear on the pistol. Of course I'm also including the case, two 15 round mags, and all the other paperwork and stuff that came with the gun. As a little bonus, one if the mags is loaded with jacketed hollow points. 

Like I said, this is pretty much a brand new pistol, in pristine condition, with all the original stuff plus well over $100 in the two holsters, plus 15 rounds of ammo. So I'm firm on the price, because it's very reasonable. I'm willing to travel to meet you, within reason, I would like to do an informal bill of sale and see your ID, just to cover my ass. Obviously that would only be for my personal records. Or if you have a valid CPL I would be ok with skipping the bill of sale. I also have my CPL, if you'd like to see it for your records."

I have shot about 200 rounds through the gun and it is in near perfect condition. The Vtac edition is flat dark earth in color and comes with factory installed double dot Viking tactics night sights. These sights alone cost around $250.  The pistol has a capacity of 15+1 and comes with two factory mags. I managed to find two more factory mags so you will get 4 mags with this firearm. These mags were somewhat difficult to find.  I also have 525 rounds of new brass ammunition to go with the gun as well as all manuals and the hard case. Feel free to ask any questions. I am only looking for cash at this point.
