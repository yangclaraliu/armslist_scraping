The bore is slightly dark, but the rifling is very sharp and consistent. Considering that this is a Paulson work, and owing to the very high quality of his jobs, I am pricing it at $700.

Made in Brescia, Gardone, Italy, by the predecessor of Uberti and imported by EIG while Mr. Eig was till alive. It is very good quality for its type. I have shot it, and it hits fine at poker table distances, etc. Guaranteed to hit a barn as long as you are inside...All kidding aside, it is a good old gun and I think it is probably rare to still have the box and paperwork from 1962. If you are a CAS shooter or just want a fun, cheap little pistol that won't break your heart if it is stolen, I think you could do worse than this one. Bring me a hundred bucks and it is yours. Email me with your email address andmphone number and we will figure out a place to meet. Face to face transactions only at this price. By the way, I bought  this at The Outdoorsman in Santa Fe, and you can see the receipt so you'll know it is not stolen. Since .22 ammo is still hard to come by, I will also include a few rounds so you can shoot it if you don't have any.  Thanks for reading my silly ad. Doby Pilgrim, Santa Fe"

He did a very nice job of engineering the milled receivers and assembling the rifle from the Yugo part kits. As i understand it, these kits were from the SOG debacle where the BATFE recalled a batch of M76's as they claimed they were capable of full auto fire. I don't go with that story, but it happened anyway. This was a total package with extra mags, scope and mount. Very nice rig. I have had good luck with hand loaded ammo and have a target to show what it will do in the hands of a semi-skilled shooter (me). The ZRAK scope has been upgraded to a brand new 8X model from PA Distributing. These scopes are pretty much unobtainable these days. A genuine Mitchell Arms M76 will cost you in the $4500 range, so this package is a bargain. $2150 plus UPS ground shipping. I expect the shipping to be around (estimate) $75 due to the heaviness of the rifle. Plus, I will ship the scope and accessories separate USPS Priority mail to ensure they don't get damaged in shipping the rifle. Payment is USPS MO's only, please. Must have FFL signed paper from FFL who accepts from non FFL holder. Will include my TX DL with shipment if that makes the FFL happy. Of course, know your local and state firearms laws. I will check this closely before shipping. I can send more pics if requested. Please state any areas of the rifle to be seen in more detail."

I was going to sand it down and just cold blue it but figured id give somebody a shot at a great rifle for a great price.
The wood is beautiful just some minor marks on the surface.
Ill sell it for $300 cash or trade for something else. interested in bolt actions, revolvers, semi-autos, lever actions. 
Email or TEXT only.

Will not take less then $300, otherwise ill just re-blue and put back in the safe."

It started of as a traditional SKS and modified heavily. I First took the clip off of it and modified it to accept extended magazines, I put in a new recoil spring (the old one was fine but I wanted to make sure it had a new one) . I decided to replace the receiver cover with a Texas Dog rail system and lighten the trigger. I also put on a short pin muzzle brake to reduce recoil...and because it makes it look bad ass when it shoots flames out the end. I then proceeded to put it in an Ati tactical stock with collapsible butt and added Knight's Armament Company rails to the front of the stock to ""beefin"" up the area in which I held the stock. I really liked the way it felt, very smooth shooter but when I seen the Cbrps Bullpup Stock I fell in love. I ordered it, put it on and shot it. I liked it but wanted the shell deflector taken off so I could leave the dog rail system on as a cheek rest. I love the way it came out and it has always been a range favorite but its time to focus on getting my arsenal to just a few calibers and it is time to part with it. I have all of the original pieces as well just in case you feel like tweaking it in some way. (The picture of the gun is the actual gun, the carry handle on top is detachable. the Ati stock pictured is exact one I have just a picture of the internet) I will include with the Trade 2 30rd steel sks mags and 40rds of ammo to get you started.

Here is the description from Remington:

 The Model 700 Varmint-Tactical Rifle is a revolutionary system optimized for extended range precision and mobility. Its triangular barrel contour is a product of years of rigorous research and development focused on reducing weight, enhancing rigidity and promoting rapid heat dissipation. To decrease recoil and muzzle jump, this uniquely contoured 22"" barrel has an integral muzzle brake that's machined in during production. Along with the barrel design, brought together a host of other cutting edge features on this super accurate Model 700 platform. The results are nothing short of astounding. Chambered for the inherently tight grouping 223 and 308 calibers, each model engineered with a rate of twist optimized for tactical style bullets, the Model 700 VTR is compact and swift handling thanks to its sleek lines and short action. The legendary ""three-rings-of-steel"" and the many other superior design elements of this rifle deliver the highest degree of out-of-the-box accuracy available today. Plus, it's matched with the X-Mark Pro Trigger system for the ultimate in crispness and shot control. For improved consistency, the green synthetic stock has a vented beavertail forend that promotes rapid cooling. Its overmold accents provide a firm gripping surface and the dual sling swivel studs permit convenient attachment of a bipod and a sling."

I have a very hard to find Smith & Wesson Governor with Crimson Trace LaserGrips.  If you are familiar with the Taurus Judge,  think of this as its more superior American cousin. 
It takes 6 rounds (vs. 5 on the Judge).  
It shoots .45 Colt, .410 shotshells, and unlike the Judge, .45 ACP with the help of moon clips.
Comes with Crimson Trace LaserGrip, as well as tritium front night sight.
Oh, yeah, and it's a Smith and Wesson!

It is in very good condition, but there is one chip on the frame near the front sight, which I included a pic of.  I got it used so I don't know the actual round count.  I didn't get the factory box or anything but I do have some moon clips and moon clip case removal tool on order.  I'm also purchasing a hard plastic case for it.

With the Crimson Trace laser, these msrp for over $1000, and actually retail around $900.  I'm asking $800.  Face to face in Portland metro area only, with Oregon ID and preferably CHL.  If you are from out of state (yes, that includes Vancouver), I can't legally sell you this gun so don't ask."

The gun still has the factory protective oil on it, so it's the same as if you were to buy it from the manufacturer.

Weight: 40 ozs.
Capacity: 8+1 Rounds
Trigger pull: 4lbs (nice)
Twist: 1:16” RH
Rifle Grooves: 6

I love this gun, but it was impulse buy for me, and I decided I prefer polymer handguns.  For those of you not familiar with the 10mm cartridge: it's essentially a 41 mag in terms of power, etc. You can buy anything from low range man stoppers to high power bear rounds.  I love the round for the versatility, and will gladly keep the gun, but I thought I would throw it out there to see if there are any takers.

Price is firm, I'm just trying to break even.  These are averaging $650 on Gunbroker, and there's shipping too.  Once you see the gun in person, and look at all of the specs, you'll want to buy it.  I also have 150 rounds of factory 10mm self defense ammo, all high quality (Hornady, etc.).  If you want the ammo, it's $150.  

Buyer must be 21 years of age, no felonies, a U.S. citizen, and show me state photo ID and a CCW if available.  Like all firearms sales, buyer pays for FFL background checks, etc.  I was told there's a place by me that does it for $15, but I'll verify that.

All of the accessories pictured will fit the full-size Springfield XD Service and Tactical pistols.  The Blackhawk holster is a Level 2 retention holster, and the MTac is an extremely effective tuckable deep-concealment holster.  

The pistol itself has very little carry time (only carried it primarily for about a year) and about 500 rounds through it.  Extremely reliable, XD pistols are lightweight polymer framed pistols with the addition of a grip safety and Browning grip angle similar to the 1911.  Many find the Browning grip more comfortable than the Glock and find the grip safety a reassurance for home/carry use.

The gun has an accessory rail, large slide release, excellent night sights (IMO a requirement for a carry gun), simple takedown for easy cleaning, and visual/tactile indicators for loaded chamber and striker cocking."

Extended takedown lever
Extended mag release
Extended slide catch
Mirror polished internals
Zev Tech Glockworks V3 connector

Spare ZevWorks V3 connector, couple spare trigger return springs, one is a 6 lb, other is 5lb (stock)

Got this gun used about a year ago and have put about 50 rounds through it. The rifle looks brand new and is in great condition overall. Price is firm. Not really looking to trade, but could possibly be interested in a nice 1911 .45ACP. Will also throw in a used Winchester soft case. Had this gun on sale before for about 2 months and received a bunch of calls on it, but haven't had the time until now to get around to selling it. Face to face sale only, not looking to ship.

I've had a number of these over the years and this one is the best  example. The bluing is rich, dark and is 99.9% intact with no imperfections that I can see. The revolver also has a bright bore with no  pitting or rust, and all the others that I've owned had dark, butserviceable bores. Additionally the grips are a deep dark walnut color while all the others I've owned always had light wood (almost blond) colored grips. Bottom line is that you'd be hard pressed to try to upgrade this revolver. 

It comes with an original and well marked holster that is in absolutely excellent condition along with an original cord type lanyard. There is also an original  wood handle Nagant screwdriver & cleaning rod both of which stow away in the holster. 

Perhaps the most interesting feature is the new & never fired conversion cylinder chambered for .32 ACP which is much less expensive and easier to find than  the original cartridge - the 7.62 Nagant. These conversion cylinders were available for a time about 10 years ago, but have become next to impossible to  find today. The conversion cylinders do require some hand fitting since the factory tolerances on the M95 varied slightly  over time. I have done the fitting so now all that is required is some normal use.  

Finally one 50 round box of PPU brass case/non corrosive 7.62 Nagant ammo is included as well as one 50 round box of Fiocchi .32 ACP 

Price is $350 with pickup in the Valrico/Brandon area. You must be a Florida resident and at least 21 years old to purchase. Thanks for looking."

Ordered a couple of weeks ago for a build I had in the works - my plans have changed to a KISS build so this Rail System is now available.

Designed by Knights Armament as an easily installed free-float option to their normal drop-in (RAS) rail system. Upper and lower sections lock together with slots in the front of each section and attach at the rear of both sections by clamps to the barrel nut, Upper free-float rail section also bolts onto the front of the rail section of the upper receiver. Intended for use with an Aimpoint on the raised section - or there is enough space for an ACOG to the rear of it. 

*Unlike most free-float rails it installs in under 10 minutes WITHOUT removing the front sight base/gas block OR the front handguard mount on an M4 carbine!

*And unlike almost all drop-in Rail upgrades, there is NO rail or barrel movement when using a VFG or when putting twisting forces on the rail.

This is a Full KAC Kit and contains: Upper & lower locking free-float rail sections with heat guard, KAC vertical forward grip, 3 full-length KAC rail covers and 1 x half-length rail cover. All fixtures and fittings.

I am slowly trimming down the collection in favor of something more conventional.  This is an EXCELLENT condition M72A tube with insert.  This would be excellent for a re-enactor, or for someone who collects weapons, or who wants a unique prop.  I am NOT willing to part out the round and the tube, they are for sale only as a set.  all deals are present on the tube, front and rear sight are intact, shoulder rest is intact, shoulder strap and end tubes are present.  

Price is firm, you may be able to find a cheaper tube, but you will not be able to find a cheaper 66MM rocket.

I will tale certain firearms in trade, prefer a .22 for the other half.

And just in case you think I am selling this with an active rocket, this is am inert, training rocket."
