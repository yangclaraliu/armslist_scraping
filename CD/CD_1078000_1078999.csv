Thank You for your dedication to Colorado, Thank You for employing Coloradans, and supporting their families, Thank you for supporting the US Military, and Thank You for your excellent products.

It appears the Legislature is about to make it impossible for you to do business in Colorado, and I for one will truly be sad to see you leave.  I hope a nice state like Wyoming will give you a good home and support your company like Colorado legislators would not.
While the people of Colorado support you and your products in great numbers, we are having great difficulty, like the rest of the country, in obtaining your products.  Our opportunity to get them is likely about to end.
If it comes to a ""nuclear"" option, I have a suggestion for one last $@#! You to the Colorado Legislature.  I would love to see you drive a semi truck FULL of magazines of all types to the Denver metro area and have a massive ""moving sale"" to ensure that MagPul will live on in Colorado even after the Legislature effectively evicts you.  I'm sure I could arrange for a location for the sale, and even have media cover the event.  I would just LOVE to see a 100,000 -  20 and 30 round magazines sell to the public on TV to flip the bird our ""representatives"" and ensure that their meaningless ban remains meaningless.

Can you help us out?

Thanks in advance.

P.S. I know the fight is not over yet, and I will be calling my representative AGAIN every time a new bill is headed for a vote.  With luck we may still get this knee-jerk stupidity stopped, but just in case, please consider my ""nuclear"" option."

This is a NIB Windham Weaponry AR-15 SRC model: R16M4FTT. It comes with the factory hard case, one 30rd factory mag, sling, and owner's manual.  This one is the flat top, optics ready model with no front sight post to get in the way of your sight picture. 

Windham Weaponry makes one of the best AR type rifles you can buy. Certainly much better than DPMS, Del-Ton, Spikes, and Bushmaster. Like S&W, they have a lifetime factory warranty that goes with the rifle.  In other words you could be the 10th owner and you still have a lifetime warranty from Windham, same as if you bought it new. 

The price is $1,600 or best offer over $1,500.  I will not take less than that.  Cash only, NO TRADES.  I just bought it so I paid a lot for it too.  I'm only selling it because I ended up winning two in separate bidding on an auction site.

Unless you're willing to meet me in the Milwaukee area another day, of course.

I'm willing to consider selling or trading one or all of the following from my collection.

Savage .300 Win Mag with Blazer 3-9x40 scope, extendable bipod, detachable box magazine, and recoil pad.  Fired approximately 20 rounds while sighting in and that's it.  Has an Uncle Mike's sleeve on the butt which will hold 9 rounds.

Remington 500 12 gauge shotgun, pistol grip in rear and on slide, heat shield, 6 shell holder on side, and flashlight.  I have the stock for it if you would prefer it instead of the pistol grip.  Comes with 5 rounds of 00 buckshot and 5 slugs.

Ruger New Model Blackhawk .357 magnum (fires .38 and +/+P rounds).  Single action, from the early 70's as near as I could trace.  Blue is worn but the gun functions flawlessly and is very accurate due to the 6 1/2"" barrel.  Comes with a drop-leg holster and 3-position holster.  Hogue molded grip to reduce recoil, and original wood grips with Ruger medallion.

Rossi .357 magnum stainless steel snubnose (fires same rounds as above).  DA/SA, six shot.  Only fired a few times, but was my daily concealed carry gun for about five years.  Comes with Uncle Mikes IWB and ankle holsters.

Ruger P97 .45 with two mags, gun lock, magazine loader, instructions, and original box.  Comes with a black leather belt slim-line holster.

Hi Point .45 in original box with lifetime warranty, factory magazine, trigger lock, new (uninstalled) ghost sight, ECI.  Fired approximately 50 times, then stuck in my truck and left alone for the last six years or so, except for regular cleaning and oiling.  Comes with a Fobus paddle holster used less than five times.

Phoenix Arms HP22 with original magazine and a leather IWB holster.  Owned since it was new over a decade ago, fired plenty but still works well.  Starting to have some feeding problems occasionally, but that's due to the magazine spring starting to wear out and I haven't bothered to buy a new one since it's not often enough to bother me when I'm out plinking.

New in package Daisy air rifle with variable pump (to control the pressure and power), and a 4x15 scope.  Fires BB's and all .177 pellets.

Adjustable drop-leg holster in green camo that can be made to fit most semi-autos
Soft zippered case that will fit the .22 or the snub nose .357
Plano Gun Guard locking hard rifle case that can fit the Savage another rifle or shotgun (minus the pistol grips)

Zippered soft case that fits the shotgun

Slide Width: .94""
Weight: Pistol 15.8 ounces, Magazine 1.9 ounces

Magazine: 1 - 5 rd flush floorplate
The CM Series, which debuted in spring 2011 with the CM9, takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel, 9 mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM4043 has the same external dimensions as the PM4043, which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel.

The CM4043 is chambered in a .40 S&W caliber, has a 3.1"" barrel and an overall length of 5.47"", with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 15.8 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models include: the CM4043 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple engraved markings instead of roll marking; and finally, the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

The CM40 boasts real sights, which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally, the slide does lock back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of other value priced compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM40 slide is machined from solid 416 stainless steel with a matte finish and is only .94 inch wide. Each gun is shipped with one 5 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush floorplate. Magazines are made in the USA, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after many uses.

Just like the CM9, the new CM40 will include all of the great features that make Kahr pistols one of a kind. Kahr's seven patents result in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today:
- The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds.
- Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety), and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations. Many lower cost compact semi-autos on the market today do not have firing pin blocks in their design.
- Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame, and since there is no hammer, the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price, but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols.

Up for trade is a great Glock 23 in .40 S&W.  This is an early 3rd Gen model without the dipped extractor, which is a good thing.  I don't have the box or docs, but this pistol will come with two 13 round magazines and night sights.  This pistol is in G to VG condition.  The night sights are on the dim side, but they still work in the dark.  I'm not a .40 shooter, so I'd like to trade this for a 9mm, 45 or a .357 or .327.  I don't have any cash to ad and don't expect new guns, but straight trades for guns in good condition will work.

 Product Description The Bushmaster C15 Carbines are a unique hybridization of traditional AR-15 type features with space-age Carbon 15 composite molded receivers for light weight and rugged durability.

The barrel and other critical steel parts are manganese-phosphate-finished for corrosion and rust protection. The Carbon 15's safety levers have color-coded markings on both sides of the receiver for quick visual check of firing condition.

This is not a WASR or Saiga. The Yugo M70AB2 is one of the very best AK47's ever made. It has a thicker receiver (1.5mm) than nearly all other AK's (1mm) built by D.C. Industries (considered by many to be the best U.S. made AK receiver), slant muzzle break and grenade launching sight (for all your grenade launching needs, lol). This rifle also has an ORIGINAL underfolding stock. (Look closely at any Yugo underfolder you see elsewhere and compare it to mine). This has original wood furniture. You can refinish the wood, or put a black tactical stock on it, but I wouldn't do either--I like the original.  Comes with one 30 round Combloc steel mag (I believe it's Bulgarian). 

I would prefer to trade. I already have a full price cash offer for this rifle, but I have to drive over an hour to make it happen. If you want to match the offer and meet me somewhere in Cincinnati, it's yours.

I also have for sale:

SKS
1 black and 1 dark earth Tapco 20rd SKS mags. I have used these a few times, but they are in excellent shape. $45 each. I also have a 30rd Steel SKS magazine I'll sell for $40. 

AK47
5 30rd milsurp Bulgarian steel AK47 mags. This is what everyone wants, but isn't in stock anywhere. I'll sell them for $45 each. 

I also have a sealed can of 700 rounds of 7.62x39 Hotshot ammo (steel cased FMJ laquered, looks just like Wolf). $240"

I have a Star Modelo A Super with production stamps from 1949. This pistol was issued to the Spanish Military and also has the military proof marks on it. All serial numbers on the pistol match. The bluing is still very dark. The barrel around the gas ports is discolored from use. The bore still seems bright and the rifling still crisp. The pistol has a thumb 1911 style saftey to the rear of the slide catch. Adjustable white dot sights. Wood checkered grips (original). The gun in general looks like a 1911 style pistol but the way the recoil and cycling of the gun operate is more like the Browning HiPower. The Spanish military used these for a reason, it is really nice and fun to shoot. I have owned this gun for 17 years and have put hundreds of rounds through it. I will include 4 magazines and around 100 rounds of ammunition (some old mil-surp ball ammo and some modern hollow points). Please feel free to contact me with any questions. I am pretty firm on the price as I really like this pistol but I am also willing to trade."

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians.

-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39

The Spike’s Tactical Enhanced LPK was designed for the end user who demands the most longevity possible out of the parts in their rifles. The core of the Spike’s Enhanced LPK is the ST Battle Trigger which is a single stage Mil-Spec trigger, rounded hammer, and disconnector that’s plated with Nickel Boron to give the Battle Trigger a very smooth and crisp trigger pull that breaks at around 5 lbs and gets even smoother the more you shoot it.

The Battle Trigger is held in place via KNS Gen II Mod II Anti-Rotation pins which keep the hammer and trigger pins from walking out  and keeps the pin holes from enlarging and “egg-holing” after years and years of use. And we’ve also included an Ambidextrous Safety Selector, our ST Billet Trigger guard with set screw, and our Ergo grip featuring our Spike’s Spider logo.

The Spike’s Enhanced LPK also features a Mil-Spec bolt catch, mag catch, and mag catch button. As well as utilizing Mil-Spec detents, plungers, pins, and springs. We also include quality spiral roll pins for the trigger guard and bolt catch as well as a ¼” allen screw and washer for the Ergo grip.

This is a rare AK, and one of the best with a LOW Serial number (0XXX) 

It comes with 2-30 round mags, and a sling. These are highly desirable because they were a 100% Bulgarian-made Kalashnikovs with a milled receiver, and partially because they had the traditional 45 degree gas block and vented gas tube just as the original Type 3 AK-47 (AKK). Aside from being a semi-automatic rifle, the only real difference from the military AK-47 was the stock set, lack of a lower tang, lack of a threaded barrel, and lack of a sling loop on the left/rear of the receiver. 

It is top of the line when it comes to AK's. Have any questions just ask. I can send more pictures upon request. Thanks for looking"

The Marlin Model 70P, also known as the Marlin Papoose, is a .22 Long Rifle semi-automatic rifle manufactured by Marlin Firearms. The rifle is notable for its portability; it is less than 21 inches (530 mm) in length when disassembled and weighs 3.25 pounds. Disassembly requires loosening a barrel retention nut by hand or with a supplied tool. It is designed as a hiker and camper utility rifle, and appeals to the same market as the AR-7. The Model 70P is based on the earlier Marlin Model 70 (currently listed as Model 795) that has a fixed barrel and conventional stock. Its semi-automatic action originated with the Marlin Model 60. The Marlin Model 70PSS variant has a synthetic stock and stainless steel barrel.

The rifle has an open rear sight and ramp front sight with high visibility orange post surrounded by a cutaway hood. The receiver has an integral .22 tip-off scope mounting rail. Swivel studs for a carrying strap are embedded in the synthetic stock. Included Marlin accessories are a 7 round metal magazine, a tool for adjusting the barrel nut, and a padded nylon carrying case designed to float in water. Optional accessories from Marlin include 7 and 10 round metal magazines 10/22
