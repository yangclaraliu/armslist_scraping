I'll be including two of the polymer 30rd mags. This is a great rifle, and everything is straight on it. The finish is good but not perfect. There are some of the expected handling marks on the finish. I have installed a dragunov style stock. It has been caringly broken in just enough to operate perfectly smooth and reliably, but certainly not worn out or abused. The bolt and trigger surfaces have been polished to insure that everything travels very smoothly. The double-hook trigger on these is superb. I have no problem maintaining a 3"" group at 100-150 yards with cheap Wolf ammo. I did install a new complete recoil spring assembly last month. I have/had many different AK's and the Norinco models are among my very favorite.  Unlike many other variants, the Chinese AK's haven't been imported since it was banned in 1994.  There are a lot of them out there, but it does serve to make them more desirable and collectible than many other variants.  Also, please be clear that the MAK-90 stands head and shoulders above any cheap Romanian, or  any cheap piece of junk you've ever seen from Century Arms or IO.  I also have 500 rounds of wolf non-corrosive ammo that I'll be selling separately for $250.  It is sealed in plastic and in 20ct boxes.

MAKs are better than most AKs presently on the market in the U.S. because:

1) It is not a ""parts"" gun. It is 100% assembled in a foreign arsenal that has been making AKs for decades. This means no canted front sights or other shoddy workmanship. 2) It has a 1.5 mm stamped receiver where most AKs have a 1 mm. This means less heat fatigue in the weapon under hard use. 3) The barrel is thicker than most AKs. How much? Not exactly sure but the difference is visible to the naked eye. 4) The chamber and barrel are chrome lined. Why would anyone want a fighting rifle with out this vital combat feature? 5) The trigger is a double hook. This means a much smoother trigger pull than a single hook. There is no trigger slap. 6) It is selling for a lot less than the fancy Vegas Arsenal with comparable quality in everything but finish and cosmetics. 7) They were imported by the hundreds of thousands. You will be able to find plenty of parts and upgrades/accessories.

To start off with I LOVE GLOCKS!! This gun was purchased in January of this year. I have only taken it to the range twice and did love how it shot. But last week I purchased his bigger brother the Glock 21 and decided their is no need to have both of them. This gun was purchased at 111 Gun Shop here in louisville for $585 +tax($35.10) for a Total of $620.10 After I purchased this gun I thought it would be neat to have a 9 round mag that fits flush with the gun for if I ever decided to carry. It took forever to find one but I was able to get one shipped and I ordered an extra 10 round mag also. They were each $30ish dollars +tax. So the gun is basically brand new in box, shot only a couple times at the range, comes with everything that was in the box on the day I purchased it and comes with a total of 4 Magazines (3 ten rounders, and 1 nine rounder). I am not trying to gouge the price and all that crazy mess. I don't even know if this gun is hard to find or not. I have about $700 in this gun with the extra mags and I know that guns don't really go down in value especially a Glock. I was trying to decide what a fair deal would be so I thought...Gun was $585 new, knock off $20, the extra mags were $30 a piece. I'm gonna lose on taxes and shipping, blah blah. So $625 is what I decided sounds like a fair deal for this gun with 4 mags. I can honestly say that I won't be sad if this doesn't sell. I think its a crime to get rid of any glocks, haha. I'm gonna stick pretty firm to this deal. The only thing Im interested in trading for would be the Springfield XDs 45acp. Thanks for your time. REDACTED Call or text."

Other info:
H&K USP 40 with Jet funnel magwell and 8 Mags. This pistol was used as my carry gun when I lived in FL. Obviously I cant carry here in IL but, its a great pistol! Like all my firearms, this has been taken care of and cleaned after each range trip! If I had to make an honest guess at round count I would say its just about 2,000 which is nothing for a pistol like this. I cant say enough good things about H&K as a company or product. I obviously have to hold the pistol and company in high regard if I was willing to trust it on my hip in case of emergency! 

The pistol comes with original box, paper work, and spent shell as it did from H&K.

The pistol is right at 94% in my estimate. There is a small amount of holster wear at near the front of the pistol and some minor cycle wear on the outside of the barrel. Nothing out of the ordinary.

To add to that, this specific H&K has a Jet-funnel Magwell (best magwell on the market for any gun made IMO) as well as 8 Mags! 4 are your standard 13 round mags that have the original bases and 4 are 16 round high cap mags with updated floor plates to snap right into the jet funnel.

I will keep the ad up for roughly a week, if nothing this will just go over to Gunbroker.

Please feel free to ask any/all question on the pistol"

LWRC® M6A2 5.56 NATO 16"" Semi-Auto Rifle Olive Drab Green

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories. The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

The FNX™-45 is the result of years of innovative product development and advanced engineering techniques. Modeled after the FNP-45 service pistol introduced in 2007 under the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-45 is a double-action/single-action hammer-driven pistol with highly enhanced ergonomics. Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel. The FNX™-45’s checkered polymer frame has multiple interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.

PhaZZer® Enforcer Conductive Energy Weapon (CEW) is a less lethal law enforcement-level self-defense weapon that provides a similar effective take-down power as any Electronic Control Device (ECD) on the market. The Enforcer CEW features an enhanced safety circuit, simplicity of use, comfort, effectiveness, reliability, and consistency at a cost-effective price. PhaZZer® Enforcer offers the following product advantages over the competition:



              PhaZZer® Enforcer has implemented a ""safety shut down circuit technology"" that automatically shuts the unit down if aggregate exposure to the body exceeds 15 seconds. Most up to date medical studies have indicated that this is the new benchmark for standardizing guidelines for responsible and reasonable usage of CEWs deploying into a live target. PhaZZer® designed the safety shut down circuit so the arming mechanism can be overridden by the operator if there is a reasonable and necessary need to use additional force by simply recycling the safety switch to disarm then back to armed mode in a split second. This design is meant to create a psychological awareness during high stress self-defense and/or public safety situations and will limit liability to the Operator, LEO and/or Agency.

              PhaZZer® has taken a different approach for the Enforcer battery system compared to competitive brands. Enforcer CEW contains a rechargeable and replaceable 7.2 Volt Lithium Ion Battery System that allows for approximately 3000, five second electro shock deployments for the lifespan equating to substantial savings for each weapon compared to battery replacement needs through competitive products. (We suggest you see what was spent in your department or agency on Taser® battery purchases in 2011 &/or 2012 and that is the amount you will save in battery purchases going forward).
              PhaZZer® Enforcer has received a positive response to the high intensity LED light compared to the X26® or M26® Taser® models which have a low illumination output LED. The superior Enforcer LED flashlight ultimately eliminates the need to use a separate flashlight in dark areas leaving the operator's other hand free to keep on a sidearm as a backup.
              PhaZZer® Enforcer offers a top of the line clam shell holster that fits the Enforcer CEW ONLY and is made from the best heat and chemical resistance material comprised of nylon 66 that contains a carbon fiber and fiberglass composite. PhaZZer® also offers Grade-A Made in USA leather duty belt holsters, as well as shoulder harness and thigh holsters.
              PhaZZer® Enforcer CEW is a more cost effective option than the Taser® X26. While retaining all of the physical qualities, highest quality components, core capabilities, and top of the line workmanship of Taser® ECDs, you will find that our CEW program will provide a police department, security firm, bail bond agency or individual with MSRP savings of approximately 40% in comparison to the X26 which is the primary ECD of choice preferred by most in the United States LE market.


Aside from the less lethal electronic dart ammunition cartridges, PhaZZer® offers four non-lethal ammunition alternatives which currently are Patent Pending with the USPTO. See PhaZZer ammunition links to learn more. See PhaZZer ammunition links to learn more. https://www.phazzerstore.com/Ammunition_c_10.html No more need for multiple weapons as PhaZZer provides a versatile solution."

This is a rare AK, and one of the best with a LOW Serial number (0XXX) 

It comes with 2-30 round mags, and a sling. These are highly desirable because they were a 100% Bulgarian-made Kalashnikovs with a milled receiver, and partially because they had the traditional 45 degree gas block and vented gas tube just as the original Type 3 AK-47 (AKK). Aside from being a semi-automatic rifle, the only real difference from the military AK-47 was the stock set, lack of a lower tang, lack of a threaded barrel, and lack of a sling loop on the left/rear of the receiver.

You may have seen it before, a too good to be true deal with pictures and everything. I have seen a few assult style rifles selling for well below current market and when I check other listings by these users they end up having multiple listings in multiple states as a ""private party"" how is that possible? Four or five really amazing rifles selling for way below market by a private individual in four or five separate states....smells just like a Craigslist scam. So,if you are contemplating one of these amazing deals first click on the ""listings by user"" link and first see if they have multiple other amazing deals in different locations....if they do then I would proceed with extreme caution....even ask them how they are selling so many great guns in multiple locations. Just be careful.  I imagine these scammer will try to flag this post off so consider reposting it if you feel inclined.

Brand new scope with scope caps. I mounted this scope and sighted in my gun, then went back to my old scope. Nothing wrong with scope, I just liked my old reticle better. I've had the scope a year now and can't return it.

Mint in the box c.1999 Kimber Classic Royal.  Original box, docs, shipping bag, etc.  Original condition, unmodified, hardly a mark on it.  Excellent frame/slide fit, very good barrel fit, nice trigger.  Has been shot very little, ever.  Factory bushing was not well fit, and it has a proper fitting replacement (stock bushing is in box, and one Kimber 8rd magazine).  There is a protective film of grease on the gun so so the finish looks a little mottled in the photo, but it is a deep polished blue - sorry.

Trades I'd be interest in are other 1911s or S&W revolvers, AR types, too. Given condition, etc., trade value is probably about $1100.

I hate to have to say it, but on Armslist it seems necessary: Please no low-ball offers. It only insults me and makes you look stupid and opportunistic.  

With AR prices starting to return to normal, time to get ready to buy one in a few months (I was going to buy an S&W M&P Sport at Christmas - well that didn't work out!).  So this could be traded against something like that, though honestly I'd wait until prices return to sustainable levels to make a trade against an AR.  Gun is in the Seattle area.  Since the web attack, the forum pm system has not been working, so don't assume a pm gets to me.  If you post a response, I'll check back periodically and we can email."

Serious firepower in a small package. The X-10 is a .308 caliber 50 round single stack compact drum designed for Armalite .308 rifles. The magazine easily loads and unloads by operating the front hand wheel. Designed to operate in automatic and semiautomatic applications, it employs a larger hand-wheel and double spring for increased reliability. Unique to this magazine's design is a patent pending feed device that allows the magazine to run massive spring pressures without effecting the firearm's bolt operation. The durable body is constructed entirely of aluminum; and finished in a friction reducing ceramic coating. All internal and operating assemblies are made of black oxide steel and aluminum. Comes with a lifetime warranty and includes an instruction manual. Currently available in black. Please note: That with the wide variance in receiver specs there may need some slight fitting in order to work properly. Please read the owners manual before use.

Going fast. I need to clear out inventory as we are moving.
The X-FAL is a .308 caliber 50 round single stack compact drum designed for Metric FAL Type rifles. The magazine easily loads and unloads by operating the front hand wheel. Designed to operate in automatic and semiautomatic applications, it employs a larger hand-wheel and double spring for increased reliability. Unique to this magazine's design is a patent pending feed device that allows the magazine to run massive spring pressures without effecting the firearm's bolt operation. The durable body is constructed entirely of aluminum; and finished in a friction reducing ceramic coating. All internal and operating assemblies are made of black oxide steel and aluminum. Comes with a lifetime warranty and includes an instruction manual.
Note: Requires unbolting your BHO device on your gun.
