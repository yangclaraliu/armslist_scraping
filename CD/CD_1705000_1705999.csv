I have been to several different gun stores over the past few weeks and nearly all of them have some .22 and .223 and it's way cheaper than everyone is listing it here on arms list. A brick of 500 .22 for $55-$100? You have to be kidding. I hope no one is dumb enough to pay these prices. Walmart gets ammo on Tuesdays and the one near me has .22, 9mm, and .45ACP nearly every time I go into the store. Fin Feather and Fur had American Eagle .22 LR for $35 for 450 with several bricks on the shelf when I was there today. They also had CCI mini mags $10 for 100. So if you are paying $55 for 500 bulk you are just being a sucker. I have seen .223 At Cabela's, Fin Feather, Nortons, and Gander for $10 20 rounds of either Federal or PMC. Cabela's has even had the 62 grain green tip Lake City $250 for 420 rounds in an ammo can. 

The prices here are a joke, don't pay them. And for all of you bastards who are buying .22 for $20 a brick then listing it here for $100, stop being dicks."

This gun comes equipped with everything you see attached, plus the original parts that were swapped out for all the custom accessories. The barrel has an added free floating NC Star quad-rail system to attach any accessories that use rails. At the butt is a FAB Defense- 6 position collapsible stock, with an adjustable cheek piece, allowing you to rest your cheek at the right height for steady shots while looking down the scope. The cheek rest can also be lowered down so you can look down the original iron sights while in close quarters. The original carrying handle has been left on, and a NC Star weaver rail mount system has been added to allow the scope to be mounted to the top. The scope is a Firefield 2.5, designed specifically for .223 caliber rifles, which includes an adjustable laser site on the side, and an illuminated red/green mil-dot reticle with includes bullet drop compensators. There are turrets on the scope that allow for windage and M.O.A adjustments, as well as a turret on the top that allows for distance compensation, of 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 yards. I shoot this gun consistently out to 300 yards (farthest my range has,) but it is made to shoot well past that. The magazine port has an added FAB Defense custom mag-well grip with finger grooves for added stability. There is also a FAB Defense tactical fore grip attached to the bottom of the quad-rail system, at the push of a button the grip will split and extend into a bi-pod, with adjustable heights. In the fore grip there are grooves to allow for pressure activated switches to be attached.  Attached to one side of the grip is a Xenon Combat flashlight, with 126 lumens maximum output, that turns on by squeezing and applying pressure to the switch. Also included are 2-30 round high capacity magazines, 2-20 round magazines,  a tactical carrying case, and the original cleaning kit that came inside the original stock. A lot of time and money have gone into the build of this AR and $2000 is much less than I have put into it after aquiring and adding all the custom parts. Serious inquiries only please, low offers will not be considered. I also have aquired 100 rounds of .223 55 grain ammo and will include it with purchase. Call/Text Nine-Two-Zero 319-1140 -Ryan"

1.  The Book of Archery
2.  The Archer's Craft

Glenn St. Charles, was born in Seattle, Washington, December 15, 1911, the son of a timber cruiser who, at the turn of the century, brought his family from Alpena, Michigan to the timber country of the great northwest.

While still in grade school, Glenn spent several summer vacations with his dad in timber-cruising camps in the Kaniksu national Forest of northern Idaho. This was the backdrop for Glenn to observe ways of the animals of these remote regions — deer, elk, moose, and bear. He fashioned flies to entice eager trout to the hook. He became a bowhunter, a bowyer, making hundreds of bows from the rich-colored yew he found combing the Cascade Mountains. He became a fletcher, making arrows from the tough spruce and Alaska cedar. He cut crude blades out of old re-tempered hand saws for broadheads.

Glenn watched bowhunting come to Washington State in 1938, and after a few years, saw it disappear in one day by action of the Washington State Game Commission. He was there when it was reestablished the very next day, due to a plea by Washington State’s father of bowhunting, Kore T. Duryee. This “bended knee” experience was forever imprinted in Glenn’s mind — a reminder of how fragile success can be. He became the watchdog of bowhunting in Washington State and eventually throughout the country.

When the bow was questioned as to its being a viable hunting weapon by concerned wildlife agencies everywhere, St. Charles and his friends found the answer in the Boone and Crockett record-keeping concepts. Thus the Pope and Young Club was formed and now stands as the pillar of bowhunting everywhere.

St. Charles is the founder of the Pope and Young Club. He is an emeritus member of the Boone and Crockett Club. Throughout his bowhunting career, he has received nearly every award the National Field Archery Association, the Pope and Young Club, and the Professional Bowhunters.

Don't. Just, do not support the disgusting practices that are being carried out on this site. When you see someone selling .22lr for $0.20-.30 a round, or .223 for $1 per round, DON'T TALK TO THESE PEOPLE, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM.
These people are the largest reason that ammo is so difficult to find right now. They go down to the store at 6am, buy every single box they can (even if they have a 1 box limit. These people are scammers, they know how to get around it.) then immediately come onto Armslist, and sell it foe $50 a box. This is truly disgusting that people do this. I understand that everyone wants to try and turn a quick buck now and again, but the way this is going has got to stop. This hobby is a truly wonderful one, but we need to support each other during this shortage. We cannot support these people and their practices.

If you want to be able to enjoy this hobby and be able to find ammo, we all need to vote with our wallets, and vote these people out with their hoarding and overpriced ammo."

Don't. Just, do not support the disgusting practices that are being carried out on this site. When you see someone selling .22lr for $0.20-.30 a round, or .223 for $1 per round, DON'T TALK TO THESE PEOPLE, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM.
These people are the largest reason that ammo is so difficult to find right now. They go down to the store at 6am, buy every single box they can (even if they have a 1 box limit. These people are scammers, they know how to get around it.) then immediately come onto Armslist, and sell it foe $50 a box. This is truly disgusting that people do this. I understand that everyone wants to try and turn a quick buck now and again, but the way this is going has got to stop. This hobby is a truly wonderful one, but we need to support each other during this shortage. We cannot support these people and their practices.

Don't. Just, do not support the disgusting practices that are being carried out on this site. When you see someone selling .22lr for $0.20-.30 a round, or .223 for $1 per round, DON'T TALK TO THESE PEOPLE, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM.
These people are the largest reason that ammo is so difficult to find right now. They go down to the store at 6am, buy every single box they can (even if they have a 1 box limit. These people are scammers, they know how to get around it.) then immediately come onto Armslist, and sell it foe $50 a box. This is truly disgusting that people do this. I understand that everyone wants to try and turn a quick buck now and again, but the way this is going has got to stop. This hobby is a truly wonderful one, but we need to support each other during this shortage. We cannot support these people and their practices.

If you want to be able to enjoy this hobby and be able to find ammo, we all need to vote with our wallets, and vote these people out with their hoarding and overpriced ammo."

Basically this a sweet and a very functional gun. I bought it in near new condition and have only put ten rounds down it to test scope. 
Very light yet very manageable to shoot. It is a stevens (savage), great action for the money. Nikon buckmaster 4.5-14x40 BDC (real sweet!). Package includes a couple boxes of ammo and a case...

I need the gas port drilled/broken bit removed. Should be a relatively easy job, I just dont have the right tools.

Im sure a drill press with the right bit can do it too. $40 cash for anyone that can fix my gas port.
