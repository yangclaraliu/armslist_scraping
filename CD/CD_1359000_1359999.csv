I have only had this piece for about 9 months now I am the first owner I purchased it from the American Historical Foundation in Ashland, Virginia. I honestly regret selling it b/c there are only 1000 of these world wide. I have number 986 I barley made the chance to owning this fine pistol. Of course this is a working firing firearm and it has never been fired before neither handled with humans hands unless with lab gloves were worn first. I honestly never had to handle it anyways until I decided that I have to list it so its only been handled by me with the lab gloves on. Some of the neat features in this pistol are: its a 1911 style, it has real rattlesnake skin grips, its 24 karat Gold in several areas, its displayed in both factory hard colt case and a walnut glass display case with a key to lock the case, its got the Colt Legacy Emblem embedded in the grips, its the colt legacy edition, its got all factory paperwork and documentation/ certificate of authenticity, it also has the factory lock, silicon cleaning towel, white lab gloves, regular factory black rubber grips, and the factory traveling bag used only for traveling and not storing the pistol for a long period of time. This pistol is absolutely beautiful a must have for colt collectors or any collector, you don't find these for sale everyday. Whoever has one of these pistols most likely has it stored away in their safe to past down the family generation, I obviously cant do that I wish I could but I have to move away. I honestly have not seen one of these sold before yet, so they are really hard to come by, but here's your chance to own one now. Enough said the pictures will do the rest of the talking for me and you decide. Definitely bid with confidence on this one, this pistol will always hold its value and rise over the years pass by. I will guarantee you wont find one like the condition this one is in. This is factory new and I am the original owner. Its been a safe queen since the day I bought it. For all bidders please know your state and local laws for owning this piece. This is considered a pistol so legal age is 21."

Trade for Glock 26. Maybe S&W M642/442. I might have some cash for the right trade.
It has some holster wear like most of these German police buy backs do, though not the worst I've seen.
Most of these guns were fired very little, just like American police buybacks.
The main springs on P6 firearms are stiff (safety?) I replaced it with one for a P225 (civilian version) It shoots nice.
Manufacture date 1983. Includes original plastic case and two 7 round magazines.
$500 cash price. You are welcome to shoot me an offer but forgive me if I don't respond.

I have only had this piece for about 9 months now I am the first owner I purchased it from the American Historical Foundation in Ashland, Virginia. I honestly regret selling it b/c there are only 1000 of these world wide. I have number 986 I barley made the chance to owning this fine pistol. Of course this is a working firing firearm and it has never been fired before neither handled with humans hands unless with lab gloves were worn first. I honestly never had to handle it anyways until I decided that I have to list it so its only been handled by me with the lab gloves on. Some of the neat features in this pistol are: its a 1911 style, it has real rattlesnake skin grips, its 24 karat Gold in several areas, its displayed in both factory hard colt case and a walnut glass display case with a key to lock the case, its got the Colt Legacy Emblem embedded in the grips, its the colt legacy edition, its got all factory paperwork and documentation/ certificate of authenticity, it also has the factory lock, silicon cleaning towel, white lab gloves, regular factory black rubber grips, and the factory traveling bag used only for traveling and not storing the pistol for a long period of time. This pistol is absolutely beautiful a must have for colt collectors or any collector, you don't find these for sale everyday. Whoever has one of these pistols most likely has it stored away in their safe to past down the family generation, I obviously cant do that I wish I could but I have to move away. I honestly have not seen one of these sold before yet, so they are really hard to come by, but here's your chance to own one now. Enough said the pictures will do the rest of the talking for me and you decide. Definitely bid with confidence on this one, this pistol will always hold its value and rise over the years pass by. I will guarantee you wont find one like the condition this one is in. This is factory new and I am the original owner. Its been a safe queen since the day I bought it. For all bidders please know your state and local laws for owning this piece. This is considered a pistol so legal age is 21."

The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, a Magpul MBUS backup sight and a folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability.

A Very Nice Single Action Colt with dual cylinders ! If you think it is hard to find a New in the Box Dual Cylinder 4 inch, or 6 inch; it is not ! ; when compared to finding the 7 1/2 inch Buntline to finish a Colt Collection of all 3 Barrel lengths All in NIB condition."

Ftf only no shipping. Willing to meet half way if you pay a little extra. If you have a cheap handgun to trade i have more. 223/5.56 rounds i could throw in on a deal so just ask. Would also trade ammo for 22lr ammo or 40 cal ammo. Im not gouging so i believe you shouldnt gouge your prices to me. I think 60 rounds for one brick of 22lr is very fair. Or 2 boxes of 223 for one box of 50 40 cals. Would also trade some ammo for. 223 dies rcbs

This is probably the cheapest on here, and hopefully these gougers realize they cant do what they are doing.

Before the hate mail comes to me i did pay alittle over $9 a box at rural king for this stuff, so no i am not gouging it just really was that much.

I have only had this piece for about 9 months now I am the first owner I purchased it from the American Historical Foundation in Ashland, Virginia. I honestly regret selling it b/c there are only 1000 of these world wide. I have number 986 I barley made the chance to owning this fine pistol. Of course this is a working firing firearm and it has never been fired before neither handled with humans hands unless with lab gloves were worn first. I honestly never had to handle it anyways until I decided that I have to list it so its only been handled by me with the lab gloves on. Some of the neat features in this pistol are: its a 1911 style, it has real rattlesnake skin grips, its 24 karat Gold in several areas, its displayed in both factory hard colt case and a walnut glass display case with a key to lock the case, its got the Colt Legacy Emblem embedded in the grips, its the colt legacy edition, its got all factory paperwork and documentation/ certificate of authenticity, it also has the factory lock, silicon cleaning towel, white lab gloves, regular factory black rubber grips, and the factory traveling bag used only for traveling and not storing the pistol for a long period of time. This pistol is absolutely beautiful a must have for colt collectors or any collector, you don't find these for sale everyday. Whoever has one of these pistols most likely has it stored away in their safe to past down the family generation, I obviously cant do that I wish I could but I have to move away. I honestly have not seen one of these sold before yet, so they are really hard to come by, but here's your chance to own one now. Enough said the pictures will do the rest of the talking for me and you decide. Definitely bid with confidence on this one, this pistol will always hold its value and rise over the years pass by. I will guarantee you wont find one like the condition this one is in. This is factory new and I am the original owner. Its been a safe queen since the day I bought it. For all bidders please know your state and local laws for owning this piece. This is considered a pistol so legal age is 21."

I have a like new Fire Fyter 3 cubic foot safe. This has a 1 hour 1700 degree rating. If you have been researching gun safes, you will realize this is much better than most safes. In addition to a digital combination lock, it has a hidden key override in case of failure or EMP.

I have included pictures of the safe with a Glock box as well as Glock 30 for size reference.  You can fit 10+ pistols in this safe without stacking. Also, with the watertight seal, this will protect your guns and documents in the event of flooding.

Safe is in like new condition, and has all paperwork, and accessory items. I have never set a code on the digital key pad. (I have the original factory code on the supplied paperwork).

This is a great safe as a main safe, or a master bedroom closet safe for docs and CCW/bedside guns.

Yes, you can get a larger safe for this money or cheaper. However, with safes, you really get what you pay for. This is a quality safe at a reasonable price.

I have cleaned it muzzle to breach and it appears UNFIRERD! I have all paper work spent casing, lock key and S&W warranty card unmarked. Gun is Glock 19 sized (not full sized but not a sub compact either), concealable with an inside the waistband (IWB) holster. Gun has a 4 inch barrel and came with (2) 16 round magazines. I purchased 4 additional magazines. When I bought them I paid $60 per magazine and have never fired from most of them. You cannot find these magazines for sale anymore! 

Buying this gun from academy today will cost $347 after tax and i have $240 invested in magazines. That puts my cost at $587... I'm willing to lose $50 and you get a brand new gun and magazines that cant be found anywhere else.

My total price is $537

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market.

Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

Sig Sauer
938 Extreme

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!


With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. 

Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue G-10 Piranha grips in black and grey provide maximum grip and a distinctive look.

This is a Swedish company Interdynamic AB of Stockholm, creator of famous MP-9 submachine gun based on the Carl Gustav M45.  Designed for military applications but Interdynamic AB did not find a government contract, so it was brought to US market as an open-bolt semi-automatic KG-9 pistol. KG-9 open bolt design makes it easy to anyone to convert to full auto and because of this, ATF forced Interdynamic to redesign it into a closed-bolt system, to make it harder to anyone to convert to full-auto and this variant was called KG-99. Conversion manual to full auto is still widely available but you have to have a class 3 license legally own a fully automatic weapon. May consider to trade with .223/5.56 ammo in equal value or a 5.7x28mm ammo also in equal value."

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

    Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
    Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
    Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
    Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
    Includes binoculars!

This sight-ready platform allows the operator to mount any optic without worrying about the sight tower. The gas block accepts all iron sights designed to work on the Mil-Spec Picatinny rail. 

The Sig M400 Series Tactical Rifle was designed for use in law enforcement, military operations, or the sporting field as well as competitive shooting. The SIG M400 is a true AR platform tactical rifle. Provides unparalleled accuracy, with a 16” chrome-lined and phosphate coated barrel that provides maximum durability and corrosion resistance. A 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum forged lower receiver adds to the durability and reliability.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Description:
The KWA Full Metal M1911 Mark III PTP Airsoft Gun is an astounding work of art. The frame and slide are constructed of metal which give the gun a very realistic look, feel, and sound when fired. Aiding in that amazing sound is the metal hammer and stiff hammer and slide springs. The barrel is conical which eliminate the barrel bushing, the end result is an updated 1911 look. The guide rod sits underneath the barrel to keep the slide on track. The rear sight has dots for faster target acquisition. The grip safety comes complete with a beaver tail to help control recoil and the traditional thumb safety is ambidextrous. The trigger has three holes bored out of it and the hammer is bored into an triangular shape. Finally, to help reloading, the magazine well has been slightly elongated and beveled at the entrance. KWA is well known for making some of the highest quality airsoft guns in the world, and this new 1911 definitely ranks up there with the best of them.

This will come with a BCM BCG and Colt MPC-marked Bolt. C-marked Colt carrier is available but will cost extra, as I am planning to use it for a new build. You'd be crazy to do it though, since the BCM carrier is newer and better anyway.

This carries the rare combined ""SPORTER M4 CARBINE"" rollmark, of which Colt says only about 500 were made after they changed from the standard ""SPORTER"" rollmark. Check the boards, there is plenty of speculation that this will become a rare find for collectors, years from now.

This is also a magnificent specimen of a Colt, with none of the marks, scratches etc. that brand new Colts are infamous for. The fit between upper and lower receivers is almost perfect, with virtually no play between them (also common with Colts). So it's not only the standard Colt workhorse, but also a great show pony.

 FEG SMC-918

When K.B.I. observed the popularity of the SMC-380 in the U.S., it decided to import the 9mm Makarov version, the SMC-918. The Hungarians had made this model (with slight modifications) since the late 1950s, with importation beginning in late 1994.

The SMC-918 we tested handled well. With its titanium and aluminum frame as well as its clean lines and rounded corners, this pistol carries comfortably in one's pocket and is light and handy. It also boasts good instinctive pointing, with a trigger pull that is noticeably smoother and lighter than that found in the SMC-380s tested. Despite the improved trigger pull, however, the SMC-918 proved slightly less accurate than the SMC-380. Whether this is a quirk of the 9mm Makarov cartridge or an inherent situation is difficult to tell. Regardless, the test pistol had no trouble feeding any ammunition tested, including Hornady's XTP hollowpoint. Recoil with SMC-918 was sharp, similar to firing a small .38-caliber revolver. The shape of its backstrap could be at fault. By rounding off much more than that of the Walther PPK, for instance, the Hungarian designers have created a gun that is smoother in contour but a bit more difficult to fire. Compact guns are, after all, an exercise in compromise.

The SMC-918 offers the 9mm Makarov cartridge in a package that is appreciably smaller and lighter than the Soviet-designed Makarov pistol or its derivatives. The SMC-918 is, in fact, the smallest pistol currently in production for the Makarov round. The price to pay is a gun that is easier to carry and slightly more difficult to shoot. Given its mission of self-defense, though, that's a compromise many buyers will surely find acceptable."
