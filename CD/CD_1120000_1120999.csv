I have a practically brand new SIG P290RS
Here is the deal, I bought the gun yesterday for my wife along with a Taurus 380 for myself.
Today me and the wife went to the gun range to get acquainted with our new guns.
Long story short I no longer have a 380 because she loved it.
I already own a couple compact 9MM's so I dont have a need to keep this one.
It had 3 clips shot through it today.
It comes ready to carry with a SIG holster, 2 mags, night sights and best of all a Laser.
I tried to get a descent pic with the laser on.
I have to say it is a SWEET gun!

Magpul MOE handguards, MOE carbine stock, MOE pistol grip (with storage compartment), MOE vertical grip and a Magpul Back-up Sight all come as standard equipment on this exceptional carbine

Colt’s rifles are the only rifles available to sportsmen, hunters and other shooters that are manufactured in the Colt factory and based on the same military standards and specifications as the United States issue Colt M16 rifle and M4 carbine. Colt customers want the best, and none of Colt’s competitors can match the quality, reliability, accuracy and performance built into every Colt rifle.

It has a ""finger"" that presses against the back of your trigger and this pressure is adjustable.

The effect is to increase the force to return your trigger to the forward position.

Which means the Hellfire system allows you to shoot your gun at ""full-auto"" rates even though you are still pulling the trigger each time a round is discharged.

The gear is all in good-great condition, and is priced considerably under value. Cash value is non-negotiable period. Trade value, price will be inflated to compensate for whatever your trade offer is, if your the sort of person attempting that - no weapon gains value after its owned and had hundreds of rounds fired. If your priced 40-100% over what you paid for it, my items will increase the same value.

If you buy all 3 items, the value is exactly 900 Cash. If you buy them individually their value is as listed on the item. Its non-negotiable. Let me re-iterate, non-negotiable. 

Im not interested in comparing your tools you bought online for $10 bucks from a third world country, when a single surgical tool in the STOMP is over 140 dollars, not to mention you can't buy them as an individual. Im not peddling garbage and im not going to deal with people that are.


Rules of the transaction. I will only drive 15 minutes from my location, it will be in a relatively public place during daylight hours. There is no shipping. There are no checks, no gold, no silver, tattoos, and no IOU's. No thugs, gang bangers, felons, or children.  
DESCRIBE YOUR TRADE - just saying 1911 doesn't count. I need estimated round counts, condition, manufacturer, picture(s), etc. Have YOUR HALF of the deal BEFORE contacting me. I have no interest in waiting for you to get paid in 2 weeks, all the while actual buyers miss their opportunity to purchase.

A little bit about the gun:
   -Made in Brazil after Taurus bought the Beretta factory there
   -I looked up the serial number, it was made somewhere around 1987
   -has roughly 1000 rounds through it, very good rifling 
   -very rare duo tone (grey frame black slide) i've never personally seen another like it
   -i have two mags 15&10 (15 has new G.I. spring and follower) 
   -pachmeyer rubberized grips
   -adjustable rear sights 
   -just gave it a trigger job (very smooth, not gritty like other Taurus guns)
   -polished feed ramps 
   -still have the original box (owner's manual is MIA but is in my room somewhere)
   -D/SA 9mm
   - clean

Now the 10/22 
i also keep this gun very clean/ well maintained, this is just your standard 10/22 wooden stock/ flip up rear sight, comes with the factory weaver rail section. Haven't shot it much so it's pretty much brand new. If you come with the right price i'll throw in a CMP hard rifle case. 

I HAVE to sell/trade both. If you want both i'll let it go for $500(no rifle case) or trade for PT1911( see below for details)+ rifle case

This is a 4th Generation Charter Arms “PUG” from the plant in Shelton, Connecticut, and is the best model they’ve ever designed. The alloy frame keeps it light, the 2"" barrel keeps it pocketable, and the .44 Special cartridge packs the punch of a .45 ACP with far less recoil than a .357 Magnum. Magnum recoil is very sharp and snappy, whereas the .44 Special is more like a firm push. This is the best big bore caliber for short barrels or recoil sensitive shooters, and is a very accurate round.

The PUG has a stainless finish, practical sights, and a snag-free DAO hammer. Lockup is very tight and revolver has a VERY low round count. It is practically in like new condition.

There is exactly 120 rounds of defense ammo (80 rds Gold Dot, 20 rds Silvertip) and a couple of loose Remington lead flat tips.  I can also throw in a cheapo IWB holster to complete the package.

I’m asking only $550 CASH for the revolver and ammo, which is a very good deal. Not particularly interested in trades as I’m funding another purchase, but I might consider a K38 Masterpiece or Speed Six with at least a 4"" barrel, or possibly a pre-lock Centennial Airweight.  ONLY interested in .38 Special caliber.

Face to face local transaction with LEGAL buyer only. I reserve the right to refuse to sell to anyone I don’t like, or to withdraw this item from sale if my pending deal falls through. Thanks."

This is a really cool rifle that runs great. This is one of the best MP5 clones out there. They were made in Portugal in the H&K factory. Gun has been fired but in great condition. If you have always wanted an H&K MP5 but can't afford the high prices this is the perfect gun. Here's a little info on the gun
In 1983, the LUSA-A2 SMG was developed by INDEP Industries of Portugal who, at the time, was manufacturing under license from H&K, the HK21 and the HK G3. Improvements and modifications were a continuing process, culminating in 1992, and with a development cost of 2.5 million dollars. The weapons are now used by the Portuguese and three other European countries.

The Name LUSA is derived from Lusitania, which is present day Portugal. Although designed as a military weapon, the LUSA-A2 is well-suited for law enforcement. The trigger group is nearly identical to that of the H&K MP-5 and the barrel is quick-change, similar to the UZI. The bolt and carrier are one unit.

In 2004, INDEP sold all dies, tooling, fixtures and manufacturing rights to group of well established names in the firearms industry. Stan Andrewski, owner of Stan's Gunsmithing for over 30 years in New Hampshire, Jerry Prasser, owner of Recon Ordnance for 29 years in Wisconsin, and Ralph Demicco, owner of Riley's Gun Shop. The company was named LUSA USA.

The LUSA has been approved by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives and is for sale as a semi-automatic firearm to the civilian market. The amount of U.S. manufactured compliant parts has met government requirements.

Springfield Armory's Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used.

I got this in a trade for some non-firearm items I was unloading.  I researched the model and to my surprise it was not a very common model and currently popular.  I also found that survivalists/outdoorsmen/preppers and others are all snatching these up because of their versatility, ease of use, lightweight frame, and cheap ammo.  To be completely honest I have been considering keeping it since I got it because I think it is a really neat gun and I bet it's a blast to shoot!  Unfortunately, I have to keep my eye on the prize and do what I planned to do in the first place.....

Wood is in immaculate condition, like new really.  Barrels have good blueing, almost no patina whatsoever, very good shape for an older model.  No scratches, dents, or rust to speak of.  It releases just right and locks up TIGHT!  Overall I would grade it around 95% like new.

I've owned it for over 20 years and fired exactly 92 rounds through it. It comes with two magazines, the leather holster, two set of grips (OEM brown plastic and Pierce rubber) and an optional two 50-rd boxes of FMJ ammo. When I purchased it I paid extra to the distributor for special hand select. With only very slight bluing wear at the muzzle and safety, I estimate this gun to be 98%.

This is a rare pistol as it has a fixed rear sight. Only a small amount were imported before importation was cut off. Only pistols with a very cheap, low quality adjustable rear sights were allowed to be imported afterward. This one is the real deal. The bore is chrome lined an excellent and the inside of the slide and frame shows little to no wear. The letter code shows this pistol was made in 1960.

From the web: East Germany
The Ernst Thaelman factory in Suhl, Thueringen made what are considered by some to be the finest pre-fall-of-the-Berlin Wall Makarovs. The finish is nice, the fit and machining is of quality you'd expect from a German shop, and they shoot like a dream. Almost all that came into this country had already seen service, so their quality varies by how they were treated by the person who carried them. Nonetheless, most have more holster wear than bore wear. They occasionally still pop up at dealers and at gun shows.

If you check Gunbroker.com right now, you'll find one just like mine already with one bid at $550 before shipping, not to mention the dealer fees for NICS after
you get it here. So my price is firm at $495 for the pistol alone or $545 with the two boxes of ammo. But..	I will entertain trades up or down, so let me know
what you have. No offense intended, but no response means no interest. And I can send larger pics if desired. Thanks for looking."

It's a 1951. It has a waffle top receiver.  The gun is in great shape with very minor wear on the blueing. No pitting or rust. The end of the muzzle has most of the wear.  The stock amd forearm are walnut and have been refinished by me. The reason was the old varnish started to flake in spots. The bore is clean and the action is smooth. 375.00 firm thanks for looking. Any questions please feel free to call or e-mail. Thank you Scott

This is a NIB Bushmaster AR15 Optics Ready, with a 14.5 inch barrel with a Phantom Flash Suppressor for a total barrel length of just over 16 inches. Also, it has a Hard chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long life and ease of cleaning. Its six position tele-stocks is fitted - when retracted, carbine length decreases by 4 inches for convenient handling/storage.
Note, this has the 7075 T6 aircraft-grade aluminum upper and lower for longevity NOT Carbon PLASTIC. I see the plastic guns going at this price and more, this is a much better investment. The gun case and ammunition are not included but picture is the same NIB gun that is for sale.
