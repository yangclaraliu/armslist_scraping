The Rem 870 EXPRESS  when using the pisol grip style stocks is a much better design than the Moss 500 because the Rem 870 has a CROSS BOLT safety that you can engage without moving your hands away from the trigger assembly. The Moss 500""s or like style shotguns that have the SAFETY on the reciever and when set up with pistol grips make you move you hand away from the ready fire position to engage the safety switch on top of reciever. So for a Home ""D"" style pistol grip shotgun the Rem 870 is a wise choose. Remember seconds count in a emergency. Enough with my rant and about this gun...

ATI tactical adujustable stock with pistol grip. (for a Home ""d"" shot gun a pistol grip WITH buttstock is better for control, its much harder for someone to wrestle this away in a struggle)

It's in great shape for it's age. It locks up tight and looks as if it has been fired very, very little. The bore is pristine and there is almost no cylinder ring on this thing. The previous owner did let the pistol get dry at some point over the years so there was a small bit of light surface rust on one side of the end of the barrel when I got it. It has since been well lubed and is hardly noticable. You can see from the pics that the plastic pearl grips have shrunk a little over the years but still function fine. That's all I can think of.. If you'd like to see it in person email me through this ad and we'll get together. Can meet in Jacksonville most days. I'm listing this at a steal for 250 obo. It's a great, fully functional peice of prohibition era history, It's just not my cup of tea.. Feel free to offer up any firearm trades. I'm mostly into pistols but a nice .38 or 357 snubby might catch my eye as well. Maybe a decent shotgun? Cash.. who knows... never hurts to ask. Thanks"

I am selling my custom Ruger No. 1 in .35 Whelen, as I realize I am never going to use it.  I have put approximately 10 rounds through it.  No rust, no gouges. I have added many aftermarket parts to it. This is the only one like it in the world. I know that, because I built it. Here’s what it has:
Hick’s harmonic accurizer
 • Decreases barrel vibration / eliminates shot stringing
Mould’s speed hammer 
 • Decreases lock time
 • Increased striking power of firing pin
Kick-eez recoil pad
Red fiber optic front sight by NECG
Williams Guide Receiver Peep sight with low light aperture
SHARPS VERNIER TANG SIGHT by Dixie Gun Works
3.75 pound trigger 
Wolff extra – power hammer spring
 • Improves lock time
 • Increased striking power of firing pin
Barrel treated with Lyman Super – Moly Bore Cream
 • Increases velocity 
 • Lengthens barrel life
Comes with authentic Ruger case and many genuine Ruger replacement parts, like the small screws and what not that are easy to lose and hard to find in-stock when you need them. For what I have put into this gun, $2500.00 is fair. No trades. Call or text 920 - 422 - 8276."

Lee PaceSetter Dies include the exclusive Lee Factory Crimp Die to produce factory-like ammunition with improved utility and accuracy. The die set also includes a conventional bullet seater. They also include a shell holder, powder dipper, load data and are packed in the nicest storage box ever designed. These extras represent an $18.00 value. Every die comes with a written lifetime warranty, 2 year guarantee and guarantee of accuracy or your money back!

This set is recommended for assembling ammunition for hunting purposes as the finished rounds chamber easily and can withstand rough handling of the firearm action.

All Lee dies are machine honed to the smoothest possible finish. Don't confuse this with the surface polish used by most manufacturers. A polish simply makes a shiny surface. It's like trying to sand wood without backing under the sandpaper. The surface in Lee dies is progressively honed to a fine finish with no waves or ripples.

Lee 223 Pacesetter 3-Die Set includes Full Length Sizing Die, Easy Adjust Dead Length Bullet Seating Die, Factory Crimp Die, Universal Shell Holder, Powder Dipper and Instructions/Load Data.

Drop-in bolt and carrier group has a self-lubricating surface that eliminates the need to apply oil or grease that can attract dirt, dust, unburned powder, and carbon and lead to cycling failures. Proprietary EXO-treated Nickel Boron finish produces an exceptionally hard surface that’s 40% more wear resistant than chrome plating, with an ultra-low friction coefficient. Surface is actually harder than the substrate underneath and will not peel, flake, gall, or rub off. EXO-treated Nickel Boron finish bolt/carrier groups have been tested to function reliably without additional lubrication up to 50,000 rounds. Reduced friction also means less heat generated by metal-on-metal contact, so the gun runs cooler and parts last longer. Easy to clean, too—fouling brushes right off. Before treatment, parts are shot peened for surface uniformity and magnetic particle inspected to make sure there are no hidden flaws."

I am selling my Glock 27 Sub Compact pistol chambered in .40 Smith and Wesson.  This gun has been a thrill to own, it changed my mind entirely on the company and I hate to see it go.  I am including a good amount of extra's with the sale which I am listing below.  I will also entertain trades plus cash but only for a semi auto pistol or a home defense shotgun.  If you have any questions please let me know and I will get with you as soon as possible.  I am located on the North side of Houston, TX.  Anyone who purchases must be willing to sign a bill of sale and provide a photocopy of a valid state ID. Thanks for your time.

This rifle has many upgrades over the stock SKS.  The trigger spring was replaced with a Wolff spring to reduce the pull and the entire assembly was smoothed and polished by a professional gun smith in Hampton Roads.  Rear sight has been upgraded to a peep site and an Advanced Technology (ATI) synthetic Monte Carlo Stock and handguard is included with an extra butt.  This increases accuracy significantly; however, all the original wood pieces are included as shown.  Similar stocks list on the ATI's website for $79.99, I also have the original packaging, instructions and warranty paperwork for the ""lifetime"" warranty on the stock.  Last two items are a metal high capacity and a smaller 5 round magazine with bash plate.  The high capacity sells for  around $20 and both are in very good condition.  

I have the bill of sale with my name on it, so you have the confidence that the firearm is legitimate and safe.  

Firearm for sale to VA residents only (DL + Voter Registration Card or CC Permit) and Active Duty (Mil ID + Orders) PCS'd to VA.  A bill of sale will be provided for proof of purchase to the buyer (legal age required).  

Price: $475 seller.  Seller receives 60 rounds of 7.62x39 ammo with purchase.

I've also put a lighter trigger kit in it when I bought the gun, idk what the pull is but its a lot lighter than factory. The holster is just a plain jain one nothing fancy but its a holster for it. The guns got over 140bucks in extras if u add them up. Would make a great carry gun real light n weight but still holds 10 and you have the night sites in case its dark out , so there you have it. Not looking to trade just a heads up. Guns not costing me nothing to keep so I'm not giving it away either. Thanks jon. Call or text REDACTED"
