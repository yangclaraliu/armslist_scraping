Due to the NYS Safe Act i cannot sell this firearm to any civilian in NY I can sell it to a active Police Officer who would have to show proper identification to FFL before transaction im not really looking to trade id prefer cash or money order unless you have something worth a trade. I am asking $750.00 plus shipping to your ffl if you are out of state I must receive either cash or U.S. Postal money order plus a copy of a valid ffl license prior to my ffl shipping the rifle to your dealer. I will not ship to a state where this rifle is illegal I am a LEO myself and will check into all local laws prior to making a deal.

However, in order to help handle the increased pressure of the 17 HMR and 22 WMR rounds, the TF Rifle also utilizes a precision engineered and machined counterweight system attached to our CNC-machined steel bolt. This eliminates the need to use more expensive alloys in the bolt. The weight is located in front of the receiver and concealed in the stock. Our TF Rifle also includes the same TG2000 trigger unit – a Volquartsen exclusive – tuned to a crisp, clean 2.25lb trigger pull. The rifle sports a black matte coated stainless steel bull barrel.

Each rifle is stripped to a shell. All parts are media blazed to remove all traces of the cheap spray paint applied by the Russian's. The old trigger groups are removed and replaced with a modified Tapco G2 which will have a 2-3 pound pull.

The old trigger group holes are big welded and ground smooth for a professional look. None of that 4 screws or rivets on your receiver like I see so many other guns being sold have. Our receivers look like an authentic Russian AK-47 is supposed to look. See photos for example of what we do compared to other guns sold here.

The old trigger guard is removed and thrown away. It is replaced with a Ram Superior Trigger Guard. We also add the bullet guide to allow the use of any and all surplus AK magazines on the planet. These rifles internally will be the same as any other AK-47 on the market with the exception that everything is factory new. There are no surplus parts.

We take the time to remove a portion of the barrel shroud and thread the barrel in the standard 1/14 LH Russian threads and add a flash suppressor. We also modified the mag release to accept ANY standard AK magazine INCLUDING DRUMS. Bullet Guide installed to assure feeding of ANY AND ALL ammo.

These rifles like all our firearms are refinished in Cerakote Firearms Coating. Cerakote it the best and most durable finish on the market. It is 100% solvent proof and rock hard. Another advantage is it has built in lubrication in the form of teflon in the coating matrix. This makes for an extremely smooth operating rifle.

Other upgrades include an aluminium quad rail, forend pistol grip, ergonomic pistol grip, 30 round magazine, 10 round factory magazine, and all removed factory stocks. Plus all the parts listed below.


Everything else listed is included.

• Saiga Model 132 16"" Threaded Barrel

• 30 Round Magazine

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

The SN 311383 which according to Frasca & Hill's ""The 45-70 Trapdoor Book"" puts it in the right year of manufacture by the Springfield arsenal. There is also the No 76 stamped behind the Trigger Guard and as other examples of 1884 Cadets show there is no year cartouch on the left side of the stock. Also it has the 1873 Breech block and Buffington rear sight which is correct. This rifle is over all excellent condition with some loss of bluing at the muzzle presumably due to the atachment of the bayonet. The Case hardening, Bore and Stock are in excellent condition as all the pictures indicate.

There is also the No 76 stamped behind the Trigger Guard and as other examples of 1884 Cadets show there is no year cartouch on the left side of the stock. Also it has the 1873 Breech block and Buffington rear sight which is correct. This rifle is over all excellent condition with some loss of bluing at the muzzle presumably due to the atachment of the bayonet. The Case hardening, Bore and Stock are in excellent condition as all the pictures indicate.

SN 473. According to the ""The Springfield 1903 Rifle"" by Brophy (pg 128-129) the Ordnance Department purchased 10 of these rifles after the 1927 International Competitions fitting them with 31 inch heavy barrels (1 inch across the muzzle),Swiss Globe front sights,target scope blocks, Lyman 48 Receiver sights, palm rests, dbl set triggers, Scheuzen style check pieces, elaborate Trigger Guards and Butt Stocks. Others were offered for sale through the DCM and NRA at a cost of $231.46 from 1929 to 1932 for a total of about 40 rifles. ""Few of these scarce rifles have survived in original condition"" This rifle will letter through the SRS, as it has in the past. The condition of this is very fine plus with 96% to 98% strong blue on the barrel, 95% original blue with some freckles of light rust on the Receiver. The wood is sound with minor nicks and scratches and a hairline crack in the butt stock behind the butt plate attaching pin escutcheon, it retains most of its original fine hand rubbed oil finish. The mechanics are excellent with a bright and shiny bore. If one has any question please feel free to ask. This CR OK, IF paid with MO or Certified funds I usually ship within 24 hours with a MO, personal checks and Certified have to clear. Buyer to pay shipping, Weight of this rifle is 14 lbs and WILL HAVE to be shipped USPS REGISTERED MAIL to insure it adequately. Reasonable offers will be entertained. This is a rare and hard rifle to find,it could take years to find one let alone one as nice.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 5/9/12 It has recently been brought to my attention that several of these Springfield Hammerillis (SN 434 and SN 456) have been sold at auction for substantially less than my offering price. After closely examining the auction catalogs multiple photos it is very clear that one has a large crack in the stock at the back of the Receiver, has a non configuration Springfield barrel and in general the condition of the stock, receiver & barrel and small parts in particular the Trigger assembly DO NOT tell the same story. It therefore appears that one of the two is REFINSIHED. The second ones pictures are a bit too vague to determine exactly what is going on with that rifle however again the barrel appears to be a replacement and the stock and metal parts condition seems to be at odds with each other. Also both rifle appear to have been shot either not at all or very little after they were blued. One MUST REMEMBER that Springfield Hammerillis rifles WERE SHOT both before and after they were sold through the DCM in the 1930's and to be in original condition need to show some commensurate wear. Again to quote Brophy, ""Very few of these scarce rifles have survived in ORIGINAL condition."""

I have for sale 2 new/never used stainless steel parkerizing tanks with lids and ½” drain valves. I bought these thinking I was going to learn how to parkerize guns but never got around to it so these have just been sitting collecting dust. Also included with this is 1 gallon of Zinc Phosphate Parkerizing Solution and 1 gallon of Post Treatment Solution, both new and unopened. Each gallon of chemical is concentrated and gets mixed with 4 gallons of water for 5 total gallons of each, which is the capacity of each tank. 

I paid right around $450 shipped to the door for the pair of tanks/lids plus around $125 shipped to the door for the chemicals. I have around $575 wrapped up in this but I will sell everything as a set for $400 cash or $450 trade value. Located in Dublin and you must be willing to meet in the Dublin area for the sale. Trades considered would possibly be 12 ga. shotguns, rifles, handguns in 9mm (no Hi-Point, Kel-Tec, or Jennings), ammo in 9mm (brass cased), .22LR (high velocity only), .223 (40-52 grain, brass), .308 (155-168 grain, brass). Not interested in bows, crossbows, or black powder.

Here is the description of the tanks from the manufacturer:

6""x6""x40"", pure 304 Stainless Steel. Tank, cover, and Stainless Steel ball valve are included. 

We are proud to offer the very best Parkerizing Tanks in the industry. They are cut and formed out of pure 304 stainless steel. Handles are formed right into the ends. All edges of these tanks are hemmed, so there are no exposed sharp edges. Feel free to handle these tank with your bare hands! 

The tanks are TIG welded using supreme skill and elaborate tooling. The outside of the welds are treated and polished to reveal the beauty of the stainless steel and show the excellence of the weld. We maintain complete passivation inside the weld during manufacturing. Please look at the last picture taken of the inside of the weld, you will see that it remains brilliant and shiny. If you see a weld in stainless steel that is black or rust colored inside this means that proper provisions were not taken and rust and breakdown will start immediately when your liquid is applied."

Product Information, Features, and Specifications:

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

This Super Charged 30-06 load was designed to be the premier deer load for 30-06, providing devastating, one shot terminal destruction of deer “clockwork”. The 150gr. Spitzer is traveling at around 3,000 fps from typical 30-06 rifles and the bullet will mushroom violently at these impact velocities. It may even fragment, depending on bullet placement and impact speed. For big game up to 350 lbs, tremendous penetration is not needed, so this bullet mushrooms radically and might even break up. (Much like our Deer Grenade 44 Mag. Item # 4F) When high speed bullets act this way terminally, the effect is devastating and they absolutely “dump” deer sized game animals in their tracks. This bullet does not give ample penetration for super big game like Yukon moose and we have designed other 30-06 loads for that type of task, but this load will collapse deer sized game unlike any other 30-06 load. This load is designed for any game weighing less than 350 lbs, such as medium sized black bear, hogs, antelope, deer, etc."

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."
