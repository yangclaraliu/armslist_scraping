Vltor MUR-1S Modular Upper Receiver For Sale or Trade. The MUR-1S comes with dust cover and shell deflector 

Note: The pictures are stock photo’s because this upper receiver is still sealed in box. If a serious buyer wants me to remove the receiver from the box for actual detailed photos, I am willing to do so. 

The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available.
The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures the reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.
All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door.

Only 20 rounds fired using these parts. Selling because I bought Nickel Boron replacements. Everything in perfect, like new condition. Will send pics upon request. BCG is the octagon version, allows your rifle to run when very dirty due to less surface area touching the receiver. BPM is a high end maker of AR parts. They actually make parts for almost all the companies who don't manufacture their parts (you'd be surprised at who simply purchase parts and put their name on them, then peice them together and call them their own). BPM are the people who turn raw material (a block of metal) in to a gun part using CNC machines. Look them up if you've never heard of them, then read a review or two about them. They are hign quality parts and rifles (I own one, and it's amazing!)."

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel
(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. 

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.

There are only 3,000 miles on the bike but I am riding it for the time being until I sell it.. Both tires are like new with only 1,000 miles on them. The bike has never been wrecked, but there are a few dings and scratches and something green in the paint that is either something splashed on the tank or some kind of discoloration caused by gas getting on the paint. There are no cracked fairings or bad road rash, but I do think the bike has been tipped over in a driveway or parking lot. There is slight scuffing on the tips of things like the front break lever, right bar end, and exhaust.

This is a great starter bike, I have had two of these over the years. Do not be afraid to buy this as your first bike. I will be happy to work with you to show you the basics of riding for the first time.

I ran this with a heavy buffer, with the dynacomp on it it shoots extremely soft. Much softer than my buddy's middy. I took it out today and ran 200rds if brass through it with no issues. I also ran some steel cased and had a few ftf (the bolt wouldn't cycle back far enough on a few rds). I believe a lighter buffer and it would run fine of lower pressure rounds but it wasn't a problem for me so I never switched. The upper has a bcm bcg(it will go with the upper unless your bcg is of lesser quality), and a Daniel defense lite 9"" rail.

Constructed entirely from Mil-Spec aluminum and then Type III hard coat anodized for durability. Surefire magazines feed smoothly and reliably were designed to be left loaded indefinitely. Additionally, Surefire Magazines can be disassembled for cleaning via the removable floorplate. Also, unlike other high capacity magazines, the Surefire High-Capacity Magazines DO NOT require dry lubricants for reliability.

Due to their unique 4x2 quad stack configuration, the magazines add firepower without excessive bulk. The 60-round magazine is only an inch and a half longer than a standard 30 round magazine and narrower than two 30-round magazines clipped together.

Surefire High-Capacity Magazines can be seated in a rifle with a closed bolt, even when fully loaded-no downloading required. Surefire ensured this by allowing for differing tolerances between SAAMI and NATO specifications."

If you're in the know this is a smart little rifle to have. Shoots the same ammo as your pistol, but turns that very powerful magnum into a super magnum, (will shoot with a 30 30 out 100 yards), and get magnum velocities out of specials. For a home defense, survival, deep woods hunting, or camp combo that's hard to beat, 200 to 270 grain thumping power, you can tailor your loads enabling you to get maximum knockdown power while being mindful of loved ones and neighbours where over penetration is concerned."

This is a great ccw or home defense chambering/platform. For all the guys, and I used to be one of them, who carry a 9mm, 40 sw, 357, have to buy special rounds that will truely expand without overpenetrating. The 44 spcl will do that easily with no other special rounds other than cowboy rounds and arives there with almost twice the lead of a 357, no super velocity need to expand the bullet, just a big thump, with all of the energy left in the Target.

True Charter Arms does not build a Colt, SW or Ruger, however look at the size and cost of those monsters, at 20 oz it is a capable carry pistol being just larger than most 38s, leave the all day shooting fest to your big revolvers and keepthis one concealed with no springs under pressure like autos"

This stuff is very hard to come by! Secondary market prices are crazy. I am looking to get some silver, therefore I'm offering a trade. Looking for two Silver Dollars per brick (Eagles preferred). I have both hollow points and solid noise ammo. Remington, Federal, Winchester and some CCI. I understand this offer is not for everyone, but if you have some Silver and need some 22, we can make a deal. 
   **** Local coin shop **** is advertising their buying price for your silver.                              
They are paying $24.31 for Eagles and $18.05 for Morgans and Peace dollars. Do the math.
My trade value is one of the cheapest advertised prices for 22.  May consider other, rounds, bullion and pre-65 silver coins, but a adjustment maybe necessary for condition and silver content. Thanks for reading, if any interest, reply to this post."

**Owners Notes**
This rifle is the most accurate rifle I have ever owned. I shoot long range and sighted it in at 300 Yards. This rifle shoots Sub MOA at 300 Yards. This rifle has had 100 rounds through it and is extremely well taken care of. FYI I only shoot 168gr SMK's.  The only reason I am getting rid of this is that I want the 700P in 300 Win Mag.

Remington cartridge and the similar military 5.56x45mm cartridge. At an unspecified time in 2007 to 2008, Ruger added a heavier tapered barrel to the Mini series. The heavier barrel had an overall larger diameter with the barrel visibly becoming thicker in the final inches as the barrel approaches the gas block from the muzzle. These changes combined with tighter tolerances result in greater potential accuracy. The new Mini-14 supposedly can shoot under 1 MOA.

ZT is proud to offer the model 0301, designed by Ken Onion and Strider - a top-quality combat knife equipped with the patented SpeedSafe® assisted opening system.

SpeedSafe® enables users to deploy the blade one-handed - using their choice of an ambidextrous thumb stud or an equally ambidextrous index finger protrusion.

In addition to SpeedSafe, the 0301 features a tough S30V stainless-steel blade with ZT's unique ""Tiger Stripe"" Tungsten DLC coating. The S30V blade steel is designed to provide the perfect combination of durability, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. The Tungsten DLC tiger striping also provides a non-reflective camouflaged surface.

The 0301's Ranger Green scales are made of 3-D machined G-10 and titanium for incredible mechanical strength and a supersecure grip. The 0301 also features a 3/8 inch hex head pivot shaft nut that makes field adjustments fast and easy with minimal tools.

In addition, this dynamic folding knife comes with a reversible or removable clip for tip-up or tip-down carry - so it remains securely stowed until the user needs it.
