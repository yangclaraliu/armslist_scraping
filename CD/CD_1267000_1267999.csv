- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications

LE6920 M4 AR15 Carbine 5.56/223. The Gold Standard of AR15's
This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.

Colt's M4 Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. 
- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components

- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- Cleaning kit, sling, and 1 magazine are standard.
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness.

With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in in length and weighs only 6.95 lb - ideal for tactical use.

We have silencers for .22LR that start at $145.00, silencers for AR-15's/5.56 calibers that start at $425.00, and 7.62mm silencers that start at $499.00. We offer a full line of SBR rifles in many different calibers.  We are now using ATF's new Eform system and it has reduced the wait time from 10 months to 3-5 months. Hurry and get yours before the wait time gets bumped back up. Our prices are typically below MSRP and we have silencers that can fit anyone's budget. Military is welcome to purchase suppressors as long as you are PCS in Oklahoma. If you chain of command allows it you can take these on deployments since we know that only the ""cool guys"" get them issued. You never know this could be the piece of equipment that helps save your life or someone else. It helps reduce recoil, keeps your situational awareness, and reduces your muzzle signature when you fire. These are just a few reasons that they could benefit a combat soldier. I sale all major brands of silencers so if you have a special request just ask. It is now legal to hunt with silencers in Oklahoma so get one before the wait gets longer. Anyone who can buy a handgun should be able to qualify for a silencer. I will complete all paperwork for you and make the transfer a smooth and easy process. If you decide to put your suppressor in a trust which I recommend, I can assist you with the process and you won't have to get the CLEO sign off or fingerprints. ATF has proposed to start making trusts also get the CLEO sign off and fingerprints but it is not in effect yet so hurry before the process gets more difficult. Transferable MAC 10 Machine guns typically start at $4500.00 and go up from there. The process for transferable machine guns is the same for silencers, and YES civilians in Oklahoma can own machine guns and you only have to pay the one time $200.00 for the ATF tax stamp when you purchase it. I am an experienced class 3 dealer and if you have any other class 3 or NFA needs or questions please contact me at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED. Leave a message in reference to what you are calling about if I don't answer and I will call you back ASAP. Thanks.

I don't have specifics on the components he used to build the rifle but I can provide contact info for Mr. Smith and he can answer any question you may have regarding his rifles.

Will consider Ruger Gunsite Scout or Benelli Vinci in MAX4 as a partial trade.  May also consider a Kimber or Colt 1911 as a partial trade.  Trade value plus cash to equal below price. 



Cash price: $2000 firm.  Final price drop.

I will include a brand new in box Leupold VX-R 4-12x50 Ballistic Dot for $2500 firm. 



It is in excellent condition and is very clean. It includes scope rings but no optics. Please email first and then I'll provide my telephone number. I'm located in McKinney, TX but will travel a reasonable distance if necessary. Thanks!

this pistol is neither a colt nor a star but a mix of the two designed by star and colt/F.I. for possible manufacture by colt as a 'colt pony'. it got as far as being included in either the 1973 colt catalog but never reach production. 

F.I. ended up manufacturing the pistol between 1973 until 1977 using frames and slides manuractured in the u.s.a. and internals parts imported from star. in 1978 Iver Johnson purchased the rights to this pistol and began manufacturing it using inventory from F.I. and then they manufactured all new parts in middlesex, new jersey and later jacksonville arkansas. iver johnson manufactured this pistol until about 1992.

the F.I. model D and the iver johnson pony are locked breech designs so it is capable of handling any factory 380 acp and hot handloads (within pressures limitations) also"

The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar.  The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed.

  The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel.  The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer hand guard.  The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver.   The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer.     The MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round metal detachable magazines and 3 internal chokes.  The magazine release button mimics the M16 rifle location.  The manual safety also duplicates the M16 style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip.  The top of the receiver has a carrying handle and  integral picatinny rail for mounting rear sights, or any optical accessories.  The MKA 1919 12 gauge shotgun is appropriate for all levels of hunting and sporting enthusiasts.  It comes in Black and ""BONZ"" camo versions and is reasonably priced for our distributors and customers alike.      This shotgun is priced to sell, and it comes with 5 magazines."

============
============
This complete CMMG AR-15 M4 Upper Assembly features a chrome-moly steel barrel with a WASP Melonite treated bore and exterior. M4 feed ramps ensure reliable feeding and the 5.56x45mm NATO chamber allows the use of both commercial or surplus mil-spec ammunition. 

CMMG's durable Weapons Armament Surface Protection (WASP) Melonite treatment is a unique protective coating applied to the barrel that surface-hardens the metal, extending barrel service life by reducing friction in the bore and lessening bore surface wear. Also referred to as Nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, making for easier cleaning and maintenance. Nitriding converts the steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering from the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore."

This is an excellent carry gun and also very fun to shoot at the range. Incredibly accurate for its compact size, with good defensive +p hollow points this 9mm packs a punch but it smooth as butter to shoot. The recoil is very manageable and a hair trigger reset makes for lightening fast follow up shots. The gun is fully ambidextrous with both right and left side safety that also functions as s decocking mechanism.  These guns are very solid and well built and many people prefer them to glocks or other ""striker"" fired handguns. If you're looking for a great hammer fired gun then this one is for you. Pictures are not of actual gun. This gun wad a police officer's duty gun so it does have some minor holster rash but has been taken excellent care of and hardly ever fired. All of the parts that matter are in 100% condition so this will make for an excellent gun to use and not have to worry about getting a little scratch like you would an expensive brand new gun. This is a real gun to use for defense of your life and keep the pretty ones in the safe not to scratch from every day use/carry. Comes with one 12 round magazine."

The 922 model was just released this year in January by ATI.  GSG also makes the SIG 1911-22.  They are great quality and have good after market support.  Many people use them in competition.

The Reason why the price is at a premium: I've been looking for an AR Lower for 3 months now, I've spent countless hours trying to locate one and I actually had to camp out 10+ hours to get it. I bought 2 (1 to keep and 1 to sell). I also know FFLs around the Bay Area that will only charge $10 for the transfer + $25 for the background check.

At only 5.5lbs, DSC has created one of the most versatile AR-15’s available.  The ultra-lightweight makes it an ideal beginner’s AR, duty rifle, or bugout weapon.  DSC has joined forces with the Samson Mfg. to bring you their 9” Evolution handguard.  This lightweight, sturdy aluminum forearm allows the shooter to place their accessories anywhere on the handguard without having the extra weight of a full rail system.  The 9” length extends of the carbine low profile gas system and gives the shooter a little extra real estate.  DSC chose the lightest stock sister company Ace Limited offers for this build.  The 7” Ace AR-UL-E is standard, but may be upgraded to the 9” AR-UL version for a longer trigger pull at no extra charge.  Both models also include a 1” or ½” buttpad that can be added for additional comfort and length of pull.

If you are looking for a carbine that’s reliable, lightweight, and made with the same outstanding quality as the rest of the DSC line-up, look no further than the Constant Carry Carbine.  Made in the USA.

STOCK FEATURES

• Proprietary carbon fiber reinforced polymer construction

• Ultra light stock weighs only 3 lbs.

• Folding buttstock with recoil pad folds from 36-3/4″ to 28-3/8″ overall length with standard 18-½” barrel.

• Aluminum reinforced full length Picatinny top rail

• Includes sights – Adjustable for windage and elevation

• Hand guard accessory rail

• Extended magazine release

• Extended and enhanced bolt release

• Aluminum hand stop with integrated sling mount

• Aluminum flash hider (fits all standard barrels)

• Dummy suppressor (fits 18-½” standard barrels)

• 2 storage compartments

• Comes with the new AA922-A1, .22 LR (25) RD magazine



It can come with the following configurations and prices:

Ruger 10/22 and Archangel Nomad Stock - $425.00 (this includes the original Ruger stock and parts)
The above plus the Mini POD and vertical grip - $450.00
The above plus the scope and optics - $580.00


I have about about 300 rounds down range since adding the stock kit. It is very solid and substantial. The rifle has about another 1000 rounds down range.

I would suggest using a Ruger mag instead of the Archangel AA922-A1 25 that comes with it. The Archangel mag works well but not a good as Ruger BX-25 or something like it.

935,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1267935,For Sale:  Liberty Centurion 12 Gun black gun safe,"Frankfort, Kentucky, United States",$ 240,"Listed On: Friday, March 15, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I bought this gun safe a couple days ago.  It sells at Lowes for $397.  I bought it cheaper because it had been dropped and it is dented at the top hinge.  The lock, hinges, door swing, etc all work fine.  The damage is cosmetic.  You can tell it has been dented, the door is rubbing a little at the top, but still opens, closes, and locks fine.   I think you could take the door off and straighten it fairly easily.  That was my plan for it anyway.  I bought it for $225 plus tax, which was about $240.  Thats what I will sell it for.  I bought it on impulse, and we really dont have anywhere to put it, or any real need for it.  I am not looking for trades at this point, unless its as a partial trade to a springfield xds.  No offense, but I will not take less than what I paid for it.  I would rather keep it.  Thanks for looking

Factory rail and UTG Red Dot sight. It has been upgraded for fast, flawless magazine changes and easier takedown (in other words, it's been “de-Lawyered” and breaks down exactly as if were a Mark II model). The mags fall right into your hand (like they OUGHT to!) when you push the release. 

Appearance and function on this gun are immaculate.  After mods (see below) were made and sight was attached, approximately 150 rounds were fired at the local range to “zero in” the firearm and make everything functioned perfectly. It does. In typical Ruger fashion, it “eats” anything you put in the magazine. CCI, Federal, Winchester, you name it. NEVER Remington. Just don't...

All internal friction points were burnished and polished for a silky trigger pull, including the square block where the barrel/receiver meets the frame. No mallets or tools necessary to break this gun apart.

Sight is UTG “red/green” dot variable intensity.  Keep both eyes open, bring the weapon up, and put the dot where you want it. Exhale. Pull the trigger. Bullseye. Simple as that.

Auction includes firearm, 2 magazines, speed loader, genuine Ruger Mounting rail, scope (as pictured) and hard padded gun case

Background checks on gun purchases amount to de facto gun registration. UNIVERSAL background checks on gun purchases amount to de facto UNIVERSAL gun registration. 

The default ""lawyered-up"" (the ones that won't release your mags and are difficult to break down) versions of the 22/45s are selling in the  $300 – $400 price range. Hard to put a value on my day-and-a-half with 600 grit sandpaper, polishing compound and gunsmithing tools pulling out all the garbage like gutting a fish, but mag changes and the trigger pull are are nicer than other 22/45s by a long shot... 

Cost of the sight was moderate. If you don't want it, I'll take $40 off the price.  Mounting rail stays on the gun.

The fact that this sale will take place between two consenting adults without paperwork is priceless. Make me an offer. I will also consider trades. Ammo mostly.

NOTE: This is the longtrack model of the F7 EFI. I have had many phone calls and questions and people don't seem to know what they are. It has a much larger suspension and a 144 inch track. Longtrack sleds are designed for deeper snow and ""boondocking"" as people call it. I have owned trail sleds before, and after owning a long track, I will NEVER go back to a standard 121 inch. My sled before this one was a 2003 F7 EFI Sno Pro, and this is much more stable on the trails, handles all deep snow with ease, never even thought about being stuck, etc. There is a slight trade off in top speed due to the longer track length, but it won't be noticed because when all of the higher horsepower 121inch sleds are spinning in the snow, you will be history due to increased traction with the longer track. F7 EFI cats are rated at 140HP stock. They are not slow, and are still to this day one of the most coveted sleds on the market. As with cars and other high performance toys, if you can't put the power to the ground, it means nothing. The 144 inch track excels at this, as well as mountains riding in Tug Hill, Cohocton, and other places there is deep snow.

I have never had a single problem with this sled. As a matter of fact, it has been nicknamed ""old reliable"". When my friends Polaris broke, this didnt. When my friends Yamaha broke, this didnt. When my friends Ski-Doo broke, this didnt. It has never been towed, broken down, or unable to continue the ride. If we had snow, I would jump on it right now and ride to Tug Hill with absolute confidence. That is worth a lot with some of todays snowmobiles.

It is stored inside all year round, as the pictures show. It is also registered for 2013, has been serviced with new plugs, chassis greased, etc.
