No known defects.Paddle and belt holster included.From the website:
The XD® Mod.2® 5″ Tactical Model packs 16 rounds of 9MM ammo in each of its two included stainless steel magazines. While it’s a double stack design, it’s not too thick to carry like so many of our competitors’ models. Measuring just 1.2 inches wide, it is barely wider than single stack pistols with far lower capacity.
A pistol with a healthy sight radius is easier to shoot under stress, and that’s why we’ve chosen to fit the Mod.2® Tactical Model with a full five-inch hammer forged carbon steel barrel. It’s treated with Melonite® to stand up to moisture, sweat, and other undesirable conditions over the long haul.
The slide takes most of the day to day wear and tear, so we’ve made sure to construct that from Melonite®-treated carbon steel too. While we always recommend properly caring for your handgun, the Mod.2® Tactical isn’t one that will require babying. This combat-ready gun is designed to be used, not left in the safe."

It is still available.  This Remington Model 700.  7mm Remmington magnum. Wood stock, Custom Stainless steel Magnaported barrel. The stock has been professionally bedded.  It has a Mercury stock stabilizer that can be taken out if you don't like it.  I have a Nikon 3x9x10 buckmaster that it came with, included in sale with scope box.  There is no way to check the manufacture date as the stock barrel was replaced by previous owner to this stainless steel barrel with Magnaporting.  From what I recall he just used it at the rifle range on targets.  I believe I bought this in 2002. I paid $750 for it then and its been upgrade more.  The barrel is at least 21 yrs old. I have put 8 boxes of shells through the barrel over the years. Again no idea on the stock nor action age,  Action blueing is quite nice, the Bolt shows quite a lot of ware, but functions smoothly.  Stainless barrel shows some blemishes.  I had the stock Pro floated and Mecury stabilizer put in.  I have shot 11 deer since I bought it. Some as close as 50 feet, and as far as 845 yards. It never let me down.  I am a big guy and with the stabilzer and Magnaporting I can shoot off hand at running game, keeping the game in the scope between shots.  This is a well used hunting rifle not something left in a gun case to look at.  If you are a buyer and looking for a proven rifle this might be for you.  If your looking for something New  or  Perfect?  Absolutely not the rifle for you."

I put it on her AR but it was never fired so it is like new. We found out that it is for an airsoft rifle. So it can work on a AR but will require some file fitting in order to be adjustable. If you just want to set it and forget it it will work fine with no adittional fitting required. Prefer texts 405-3zero1 158seven. Asking $75 OBO.

This allows the pistol to be easily modified to fit to any individual user.The P30SK has HK’s enhanced double action only “Law Enforcement Modification (LEM).” For the P30SK, the LEM trigger is configured with a “light strike V1” setup — requiring approximately 5.4 pounds-force to pull the trigger. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide and magazine release levers. Like all P30 pistols, the P30SK features an automatic hammer safety and firing pin safety.  An abbreviated Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame enables weapon lights, lasers, or other accessories to be easily mounted. All P30SK models have been extensively tested during a three year development process. Despite their small size, P30SK subcompacts have excellent weight and balance making them naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot.Buyer must be a Florida resident who is legally allowed to own a firearm and have a  Florida drivers license, Florida concealed carry license and be willing to sign a bill of sale.Thanks for looking."

This is the toughest, most compact, most reliable semi-auto centerfire rifle you can own.
