This relatively short 30mm tube scope does not add a lot of weight to any rifle, and thanks to the large diameter of the scope tube, it lets in a lot of light for a bright target image. Also, due to the high quality fully multi-coated lenses, that image is also clear and sharp. An extremely practical circular reticle aids in quick target acquisition by drawing the attention of the shooter's eye to the center of the scope. To insure that the target is fully visible, this reticle has only a horizontal crosshair, with a partial vertical lower crosshair. The upper half of this reticle leaves the scope clean and uncluttered. Plus, the lower crosshair features short bar aiming points calibrated for standard .223 and .308 service ammo, which are very precise out to 600 meters.

The dragoons were pre 91/30 rifles. This one is original and not arsenal refinished like the russian dragoons you find alot of times. Reason being this one was captured by the Finn's and issued to their army. It has two boxed SA stampings, The finnish 41 stamping, D mark on the side of rear sight base. Has the original russian arshin measurements crossed out and the finnish markings stamped onto rear sight base and the extra notch cut into base that the Finn's did as well. It still has the dragoon rear sight and front sight. Has its dragoon stock with brass end caps on handguard. 
The rifle was built on a 1916 Izhevsk receiver as the russians recycled recievers for use on rifles. It has the imperial eagle stamping but when they built the dragoon in 1925 they stamped over it with the izhevsk symbol and peened the center of the eagle. 

Stock has not been refinished and the metal has not been refinished either. Bore is frosted and dark but it shoots excellent and very accurate yet. Counterbored about and inch on the end of barrel. It did not come with its cleaning rod but I have lots of 91/30 cleaning rods so put one with the rifle. 

A very hard to find dragoon rifle that was not updated to a 91/30 and has a lot of history behind it.

The pistol has the German Eagle over ""N"" nitro proofs on the slide, receiver, and barrel. The barrel has the number ""68"", and half antler before the Eagle over ""N"" markings.  

The number ""68"" identifies the year in which this pistol was manufactured. The pistol not having import markings identifies that it was manufactured in 1968 prior to the Gun Control Act implimented in the same year. The unique characteristic of this pistol is that it does not have any import markings which means it very well may have been imported through Canada to the United States. Not having imort markings on a pistol manufactured in West Germany increases its valuation. The half antler was a marking given to pistols manufactured in Ulm West Germany. The Eagle over the ""N"" was the definitive proof for all Walther pistols to include a way of identifying that a particular pistol passed the smokeless black powder test.

If you are interested in this pistol or have any questions pertaining to it please do not hesitate to text me at REDACTED.

You will never find another boat similar. The boat is all fiberglass, 12 foot long. 

It's extremely low profile, and has a new paint job. I have spent over 50 hours going through this boat top to bottom. I refilled the back of the boat with foam, sanded down the previous fiberglass and re fiber glassed. Re did the floor, sealed the wood, re did the platform up front, put a new drain plug in, painted entire boat with primer, then rust oleum paint, then a clear coat for protection, then I started grassing the boat. 

The boat is perfect for anchoring out in a bay with some diver decoys around you and they will literally land next to the boat. Also good for pulling on top of an island and using as a lay down blind, or anchoring next to the island and it disappears. The boat hides so easily it's not even funny, can transport two people, or I person and a dog with ease. A 9.9 is a perfect motor for it. But A 5-6 hp pushes it just fine. Also had a 6.5 long tail on it at one point and it did great. 

The boat is 100% solid. 

Contact me any time night or day most likely I'm up 

Will consider trades but the reason in selling is because I am moving back to fl where I hunt on marshes in blinds I get to from an airboat. 

Boat comes with a trailer. Ill be honest the trailer is nothing special. But it works. 

Title in hand for boat, but no title for trailer. The boat fits easily in a pick up bed. 

Once again this is a custom duck boat you won't see another one like it. 

Trades I will consider are what you bring duck hunting and put 3 of something in. For more details text or call or email. Thanks

I have up for sale a practically brand new FNS 9 for sale. I bought this pistol to add to my collection, but just decided I do not need it. For a striker fired pistol, it is very nice. I ran about two magazines through it, and I immediately noticed I was more consistent with it than my Glock 19 (which I have extensive experience with). It comes from the factory with Novak style Trijicon night sights, three 17 round magazines, the factory case, and all the factory paperwork. This pistol has never seen the inside of a holster, and is as nice as one you would find at a gun shop. I by no means am desperate to sell the pistol, just looking to thin out my collection. The price is firm and fair. I took some real good pictures of the pistol, but am having difficulties uploading them. E-mail me with your phone number, and I can send them to you.

Thank you for your interest,

The carbines were originally produced in Austria with the Augustin Consol Lock ignition system, better known to collectors as the “tube-lock” or “pill-lock” system. The guns also utilized a Delvigne chamber, better known by the French term “a-Tige”, in which a projection from the face of the breech upset the bullet, helping to make sure that it engaged the rifling, when the bullet was rammed home. The guns were short (only 30” in overall length), sturdy arms, manufactured with a beech stock that included a typical Austrian raised cheekrest, and an iron skeletonized pistol grip to the rear of the triggerguard. The barrel was only 14.5” in length, with a .71 caliber bore that was rifled with 12 deep, narrow grooves. When the Civil War began, arms purchasers and speculators scoured England and Europe for small arms that were available to purchase. These obsolete, ungainly carbines were quickly offered for sale by the Austrian government. The US government purchased at least 10,000 of these carbines, with that number obtained by US purchasing agent George Schuyler. These are the guns that are well documented as being issued to General Fremont’s western forces in early 1862. More recent scholarship has provided evidence that the Confederacy also purchased some of these carbines, and a handful of identifiable Confederate examples have been recently located. It appears that the majority of the carbines were altered to percussion prior to their importation to the US, most likely in Belgium, with some possibly altered in Austria or one of the Germanic states."

This rifle is new, unused, unfired and comes with everything you need to get started (other than ammo).

The lightweight stainless barrel makes this rifle handle like a typical carbine with a hammer forged barrel…but with the accuracy of a Noveske stainless. This is particularly true with the 14.5 inch barrel - this rifle handles and balances amazingly well for one with a stainless steel barrel. The pinned/welded Battlecomp 1.5 makes it a non-NFA weapon and will do an outstanding job of stabilizing the barrel during rapid firing, while not being as loud/blasty as some other compensators. These components make this rifle a near perfect combination of accuracy, weight, and balance. This rifle also includes a LWRC lower parts kit with the LWRC Enhanced Fire Control Group which has a very smooth and clean break, as well as a Vltor A5 buffer system.

The components of the rifle are as follows: 

- Noveske matched receiver set with Gen 2 lower, Cerakoted in FDE
- Noveske 14.5 inch lightweight 5.56mm stainless barrel; 1 in 7"" twist; improved polygonal rifling; extended feed ramps; bead blasted finish; mid-length gas system; light contour - weight: 29 oz.;
- pinned/welded Battlecomp 1.5 compensator/muzzle device
- pinned Noveske low profile gas block
- Centurion Arms 12 inch C4 rail/handguard
- Larue Tactical FDE index clips - mix of FDE, UDE, and black - but these will be swapped out for other colors if requested by the winning bidder (some ""hooks"" and ""retainer"" index clips are included)
- Magpul AFG2 - FDE
- Bravo Company Manufacturing (BCM) full-auto bolt carrier group
- Vltor/BCM Gunfighter charging handle - Mod 4
- LWRC lower parts kit with Enhanced Fire Control Group/Trigger (nickel/Teflon finish) 
- Vltor A5 buffer system
- Lewis Machine and Tool (LMT) SOPMOD stock - FDE
- Magpul MIAD pistol grip - black
- Knight's Armament micro flip sight set (both front and rear)"

PWS 16"" Piston Driven Rifle, 5.56, SS Isonite QPQ Treated, Button Rifled, 1:8 Twist Barrel, mil-spec receiver, quad rail The MK116 was developed by Primary Weapons Systems (PWS) as a significant product improvement over the standard M4 carbine. Developed specifically for infantry and law enforcement operations and utilizing our proven long stroke piston system, this weapon is as reliable as the AK47 that it was designed after. Significant improvements have been made over both the direct gas impingement operating system and previous offerings of piston-driven operating systems. The Stainless Steel, Isonite QPQ treated 1:8 twist barrel provides unmatched accuracy and barrel longevity. The product improvements made by PWS have addressed reliability and performance issues as well as reduced carrier tilt, cam pin wear and carrier bounce. In addition, I have one of the lightest systems on the market today! An innovative hand guard system utilizes a proprietary non-free float system that allows the end user or unit armorer to replace individual rails as needed without removing the barrel, barrel nut or even other rails. This system allows the user to attach numerous Picatinny rail-mounted devices such as sights, lights, and laser aiming devices. The PWS proprietary operating system utilizes an operating rod that is attached to the carrier and a floating head piston that is attached to the operating rod. The MK1 series is built to be a true combat carbine. With no unnecessary gas adjustments and only one moving assembly, this is the most rugged, simple and versatile piston operating system available. The MK1 series is available as a complete rifle or as a complete upper receiver for use on existing M4/M16 style lower receivers"

The Ultratech is Microtech’s original dual action out-the-front knife. With over 40,000 units in
 circulation since 1999, the Ultratech is regarded as a leader in the industry. The Ultratech’s spring remains in an “at rest” position at all times, except when deployed. This ensures that the compressed spring will not become fatigued, assuring users that when the knife is fired, it will operate effectively. The Ultratech’s simplistic design, light weight, one handed action, slim shape, and scalpel sharp blade make it an exclusive everyday carry knife.

Product Information

The Lee Precision Carbide Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Carbide Factory Crimp Die features a carbide ring that sizes the cartridge while it is being crimped so every round will positively chamber freely with factory-like dependability. The adjusting screw quickly and easily sets the desired amount of crimp while a factory-like crimp (Taper crimp) is added to more firmly hold the bullet in place. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. A firm crimp is essential for dependable and accurate ammunition. Shellholder sold separately.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol(.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates
on a unique hybrid blow back /locked-breech system. This operation system
allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts
between locked breach and blow back operation, depending on the pressure of
the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a design that holds 30
rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a
crisp single action with an over travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb
activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide
locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also
provided.  Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip,
slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced
Nylon (Zytel). The magazine is also Zytel with round count ports. Other
features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine
release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight,
Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive
coaxial recoil springs. The barrel is fluted for light weight and effective
heat dissipation. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single
pin.

Product Overview
Tactical Machining stripped lower receivers are built to last and come with an unconditional lifetime warranty. These are standard mil-spec based lowers topped off with a black hard coat anodizing.

Description
The Tactical Machining AR-15 lower receiver is built from 7075-T6 forgings from the lead forge in the United States. The contour is fully machined leaving no flash marks from the forging and we take extra care when machining our lower receivers resulting in tolerances that are tighter and fits that are better than other lower receivers.

The Christensen Arms CA-10 is built on the AR-10 platform. Christensen has created an incredibly lightweight AR-10 that gives the shooter a new level of long range precision in a rapid-fire semi-automatic rifle. The CA-10 is built with a carbon-wrapped, match-grade barrel and is tipped with a titanium flash-hider or muzzle-brake. The hand-guard is constructed out of carbon fiber to lighten the front-end and create exceptional overall balance. It has a 24” barrel with a 1/10 twist. The rifle is equipped with a Magpul STR stock. It is a direct gas-impingement system in an AR platform. The full-length Picatinny top-rail makes it easy to mount any optics and accessories you want to add to your rifle. The bolt carrier group is nickel-boron, and this rifle accepts DPMS-style magazines. The CA-10 is unbelievably lightweight and easy to carry, weighing in at just over 7 lbs. 

FROM CHRISTENSEN:

CA-10 Recon Carbon Barrel

The CA-10 is Christensen Arms™ large-caliber AR-style firearm that weighs several pounds less than other guns of this type. The Carbon Barrel is available from SBR to 24” lengths. The nickel-boron coated bolt carrier acts as a protective finish, polishing the receiver each time it cycles. A perfect match for precision shooting, tactical drills, or hunting, the CA-10 comes in configurations to suit your specific needs.
