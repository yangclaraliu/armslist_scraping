I am truly and utterly baffled as to why they would do this.  I had them on the phone 2 or 3 days ago.  They had already taken my order and my credit card number.  They had NO PROBLEM with that part!  I called to double check that I had ordered the right magazines for my Beretta Cx4.  They said yes, that is the right magazine, but they are out of stock.  I asked how it works if I already made my order, if they don't get inventory before the Colorado ban starts.  They said that if I am in Colorado, they are already refusing to ship any magazines over 15 rounds, in anticipation of the law that won't go into effect for a couple of months yet.

The gun comes with everything it came with new plus four 13 round mags.  I have never had a problem with ths gun especially with it being such a reliable feeding round (think of a 9mm going into a .40 chamber), and it looks like new.  Also you could have 3 guns in 1 if you wanted to by buying a .40 barrel and a 9mm conversion barrel (you will have to buy a 9mm mag too).  If you reload, then there is no point in the 9mm conversion barrel since you can shoot the .357SIG for around $8 a box of 50.  I've cleaned this gun after every time I shot it, so its been very well maintained.  I'm not sure of the round count, but for the condition the gun is in, I can say it's under 500.  The only reason I'm selling is because i bought a glock 33 which is also .357SIG.  My girlfriend recently decided she wants a glock 19 so I will do an even trade as long as you have the same amount of magazines. Feel free to ask any questions.

What's there to say about the Glock 19, other than they are great guns, always work, and in great demand, if you can find one. I have two 19's and decided to keep only one of them. From my ad response I could have sold the G19 already a hundred times. 

My SIG is Double Action/ Single Action trigger group with de-cocker, and factory SIG Night-Sights and is un-fired in the SIG case.

The ""Scorpion"" is a premier gun from SIG, and besides the cool factor, they are designed to meet all criteria and battle conditions that you can throw at it, and still function with 100% reliability.

This is the concealed carry version of the 45ACP glock, compact enough to be hidden easily while still packing a mean punch with 10 45ACP rounds. The pistol comes with factory box and papers, cleaning rod, and loader. The pistol comes with two ten round factory magazines as well as one 30 round Kriss Vector factory magazine. The Kriss Vector Super V mag holds 30 rounds of 45acp. Those mags are going for over $300 now, and their prices are only going up. The main shortcoming of the 45acp concealed carry weapons was the limited capacity of their magazines given the size of the rounds. With a 30 round stick this 45acp pistol has as much fire power as any other pistol on the market. I have only fired the pistol 20 rounds of federal hollow points to test functionality. If I did not tell you the pistol was fired it could easily pass as new. This is a great all around 45ACP pistol. Please make sure you are legally allowed to own the pistol and high capacity magazines before bidding. Thank you for your time and consideration."

Pistol was made in 1966 by MBA in San Ramon, California. To give you an idea of who made it: Robert Maitland was a Nuclear Physicist at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Just South of San Ramon, California. This was made before we went to the moon and he developed this to be use in the confines of outer space. But not just outer space and on the ground but underwater too. This was truly remarkable piece of equipment. Plus it was the launching platform for the included three (3) solid fuel rockets. 

Besides that if you really want to look it up go to the History Channel on you tube and type in Gyro Jet you will see one being fired. 

Back to this interesting rocket pistol. 

The 13mm Gyro Jet pistol here is #169 of 1000 and is one of 12 in bright nickle. It was made in early 1966 and is nearly perfect although it is missing one scale (grip panel). It makes me laugh because it has an On/Off Switch instead of a Fire/Safe Selector like the later 12mm Gyro Jet Rocket Pistols"

 SRS: Command Arms CAA – SRS Sniper Stock with Rear Mono-pod - AR15
The CAA SRS Sniper Stock with Mono-pod Leg is the result of more than two years of research and development. Designed in conjunction with special units of the IDF (Israel Defense Force) the CAA Sniper Stock is designed to meet the demands of the precision marksman community. The Command Arms Sniper Stock has proven to provide rapid target acquisition, faster and more accurate follow up shots, and quicker target-to-target attainment. Completely adjustable and featuring a rear-folding pod that converts an A2 rifle, SR-25 rifle, or M4 carbine with a bipod, into a stable shooting platform with three-point support, the CAA Sniper Stock is in a class of its own. Operators who have evaluated the CAA Sniper Stock have found its unique features exceed all of their requirements. Finally, the ultimate sniper stock for the M16/AR15/ SR25 is now available.

$1875 is too far over MSRP already.  No need to consider the over-market-priced KSG's being offered now.

Specs (in case you're not familiar...)
The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 7 rounds of 12 gauge 2.75"" shells each, for a total capacity of 7+7+1=15 rounds. The pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in.

The scope is a tasco with a 8 to 32 magnification.  It has tactical turrets on it and a fine crosshair with 1/8 click adjustments.  For some reason the matte rubberized finish on it has become tacky.  I'm not sure why.  The scope works perfectly though.  It is mounted with all steel leupold mounts and bases.   The bipods will come with it.  They are cheap and missing one of the rubber pads on the foot.  Consider them a free added bonus.   More pics upon request.
