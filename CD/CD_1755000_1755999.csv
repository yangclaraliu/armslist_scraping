[11] For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.

Model: 686 

Serial Number: AAF5860 

Year of Manufacture: 1982 

Caliber: .357 Magnum/ .38 Special
Barrel Length: 4"" 
Type of Finish: Stainless 
Finish Originality: Factory Original
Action Type: Double Action Revolver, Swing Out Cylinder 

The left side of the barrel is marked ""Smith & Wesson"". The right side of the barrel is marked ""S.&W. 357 Magnum"". The Trade Mark logo and the 4-line “Marcas Registradas” address are on the right side of the frame. The frame, under the yoke, is marked ""AAF5860 / M / Mod. 686"". The yoke is marked ""B20 / S / 18623"". The left side of the grip frame is marked ""1 / 2 / B20 / S / 18623"". The right grip frame is marked ""V / B / 07530"". 
This revolver is mounted with an orange insert ramp front sight and a windage and elevation adjustable rear sight. The grips are target style checkered wood grips. The bottom edges show some wear and thinning. The right panel shows some chipping at the bottom and wear to the checkering from the case. There is some discoloration from handling andfrom the case. The grips rate in about Very Good overall condition.   The bore is bright with a bit of fouling and the rifling is sharp. There is no pitting or erosion.     This revolver retains about 85% of its metal finish. The contact surfaces show rubbing from handling, and storage in the case. This is typical with all the stainless S&W's. This revolver was cleaned heavily at some time, explaining the lack of lead rings on the front of the cylinder and also some of the dulling. What is great about stainless is that it can always be polished or brushed back to whatever shine you desire. The Screw heads are a bit worn. The markings are crisp. Overall, this revolver rates in about Very Good - Fine condition.     The action functions correctly, both single and double action. We did not fire this revolver.   This revolver comes in a S&W wood box. The lid has deteriorated, flaking velvet dust over the gun when the gun is in the case. The box is sound, though scratched. The cleaning swab is retained. This is not the correct box insert for this gun. The insert is for a gun without a full under lug. 

The Smith & Wesson 686 is possibly the best double action revolver ever made. This one is in great condition, features the red ramp insert on the front sight, and has an under lug barrel, which makes it a very handsome as well as robust revolver. Chambered in the hard-hitting .357 caliber, it will also fire .38 special rounds which offer less blast and flash, and which can be loaded down. Dependable, accurate, trouble free – this revolver will make its new owner very happy!."

This rifle was manufactured from 19876 until 1985 and hasn’t been made since. It is becoming hard to find and becoming very rare in this condition. This .22lr was styled after the legendary Russian PPSh 43 submachine gun.

There is no rush or scratches and comes in the original box with the original paperwork. I always note any flaws or defects no matter how minor and there just aren't any visible, it is in absolutely pristine shape. Comes with 50 round drum, sling, original sock and the speed loader. The speed loader helps a lot with the 50 round drum and that piece is often missing.

Lightly used, stored indoors, non-smoker household. Wonderfully cleaned, in perfect condition. 

The Desert Eagle was originally designed by Bernard C. White of Magnum Research, who filed a US patent application for a mechanism for a gas-actuated pistol in January 1983. This established the basic layout of the Desert Eagle. A second patent application was filed in December 1985, after the basic design had been refined by IMI (Israel Military Industries) for production, and this is the form that went into production.

The Desert Eagle uses a gas-operated mechanism normally found in rifles, as opposed to the short recoil or blow-back designs most commonly seen in semi-automatic pistols. When a round is fired, gases are ported out through a small hole in the barrel near the breech. These travel forward through a small tube under the barrel, to a cylinder near the front of the barrel. The separate bolt carrier/slide has a small piston on the front that fits into this cylinder; when the gases reach the cylinder they push the piston rearward. The bolt carrier rides rearward on two rails on either side of the barrel, operating the mechanism. Its rotating bolt strongly resembles that of the M16 series of rifles, while the fixed gas cylinder/moving piston resemble those of the Ruger Mini-14 carbine. The advantage of the gas operation is that it allows the use of far more powerful cartridges than traditional semi-automatic pistol designs. Thus it allows the Desert Eagle to compete in an area that had previously been dominated by magnum revolvers. Switching a Desert Eagle to another chambering requires only that the correct barrel, bolt assembly, and magazine be installed. Thus, a conversion to fire the other cartridges can be quickly accomplished. The rim diameter of the .50 AE (Action Express) is the same as the .44 Remington Magnum cartridge, consequently only a barrel and magazine change is required to convert a .44 Desert Eagle to the larger, more powerful .50 AE round. The most popular barrel length is 6 in (152 mm). The Mark XIX barrels are machined with integral scope mounting bases, simplifying the process of adding a pistol scope."

The left side of the frame is marked ""Pat. Sept. 19 1871 / July. 3=2. 72. Jn. 19. 75."". The frame, trigger guard and back strap are marked ""271797"". The rear face of the cylinder is marked with the Colt Rampant logo, without a circle. 

Barrel Length: 7 1/2"" This is an SAA barrel that has been replaced. 

Sights / Optics: The gun is mounted with a modified front blade (please see the pictures). The rear sight is interesting... The top strap is in the same configuration as an original gun, but has seen extensive work. It looks like the original trough was milled and an insert put in its place. It almost looks like an adjustable sight was once on this gun, and then replaced with a fixed insert... Please see the pictures. It's neat and it does not look to be a repair of any sort. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are Franzit imitation stag. The grips have shrunk considerably, affecting the fit. The grips otherwise just show marking and age discoloration. The grips rate in about Good overall condition.

Overall Condition: This gun retains about 50% of its metal finish. The replaced barrel shows the majority of its original finish, drifting to a medium patina. There are nicks and dings on the barrel, which are likely tooling marks. The frame metal is very smooth, without pitting, though the case colors have primarily muted. The frame shows an older surface cleaning and some very light discoloration. The grip straps show no finish, but smooth metal and the back strap has been crudely checkered. Someone has also lightened the hammer. The Screw heads are very serviceable, though a bit worn. The markings are clear. Overall, this gun rates in about Very Good condition. 

Mechanics: The action functions quite well. The timing is good and the springs are strong. This should be a great shooter.

The stock and handguards will be of walnut and correct for the rifle but will have some dings, dents, scratches and marring of the wood finish. Stocks will have the appropriate original inspector's cartouche. The rifle bore will be very good with no significant defects. Very good to excellent condition. This grade is rare and is only available occasionally in limited quantities. Because of the scarcity of these rifles, they will only be sold on the CMP auction site.

Correct Grade rifles will have all correct parts for the date of manufacture with 80% or better overall original metal finish. The stock and handguards will be of walnut and correct for the rifle but will have some dings, dents, scratches and marring of the wood finish. Stocks will have the appropriate original inspector's cartouche. The rifle bore will be very good with no significant defects. Very good to excellent condition. This grade is rare and is only available occasionally in limited quantities. Because of the scarcity of these rifles, they will only be sold on the CMP auction site.

The class lasts about 7 hours total, includes a written and range test, basic handgun safety, handgun cleaning, handgun knowledge, handgun marksmanship, and qualifies you to apply for a CCDW license in KY. Students should bring a modern functioning handgun with 50 rounds of factory new ammunition and appropriate cleaning supplies for the firearm. Don’t have a handgun, ammo, or supplies? No worries! Get in touch with me and we can work out the details. There is also a $60 fee divided between the state and local police that is normally paid 2-3 weeks after the completion of the course. A criminal background check will be done by the Kentucky State Police after the completion of the course. Due to high volume, it is currently taking up to 5 months after the class for the actual license to be issued by the Kentucky State Police. Feel free to contact me, and thanks for your consideration!"

The following is the description on Kahr’s website:

KP3833 (2.53"" Barrel) 
Black polymer frame, matte stainless slide
MSRP: $649.00
Caliber: .380 ACP
Capacity: 6+1
Operation: Trigger cocking DAO; lock breech; ""Browning - type"" recoil lug; passive striker block; no magazine disconnect
Barrel: 2.53"", Premium Lothar Walther Match Grade Barrel
Length O/A: 4.9""
Height: 3.9""
Slide Width: .75""
Weight: Pistol 9.97 ounces (w/o magazine) 
Grips: Textured polymer
Sights: Drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights
Finish: Black polymer frame, matte stainless steel slide
Magazines: 2 - 6 rd, Stainless

The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP caliber, has a 2.53"" barrel and an overall length of 4.9"", with a height of only 3.9"". It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide, with optional night sights available.

The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.

The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

Berreta Info: 

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

Other PX4 Accessories 3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Trijicon Night Sights.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use. 

9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

The Glock 31 is about the size of a medium-frame .357 service revolver but
much lighter, with 10/15/17 shots instead of 6. The G31 in .357 delivers
the same legendary stopping power as the old Magnum with faster delivery of
many more shots with less recoil and better trigger pull thanks to the
modern Glock ergonomics. Externally, what is immediately apparent is the
multiple back strap design of the frame, which can be instantly adapted to
small, standard and large frame hands. The surface if the frame is the Gen4
Rough Textured frame scientifically designed, real world tested,
Internally, the Gen4 Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially
increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable
in seconds, accommodates left or right handed operators.

Introducing the XD-S. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers
all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.
At only 1""  wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry
strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag
pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a
top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and
usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S,
the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol.
Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be
inserted into the pistol.

Like the Kalashnikov rifle variants, it is a rotating bolt, gas-operated gun that feeds from a box magazine. All Saiga-12 configurations are recognizable as Kalashnikov-pattern guns by the large lever-safety on the right side of the receiver, the optic mounting rail on the left side of the receiver and the large top-mounted dust cover held in place by the rear of the recoil spring assembly.

The Saiga-12 is manufactured by the arms division of Izhmash, in Russia. It was previously imported into the US by European American Armories, although their agreement expired in 2005 and Izhmash then began exporting through the Russian-American Armory Company. The current export import partner is Wolf Performance Arms.[1] Izhmash also manufactures Saiga 20s and Saiga 410s in 20-gauge and .410 bore, as well as the Saiga semi-automatic hunting rifles in a number of centerfire calibers.
