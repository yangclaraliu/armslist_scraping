can increase in value from one month ago when a seller
""bought it and only shot it a FEW times"" 
now the gun is suddenly worth twice what the retail value is?
maybe I'm just un-informed, but I don't know why anyone would buy
a weapon on here used, that costs less at the big sports stores new.
Please elighten me if you have a sensible answer

update:
See below.. this is just a sampling of the replies I received
Renews my faith that there still are real gun folks on this board.

Folks, please do some research before you pay the outrageous prices some
Are fear peddling on here.  The stores are slowly restocking and there is no reason to be taken advantage of.  


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
People are stupid...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
its because they fired their $1.00 a round 5.56 thru it. made it 2x valuable LOL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I even told one seller that a local gun shop had exactly the same firearm new at $150 less than his used one and he tried to convince me to buy his at the higher price. Told him they had 7 of them on the shelves They do believe that a lot of idiots read this board.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because these idiots are trying to take advantage of the misinformation that is going around. It's finally starting to free up. I contacted a guy on here that had an XDS 45 that retails for 549, I offered him 600 and he turned me down. I just went to Cabela and they just happen to get one in so I saved myself some money.

Weapon has never been fired besides factory proofing to verify operation. Everything seen in photos is included (besides photo background)! Some of the features:

CONDITION: Factory new, in factory box. Not for sale anywhere but here. Not a display model-has never been handled.

In order to meet the needs of today‚Äôs combat conditions, the new stainless steel magazine was developed. Extremely durable and dependable, the stainless steel magazine outperforms the mil-spec aluminum magazine in every test. 

The combination of 400 series stainless steel and heat treatment makes this magazine one of the most heavy-duty in the industry today, with only a slight increase in weight. It can take a beating that would destroy an aluminum magazine and continue to perform admirably with enhanced strength, reliability and performance.

All C Product Defense magazines feature the new ‚Äúsnap on‚Äù anti-tilt follower. The use of the .020 gauge material in stainless steel combined with increased interior dimensional room enhances proper stacking of the rounds and dramatically reduces failure due to jams. Functionally, this magazine is far superior to any in today‚Äôs market.Ôªø

So whats up with you cheap ***holes?
It amazes me.. For weeks you scramble to buy everything at any price.
I could put a crappy AR up for $2000 and you would grab it without question.
.22 for $200 per 500? Yep you would pay it..

But unlike the other jerks out there I did not do this, I did not sell a single thing during the panic.

But now that I put up a hard to get AR15 for a REASONABLE price, that comes with a ton of extra stuff including a expensive scope.. Not even a biter.. I have not even had a single person message me to low ball!

I post up a case of 7.62x54r for $160 and get a single email from a guy asking if I would take $100 walmart gift card for it.. BEFORE THE PANIC YOU COULDNT EVEN GET IT FOR THAT CHEAP. The best online price was $160+ shipping!! It sells out in minutes online currently anytime its up for $160-180+ shipping..

So where are all the idiots paying $50 for a box of plinker 9mm ammo?
Where are all these people who hassled and low balled me during panic?

Did you all max out your credit cards? Finally realize Obama is not going to ban guns?

Im just astonished! It seems I could price my m9 beretta at $300 and I would not get a single email about it. Is there a single ****ing person on here with a pulse? 

Anytime I go to buy something people act like their product is made of gold. But when I post something at a lower price than anywhere else I dont get a single email. Or I get an email from some cheapskate with some sob story of ""18 years ago I got one of those for $200, so will you take $200""

Yep I sound like a POS.. No offense is meant, but im sick and tired of people low balling me offering $700 for a $2000 setup. Can I get a single decent offer? Is there a single person out there wanting a good rifle at a better than average pre panic price? Or am I doomed to get little stories and reasons why I should take $800-900 for a $1000 rifle with a $600 scope and 20 30rnd magazines?

EDIT

Get the latest technology in plate defense with 7.62 APM2 Plates (Armor Piercing Protection).  

If you are looking for a premium quality plate that passes NIJ IV certification, look no further. These BAE Eclipse plates are made from Boron Carbide ceramic tiles, the same technology used in current military issue ESAPI plates costing several times more. 

Typical commercial plates are Silicon Carbide and you pay a premium in weight versus performance. Not only are these premium plates in the same price bracket as commercial ICW plates, they don't need soft armor plate backers to achieve their rating, making them an even more incredible deal. These plates are made to the same size and weight spec as ESAPI plates (BAE is one of three ESAPI plate providers to the military).

*Lightweight design 

*Compatible with almost all Armor/Plate Carriers

*Size Large (10.25"" x 13.25"" / 6.4 lb)

Here is what she said: ""I will tell you these are ammunition, they‚Äôre bullets, so the people who have those now they‚Äôre going to shoot them, so if you ban them in the future, the number of these high capacity magazines is going to decrease dramatically over time because the bullets will have been shot and there won‚Äôt be any more available.""

Imported from Czechoslovakia and manufactured D-Technic. 
- Built on milled receiver
- 7.62x39 caliber and take all standard ammo corrosive and non-corrosive)
- Czech made cold hammer forged chrome lined barrels. 

Advantages of Sa vz. 58 over AK47 rifles (cited from Richard Rich Chris)
- All vz. 58 rifles possess a milled receiver; the vast majority of AK47s utilize stamped sheet metal receivers and are not as rigid as the vz.58 receiver.
- Even with the milled receiver it is almost one pound lighter than a stamped AK47.
- The bolt of the vz. 58 stays open after the last round in the magazine has been fired ‚Äì the shooter immediately knows the firearm is empty and allows for quicker reloads.
- The vz. 58 can be reloaded with stripper clips while the magazine is inserted in the rifle.
- The vz. 58 has a more natural point of aim and is faster handling.
- The safety is more ergonomic making a faster first shot possible with the vz. 58. Unlike the AK safety, the vz. 58 safety can be operated by just a forefinger with the hand remaining on the pistol grip.
- vz.58 has no need for an ejection port dust cover as the receiver is completely enclosed. A cover (on the safety lever) must be used on the AK47 to prevent debris from entering the receiver through the reciprocating charging handle slot.
- The ejection port is HUGE. There is no chance of an empty case getting stuck in the action of the vz. 58.
- The vz. 58 gas piston can be removed or exchanged without tools.
- The alloy magazine of the vz. 58 is half the weight of the steel AK47 magazine.
- The vz. 58 is striker fired unlike the hammer fired AK47. This reduces the number of parts and possible points of failure.

The gun is in great condition with very minor surface rusting that can be cleaned off and it functions like a dream. The Lyman scope is an All-American 4X scope that has worked beautifully for me. The gun has only been shot around 15 times and only at beer cans and paper set up in the woods of upstate New York and then stored for the rest of its life. The bolt is an FN Mauser that runs very smooth and gives and easy load for each round. The trigger had a great tweak done to it and now sports a little less than a 2lb crisp pull. This baby is an amazing gun to hunt with and can take down almost anything you want but there is quite a kick that comes with it. And as I have been asked a few times, there is no raised cheek piece on the stock, it is flush all around. Not knowing an extreme amount of gun history knowledge, I sought out a few gunsmiths to help find the year of the rifle but the closest I could get between the parts and the serial number is the mid 1950's. The bag it came with is an older soft rifle case but the bolt has torn the fabric on the inside where it sits. I do not want to sell it, but as my taste has changed, so has my choice of firearm and pistols are my new passion. Email me with any questions and offers!

Most people understand that but some people have asked this question. It's a blanket cost that I figured would equate to a nearly complete AK.
I'm surprised more people haven't been buying the full parts. $500 for a milled receiver underfolder is cheap compared to what everyone else is asking. (I've only seen $800+ AK's while Centerfire has had Polish pistols w/ free shipping for $600. Make sense people.) 

I have a lot of AK parts or ""Milled kits"". Only major thing I'm missing is front trunnions. I'd be willing to sell these as milled kits. (You'd need trunnions or milled receivers to build on.)

Or I'd be interested in purchasing/trading for trunnions or milled receivers so I can build the full guns.

I have two underfolders to either go with a kit or that I would sell seperately. I don't have the internal receiver piece so again these are good for milled receivers. Otherwise there are some aftermarket internal trunnion pieces that can be welded together for sale now.

I have a milled replica receiver if you want to build or make a replica gun. This removes the need for the trunnion pieces to complete a full gun."

636,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1398636,For Sale/Trade:  SKS owners: Change mags in ¬º the Time!,"South Metro, Denver, Colorado",$ 175,"Listed On: Wednesday, April 10, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"SKS owners: Change mags in ¬º the Time!

For sale/trade: my modified SKS bolt that lets you change magazines faster and easier. Like - as fast as you can snap one out and snap a new one in! The contouring I've done to the shape of this bolt (after I studied the problem for years and measured and experimented in the shop until I got it right) also eliminates the major cause of most SKS / magazine incompatibility problems ‚Äì the mag lips hitting the bottom of the bolt (which also causes most SKS FTCs and FTEs). 

Open the top cover, slide your bolt out, slide THIS one in, and you'll be able to change mags in seconds without having to wait for ‚Äúlast shot hold open‚Äù or reach inside the bottom of the rifle and lock the bolt open manually with all three hands like you do now. MAJOR improvement in function and reliability over a standard SKS. 

When I finally got this right in my own SKS, jams and stovepipes suddenly stopped happening and I started enjoying my SKS for the first time. 

This bolt has also been torn down, the original (bad design!) firing pin removed, everything that touches ANYTHING burnished and polished (especially the interior of the firing pin channel). Then I threw away the standard firing pin and replaced it with a patented hardened steel MADE IN USA firing pin nestled inside a return spring. Now the pin hits the primer and flies all the way back and doesn't get stuck in the tunnel any more. This eliminates the SKS's weakest link ‚Äì the firing pin which can get rusted and stuck inside the channel, causing FTFs or deadly ‚Äúslam fires‚Äù.  Go ahead ‚Äì pull out your bolt and try to move the firing pin back and forth. You'll see what I mean. One of these days your firing pin is going to stick and when you release the bolt, you accidentally fire a round. SKSs have been known to empty entire magazines without any human help. Scary thought. This makes 1000% improvement in the way the SKS fires.

Replace your bolt with THIS one, set your old bolt aside and never be without a spare.

Please understand that ANY alteration to a default SKS ‚Äì including removing the fixed magazine ‚Äì puts you in the 922(r) compliance arena. Do your own research ‚Äì for instance, a magazine made in the U.S.A. Counts as three (3) 922(r) compliant parts.

And, yes, the new Made in U.S.A. firing pin qualifies as one (1) 922(r) compliant part.

This thing makes mag changes lots easier and faster, and makes the rifle much safer than the way they're shipped over here.

Even with this safer firing pin design, it is still YOUR job to clean your rifle and its parts to prevent rust and the buildup of foreign matter. 

I'm into this bolt and firing pin $120 plus a couple of hours of my time in my shop. What's it worth to transform your SKS into a serious machine that fires round after round without malfunctioning and lets you remove and re-insert mags smooth as silk any time you want as fast as you can pull one out and slap a new one in?

This bolt's my spare. If I sell it, I'll make another. Once you try these two mods, you'll wonder how you got along without them. Even if I don't sell this one, maybe you'll do some research and do it yourself. More power to you. It's all about safety and NOT having a bunch of us yayhoos running around with firearms that don't work when we need 'em to.

If you're interested in this one, shoot me an offer (I'm open to trades, too ‚Äì especially ammo); otherwise I'll just keep it in my spare parts bin.

Stay Safe!"

**Pmag
The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact resistant polymer construction, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.

**Tapco:
The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE¬Æ is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine.  It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we‚Äôve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine.  First, we‚Äôre making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel.  Second, we‚Äôve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30(10) rounds.  Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn‚Äôt just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.

We‚Äôve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won‚Äôt be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine."

There is some definite wear to the box, but mostly on the sides and back. A few dents and dings toward the back, but nothing major. The front of both the top and bottom pieces is in pretty good condition. Comes with keys that lock all drawers and the top compartment. The only issue I've had is when I received the box(I'm the second owner) it was slightly lopsided. In other words, one wheel is about 1/8 of an inch higher than the others, which causes a tiny shift when opening drawers. This issue could be resolved in no time by just putting a few washers between the wheel plate, I just simply have not had the time to mess with it. Other than that, it's a good snapon tool box listed at a couple thousand less than you'll find a comparable box. Also remember, Snapon is lifetime warranty, so in the event you need something replaced, you can get it taken care of. I'm asking $1,300 OBO. Will entertain any serious offer."

I purchased the lower with plans to build a no expense spared lower for a target/varmint rifle, but I recently decided to go another direction with the build. I paid $219 for this lower + transfer fee, but I also bought it when lowers were a bit harder to find. I'm losing about $40 but I simply don't need this lower anymore. 

This particular lower has an integrated over sized trigger guard for use with gloves, and a no roll pin assembly design. The finish on this lower is perfect. I can't find a single blemish anywhere on it. This lower also has a set screw tension adjuster which is only found on high end lowers. The front of the magwell also has magwell grips machined into the front of it.

I'll consider trade offers for FOID items, or possibly other items of like value.

Also, the barrel, receiver, and stock hardware all seem to match.  It even has it's set screws which lock the screws in on the floorplate and trigger guard.  The rifle was manufactured by Gustloff Werke, Weimar, Germany in 1944.  It was captured probably by the Russians late in the war or even after the war.  It doesn't have the typical ""X"" marking on the receiver like most ""Russian captures"", but it has all the other indicators.  These rifles ended up being distributed throughout the eastern block countries following the war.  Gustloff Werke, like most arms factories in Germany was said to have used slave labor from concentration camps.""  The above statement was given to me by an avid weapon enthusist that is well versed in the K98 rifles.  He is a close family member and doesn't bs or sugarcoat the subject at hand.  I have owned the rifle since around 1998. I've never shot it but it stays oiled and cleaned.  It is being sold with 33 rounds of ammo (possibly more if I run across any more).  I know VT doesn't require a permit to purchase.  I would require the buyer to cover the fees for transfer.  I know a local gunshop that can handle the purchase transfer.  In VT or NH only a valid DL is needed that lists your physical address."

I did not ""Screw"" people over in this panic, but now that the panic is over and people have already maxed their credit cards I am finding it hard to sell stuff that 4 months ago people would have sold their soul to get..

Anyhow, make me an offer. I am in Raleigh, I dont want to ship."
