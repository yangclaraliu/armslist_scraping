Buyer / Trade Partner Requirement: Anyone I conduct a transaction with must have valid Florida Driver's license / ID.  I will not sell to anyone under 21. I prefer working individuals that are CWP holders.  Individuals I work with must be willing to fillout paperwork and sign a bill of sale. I vet everyone I sell to or trade with so do not contact me if you are a felon.  I will check criminal history and if you have a record it will come out so do not bother trying to lie your way through a transaction. I guarantee trying to circumvent any of these requirements will cause the transaction to fail and ultimately waste everyone's time. If you are looking for a backroom undocumented or non-registered sale you will want to find someone else to work with."
