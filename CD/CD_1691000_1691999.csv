Block II (est. 8 Hours): Training, After Action Review, and Final Out


Purpose: The GASP will introduce clients to a “real-world” situation and help expose both 
strengths and weaknesses of the group as a whole. This training iteration will be an intense introduction into the skills needed for survival in a chaotic environment. This is meant to stress, test, and upset the balance of any group to expose both strengths and weaknesses in an austere environment. By taking you out of your comfort zone and exposing you to being tired, hungry, and disoriented, your group will need to adapt and overcome your situation and environment to thrive.

The GASP Basic (GASP-B) course is a pre-requisite for follow on training, and will provide our team the opportunity to assess group and individual strengths and weaknesses.  This is not a firearms training course. Airsoft type firearms will be provided for familiarization purposes only.

You will find that it fits the AR-15, M16 and M4 This Item comes with a Mil-Spec T6 Stock Body Assembly with Metal Sling Swivel, Mil-Spec 6 Position AR Carbine Receiver Extension Tube, AR Carbine Buffer Spring, Buffer, AR Carbine Castle Nut, AR Carbine Locking Plate. Why you need it: The 6 position adjustable stock allows you to fit the rifle to your needs. Our extension tube is second to none and just like the stock body, meets all military requirements. This is the best fit between the stock body and the tube, cancelling any rattle that might occur with cheaper stocks. You will find this tube is crafted from the same aluminum that most AR receivers are made from except ours allow for extra camouflage due to the Desert Tan color. The tubes threads are rolled on as opposed to having them cut into the metal like most other extension tubes today. The inside of the tube is coated with a Mil-Spec dry film lubricant that not only keeps the action quieter, but reduces metal-on-metal contact, along with a grit blasted finish which enables our tube to have a non-reflective surface. Why buy it from us: Lifetime Limited Warranty Competitive price for Buttstocks"

So a Aero Precision lower or a Bushmaster lower would do nicely. I am not in a hurry to buy right now but pretty soon i will be . So shoot me some prices.

You can either come down to Vancouver to make the sale or i can send a check to you then when it clears you can ship it to my house.It is legal to ship the receiver to another person within the state if you have no reason to believe that they are a felon or otherwise prohibited from ownership.

 B1) To whom may an unlicensed person transfer firearms under the GCA? 

A person may sell a firearm to an unlicensed resident of his State, if he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under Federal law. A person may loan or rent a firearm to a resident of any State for temporary use for lawful sporting purposes, if he does not know or have reasonable cause to believe the person is prohibited from receiving or possessing firearms under Federal law. A person may sell or transfer a firearm to a licensee in any State. However, a firearm other than a curio or relic may not be transferred interstate to a licensed collector.

(B7) May a nonlicensee ship a firearm through the U.S. Postal Service?

A nonlicensee may not transfer a firearm to a non-licensed resident of another State. A nonlicensee may mail a shotgun or rifle to a resident of his or her own State or to a licensee in any State. The Postal Service recommends that long guns be sent by registered mail and that no marking of any kind which would indicate the nature of the contents be placed on the outside of any parcel containing firearms. Handguns are not mailable. A common or contract carrier must be used to ship a handgun.

I have the original hard case, manual, speed loader, lock,10rd mag (with original flat and finger extension plates), and 3 17rd mags (all with original Ruger extensions on them so they fit flush with the grip). 1 came with original with the gun, 2 are brand new, never used, and I'm pretty sure I still have the factory packaging around. I also have a barely worn, Old Faithful hip IWB holster (black on black). That's over $150 worth in extra accessories, not to mention, getting a hold of the high-capacity 17rd mags is nearly impossible right now. These mags are also compatible with the full-size SR9, just don't need the extensions.

I have to say, I like this gun a lot. It fits well in my hand, and I'm quick with it on the draw, getting a good grip, and putting shots on target. It's also more comfortable than my carry piece, and is a tack driver... shoot the bullseye out of the target accurate.

So why am I getting rid of it? I'm not as accurate in my defense drills with it. It just doesn't point as naturally for me as my preferred carry gun. Hey, different guns for different people, and I've seen and read that a lot of people love and prefer this one, so if I can get it to someone who will carry it everyday (like it deserves), then great.

For sale is a used (approx 700 rounds), pre-ban Colt Sporter Match HBAR with accessories.  The serial # is MH06XXXX.  There is some minor finish wear on the rifle, but it is in very good condition. This model has the flash hider but no bayo lug.  I spoke with Joe from the Colt archives and he confirmed the manufacturing date to be ""approximately 1991"".  He could not give a specific month, day, year.  This  confirmed the pre-ban status.


With the rifle comes the original manual, original sling, 1 original (to the rifle) and 1 extra Colt 5-round mag (2 total), 5 D&H tactical 30-round mags, an N/C Star 3-9x42 illuminated reticle scope with laser and drop compensator, a weaver style mount for the rifle handle (used to mount the scope), and a brand new Boyt H48 single rifle case.

I have used the scope with this rifle with excellent results.  The Boyt case I bought for another rifle, but decided against using it.  It is an excellent case.  The D&H mags are also new and have never been loaded.  The 2 Colt mags are used.  I unfortunately do not have the original box for the rifle.

$1450 local pickup or $1500.00 gets everything shipped.  The rifle will go from my FFL to yours.  I will package the rifle in the Boyt case and place it in a box for shipping.  The accessories will be packaged separately and shipped in another box.  I do not want to package magazines with the rifle and risk any kind of finish damage to the rifle.

Local pickup available in the Cleveland area.

The Gun was purchased for my sister's carry piece last month, it includes the gun, two 10 round mags, and the original box/paperwork.  

After firing the weapon she feels like it is heavier and larger in size then she would like as a everyday carry piece, a mistake on her judgement when she initially put it on lay-away back in January.  The gun has only 1 box (50 rounds) put through it, and ran flawless with no malfunctions during those 50 rounds. 

I am trying to help her get into something she is more comfortable with, and more importantly more confident with.  We are willing to sell the gun or trade for something more suited for her.  If you have something more valuable, but would like to trade, we are willing to put cash towards a trade if it is a gun more suited for her.  Again, she is my sister, so my concern in this is that she is happy with her every day carry piece.

Gun is almost brand new. Excellent condition!! Only fired 50 rounds and then put away. This gun super accurate and reliable! eats all kinds of ammo without any jams. will ship if buyer pays all fees. Comes lots of extras! This German Sport Guns GSG 522 is a great replica of the famous Heckler & Koch MP5. Everyone would love to own one and shoot one…however a real MP5 would cost you over $2,500 and even a replica that shot 9mm would cost over $1,500.  Not to mention shooting 9mm rapid fire with a 25 round clip would get expensive fast. Each magazine you shoot would cost you at least $6-$8…shooting three magazines at the range would set you back at least $20. The .22 LR is much cheaper too shoot. .22 LR cost around $.05 to shoot verses $.50 plus for a .223 or 9mm at $.30. Same great gun without breaking the bank!

Rifle is located in Cleveland, Ohio

For sale is a used (approx 700 rounds), pre-ban Colt HBAR with accessories. The serial # is MH06XXXX. There is some minor finish wear on the rifle, but it is in very good condition. This model has the flash hider but no bayo lug. 

With the rifle comes the original manual, original sling, 1 original (to the rifle) and 1 extra Colt 5-round mag (2 total), 5 D&H tactical 30-round mags, an N/C Star 3-9x42 illuminated reticle scope with laser and drop compensator (requires a weaver mount for the rifle handle, I no longer have the one in the pic), and a brand new Boyt H48 single rifle case.

I have used the scope with this rifle with excellent results. The Boyt case I bought for another rifle, but decided against using it. It is an excellent case. The D&H mags are also new and have never been loaded. The 2 Colt mags are used. I unfortunately do not have the original box for the rifle.

$1650.00 gets everything shipped. The rifle will go from my FFL to yours. I will package the rifle in the Boyt case and place it in a box for shipping. The accessories will be packaged separately and shipped in another box. I do not want to package magazines with the rifle and risk any kind of damage.

Rifle is located in Cleveland, Ohio.

For sale is a used (approx 700 rounds), pre-ban Colt HBAR with accessories. The serial # is MH06XXXX. There is some minor finish wear on the rifle, but it is in very good condition. This model has the flash hider but no bayo lug. 

With the rifle comes the original manual, original sling, 1 original (to the rifle) and 1 extra Colt 5-round mag (2 total), 5 D&H tactical 30-round mags, an N/C Star 3-9x42 illuminated reticle scope with laser and drop compensator, weaver mount for the rifle handle and a brand new Boyt H48 single rifle case.

I have used the scope with this rifle with excellent results. The Boyt case I bought for another rifle, but decided against using it. It is an excellent case. The D&H mags are also new and have never been loaded. The 2 Colt mags are used. I unfortunately do not have the original box for the rifle.

$1550.00 gets everything shipped. The rifle will go from my FFL to yours. I will package the rifle in the Boyt case and place it in a box for shipping. The accessories will be packaged separately and shipped in another box. I do not want to package magazines with the rifle and risk any kind of damage.

997,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1691997,Want To Buy:  CZ-P-07 decocker conversion parts,"Kirkwood, St. Louis, Missouri",Offer,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 29, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"CZ P-07 pistols used to ship with a decocker system installed, and parts to convert to a safety included in the box.  Recently a couple of variations have appeared with the safety only system installed and no decocker parts in the box.  At present CZ-USA has these parts on indefinite backorder, and when they are available, the price is way out of line for something that used to be included in the price of the gun.  If anyone has taken the decocker parts out of their P-07 in order to install the safety, I would like to buy them from you.  If you are local around the St Louis area, all the better.  As far as I can gather I need both left and right levers and a small spring.  If there are more parts needed, I would appreciate it if someone would let me know."
