Been my EDC for little over a year. Handle finish is a rubberlike material. This finish hasn’t worn well, but I planned to have it cerekoted eventually. However, my Mircrotech has finally come in after a year wait so I’m parting ways with the Spartan.
Includes the installed Tanto (partial serrated) blade as well as the Spear Point (double edge partial serrated) blade. The Spear Point has seen very little use but looks worn on the back side due to my auto sharpener. Glass breaker is a ball style.
Also included is Ravencrests “care kit” that includes replacement screws, wrench and most importantly a spare set of spring mechanisms. There is a belt holster that is unused.
Using the Build Your Own selector on the Ravencrest site this knife works out to $229 plus $40 for the spare blade. This is just a reference though as I know they can be had for less.

No scratches or marks that I could see. Once BDC is dialed in this scope works awesome and stays true at any magnification. Selling to fund 30mm rings for my new Nikon Monarch 7.
My honest opinion is this is probably the best FFP scope under $500 with BDC. Reticle design is probably not the best for paper target precision shooting due to the BDC's open circles. These open circles are AWESOME for deer or elk because it seems to represent the vitals of said animals.Cabela's has these on sale for $399.99 and the Leupold rings are $65."
