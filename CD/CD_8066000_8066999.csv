As soon as I find a good home for these, I can move forward with my next purchase. that is, unless you have what I want and would like to trade. See Bottom of Description for the ONLY trade items I am looking for AND this transaction will be for everything pictured and described in this listing, cash or trade only Face to Face. Only persons qualified to be Legal Owners in the State of Florida qualify! AND IN CASE YOU THOUGHT YOU MIGHT ASK ANYWAY - NO I WON'T SPLIT THE COMBO - ALTHOUGH MORE MAGS CAN BE AN OPTION For sale is the pictured Combo that includes a 9MM Cougar 8000 Pistol and a 9MM Beretta CX4 Storm Cougar 8000 Carbine - THEY WILL BE SOLD AS A COMBO ONLY, with 12 - YES ONE DOZEN Genuine 15 round Beretta Cougar Magazines.  Both Guns use the same magazine, the previously mentioned Cougar 8000 15 Round mag made in Italy by Beretta. In case you were wondering, CX4 is not modified to accept the Cougar Mags. The CX4 came this way from the factory and then Beretta ceased production of the CX4 Cougar when they stopped producing the Cougar 8000 Semi-Auto pistols and moved on the PX4 style Pistols. Anyway, the CX4 is OEM regarding the magazines it uses. The Genuine Beretta magazines are practically impossible to get today, I purchased them from Beretta several years ago, by calling the warehouse in Maryland and ordering a total of 36, to go with the 6 that I already had when they were onsale. I purchased the mags shortly after Beretta sold the Manufacturing Rights for the Cougar Pistol to Stoeger and I knew, at that time, the genuine magazines and parts would be increasingly difficult to locate, as time passed. The guys in Maryland were very helpful at the time, and I ended up with several misc Cougar parts, Beretta walnut grips among others. Each gun comes with a Red Dot laser, the pistol has a custom high power magnet attacment for laser under the barrel, while the Carbine laser is attached via a short Picatinney side rail and the carbine also has a full length top rail among other goodies, including a Barrel Shroud. The Carbine had a Premium tune-up and Trigger Job completed by the CX4 Specialists - SierraPapa - in Portland, Oregon. For anyone that has never fired a CX4, and especially with the Trigger tune and upgraded premium parts, they are a whole lot of fun, cheap to shoot 9MM and AMAZINGLY ACCURATE. You will find it enormously convenient and cost effective, to have a single type of low cost ammo in 9MM and a single 15 round magazine to fit both weapons. Finally, the Combo is professionally packaged in a Custom Guitar/Violin type case, with both guns and the Magazines. Guns a secured using several strategically located Velco Straps. Each firearm is in Pristine condition and Prime working order. The original plastic Guide Rod in the Pistol has been upgraded to Aircraft Grade Aluminum. In addition to the Hammer/Trigger/Spring upgrade done to the carbine, Sierra Papa installed several Premium parts including, the Steel Recoil Rod, Alloy Sear Clip, and put in a High Durability Buffer Replacement. Included in the package will be 500 rounds of 115 grain Speer Lawman Premium AMMO in individual packed blue MNM 50 round 9MM cases packed in a water proof ammo case. If you wish, more Beretta Cougar mags are available - the more you buy the less per item cost. I also other quality ammo available, including PMC and MAGTECH if you are interested in obtaining another 500 rounds for a discount price. Total Package is $1200 or best offer. I am open to entertaining Trade offers, but ONLY THE REVOLVERS LISTED BELOW. Consideration for a trade will include ONLY these specific 3 S&W Revolvers: 1. S&W PERFORMANCE CENTER® PRO SERIES® MODEL 986 - SKU: 178038 in the description online at S&W 2.

PERFORMANCE CENTER® MODEL 686 PLUS SKU: 11760 in the description online at S&W  If you don't have one of these Revolvers you will be wasting time for both of us by asking 'just in case'For those of you still with me, I wanted to make it clear as a Highly motivated seller, I would give more credit toward a trade involving any of the 3 above listed S&W Revolvers. So if you have one of the Revolvers I want, you might get a MUCH BETTER DEAL than someone with CASH I know, it sounds unusual, but that's the way it is ........ let me know Thank you in advance for any consideration while checking out this unique setup ANY LOWBALL OR OBVIOUSLY RIDICULOUS OFFERS WILL BE IGNORED AND/OR SUMMARILY RIDICULED IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN."

Power Steering reduces steering effort and foot fatigue, making Ultrex the smoothest, most responsive motor you’ve ever driven. Get instant response with all-day comfort. – Steering Lock: When you take your foot off Ultrex’s foot pedal, the motor head remains pointed in the direction you left it last – so you can keep your heading without loosing your bite. There’s no recoil or readjustment – just easier steering every day. – Ultrex Foot Pedal: The Ultrex foot pedal is like nothing you’ve ever used. Classic heel/toe steering with Power Steering gives you instant response without the fatigue. Steering Lock keeps the motor pointed in the direction you left it last when your foot leaves the pedal. Features Spot-Lock and AutoPilot buttons directly on the foot pedal, so you can lock onto a fishing spot or set a course directly from the foot pedal. – Lift-Assist: Lift-Assist’s stainless steel, nitrogen-charged gas spring makes stow and deploy easy. When you deploy, let go of the motor and Lift-Assist will gradually guide it into the water – quickly, but without impact. And stowing your motor is 50% easier – as easy as lifting your SUV tailgate. – Counter-Tension Stabilizer: Utilizes an integrated spring that applies force whether the motor is stowed or deployed. On the water, that translates to a motor with no play, no give, reduced steering torque and years of silent operation. – Digital Mazimizer: Motors with Digital Maximizer provide up to five times longer run time on a single charge by drawing only as much power as you need, so they don’t waste any energy. These motors are variable speed, so dial in your precise speed and let Digital Maximizer deliver the right amount of power, while conserving your battery – extending your time on the water. – Weedless Wedge 2 Prop: Push weeds away and take on the thick stuff without battery-draining chopping and hacking. Weedless Wedge 2 features swept-back, flared blades for unrelenting, reliable prop performance. – Advantage Minn Kota: Indestructible Composite Shaft: Pound for pound, our composite shaft is stronger than steel. It flexes on impact and won’t break, kink or corrode. – Cool, Quiet, Power:Nothing runs cooler or quieter than a Minn Kota. The extra large windings and commutators dissipate heat, resulting in cooler operation, extended battery power, and longer motor life. And the unique bearing system reduces friction to cut fish-spooking noise."

It was carefully cleaned after each range trip and then stored in a climate-controlled safe. It was never carried and that shows on the finish, as the gun is in perfect condition. It comes with 3 14-round mags, box, and manual. My strong preference is to sell, and I am asking $450 obo. I don’t need to sell, so if you lowball me, you will be mercilessly spammed. I will also consider trades for full size 9mm pistols. No other trades will be considered. I can add cash for the right deal.
