There are some small nicks in the finish. We tried to show them in the photos. Also, the emblem that had the 5 gold stars is missing (see photo). It has duplex cross hairs. The lens are clear, & scratch free. This scope is crystal clear [any of these Denver made Redfields that are not crystal clear; have something wrong with them.]We have all the factory literature Redfield ever published on the Illuminators (this includes the Golden 5 Star, & the Low Pro Series), & the Accu-Trac system. If you need any information, such as trajectory charts of the Bullet Drop Compensator dials: To an illustrated guide, on using the stadia wires, to bracket an animal; contact us, & we will email it to you.This scope includes the A dial; & a set of Butler Creek lens covers. If you need the B dial, let us know, & we will swap it out for you (the A, B dial, cover 95% of cartridge/bullet combinations). Although ABO is easily the worst scope repair company; we have ever had the misfortune to send a scope to; they do sell these dials, for around $20.00 each.These Redfields are easily the best hunting scopes, ever built; however; at this point, they are over 20 years old. We can not guarantee this scope is in perfect condition. Even if they look good, & there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with them, you don't know for sure, until you mount the scope, & try it.However, we do guarantee, there is nothing obviously wrong with the scope, we don't tell you about.All of these Redfields should be disassembled, & cleaned, before mounting them on a rifle. This usually costs $60.00-$100.00. You should figure that in, when buying the scope.There are two repair companies we have used; we wouldn't recommend, to anyone: Iron Sights, & ABO.We have sent a couple Redfields to Iron Sights, & it took a year to get them back, & they still had the same problems, they had, when we sent them in.ABO, is even worse. They either can't, or won't, fix anything properly, & they do not stand behind their work. They are very expensive; also. We would not recommend you send a toy scope, or a Tasco (same thing actually), to ABO; much less a prized Redfield, such as an Illuminator, Golden 5 Star, or a Low Pro.That said; there are several other scope repair companies; there has to be a couple of them that are reputable; who will disassemble, & clean a Redfield.The range finder in these scopes, will work in low light, cold, wet, rainy, & snowy conditions. Every place a laser range finder, won't work. Same goes for the bullet drop compensator. They are hands down, the best hunting scope ever produced. Why Leupold doesn't put them back into production, is beyond me.One last thing. If you hunt in cold, wet conditions, you should always drop a heat pad over your scope, a couple days before the hunt. Hit it with at least an hour of heat.Any questions; email us through Armslist, or call us at: 307 258-9835.If you need faster shipping, contact us for a shipping quote. Contact us for an international shipping quote.We accept all major credit cards, but regrettably, we must add a 4% surcharge, to off-set the credit card charges.

I've owned this gun since new. Purchased it ~ 18 yrs or so back.I changed out the rear mainspring plastic/MIM part w/one from either Kings Gun Works or Brownells (can't recall). Blending of the base of the magwell and frame isn't perfect but not bad either and I'm being very nitpicky! Sights were Meprolight Night Sights I believe. Not very bright but the actual outlines are easy to pick up and it shoots great. Has a Wolf 18.5# recoil spring installed and the factory spring is included. Checkered Micarta grips installed. OE Rubber Grips and MIM mainspring included. Wilson Combat Checkered front strap overlay (frame is not checkered).  Also includes 1 Chip McCormick Powermag. Original Plastic box and paperwork included.Estimate 700 rounds thru this one. Most likely a lot less. Only mark is a smudge like mark along the front of the slide as pictured. For an 18+/- yr old 1911 it's in very good shape.I can send more pics of needed.  ONLY Trade considered: Older S&W 22 Cal Revolver or Glock G40!  ThxAsking: $650.00 ... Drop to $625 (Firm)

I purchased this scope new from Optics Planet back in the fall of 2016 and mounted it on a 6.5 Creedmoor I use for hunting large fields on the farm back home. I have now taken that rifle apart for building into a PRS match rifle, and therefore have no use for the PST 6-24 as I will also be stepping up to a 34mm tube scope. This scope is in in excellent condition, and looks just like new. I fired less than 200 rounds through the gun (hunting and shooting some steel at the farm) and it was mounted with Vortex Precision series rings. The zero stop shims are installed, and I will include the extra ones as well. The scope comes with the lens covers and also the sun shade, which was never used and still in original paper wrapping. The illumination also works perfectly. Price: $580I live and work in the Research Park/Gate 9 area of Huntsville and prefer to meet at the Cabela’s in Huntsville. I am not interested in trades. Thank you for looking and hopefully someone can use this deal to equip their rifle with a great scope without breaking the bank compared to what new scopes are costing these days. -Mike"

This rifle is in immaculate condition and comes complete in it's original factory box. GUARANTEED NO SALT WOOD. Also included is the serialized factory test target, the user booklet, one 5 round magazine, and the very seldom seen factory 2 piece single shot adapter. Even the factory flimsy translucent wrapping paper is included as well as the hang tag of the store where it was originally sold. This is a great addition for any Browning or vintage gun collector. Or, you can buy it and shoot it. As long as you take care of it, it will hold its value. The box is in excellent condition. ***** I am 68 years old, a non-FFL collector, hunter, reloader, and shooter. I am reducing the size of my gun collection in preparation for retirement and a much anticipated move back to the sunny south. *** PAYMENT, LAYAWAY, and SHIPPING - I will accept money orders, bank checks, and personal checks. Payment by USPS money order is preferred and results in next business day shipping. Other forms of payment must clear my account before shipment. Since I am not a business owner, I cannot accept credit cards. In lieu of that, I offer a 60 day layaway with 30 percent of the total down. The 60 day clock starts on the day of purchase. Do not opt for this unless you know you can handle it as the deposit will be forfeited if default occurs. Shipping with insurance is $50.00. Since I am a non-FFL I prefer to ship directly to your FFL. I will enclose a photocopy of my driver's license. If your FFL will only accept shipment from another FFL then add $25.00 to cover the FFL fee on my end. *** CALIFORNIA I'm not one of those who arbitrarily chooses to not ship guns to CA. I have an FFL who ships to CA FFL's for an additional cost of $30.00. However, if you are a CA bidder, you must first ensure that this firearm is legal to own before placing bids. Remember, this rifle has a tubular magazine with a capacity of more than 10 rounds and I wouldn't be surprised if it is CA banned for that reason. That's for you to check out. *** NO SALES to any location where prohibited by local or state law. It is your responsibility to know governance where you reside."

The glock comes with trijicon nights and a inforce light attachment. Extended upgrades on everything for easier function for your fingers. Finally, it will come with a T rex IWB Holster that was made to holster with the light. Now, lets do some math. 6 pre ban mags = $480.00Sights = $120.00Light = $100.00Holster = $70.00Ammo = $80.00Gun = $250.00total = $1,100 I mark the Gun at $250.00 because i stippled it. came out good at first but anyone who has a stippled gun knows that with use, it fades and wares. Anyone who understands this lovely state that we're in accepts that the pre ban mags situation sucks and why the price is jacked but its why i keep the gun price low. Lets be honest, its a glock. But this package comes with everything youd probably do on your own with it. I stippled the outer factory grooves so if you want to get it professionally stippled then a dremel will shave off the normal amount and you'll be good to go. I marked my prices at about 80% from what i paid and ive shot about 2,000 rounds out of it. Always kept clean and greased when not in use. The price and trade value is pretty firm. Im in no rush to sell or trade and im up for anything. Give me the low balls and what you may think would be a good trade or cash amount. I love the firearm culture and im open to most offers. All laws will be followed, proof of LTC A is requiered. Meet up in public and i usually meet up 50/50 but if you're 45 minutes away from me we can work something out."

It is unique for many other reasons but something it does is really special, the weapon cants on its axis 38 degrees one way or the other depending on your circumstances or hand you are firing with, otherwise it ejects from the top.  I could go on but go read about the little bullpup and shoot me an email if you are interested in this rare and very special piece. This is number 0018xx of about 3400 and that puts its production date at about 1974.  $1800 or trade for a 16 or 18 inch Springfield SOCOM or Squad Rifle."

It was barrelled by Springfield Armory in 1942 with the good 4 ring/land 22"" rifled barrel which is stamped and still has the flaming bomb cartouche. It is in excellent condition and was sporterized with a very nice high cheekrest stock. There are a few nicks, scratches etc. from use as would be expected. It's topped with a Bushnell Sharpshooter 3 x 9 scope. This rifle is very,very accurate and has dispatched many animals in my hands and who knows what else in it's lifetime.

Also comes with the reloading dies and 100 or so once fired tumbled brass. Everything you need to own/use this caliber. This rifle has been in the family since it got out of the service and is a great ""piece"" of history. I no longer hunt and cannot take the recoil so it is looking for a new home. I would rather trade than sell. Face to face cash or trade, NO SHIPPING, will need to see AZ ID. I can provide a bill of sale if desired. More pictures are available, I can only fit these 2 here.
