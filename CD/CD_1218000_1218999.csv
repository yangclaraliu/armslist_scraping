Brand New & In Stock!! NO credit card fees!!


The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed (not included), and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model  (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. 

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U. S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two decades of distinguished service and reliability. The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own.

What sets it apart from the 92FS is: 
A. Distinctive military style markings: on various components
closely replicate those of the U. S. Armed Forces
M9 pistols.
B. Unique M9-prefixed serial number: (M9-xxxxxx) sets
this configuration apart from the other 92 series pistols.
C. “Dot-and-Post” sight system: clones that of the M9."

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed (not included), and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model  (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. 

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

Patriot Brown
7.62 NATO

Brand New & In Stock!! NO credit card fees!!


The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed (not included), and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The R.E.P.R. rifle is available in three models: Standard Model  (16.1”) and Sniper Model (20”). The DMR and Sniper models will feature Geissele triggers. 

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

In order to realize this goal the engineers spent years experimenting with different systems until they created this mechanical marvel. Simple but durable, the 54 uses a floating action riding on rails to achieve a totally recoiless system that stands up to the pounding of our 1100 fps system. Not only does this arrangement prevent transmission of felt recoil to the shooter, it also permits the rifle to excel in the accuracy department. When the rifle is fired, the action moves back lightly within the stock, absorbing the recoil, and permitting the pellet to exit the barrel before any of the spring vibration affects its travel. This system dramatically improves the accuracy potential of this magnum air rifle, making it a first class choice for either long range pest control or the precise demands of field target shooting. This side lever cocking magnum rifle's other features include adjustable trigger, adjustable rear sight, scope rail, Monte Carlo stock with cheek piece and checkering, and an automatic safety.
Sells on-line for $595.00 without the scope and case.

 The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
 FACTS:
 You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
 We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
 The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
 The permit is valid for 5 years
 We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
 Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
 Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

 The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
 FACTS:
 You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
 We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
 The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
 The permit is valid for 5 years
 We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
 Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
 Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

Two-part floorplate with integral lanyard loop removes easily without tools for cleaning and maintenance; floorplate and follower are designed so they can’t be reinstalled the wrong way. Fits minimum-dimension magwells and guaranteed to drop free from mil-spec magwells under its own weight, even when empty. Fits any mag pouch designed to hold standard USGI-spec magazines. Body is precision formed on an 18-stage progressive die system from a single piece of .021"" thick 1050 sheet steel and robotically MIG welded for strength and dimensional consistency. Crush resistant to 1,000 lbs. (500 lbs. side load) fully loaded, and impact tested to withstand dropping 1.5m onto a flat concrete surface. Function tested to ensure operation at temperatures from –67°F to +329°F. Body is nitride heat-treated to Rc 60 surface hardness, then pickled to remove the oxide layer before application of the heavy duty manganese phosphate Parkerized finish (MIL-DTL-16232G Type M) for maximum abrasion resistance. After nitride hardening, follower, floorplate, and retainer receive a dry-lube-impregnated powder coating to aid in smooth follower movement. Both finishes resist continuous salt fog exposure for 96 hours without developing corrosion, and also resist bore cleaners, solvents, oils, gasoline, diesel fuel, hydraulic fluid, insect repellents (including DEET), and other harsh chemicals likely to be encountered in a military environment.

Fusil-USA produces highly-reliable magazines for the AR family of firearms. This 30 round .223 magazine features durable steel construction, tilt-resistant follower and an easy-to-remove floor plate that allows for assembly/disassembly and maintenance.
 All-Steel Construction With Robust One-Piece Body To Handle Extreme Tactical Conditions
 Newly designed, 30-round magazine features a strong one-piece steel body built to handle the roughest combat and tactical operations. Precision manufactured to ISO 9001:2000 quality management standards to exceed DoD specs for USGI magazines. Advanced features include a tilt-resistant steel follower and stainless steel spring that ensure even pressure on the round stack for smooth, jam-free feeding. Two-part floorplate with integral lanyard loop removes easily without tools for cleaning and maintenance; floorplate and follower are designed so they can’t be reinstalled the wrong way. Fits minimum-dimension magwells and guaranteed to drop free from mil-spec magwells under its own weight, even when empty. Fits any mag pouch designed to hold standard USGI-spec magazines. Body is precision formed on an 18-stage progressive die system from a single piece of .021"" thick 1050 sheet steel and robotically MIG welded for strength and dimensional consistency. Crush resistant to 1,000 lbs. (500 lbs. side load) fully loaded, and impact tested to withstand dropping 1.5m onto a flat concrete surface. Function tested to ensure operation at temperatures from –67°F to +329°F. Body is nitride heat-treated to Rc 60 surface hardness, then pickled to remove the oxide layer before application of the heavy duty manganese phosphate Parkerized finish (MIL-DTL-16232G Type M) for maximum abrasion resistance. After nitride hardening, follower, floorplate, and retainer receive a dry-lube-impregnated powder coating to aid in smooth follower movement. Both finishes resist continuous salt fog exposure for 96 hours without developing corrosion, and also resist bore cleaners, solvents, oils, gasoline, diesel fuel, hydraulic fluid, insect repellents (including DEET), and other harsh chemicals likely to be encountered in a military environment.

Barrel: A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system. The Special ultra lightweight profile barrel has a conventional .750"" gas block diameter, is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected. The weight of the barrel splits the difference between our light profile and our pencil barrel. Barrel is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider.
