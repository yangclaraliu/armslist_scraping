Gently used European American Armory Witness PS40. Comes with 1 mag. Made and imported from Italy. As you know this 1911 version is of military grade and was carried by the Italian police .This finished steel Witness is light enough to be used as a carry gun while being chambered in a caliber that can knock down an assailant. Featuring a spurred hammer with a long tang to prevent hammer bite, the Witness can be both single and double action fired. An internal firing pin block safety stops the firing pin from traveling forward and the manual safety allows the pistol to be carried with the hammer back, ready for use just by switching the safety off. Unlike most other semi-automatic pistols, the slide rides inside the frame rails rather than outside, providing a very tight slide-to-frame fit and very good barrel lock-up, which improves accuracy. This double-action pistol features a frame-mounted safety, fixed 3-dot sights."

Tactical Flexibility combined with the compact length of the 16"" barrel and collapsible stock are standard to  any carbine model; but add in the advancements that ArmaLite's engineers have made on every ArmaLite AR-10, such as improved feeding, extraction and ejection and there is not another heavy caliber carbine that can compare to this rifle. (- ArmaLite Website) In short this rifle kicks butt (Me).

This is my baby and I do not want to get rid of it, but unfortunatley I'm moving to some state that will not allow me to own it leagally.  When I was in the Marine Corps. I dreamnt of a 7.62 caliber M-16 so when I got my chance I bought one and customized it.

This AR-10 is in perfect like brand new condition (other than the sling I put on it but that I had that on my rifle when I was deployed to Afghanistan when I was still in the Corps) because I babied it and cleaned it after shooting it every time.  I have shot just at 500 rounds through it so it is still a baby in AR terms. 

Here are some of the mods I made to it and accesories it comes with:

Swaped out the standard hand grips for a rail system that allows you to customize it however you see fit
Rubberized hand gaurds
Tactical Vertical Grip that fits the rail system

Expandable Butt Stock with Rubberized shoulder piece

1-10 round magazine and 1-20 round magazine

Hard Case

Gun Cleaning Kit (Take care of it, it will take care of you)

Trijicon Reflex Site ($475 value)

I am not very flexible with the price, as I would rather give it to a friend to hold for me, than get rid of it, in hopes that one day I can own an Assault Rifle in any state. But the money would help me move which is why I'm posting it for sale.  I will require a bill of sale and a valid Drivers License.  Must be of legal age to buy it.

A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

The serial number is 80xx with the condition of barrel as excellent, overall about 70% blue remaining on slide and frame and grips as near perfect. This is John Browning's first successful patented semi-auto pistol and led to the popular 1911 Colt model. The action and workings of this gun are excellent but being over 100 years old one would expect some bluing loss and some corrosion in spots, there is that here with this gun. The faded or worn areas have turned brownish and a few of the screws and pins show use. Still a very nice addition to a collection, they are not as available as they once were and this is one of the rather early guns.

This is a RARE opportunity to own a special Colt AR. Under present circumstances perhaps an even better time to act.

Not only is this Colt a rarity in its caliber - 7.62x39, it is in near new condition, but without box, manual, or goodie bag. The firearm has been well kept and was purchased ""like new"" as a bare gun in the early 90s by the owner I bought it from. A replacement trigger group had been installed and the original was since lost.

This very meticulous 2nd owner removed the Colt carry handle upper, put it away, and replaced it with a flat top (PWS?), put in an accuwedge, changed out the flash suppressor and fired a few rounds now and then with it. He also told me up front his flat top upper would not chamber steel case or poly coated cartridges. Brass was all he ever shot through it. When I purchased it he replaced the upper with the original, still unfired. I have the original flash, and ""good guy"" 5 round factory steel mag.

SInce I bought it I have exactly 40 rounds through it - also brass FMJ. 20 PMC Bronze and 20 Fiocchi. I can say that the weapon is an absolute joy to fire. The well-balanced old school Sporter design with A2 stock and carry handle, combined with the R6830 buffer spring setup make the felt recoil about a wash compared to a 5.56. (My Colt 6720 M4 shooting 62gr XM855 kicks much harder.) On its iron sights at the back of my 25 yard range this Colt is also accurate - on its first box of ammo from the beanbag it shot sub-2"" groups with the PMC.

Included in the sale are some very rare accessories. In addition to the beautiful rifle I am including 4 high capacity magazines: two 20 rd, one 30 round, and the 75 rd drum. No markings but I believe these to be early USA ""frankenmags"". (This refers to ""obvious"" grafting the AR15 upper mag body to the AK47 lower.) I have not tested these for cycling but they are in very good to excellent condition. A magazine selection like this is VERY hard to find.

Along with the rifle and mags is a VINTAGE beauty of a scope - 3x20 Colt 1960s Japan manufacture and in near mint condition. Worth $4-500 alone, it is a nice companion piece to the rifle.

This classic weapon features the super-durable milled receiver. Chambered for the 7.62x39mm, it has a 16-3/8"" chrome-lined barrel with threaded muzzle. Condition is ""as good as it gets"" and the rifle is new-in-the-box, never fired. Cosmetically, I'd grade the overall condition at close to 98-99%. There is no rust or pitting, just the usual light handling marks that are always present on a military grade Chinese weapon. Matching numbers throughout. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent with bright, sharp rifling. It comes with the original bayonet & scabbard and all three original 30-round chrome follower mags (two still sealed in the wrappers!). Also included are the original sling, oil bottle, gas port tool, and cleaning kit (in butt trap). Of the highest quality and imported for only a short time (1988-1989), the Poly-Tech Legend is perhaps the most desirable of all the AK variants."

Was a field grade 28"" mod choke until I had the barrel professionally shortened and crowned and the bead reset for a current riot-gun configuration.

The gun is a 1954 issue, in excellent mechanical shape and very good cosmetic shape (only flaw is a small area of shallow pitting and bluing loss on left side of receiver). Straight-grain black walnut stocks retain about 85% finish and are crack-free. Bluing and overall fit and finish are excellent. Cylinder-bored 20-inch barrel with a bead sight; chamber and bore are both mirror-bright, as both have just been professionally honed and the barrel back-bored.

Would make an excellent Cowboy Action or Bowling Pin shotgun or deer gun with slugs or buckshot in brush or tight cover. And, of course, it would make a very persuasive and effective home defense gun. This was one of the very few pumpguns (with the Win. Model 97 and early Ithaca 37) ever built without a trigger disconnect, so it can be slam-fired--almost as fast as an autoloader. Compact, well-balanced, and shucks lightning-fast. 

And, of course, it has that unmistakable heft and feel of a pre-64 Winchester, when polished blued steel and real walnut were standard equipment. Unlike today's cheap pumpguns, the only plastic part associated with this gun is the Winchester embossed buttplate. 

I have additional photos that I will gladly email upon request.

 Serious inquiries only, please; do not reply if you are unable or unwilling to pass NICS. 

Respond to this post with a phone number and the best time to call.

The fire controls have been nickel plated for durability aesthetics. It has a full length quad rail for mounting anything you want such as night vision, lights, lasers....just about anything. Don’t think this rifle is all show. It will certainly hold a 1 inch or better group with factory loads. The barrel and upper receiver are DPMS. The receiver is a super heavy duty slick side and the BCG and has been Molly coated for smooth operation. The gas system is rifle length and has a weaver gas block for back up sights. The barrel is a heavy contour 18"" match grade 1 in 8 twist Panther Arms Mark 12 in stainless steel. It has been factory coated with black Teflon to keep the recce/mark 12 look correct.

Project Appleseed is a 2 day event providing rifle marksmanship instruction and the history and heritage of the Battle of Lexington and Concord which is described as the ""Shot heard round the world"". For details and locations visit www.appleseedinfo.org

History and Heritage

Project Appleseed is an activity of The Revolutionary War Veterans Association, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, dedicated to teaching every American our shared heritage and history as well as traditional rifle marksmanship skills.  Our volunteer instructors travel across the country teaching those who attend about the difficult choices, the heroic actions, and the sacrifices that the Founders made on behalf of modern Americans, all of whom are their posterity.
Our heritage program vividly portrays the Battles of Lexington and Concord with the kind of care and immediacy that is absent from most formal schooling. Modern listeners are confronted with the danger, the fear, and the heartbreaking separations that arose out of the choices made on April 19th, 1775. They are also reminded of the marksmanship skills and masterful organization that ultimately helped set the colonists on the path to success. Those who attend gain a better understanding of the fundamental choices faced by our ancestors as they began to set the stage for the nation we now enjoy.

Marksmanship Clinic 

Our rifle marksmanship program complements our history and heritage.  We teach the traditional American marksmanship skills.  There are, however, several aspects of our marksmanship program that deserve special mention. We are particularly proud of our younger attendees. In accordance with applicable local laws, young people with sufficient maturity are welcome to the Appleseed line and can, with parental permission, join the cadre.  The RWVA recognizes the importance of introducing a wide cross section of Americans to their marksmanship heritage. To encourage participation, we offer our program of instruction at a greatly reduced price to both women, and responsible persons under 21; Finally, an important aspect of our marksmanship program is called “Adaptive Appleseed.” Project Appleseed is serious about bringing our heritage and marksmanship instruction to everyone so we’ve committed ourselves to adapting Appleseed to the special needs of those who have certain physical challenges.
Why teach marksmanship?  Because good shooting requires learning positive traits such as patience, determination, focus, attention to detail, and persistence.   Since these skills are likewise key elements of mature participation in civic activities, we urge our students to take what they have learned about themselves as marksmen and apply it to their participation in their communities and in the wider American society in accordance with their own choices about how Americans should govern themselves. 

Civic Involvement

There are those who feel that America’s future is grim, that is, that America has lost something special and it can never be regained.   And in their consternation they mutter about “dark choices” and the like.  Appleseed has a message for them.   Just over two hundred years ago our ancestors genuinely faced a tough choice.  They could submit to those they felt were depriving them of their rights as Englishmen or they could fight.  Because they chose as they did, we may never have to face their dilemma because we have a third alternative.
So what must you do with your third choice?  Well, you must roll out of the recliner, cut off the computer, turn down the TV and get involved.  That’s it.  Talk to family, talk to friends, interact with neighbors, take part in local community decisions, and become active in whatever political party best fits your idea of how America should be governed.  Write to your elected representative, attend town halls, correspond with newspaper editors, and wholeheartedly enter the discussion in both online and traditional forums.
Read!  Think!  Debate!  Vote!  And finally, we'd really like your help in shaping America's bright future by participating in this program as a student, as an instructor, or as a volunteer in other support roles.  But even if you never pick up a rifle again, know that you are everything that Project Appleseed works for.  You are an involved, committed American making responsible use of the liberties gifted to us so long ago.  The future is what we make -- YOU make -- of it."

** Update: I received a few responses and offers so far, which I really appreciate it. But do not email me and whine about my price, and that you can buy the same gun cheaper somewhere else. If you can buy it somewhere else cheaper, then go buy it. Don't bug me. And if you are going to be a crybaby about it, don't reply to my posting (ad). You don't have to! Smart ass emails/responds will be ignored/ deleted. I don't want to be rude but some people around here are just like to whine and have nothing else to do but to piss people off **

“The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun manufactured in Turkey by Ucyildiz Arms. The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar. The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed.
The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be very easily removed from the upper receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer.

Project Appleseed is a 2 day event providing rifle marksmanship instruction and the history and heritage of the Battle of Lexington and Concord which is described as the ""Shot heard round the world"". For details and locations visit www.appleseedinfo.org

History and Heritage

Project Appleseed is an activity of The Revolutionary War Veterans Association, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, dedicated to teaching every American our shared heritage and history as well as traditional rifle marksmanship skills. Our volunteer instructors travel across the country teaching those who attend about the difficult choices, the heroic actions, and the sacrifices that the Founders made on behalf of modern Americans, all of whom are their posterity.
Our heritage program vividly portrays the Battles of Lexington and Concord with the kind of care and immediacy that is absent from most formal schooling. Modern listeners are confronted with the danger, the fear, and the heartbreaking separations that arose out of the choices made on April 19th, 1775. They are also reminded of the marksmanship skills and masterful organization that ultimately helped set the colonists on the path to success. Those who attend gain a better understanding of the fundamental choices faced by our ancestors as they began to set the stage for the nation we now enjoy.

Marksmanship Clinic

Our rifle marksmanship program complements our history and heritage. We teach the traditional American marksmanship skills. There are, however, several aspects of our marksmanship program that deserve special mention. We are particularly proud of our younger attendees. In accordance with applicable local laws, young people with sufficient maturity are welcome to the Appleseed line and can, with parental permission, join the cadre. The RWVA recognizes the importance of introducing a wide cross section of Americans to their marksmanship heritage. To encourage participation, we offer our program of instruction at a greatly reduced price to both women, and responsible persons under 21; Finally, an important aspect of our marksmanship program is called “Adaptive Appleseed.” Project Appleseed is serious about bringing our heritage and marksmanship instruction to everyone so we’ve committed ourselves to adapting Appleseed to the special needs of those who have certain physical challenges.
Why teach marksmanship? Because good shooting requires learning positive traits such as patience, determination, focus, attention to detail, and persistence. Since these skills are likewise key elements of mature participation in civic activities, we urge our students to take what they have learned about themselves as marksmen and apply it to their participation in their communities and in the wider American society in accordance with their own choices about how Americans should govern themselves.

Civic Involvement

There are those who feel that America’s future is grim, that is, that America has lost something special and it can never be regained. And in their consternation they mutter about “dark choices” and the like. Appleseed has a message for them. Just over two hundred years ago our ancestors genuinely faced a tough choice. They could submit to those they felt were depriving them of their rights as Englishmen or they could fight. Because they chose as they did, we may never have to face their dilemma because we have a third alternative.
So what must you do with your third choice? Well, you must roll out of the recliner, cut off the computer, turn down the TV and get involved. That’s it. Talk to family, talk to friends, interact with neighbors, take part in local community decisions, and become active in whatever political party best fits your idea of how America should be governed. Write to your elected representative, attend town halls, correspond with newspaper editors, and wholeheartedly enter the discussion in both online and traditional forums.
Read! Think! Debate! Vote! And finally, we'd really like your help in shaping America's bright future by participating in this program as a student, as an instructor, or as a volunteer in other support roles. But even if you never pick up a rifle again, know that you are everything that Project Appleseed works for. You are an involved, committed American making responsible use of the liberties gifted to us so long ago. The future is what we make -- YOU make -- of it."

I am open to doing this, I will take $600 cash obo.

I have a Springfield Armory XDS .45 pistol in like new condition that I am looking to trade.  It has had less than 100 rounds fired through it and is cosmetically perfect.  Comes with the whole kit which includes the paddle holster, magazine holster, 2 magazines, and the hard case.  I also have bought and installed Pearce grip extensions for both the magazines as well which makes holding this little gun much easier.  Comes with the original magazine base plates as well.  I also have about 25 rounds of Remington HD hollow points that I will throw in if the gun I am trading for is not a .45 (this is my only .45 right now so I will not be needing them).

Now for what I am looking for-  My first preference is for a Beretta 92FS / 92A1 / M9 / M9A1 / 90two.  Any of those models will do, but I want the pistol to be in equally good condition to my XDS (like new condition).  I am also willing to trade for a full size .45 pistol (1911s, FNX 45, FNP 45, etc). I would be willing to throw more money on top for the right pistol as well, however, I am NOT looking to sell this XDS.  It is up for trade only, so unless you want to offer me over market value for it, I am not selling the gun.

I am only getting rid of the XDS simply because I have no need for a concealed carry type pistol at this time.  I am open to other trades as well for items not listed above if the deal is right, so feel free to shoot me any kind of offer that involves firearms.  Not looking to do any kind of trading for ammo/accessories only, a firearm must be involved in the trade.

Shoot me an email with your trade offer and phone number and I will get back to you."
