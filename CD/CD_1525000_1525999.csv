It's a fun shooting .22 caliber. 

Here is a little of what I found online. By John Zent, American Rifleman

For more than a century, Iver Johnson was a prolific manufacturer of revolvers that claimed a large share of the lower- to mid-priced market. From assembly lines in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Arkansas, the company produced scores of different models that ranged from crude, spur-trigger pocket pistols to full-size double-action revolvers whose fit, finish and features rivaled name-brand wheelguns. Shooter perception varied accordingly. Some considered “Owlheads” (so-called for the grip embellishment seen on many models) nothing more than cheap marginal revolvers, while others appreciated a relatively inexpensive alternative that was also solid and reliable.

Among Iver Johnson’s finest work was the Supershot Sealed Eight, a series of large-frame, top-break .22 rimfires produced in three production stages between 1932 and 1958. Its lines and blued finish mimicked costlier revolvers, and it had the heft and balance of a high-end match gun. The oval-shaped, single-piece “Hi-Hold” walnut stock added further to the gun’s appearance and handling characteristics. Sealed Eight stocks typically sported a diamond-shape checkering field over the backstrap, and attached to the frame via a single screw through the butt.

The Sealed Eight name came from a unique safety feature, in that all eight chambers were counterbored into the cylinder face so that the shooter was shielded in the event of a ruptured case head. Inner surfaces were correspondingly machined to allow the star extractor to fit flush as well. Variants with 2½- and 4-inch barrels were offered for short periods, but by far the most common Sealed Eights came equipped with a 6-inch barrel. With the longer barrel, the overall length was 10¾ inches and the weight was 24 ounces, with beefy dimensions that complemented the gun’s smooth operation and aided the shooter’s ability to hold it steady.

Stunning wood finishing, easy-to-adjust iron sights, and simple safety features add to the STG-44’s superb level of quality. Packed in an old-world style pine crate made by Amish craftsman, the STG-44 offers everything to make any shooting experience a memorable one.

  Almost every family has great grandpa's old shotgun. It may have been in the family for generations! It is a keepsake but needs to be put into better shape. Parts may be missing.

Perhaps you wish to present this family treasure, fully restored for Father's Day? Or a birthday? Don't wait. It may take us DAYS to complete your project - once we get yours in line.

The All-Round Talent

GLOCK 19 ""GENERATION 4""


The GLOCK 19 is ideal for versatile use through reduced dimensions compared with the standard pistol size. With the proven caliber of 9x19, it has found worldwide distribution in security services. In addition to being used as a conventional service weapon, it is suitable for concealed carry or as a backup weapon. For instance, many of the elite pilots of the USAF for instance trust the GLOCK 19 for their efficient defense in emergency situations. 

The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested
“Safe Action” system
durable exterior finish
cold hammer forged barrel
durability
reliability
light weight

... that make GLOCK firearms famous!

The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back strap) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size.

The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin.

The grip angle of the GLOCK “Safe Action” Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol.

    The smallest back strap is integrated in the GLOCK MBS Frame reducing the trigger distance of the standard size frame by 2 mm. The medium back strap is a 2 mm back strap offering equal size of a standard frame. The large back strap is a 4 mm back strap.

    The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts.

    Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps.

    Internally, the original recoil spring has been replaced with a dual recoil spring assembly. The dual recoil spring assembly noticeably reduces the recoil while simultaneously increasing the life cycle of the assembly.

All GLOCK pistols are backed by the GLOCK Limited Lifetime Warranty and world-class customer service and support that is second to none in the firearms industry!"

I've been very interested in this particular GBB, partly because the real gun is so interesting and partly because the TM 5-7 has built a reputation for being a 'big kicker' by GBB standards. That I have got to review this gun it is brand new In the Box  with a Foliage Green framed version with the Tac Light. The box is a little ordinary next to TM's own 1911A1, but the smart cardboard lid looks suitably 'tacti-cool' and the white polystyrene bed protects and supports the 5-7 and the mag, which was shipped with the 5-7. You can fit a mag in the gun in the box, which means it'll hold the gun and two mags, which is always a nice touch with TM boxes I think.  As well as the gun, magazine and the Tac Light (attached to the gun in the box), there was the usual collection of BBs,cleaning rod, a TM catalogue and various parts and instruction manuals.
The gun, with the magazine in at least, feels solid and pointable from the outset and it looks well made and tight of fit.The rear sights, take down catch, trigger, safeties and trigger are all metal and look surprisingly small and jewel like."

Improved Global Pistol


The GLOCK 17 GEN 4 in caliber 9x19 is the most widely carried law enforcement pistol worldwide. Because of its unsurpassed reliability, above-average magazine capacity of 17 cartridges in the standard magazine and its low weight, it is trusted by law enforcement officers in their daily duties throughout the world. The Glock 17 Pistol is safe, easy and quick to use through the revolutionary “Safe Action” trigger system. GLOCK 17 Generation 4 – designed for professionals.

With the new GEN 4 frame, features which have been requested by past users have been incorporated in this 2010 Glock model. Removal of a single pin allows the user to quickly and easily change grips to fit the GLOCK 17 Generation 4 into a small or large hand.  Glock's long life dual recoil springs replace the single spring found in previous models, giving a much better feel. The Glock 17's surface of the stock and backstraps have been redesigned to provide a much improved grip, providing better control. The last improvement Glock made for this model is the slightly larger and reversible magazine catch. 

GLOCK 17 Gen 4 pistols are backed by the GLOCK Limited Lifetime Warranty and world-class customer service and support that is second to none in the firearms industry!

I don't care if what you have is new or used(as long as if it's used its not in too bad of shape for the price). Any extra's you have for the gun would be awesome, ammunition, etc.

BTW 400 isn't necessarily the price. I'm willing to check out anything close to what Im looking for and go higher or lower depending on what you have for sale.

Im not really looking for something that has to be shipped to me but something from someone semi local where i can meet up with at a local FFL and pick up.

Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles

I ordered from RockYourGlock and installed a LWD chrome pin kit (slide release, slide lock, trigger pin and locking block pin), a LWD chrome trigger housing pin, an anodized aluminum slide cover with the Glock emblem engraved, a chrome extractor (back ordered and should receive in a day or two), 2 Pearce finger extension mag floor plates and a Ghost Ultimate 3.5lb trigger connector. I also stippled the frame for an enhanced grip! I have over $750 invested in the gun as well as about 8 hours of time. I've built several custom Glocks and just really enjoy playing with them. After I finished the gun, I fired 11 rounds through it to ensure reliability and safety. It shoots excellent and carries well. I've carried it every day since I finished it. I also have a leather IWB holster that I purchased for it and will include it in the transaction with the gun. For more info or to make an offer, call or text REDACTED. Thanks for looking."

Height: 4.0""
Slide Width: .90""
Weight: Pistol 14 ounces, Magazine 1.9 ounces

Magazine: 1 - 6 rd flush floorplate

The CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel 9mm) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines. 

Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.

Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols"

Model: UBL-37 37mm UNDERBARREL LAUNCHER 




 Condition: FACTORY NEW 




 Additional Description: The UBL-37 is the long awaited B&D re-creation of the venerable M-203. It is single action with a cocking lever on the side. It boasts a positive trigger block safety. As with all B&D Launcher products, it chambered in 37/38 mm and made to the highest standards of American workmanship. Constructed of 6061 aircraft grade aluminum and 4140 hardened steel, it is rugged while maintaining a reasonable weight. This product has particular appeal to SWAT Launcher Specialists who might prefer to have a launcher as part of their primary armament. Please contact us for any specific needs. The UBL-37 attaches to any rifle or carbine fitted with a Picatinny Rail. You need to purchase (if you do not already own one) a Picatinny to Picatinny clamp of the correct length (see ours in the accessories section). Note that we will be providing mounting systems for other weapons on a regular basis. Please contact us for your specific needs. Based on the proven design of the Viet Nam era M-203 grenade launcher, the UBL-37 has advanced it to new levels. As always, state of the art materials are used throughout and the old plastic forward grip is now machined as part of the barrel itself. All parts are Hard Coated or Black Oxide treated. We think that you will agree that it is a perfect counterpoint to your AR platform weapon. 




 MANF: B&D Design 

• ITEM: The UBL-37 is equipped with a 12” barrel with a full length upper Picatinny Rail for attachment to your Picatinny Rail equipped weapon. The underside of the barrel has a 3” rail at the muzzle end for bipod or other accessories. Loading is accomplished by releasing the barrel and sliding it forward to it’s positive stop. Ammunition up to 8” long can be easily accommodated this includes Batons and other Less-Lethal Law Enforcement rounds."

Built it to shoot F-class competition, but never really got into it. That was a few years ago... Now I am trying to raise money to pay for a wedding.

About the rifle-

Barreled action was purchased from GA Precision. It is their brand (Templar), and is a very smooth cycling, precision Remington 700 clone (with upgrades like a bolt release on the side of the action). The gun has either a 20 or 22"" Bartlien 5R barrel, I can't recall the exact length at the moment (I'm pretty sure it is a 22"" though).The gun is chambered in .260 Remington.

Barrel and action were finished with matte black cerakote by GA Precision.

20 MOA scope rail is Templar brand as well; I purchased it with the action.

The stock is a Bell and Carlson Tactical Medalist with the adjustable cheek piece and shoulder plate. It has a full length aluminum bed block, the fore end was finished so the barrel would fully float. The action and 1/4"" recoil lug were fully bedded using Devcon steel putty (completely chemical resistant unlike glass bedding).

The trigger is a Jewell Varmint trigger (with safety). It is adjusted to a very light pull and breaks like glass.

The bottom metal is a Wyatt trigger guard with 5 round detachable magazine.

The scope rings are Leupold brand Mark 4 rings. The scope is also a Leupold Mark 4 with a duplex reticle and the target turret knobs. The scope also has a bubble level on it to ensure the gun is vertical during shooting.

The scope has an anti-glare device on it that works wonders for shooting in the sun. It is as effective as a 4+"" shade tube but is barely noticeable on the scope. It also has 2 butler creek scope caps that flip up.

Finally, the gun will also come with a Harris bipod and the necessary adapter. It is the 6-12"" version with spring retracted legs.

I have had this rifle appraised at East Coast Gun Shop in Summerville for $6500. 

It only has 400 rounds through it (all documented), and it shoots like a champ. At 200 yards (when I was shooting it all the time) I could easily hold a 1.25"" group. I've shot the gun out to 6-800 yards at the Palmetto Gun Club and was able to maintain under a 12"" group. A better shooter could almost certainly do better than that with it. I have the bullet drop information printed and stuck in the gun's case.

With the gun I am including a Plano Airglide case, a Tipton carbon fiber cleaning rod with nickel plated jag, nylon brushes of the correct size, an action end bore guide to ensure you don't scrape the chamber while cleaning, and 100 Lapua cases that are fire formed to this gun (this includes 12 loaded rounds). The cases were .308 Winchester cases that have been formed into .260. Everything on the cases was uniformed, necks were reamed, etc... A lot of time went into those cases. 

If you are interested, I have some high end reloading equipment (dies) available for this cartridge. This will be in addition to the price of this rifle. Please let me know if this interests you before we meet so I can pick them up.

Asking $3750 Obo for the gun. Make me an offer, I need a quick sale."

My interest has changed and I'm selling/trading my collection of collector quality SKS's.
These are from my personal collection are are not the typical beat up junk you've seen on the market.  See the list and descriptions below:

*1970 Albanian SKS - This is one of the most rare SKS rifles, there are estimated to be only 7k - 8k of these known to exist in the entire world.  Most Albanians you will find are in bad, beat up condition and look like they were attacked by a sledge hammer.  This one for sale is in very nice condition and not typical of what you will normally find.  It is a beautiful condition and most likely one of the nicest if not the nicest one you will ever see.  This is an extremely collectable fiream in great condition and all matching numbers.  A great investment and asking only $600.00

*Norinco -  Ya ya, I know, Norinco's are the most availble SKS in the world.  But, this particular SKS has the factory installed bakelite handguard, this is very rare.  This rifle is in aboslutley as new condition as it can be, it appears to be in un-fired condition.  It is just about as perfect as you will find.  It is all matching numbers and comes complete with cleaning rod and bayonet.  It's so beautiful I fell in love with it when I saw it and just had to have it and you will to!  Asking only $450

* 1951 Russiian Tula - Beautiful dark wood, very good condition, all numbers match except magazine, has bayonet and cleaning rod.  A very nice example of a high quality Russian SKS.  Asking only $550

* 1952 Russian Tula - Another great example of premier Russian workmanship.  This is a very nice SKS with all numbers matching and super clean, comes complete with bayonet and cleaning rod.  This is a beautiful gun.  Asking only $600

* 1954 Russian Tula - OH MY, this is extremely rare as it has no refurb markings!  Nearly all Russian SKS's have been factory refurbished and marked as such prior to being imported to the U.S. for resale.  It is extremely rare to find one in this beautiful, near perfect condition that hasn't been refurbished.  Not only has it not been refurbished it has dark solid wood.  Many of the later SKS's came with the ugly laminated or plywood looking stocks.  This is an excellent collector grade SKS with all matching numbers except the mag doe's not have any numbers on it.   Comes complete with cleaning rod and bayonet.   Asking ONLY $550 !!!

* 1958 Romanian - Considered to be of equal quality to the Russians and second to none.  Much like the Albanian, these are very few and far between and most are very beat up.  Not this one,  I guarantee this Romanian is one of the nicest you will ever see, if not the nicest.  There is nothing wrong with this rifle and there is everything right about it.  It is extremely rare especially in this nearly perfect condition.  This could possibly be the best SKS investment you could make or a very close 2nd to the Albanian.  All matching numbers with cleaning rod and bayonet.  This is my personal favorite and hate to sell.  ONLY $600

I will make 7.62x39 ammo available to anyone who buy's any of these rifles.  I have sealed cases of Yugo brass ammo and will sell to you at .50cents per round as much as you want.

I prefer cash but will entertain offers but I'm very very select on what I'm willing to trade for.  But go ahead and tell me what you have, all I can say is no.

I am looking and interested in the following:
*CASH !!!
* Ruger Mini 30 in the tactical version 
* Ruger 1911 cmd
* Ruger PC9
* Kimber & Colt handguns
* U.S. silver coins and silver eagles.
* Did I say cash already ?
* What do you have ???

You will need to provide a copy of your DL and PTC/PTP and sign a Bill of Sale for my records, no exceptions.

I can ship out of state to an FFL of your choice, make sure the rifle is legal in your state, you pay actual shipping and pay with a Postal Money Order.

I will provide photo's to you on any of the rifles you want but please ask only if your serious about them.

Feel free to ask questions and submit offers/trades.  I will reply as soon as I can unless I feel they are not serious inquires.

I'm located in the Clearwater area, you must be willing to meet at my location or very close.
