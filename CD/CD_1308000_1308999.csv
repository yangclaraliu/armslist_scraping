STRONG STEEL BODY: 12 GAUGE STEEL
Strong 12 gauge steel makes the Sporter safe heavier and tougher to move, is more time consuming to cut or drill through and flexes less when heated for better protection in a fire.

1-INCH FORMED DOOR:
The 1-inch formed door is engineered with a rugged steel face, back, and reinforcement panels to provide excellent strength and attack protection compared to the competition.

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM:
The Force Deflector Locking System (patent pending) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

LOCKING BOLTS: 1-INCH CHROME
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. Bigger bolts, and more of them, provide greater security.

 REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES:
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degree for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX HALF PANEL:
The DPX Half Panel combines fast access long gun storage on the back of the door with pockets and pouches for your small valuables and gear.

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use .5-inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by .5-inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING: 1200F/45 MIN. FIRE PROTECTION
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

The S&G Electronic Lock is an advanced security system manufactured by the leader in the lock industry. Includes many technical security features. Standard on NRA.

The well designed layout of the interior of the safes allows users to easily organize firearms and other items that need safe keeping. The top half of the safe door features the DPX storage system that boasts a variety of pockets and pouches for more storage. The DPX Storage System features a gun rack on the safe door for more storage and easier access to your most used firearms.

STRONG STEEL BODY: 12 GAUGE STEEL
Strong 12 gauge steel makes the Sporter safe heavier and tougher to move, is more time consuming to cut or drill through and flexes less when heated for better protection in a fire.

1-INCH FORMED DOOR:
The 1-inch formed door is engineered with a rugged steel face, back, and reinforcement panels to provide excellent strength and attack protection compared to the competition.

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM:
The Force Deflector Locking System (patent pending) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

LOCKING BOLTS: 1-INCH CHROME
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. Bigger bolts, and more of them, provide greater security.

 REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES:
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degree for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX HALF PANEL:
The DPX Half Panel combines fast access long gun storage on the back of the door with pockets and pouches for your small valuables and gear.

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use .5-inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by .5-inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING: 1200F/45 MIN. FIRE PROTECTION
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

S&G MECHANICAL DIAL LOCK STANDARD

S&G ELECTRONIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*
The S&G Electronic Lock is an advanced security system manufactured by the leader in the lock industry. Includes many technical security features. Standard on NRA.

High quality lower parts kit that includes a superior ALG QMS fire control group. The ALG Defense Quality Mil-Spec (QMS) Trigger is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the QMS is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however the majority of the associated grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the well known reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs. Kit includes everything needed to assemble your stripped AR-15 lower. Parts are 100% made in USA!"

The rifle was spray painted camoflage which makes it look pretty bad ass, even if it does take away from it's value a little. It was originally bought at the price of $100 used, so, I would like to get something of equal value for it if possible. It doesn't matter to me how old the shotgun is, as long as it still fires.

New York offers $500 reward for reporting illegal gun owners

Thursday, March 21, 2013 | AP | FoxNews.com
Nearly a year before signing the nation's most stringent gun control measure into law, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo launched a hotline that allows state residents to report illegal gun owners in exchange for a $500 reward.

The measure is part of a four-pronged approach established by the governor's office to reduce gun violence in urban communities, according to CBS6Albany.com.

New Yorkers can call the ""Gun Tip Line"" if they believe someone they know has an illegal gun. Hotline calls are answered by state police and tips are referred to local law enforcement, the station reported.

“This initiative seeks to turn neighbor against neighbor and use their own tax dollars to pay for the $500 reward,” Republican Assemblyman Steve McLaughlin told the station."

The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
FACTS:
You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
The permit is valid for 5 years
We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

This is the 22lr version of the weapon the Navy Seals used to take out Osama Bin Laden.

The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense. Flash hider, adjustable stock, etc.

Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. (This is the 20 Rd version.)

The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open.

This rifle has the weight, feel and appearance of the AR 15 version, and you can shoot it all day long with inexpensive 22lr ammo!we will only ship to FFL. $30 shipping to lower 48 states - additional charge for HI and AK and/or insurance. Certified bank or postal check preferred - if paying with Paypal + 4%. Happy Bidding!!!"

FREEDOM MUNITIONS inspects all cartridge cases for defects. The Scharch Range Master machines are fully automated and cases are checked for any debris and pressure tested for any splits or cracks. Primers are removed, flash holes are cleared, and primer pockets are reamed to accept new primers.

FREEDOM MUNITIONS then washes cases in an acid wash specially designed to remove all remaining burnt powder from the flash hole and interior of the case which tumbling doesn't remove. Then cases are tumbled in a dryer for a factory look and finish.

FREEDOM MUNITIONS roll sizes all cases on our own designed machines to meet S.A.A.M.I.specification. This method is the industry standard for commercial sizing, insuring the case wall is sized down to the rim which insures new component performance.

FREEDOM MUNITIONS then loads these processed components on the same fiber optic-controlled Ammo Load machines as our premium new ammo. These are the same machines used by some of the largest manufacturers in the industry. These machines assure S.A.A.M.I. specifications for priming depth, pressure and overall cartridge length.

The Finer Points:
This is a premium build I did for myself just over a year ago. I personally spoke with the Legion Firearms, awesome people who build tac drivers in Texas, and got their input on this build. Everything part was selected to work in harmony with each other to produce a rifle that will do sub MOA at 100 and be reliable in whatever conditions it is exposed to.  

There have been exactly 273 rounds fired through this rifle and I can provide the data book for confirmation.  The only cosmetic blemishes to be found are some small scratches to the brass deflector that did not penetrate the Nickel boron undercoating. 

I assembled this rifle for my own personal use  and have since started working in a nearby state that is...  The point is I don't get to take this rifle out as much as I should, and something built to these standards deserves to be out on a range more often.

I believe my price is fair given the features of the rifle, but I am open to reasonable offers. 

Please no low ball offers, I know what I spent to build this rifle."

It is in 9mm, comes with original box and 2 genuine para mags.

Capacity is 18 rounds.

Has Para's proprietary LDA, Light double action. If your familiar with it, you know how baddass it is. If not, Para refined the 1911 action, so the 1st trigger pull in double action is virtually effortless. You will not find a finer trigger pull on the gun market.

Has high visibility fiber optic sights, beavertail safety, walnut grips, and satin finish.

I recently called Para about this pistol as I had my questions from people that KNOW them, and said something sounded wierd with this one. 
 Para told me, This is a PXT P18 ELITE, It was made as an elite before they actually engraved ""Elite"" in the side of the slide. This would account for all the ""extras"" that are on this gun. You can see the factory walnut grips for the Elite, as well as the same adjustable sights and front fiber optics.
 Para was interested in getting this gun back, and offered a trade in. If I dont sell it for my asking price I will just go that route.

Take a look at what these go for HERE
http://www.gundealeronline.com/category-s/124.htm?searching=Y&sort=13&cat=124&minprice=1006&show=60

ONE issue, as it has a slight bit of holster wear as seen in the pic. If not for the wear, I would ask $100 more. The wear spot will not rust..its not that bad. I just have a mindset that every pistol I own, I want to be able to carry. I use a high end bianci holster that hits this pistol in a wierd spot, so she has to go.

I bought it just because I'm a para junky. I'm just not a fan of the 9mm. All my other paras are .45. This is as they say a ""tack driver"". Shoots straight as a laser. @ 200 rounds through it.

When you receive it, Im sure you will be 100% happy. This pistol is a marvel in hand, and pics do not do it justice.

If you are out of state, HERE IS HOW IT WILL GO DOWN. FFL to FFL ONLY. If you pay by check, paypal or deposit into my bank it MUST clear 100%. If it is a trade, You will send 1st, After I receive your item and inspect that it is roughly in the shape as described I will in good faith send the Para. I HAVE REFERENCES from other states to show I do this in good faith. I will draw up a contract, so that there is a good legal binding so that we ARE BOTH PROTECTED. will NOT ship to PO box. Purchaser will pay shipping (should be $10-$15)

I want to make sure EVERYONE IS SATISFIED. I try to cover all points so that we both feel good about the deal."

FREEDOM MUNITIONS roll sizes all cases on our own designed machines to meet S.A.A.M.I.specification. This method is the industry standard for commercial sizing, insuring the case wall is sized down to the rim which insures new component performance.

FREEDOM MUNITIONS then loads these processed components on the same fiber optic-controlled Ammo Load machines as our premium new ammo. These are the same machines used by some of the largest manufacturers in the industry. These machines assure S.A.A.M.I. specifications for priming depth, pressure and overall cartridge length.

If my add offends you in any way then like an adult tell me and i will change any part that offends you (unless you are a gouger then offending you makes me smile :) ) My intentions are not to offend anyone but to keep the offers to only guns that i will consider trading for! Im not trying to insult your guns and people with those guns who arnt selling or gouging people i hope understand that. Thanks to all that have emailed me to tell me i have a beutiful gun or if you just want info on it im happy to speak to other people who love 1911s like i do. That is not a waste of my time. I am not a prick but i admit i ramble and it may come off the wrong way. If it does and you tell me with respect then i am happy to change my add. Thanks a god bless! PS 400 rounds have been added to the count in last two weeks!
If you have a trade worth considering then i will send you all the pics you want. If you have the desire to waste my time then you can order your own.
Now what i have is a Concept V. This is not the ones you find stock option for 16-1700. This was a special ordered pistol directly from Les Baer with a nice wait for it to be built and much higher price tag. (i still have the receipt to prove and since i am friends with my ffl dealer my cost is 10$ over cost. So unless you have the same situation or are an FFL dealer it would most likely cost you over 100 more then what i paid. When i looked them up on Guns America for the regular version most were over 150 more then what i would get them for). If a deal is made i will gladly show the receipt upon the trade.
Ordered with Mainspring/magwell
Fiber optic front sight
Tactical mag release 
Trigger ordered  to be set to 4lbs exactly (not approximately) and more. Like i said serious trades will get answers and pics.
If you know anything about Les bear pistols then you know what craftsmanship and reliability these pistols are about. Over 4,000 rounds through this pistol (with only mitch Rosen Leather around it) and not one jam. The chamber is so tight you have to Gauge your rounds before you load em up. any reload that is swelled to much will not chamber. Normal concept V go for 16-1700. This was alot more then that. If you are freaked out by 4000 rounds down the pipe and you think this is to high of a round count then you would freak at my Springfield's with 20,000+ that aren't built half as good and still perfect rifling. Now i dont mean to sound rude but i do not want to explain every detail about what is what and why. Do your research, read reviews and do not offer me a DPMS or any AR-15. I dont care if they hold 30 round or more. I don't shoot to miss....always. I just dont want people wasting my time since i really doubt i will get rid of this pistol unless i get something i really want. Im sure many of you with quality guns have been through the same. 
Does have 10-8 Perf. grips and Nighthawk short trigger. I have the original trigger/grips and grip screws. (In pics the gun needs cleaned but you can see there is no dummy scratches) Thanks and God Bless."

This is the 22lr version of the weapon the Navy Seals used to take out Osama Bin Laden.

The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense. Flash hider, adjustable stock, etc.

Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. (This is the 20 Rd version.)

The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open.

This rifle has the weight, feel and appearance of the AR 15 version, and you can shoot it all day long with inexpensive 22lr ammo!we will only ship to FFL. $30 shipping to lower 48 states - additional charge for HI and AK and/or insurance.

I do not have the box as it got lost in a move.  This rifle is extremely accurate.  I have had my best luck with Berger 168 VLD and 45 grain Varget.  The trigger has been adjusted to 3 lbs I believe and the custom brake was installed by a local gunsmith.  Other than those adjustments everything else is out of box from factory.  I purchased this new in 2005 and have used as my primary hunting gun…it has been great.   I also have dies and a lot of reloading supplies if interested.  The Leupold base and rings are included.

 The book value the last time I checked was for a poor one around $171 to a perfect one around $900ish. Looking for around middle of the road for this one since it is in wonderful shape. So $550 cash or trade value, somewhat negotiable. I am in no way a coin expert, so if my prices are too high or if I am off then let me know. But, from what I have seen and found online(for what its worth) and gathered from talking to a friend who has a little coin shop this is the area he put the value at. So send me an offer and we can discuss it from there.

Multi-Purpose 20-Gauge Shotgun with 12-Inch LOP

The Maverick family of 88 pump-action shotguns takes a simple approach – a durable, multi-purpose shotgun that is equally at home in the woods, on the upland plains or for home defense. Now this no-frills pump-action is available in a shorter 12-inch length-of-pull (LOP) platform combined with a well-balanced 22-inch barrel length: introducing the Maverick 88 Youth 20-Gauge pump-action shotgun.

Maverick 88 pump-action shotguns are designed for reliable, smooth operation with the combination of dual extractors; twin-action bars; positive steel-to-steel lock-up; anti-jam elevator; interchangeable ACCU-CHOKE choke tube systems; and cross-bolt safety, located at the front of the trigger guard. At the core of its no-frills and low-maintenance design is the ability to field-strip the Maverick 88 with the simple removal of one pin. These durable shotguns feature weather-resistant, black synthetic stocks and forends and blued metal finishes; and are available in All-Purpose (12 and 20-gauge), Security (12-gauge) and Slug (12-gauge) configurations. Adding to their versatility as a multi-purpose shotgun, the Maverick 88 is fully compatible and interchangeable with Mossberg 500 barrels and ACCU-CHOKE tubes within gauge.

Maverick 88 Youth 20-Gauge Pump-Action Shotgun – This multi-purpose 20 gauge (2 ¾ and 3-inch) scattergun is proportionally-built to fit younger or smaller stature-shooters with its shortened 12-inch LOP and easy-handling 22-inch vent rib barrel with simple front bead sight. The Youth version also features the interchangeable ACCU-CHOKE system and comes equipped with a Modified choke tube. MSRP: $289"

Ok, so for sale is a newer used Ruger LCP .380 caliber semi-auto pistol. Its black all around and has some minor finish wear near the rear sight from holster wear. Other than that its pretty much in great condition. Overall id rate it as 85-90% outta 100% condition. Its only about 2 years old if that. Gun has had less than 100 rounds through it and bore is in great shape. Gun comes with , hree magazines an inside the pants right-hand holster and a reversible pancake nylon thumb break holster too. Comes with original box, storage bag and manual. Additionally i can throw in three boxes of hollow-point ammo if decent offer is made. These guns are perfect for concealed carry as they have a low profile and are lightweight. More pics available upon request, i tried to describe best as possible but feel free to contact me with any questions. 


Price is 300.00 for bundle or obo.

Up for sale is a used Interams 1911 A1 model in .45 acp silver cup edition. Its a clone of the military version of the Colt 1911 Gold Cup model made in the 1980's by Interarms Corp. Weapon is complete and fully functional. It shoots perfectly without any hiccups and has flawless action. The only downside is that the blueing is coming off from wear and scratches and there is some minor pitting near rear of the slide but its mainly surface issues. nothing that cant be sanded or polished off. Gun currently has pachmayr grips on it nut original GI style grips are included too. Weapon comes with 1 magazine and the original box. Box is worn and torn but cool to have. This is a routine shooter but bore is still in good shape. Item would be a great resto project or base for a upgrade build. Any questions feel free to ask, i tried my best to describe it all the way. More pics available upon request.
