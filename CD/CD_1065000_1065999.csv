Along with this bill is an attempt to do away with all personal sales between private parties. It is now certain to be passed with a Democrat-controlled state congress. These magazines will quadruple in value as they did during the Clinton-era assault weapons ban, and Coloradans will no longer be able to purchase them after it goes into effect, much the same as in New York or California.  If you purchase prior to the ban you are good to go, you just cant buy any more high cap mags.

AN ABSOLUTE DREAM TO SHOOT!  Here we have a very nice CUSTOM Saiga 308 AR. This will shoot both the 308 WIN and the NATO 7.62 x 51 military surplus ammo.  Comes with 4 x 10 round mags, 4 x 25 round mags, a bipod, a sight adjustment tool and scope mount with scope, adjustable high shock absorbing stock, and upgraded hand rail with 3 picatinnys!

Trigger & grip conversion professionally done.  Deadly accurate 22"" barrel, 98% condition LIKE NEW. The front sight has been upgraded with AK style sight and end of barrel was threaded to 1/2 28 thread and rediculous muzzle break!!! New stock and front grip with 3 rails for bipod, flashlight, laser etc.  The scope also has a quick release for close range.  Also have owners manual.  This thing is BADASS!!!

So you can go show off at the range and since ammo everywhere is limited, I will also include 150 Rounds of 308 ammo, however, the ammo must be picked up in person in CO - it costs too much to ship it. Guaranteed to turn some heads at the range as it is BIG and LOUD with NO KICK! - SUPER ACCURATE LONG RANGE WITH TONS OF KNOCKDOWN POWER - this is a 308 and not some 223 AR or AK47.  I also have tons of 308 Win brass and bullets available.  I will sell up to 500 rounds if you are interested.  Thanks for looking!"

What I know about the gun. Charles Daly 1911 5"", does have a Rock Island slide on it. I know all the internals have been reworked. The trigger pull is the lightest I have ever owned. I have 2 other 1911's with a 4lb, and one with a 6lb pull, and this one I would say is 2 or less pounds. It has the factory black grips, and I will include one Novak 8 round mag, and for the right price ammo. I have practice rounds, and hollow points. I did get bored one night and polished a few things, trigger and hammer sides are light polish. Safety, slide release, barrel, barrel bushing, feed ramp, and recoil plug are a mirror chrome polish. It is in really good condition, the slide has a small scratch from maybe holster wear. There is a spot there the Ambi safety used to be that is rubbed, and the normal scratch at the slide release. This gun shoots phenomenal, I have put several 100 through it with no issues of any type.

3-speed manual w/ floor shifter (3 speed + granny low), rebuilt 186 HP 292 Y-block 8-cylinder engine, 4-barrel carb, does not smoke/leak. I've done 85-90mph on I25 and I70 before I knew it. Speedo cable needs replaced or repaired as she reads 22-25mph below the speed you're going.

Electrical system is solid and all lights work (after-market fogs, all turn signals, all headlights). Interior cabin light needs replacement/installation. Wipers work, all emblems intact, and the front light frames as well as the dash are powder-coated white. Original headliner is in good condition too.

Front and back glass plus seals are excellent, side windows/vents are cracked but repaired with epoxy and are fully functional - I have been quoted $21/square foot for custom-cut automotive glass to repair all four (plus labor) - estimate is $130-$160 for full replacement and installation of new safety glass.

Original steering wheel with horn that works, all gauges intact and functional (other than noted speedo issue). No radio, though the wiring is there, and the heater blows strong and hot.

Bed is solid with nothing except some very slight surface rust in a couple of tiny spots, wheel wells are generally good, with just a tiny bit of rust-through at the back side of the front wheel wells. 15"" alloys with good tires (approx 50% tread remaining) roll straight and true, and the suspension is solid as well.

Just replaced the master cylinder and the master brake cylinder (because I wasn't happy with the braking) and the four drum brakes are solid. Seat could be worked on and potentially replaced with something a little more comfortable.

I have the original tailgate for the truck, though it is detached and in only okay condition...the back ""Ford"" panel can be cut and remounted in a new frame if you wanted to have it done, saving you the money for buying a replacement.

I've got two leather Audi A4 adjustable heated seats to replace the current seats...the heaters work and are a single-point connector that can be wired into the current 12V wiring harness. Included with the truck, as well as the original seats so you can take your pick.

I've driven her as far as Pueblo, Fort Collins and Greeley and back to Denver on the highway, side roads and dirt roads with no issues...you could too.

Why am I selling her? Got my eye on a '53 Chevy pickup and I just can't get away from those big flared fenders!

I purchased this pistol new 20 years ago, in 1993. It has NEVER malfunctioned and has been totally reliable with a large variety of full metal jacket and hollow point ammunition. The Interarms version of the Walther PPK is highly desirable compared to the current S&W version (which I've owned as well and had nothing but problems with). These Interarms versions are going for a premium on Gunbroker right now, but I'd prefer a local sale if possible. I have quality holsters and ammo to sweeten the deal as well (and you know how hard it is to find ammo right now). With my entire package, you'll be completely set up and ready to go. The pistol is freshly cleaned, lubed, and ready for use. I have additional, more highly detailed photos of the pistol that I can email to you if needed. Here is everything I'm offering:

- Walther/Interarms PPK .380acp in original box with paperwork and factory test target
- (4) factory magazines with flat base installed
- (4) finger rest conversions for the magazines
- (1) set of extra factory grips
- A-Zoom snap caps for dry fire practice
- Alessi Talon IWB holster (in my opinion, one of the best IWB available, $85 new)
- Galco Ankle Glove ankle holster (very comfortable and concealable)

1: - has scratches and fading on the bluing, no rust.
(I'll take an older fading Wingmaster over a new Express any day, ask around why, I've left the bluing as it is rather than strip the blue and redo it since factory bluing is irreplaceable in quality and durability, whether you DIY or professional)

2: - current extractor spring is broken, brownells has a replacement for $5.
(If I fix it myself I undoubtedly will end up keeping it, to completely restore this gun, Wingmaster - Magnums are less common)

Their barrels are second to none.  For proof just google ""BCM Filthy 14"" and ready the article.  All you'll need to do is install your own BCG and you'll be ready to go with a rifle that will shoot circles around all these PSA complete rifles flooding the market.

The Luger has the earlier style of receiver that did not have a stock lug on the backstrap. The pistol has Imperial proofs on the left side of the receiver. Serial numbers on the pistol are matching, the mag is a correct wood-based WWI Un-Numberd magazine there are two magazines. The pistol’s original finish exhibits normal wear for a luger that is 101 years old, and holster wear on the tip of the barrel and the sideplate, overall finish condition is about 70%. The original wooden checkered grips are fairly worn, and are serial numberd to the gun. The bore is great not worn, good rifling remains. There are NO importers markings anywhere on the pistol. This is an honest early military Luger that has not been messed with. The Leather holster is dated 1936 and was made in Berlin, all stiching is tight and no cracks for something that has lasted 77 years. The holster has a name stamped inside the flap it reads P. A. BECKE. The luger tool has a stamped eagle with 63 under it. This will be a nice addition to your luger collection."

I no longer need this rifle and it has just been collecting dust tucked away in my closet over the last year.

Clean bore with no apparent pitting. This is a very accurate and well made rifle that packs a punch and has a ton of history to it. This rifle went through WWII and is in amazing condition considering.

-1894 Izshevsk Hex Reciever w/ matching bolt 5440 (1894 receiver qualifies this rifle as an antique according to the Gun Control Act of 1968 which means no FFL is required to purchase this firearm.)

SIG SAUER® P250 Wins Two NRA Golden Bullseye Awards 

SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association’s coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year. 

This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250® is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose. 

The new SIG SAUER® P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned SIG SAUER quality – the performance, the accuracy and the reliability – into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. Choose the caliber: 9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W, or .45ACP. Choose compact, subcompact or full size polymer grip module. Select 
one of three grip sizes and two trigger lengths. Now it’s a fully customized P250. But then you can change 
everything to meet new requirements. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality SIG SAUER pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a new SIG SAUER pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance."

There's something I would like to put the money towards, but if it doesn't move, I won't be heartbroken.  To everyone I have spoken to or been offered trades by, I am still not interested in any of them.  

Savage 10 Precision Carbine in .223 with a 20"" medium bull barrel, accu-stock & trigger, recessed target crown & a Vortex Viper PST 6-24 scope.  Has Ken Farrel base & rings, a Harris bi-pod with an A.R.M.S. QD cam mount, forward pic rail (for bi-pod) & sling.  Scope has a mil-range reticle that is night vision capable & illuminated.  A very quality piece of equipment that's almost $1k new.  It is equipped with Sharp Shooter Supply bottom metal & 3 high-cap (11 rounds, but better than 4) magazines.  Magazines are available through Wyatt's for $68 & are very well made & heavy duty.  The bottom metal is a drop in replacement & no longer made.  This was a very costly mod. & took over 8 months to get.  Also included is a single shot ""sled"" that works instead of a magazine for range or BR shooting.  This replaces the factory bottom metal, but it is also included if you want to make it a 5 shot rifle again. 

This is a ""one-hole"" rifle & capable of sub 1/2 minute patterns.  I have shot several 5 round groups that is 1 ragged hole @ 100 yards.  Great gopher, or varmint rifle or just fun to shoot.  Also included is around 100 rounds of ammunition.  Some heavy match (mostly 68gr. HP).  $1695 cash.    Do the research before sending hate mail, please.  These rifles are hard to find & very costly.  It's getting too expensive to shoot even .223.  Call or text 417-425-5587  Thanks for looking.

I would be interested in a pre-1964 Winchester .243, a Winchester pre-war 1894 in 30-30 or similar as a partial trade.  I also like Savage 99s in 30-30, 250-3000, or 300 Savage.  A Ruger 10/22 Team U.S.A. TD would also interest me.  I like Colt revolvers, but don't expect an even trade unless it's a Python in the box.  Mainly I want cash.  No AR-15/10 trades wanted.  No tupperware guns.  No AKs, imported cold war guns.  No boats, cars, lawn care, etc.  If your gun is selling for $500 on Gunbroker, don't offer it as an even trade, you are wasting your time."

(5.56MM) that will come in it's factory box. The firearm still has the factory wick in the barrel and the muzzle cap on the flash hider. The firearm serial number matches the serial number on the Green Label. The firearm comes with it's plastic wrap bag from the factory, owners manual etc., one mag, sling, and a cleaning kit. I put the product registration card, the Colt NRA card and the cleaning kit in with this set, in which the cleaning kit contains the 4 section cleaning rod, patch attachment, and two cleaning brushes. The firearm features the collapsible stock and does not have the sear block. This firearm has not been fired since it left it's manufacture (factory test fired), but I have to list it as used where it was transferred to a high end collector that did not fire this weapon. This is one of the most desirable rifles for collectors being a Green Label, unfired, with the factory barrel wick and matching factory box, plus a most welcomed firearm for the shooter too. The box as seen in the pictures shows some wear and has been taped to secure the edges, torn corners etc, but remains the original for this rifle. This firearm belonged to a high end collector that kept the firearm in a safe in which when he took it out to pack it up for the move here, the firearm was bumped against the safe door in which luckily the only thing that was hit on the firearm was one of the handguards.I have taken several pictures all over the firearm so that you can see it and know what to expect as it is a highly desirable unfired Green Label firearm with the factory box, no sear block, along with the barrel wick still in place and a clean very well kept firearm. Must be shipped to a ffl, purchaser to pay the actual shipping cost to be determined by your ffl's address. any questions just e-mail me and Thanks"

GET YOURS WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!! The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest.

Features
• Compatible with all weapons that accept standard STANAG 4179 compliant magazines
• Reliable functioning due to mechanical simplicity and high-quality non-binding coil springs—no lubricants required
• Long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance 
•Easily seated in weapon with bolt forward
