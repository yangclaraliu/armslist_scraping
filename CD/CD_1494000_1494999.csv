The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

Offered with the Garand is a 1942 production Utica Cutlery chromed bayonet, a Korean  War issued ""winter trigger"" with it's original packaging dated March 1953, a mount for a grenade launcher sight, an oiler that was originally issued for the 1903 Springfield with a  USGI 3 piece cleaning rod I have stored inside the butt-stock compartments, an original dis-assembly tool, about 20(?) enbloc clips and 270 rounds of Korean .30-'06 along with ~400 (maybe more) of once fired .30-'06 brass. I MIGHT even throw in a good condition 50s era M1 helmet with complete leather liner and web chinstrap.

All of this is offered as a package deal with the M1 Garand. I can supply an extensive amount of photos of any item upon request. I will NOT entertain any offers for any single piece listed."

I'm slowing down on one expensive guitar hobby and starting another in things that boom. I'm in the market for firearms, rifles, handguns, or shotguns.  And in addition to the tons of high end guitars I have, I also have a nice kayak and two luxury American Heritage pool tables. Check out the list below of all my stuff, please email me for pics or info of anything you might be interested in trading for.
GUITARS:

Acoustics:
1. 1972 Martin D12-28....SOLD

2. 2011 Bedell OH-12G with deluxe hardshell case (has built-in humidity gauge in case). This is nearly a parlor size guitar, HUGE sound, top/sides/back all made from solid African Sapele. Brand New condition. $899

3. Takamine EG523SC (Acoustic/Electric) Features:
Solid spruce top
Flamed maple back and sides
Jumbo body style
Abalone rosette
Active electronics with onboard EQ
Guitar cosmetically is in awesome shape but the only issue with this axe is some faulty electronics. You hear feedback from the guitar when plugged into an amp sometimes, then other times its silent. I had it professionally inspected and the guitar tech said he believes its the plastic strip transducer of the pickup that sits underneath the saddle in the bridge, which would be a cheap fix but I play Martin so this guitar has sat for at least 2 years in a spare case, which will not be included. As for playability, its great, straight neck and perfect action, paint is pristine. I will clean and restring with your choice of gauge strings before sale... $350

4. Washburn J28SCEDL (Acoustic/Electric) with original hardshell case. Solid spruce top, solid quilted maple back and sides, maple neck with truss rod, rosewood headstock, premium gold Grover 18:1gear ratio tuners with custom brass bridge pins, and plenty of abalone pearl to catch anyone's eye. It also includes the B-band tape mic and preamp. This axe is immaculate and the price is generously reduced to sell. So yes, the neck is straight, the action as well, no scratches dings or dents. Immaculate means immaculate. Includes original deluxe hardshell case... $475

5. Recording King RD-227 (Acoustic/Electric) with Fishman pickup and hardshell case. Closest thing to a Martin D-42 D42 or D-45 D45 for the money. This dread sounds amazing, no lies. Would love to keep this one. Brand New. $700

6. Recording King ROS-16. This model is much similar to Martin's 000-28vs, a 12 fret version (giving a larger louder tone due to the extra two frets of body). The ROS-16 is a solid top 12-Fret OOO-style guitar crafted from a vintage 1902 design. With a solid AA-grade Sitka spruce top and mahogany back and sides, this guitar has the warm intimate sound you would expect from a classic 12-Fret. The 1-13/16"" nut with is a fingerpicker's dream, and professional appointments like the one-piece neck, rosewood fretboard, ebony pyramid bridge, bone nut and saddle insure the guitar sounds as great as it looks. Herringbone purfling and grained ivoroid binding give a nod to this guitar's historic heritage.
This guitar is used only several times, cosmetically in awesome shape with only one small finish crack in the top lacquer (professional inspected and cleared without needing repair). No case included...$250

7. VINTAGE & RARE 1940-1950s KAY jazz archtop, natural blonde in color. As for condition, no repairs have been made to this yet, playable but will need a neck reset if you plan to play this axe for the next 20 years. It is playable in the current condition but action is a bit high, would be great for a slide guitar too! No dents or nicks, paint is actually in awesome shape. Original pickguard is missing. Bought this guitar approx 9 years ago in hopes to repair this to its original condition but have yet to make the time. No case included. Guitar in ALL original condition...$349

8. Epiphone Emperor II Joe Pass jazz hollowbody archtop electric guitar with original deluxe hardshell case. Sunburst finish. NEW condition, perfect shape, no flaws or issues. 
SPECIFICATIONS
Body: Solid maple

$575

Electrics:
1. Schecter C-1 Classic (Red) case included. Features included Seymour Duncan JB/Jazz combo, 25.5"" scale and the infamous 'Vine of Life"" full neck inlay pattern.
No dings, dents, scratches of flaws. The paint is pristine, the neck is straight with perfect action. The covers for the electronics on the back of the body still have the plastic wrap intact, testament to the meticulous case this guitar has received and limited play since it was made, never gigged or abused. No case included... $450

Pedals: 
1. Boss DS-1 distortion, like new
2. Danelectro Pepperoni Phaser, like new
3. Ibanez CF-7 Chorus/Flanger, like new
4. Ibanez TS-7 Tubescreamer, like new

KAYAK
Liquid Logic ""Sessions"" Whitewater kayak, yellow and slightly used only one year, last two years it has sat in my house. Since everyone asks for the size, its about 7'3"" or 87 inches in length roughly. If buying with cash only, I will throw in the high quality Big Spoons Whitewater 150 paddle ($195 value) and hemet, as well as Bomber Gear K Bomb outer skirt ($175 value)...$600

POOL TABLES
I have two luxury American Heritage pool tables, already disassembled ready to move. I do have pictures of the parts. I have sets of balls, tons of sticks, and a shelving unit to store the balls and sticks and chalk. One table is in better condition than the other. I would ask $750 for the one, and $1250 for the other..

6. Recording King ROS-16. This model is much similar to Martin's 000-28vs, a 12 fret version (giving a larger louder tone due to the extra two frets of body). The ROS-16 is a solid top 12-Fret OOO-style guitar crafted from a vintage 1902 design. With a solid AA-grade Sitka spruce top and mahogany back and sides, this guitar has the warm intimate sound you would expect from a classic 12-Fret. The 1-13/16"" nut with is a fingerpicker's dream, and professional appointments like the one-piece neck, rosewood fretboard, ebony pyramid bridge, bone nut and saddle insure the guitar sounds as great as it looks. Herringbone purfling and grained ivoroid binding give a nod to this guitar's historic heritage.
This guitar is used only several times, cosmetically in awesome shape with only one small finish crack in the top lacquer (professional inspected and cleared without needing repair). No case included...$250

7. VINTAGE & RARE 1940-1950s KAY jazz archtop, natural blonde in color. As for condition, no repairs have been made to this yet, playable but will need a neck reset if you plan to play this axe for the next 20 years. It is playable in the current condition but action is a bit high, would be great for a slide guitar too! No dents or nicks, paint is actually in awesome shape. Original pickguard is missing. Bought this guitar approx 9 years ago in hopes to repair this to its original condition but have yet to make the time. No case included. Guitar in ALL original condition...$349

Guitar cosmetically is in awesome shape but the only issue with this axe is some faulty electronics. You hear feedback from the guitar when plugged into an amp sometimes, then other times its silent. I had it professionally inspected and the guitar tech said he believes its the plastic strip transducer of the pickup that sits underneath the saddle in the bridge, which would be a cheap fix but I play Martin so this guitar has sat for at least 2 years in a spare case, which will not be included. As for playability, its great, straight neck and perfect action, paint is pristine. I will clean and restring with your choice of gauge strings before sale... $350

No dings, dents, scratches of flaws. The paint is pristine, the neck is straight with perfect action. The covers for the electronics on the back of the body still have the plastic wrap intact, testament to the meticulous case this guitar has received and limited play since it was made, never gigged or abused. No case included... $450

KAYAK
Liquid Logic ""Sessions"" Whitewater kayak, yellow and slightly used only one year, last two years it has sat in my house. Since everyone asks for the size, its about 7'3"" or 87 inches in length roughly. If buying with cash only, I will throw in the high quality Big Spoons Whitewater 150 paddle ($195 value) and hemet, as well as Bomber Gear K Bomb outer skirt ($175 value)...$600

POOL TABLES
I have two luxury American Heritage pool tables, already disassembled ready to move. I do have pictures of the parts. I have sets of balls, tons of sticks, and a shelving unit to store the balls and sticks and chalk. One table is in better condition than the other. I would ask $750 for the one, and $1250 for the other..

Because the slide is so short there was no room for the bushing to go when the slide went back. Therefore a larger bushing was made that slips over the barrel lugs during recoil, and the barrel diameter was belled to match. Another reason is with the shorter slide and barrel, the barrel angle would be too steep for the slide to function properly during recoil. A straight barrel would wedge the slide back during recoil. The shape of the bell keeps the barrel angled properly for slide function, and then realigns the barrel to the slide as the slide closes; there is a considerable amount of torque in a barrel and this is more evident in a short barrel. This barrel is beautifully bright."

I put 14 shots thru it to zero the scope, cleaned it, then put it in my climatically controlled vault where it has sat untouched since. This is the Varmint version of the XT-22 with the heavy bull barrel and beavertail forearm and you won't find it at any big box sporting store. I have the factory boxes, paperwork, and owners manual for both. I can meet in a public place for a cash FTF deal.
