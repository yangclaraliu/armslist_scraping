The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.
The best home security shotgun I have ever owned.  I have never seen one at any gun show or store in knoxville. I put a pic of mine with surefire fore grip, mag pul front and rear sight, and a laserlyte kryptonite center mass laser..   $3200.00"

No BCG or charging handle. Upper is brand new and has never been mated to a lower. If you want higher resolution pics, just let me know. No trades. $675 firm.

For those not familiar with the different barrel profiles, the lightweight barrel reduces a bit of muzzle-end weight (where you want to reduce weight - i.e., the part of the rifle farthest from your body) relative to the government profile barrel. From the chamber to the FSB, the barrel is identical to the government profile barrel. All the weight savings is at the muzzle end.

The streaks and unevenness you see is just the preservative oil that is slathered on at the factory.

Winchester® Model 70™ Extreme Weather Rifle
Regular Price: $1,069.99 - $1,089.99
Hunt in any weather with confidence, knowing this rifle delivers extreme accuracy in extreme conditions. The Bell and Carlson™ composite stock delivers trim and lightweight ergonomics without compromising a solid feel. It’s textured charcoal-gray matte finish improves grip in adverse conditions. A sculpted cheekpiece ensures eye-to-scope alignment from any shooting position. Felt recoil is of no concern, thanks to the Pachmayr® Decelerator® recoil pad. A claw extractor offers controlled-round feeding so the cartridge may be easily withdrawn from the chamber at any point after it leaves the magazine. The cartridge feed lips are part of the receiver for improved reliability. The classic Three-Position Safety offers safe and fire positions, plus a middle position that locks the firing pin, yet still allows the bolt to be operated, offering a greater margin of safety when checking the chamber condition or unloading. A free-floating, fluted stainless steel barrel features a recessed target crown to protect the rifling. With quality optics, premium ammunition and good shooting conditions, 1-MOA accuracy can be expected. Two stainless steel sling swivel studs are installed"

I would offer a volume price to the person who wanted all 16 at once.  These retail at $25 for reference.

For those of you complaining about my shipping fee, please note that that yes these will fit into a USPS Small Flat Rate box - but do not leave room for any padding or packing materials which means they can become damaged in shipping (USPS does not handle parcels gently).

I bought it as a Certified Pre Owned thru Sig in December. Sold by Sig to an undisclosed Law Enforcement agency in 1999 but apparently never issued....it sat in their armory and was traded in to Sig last year, per the Sig armorers notes. Looked 100% brand new when I got it. Still immaculate.

Legendary Sig quality and reliability, nearly new condition. I've put 700-800 rounds thru it. I just can't switch back and forth between this and my Glocks, the triggers are too different.

Comes with case, 2 Sig 15 round mags, one Sig 20 round mag, a Galco leather holster, Blackhawk SERPA holster and Hogue grip.  I've also had Ameriglo 3 dot night sights installed to replace the lame factory sights.

I wanted to have a couple clips of this ammo for SHTF situations and the only way I could find it was in bulk so im breaking the case up and passing this stuff along.  I paid well over the price listed in the photo below and this is military duty grade barrier blind ammo, so please don't email me about how you used to buy independence ammo for .40 a round.  

The open-tipped rounds until now have been available only to Special Operations Command troops. The first 200,000 5.56mm Special Operations Science and Technology rounds are already downrange with Marine Expeditionary Brigade-Afghanistan, said Brig. Gen. Michael Brogan, commander of Marine Corps Systems Command. Commonly known as “SOST” rounds, they were legally cleared for Marine use by the Pentagon in late January, according to Navy Department documents obtained by Marine Corps Times.
SOCom developed the new rounds for use with the Special Operations Force Combat Assault Rifle, or SCAR, which needed a more accurate bullet because its short barrel, at 13.8 inches, is less than an inch shorter than the M4 carbine’s. Using an open-tip match round design common with some sniper ammunition, SOST rounds are designed to be “barrier blind,” meaning they stay on target better than existing M855 rounds after penetrating windshields, car doors and other objects.
The  Federal T556TNB1 is the commercial designation for the MK318 round. The 62 grain bullet was designed by Federal / ATK and features an open tip with lead at the front and a thick copper base. The lead is designed to defeat barriers and the copper to penetrate the barrier.

Most interested in the old (non-""C4"")  streamlights or any other single emitter light. There's not much I can do with the cheap multi-emitter and/or direct drive lights. 

I will pay a fair price (depending on what's broke) for any brand of LED flashlight. I buy them as a body to build custom lights off of, being as this is my hobby i do for fun I would consider upgrading/fixing yours for a small fee."

New Unique SA/DA Trigger System
The PT24/7 Pro Trigger system solves the double action/single action dilemma once and for all. Figure 1 shows the trigger at full rest. When a round is chambered, the trigger sets in single action mode with the trigger traveling freely to the crisp break point shown in figure 2. The trigger resets to DA mode until another round is chambered.
