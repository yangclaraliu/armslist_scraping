The gun looks new but minor flaws are always seen in pictures. I took as many pictures showing all angles so there are no questions or regrets. I grade this fine example conservatively at 97+ %. Most people would say its 98%-99%. This rifle has never been touched with a claw mount, carry handle, buffer or bipod. Buttstock has signs of glue at the buttpad where they may have used excess glue residue, then wiped off. The forearm has light spots that could be from ageing or being wiped with a cleaner. Like I said, I want to be brutally honest and call out everything I’ve noticed. Most wouldn’t notice these things I’m drawing your attention too. Reading this, you’d think the wife is making me sell this. The chamber and bore are pristine. Included with this rifle is, one 20rnd, one 40rnd mag and the HK 93 sling  Back in the day H&K was trying to get some imported in-They ran out of regular barrel and on a select few they put a machine gun shorter barrel and put a longer flash to pass regulations-This is one of those Rifles-They Stamoed it 42 then seril to denote the changes in barrel -. This rifle does not appear to have ever been fired, it's in mint condition. This fine example of a HK 93 in it's most desirable configuration is highly sought after due to it's incredible accuracy and build quality. It has the collapsable stock, bipod and claw scope mount-all original HK manufacture. This may be the most flawless HK 93 I have ever seen and I've seen a lot!! I can ship out of state to FFL."

I haven't fired it since it has been back from Sig because of the cold weather, so it's perfect from Sig.From the factory it comes with a Medium grip module, but I got a Small grip module installed now to fit my hand. Just to Clarify, the Sig currently has the Small Grip module install, but will come with the factory Medium grip module for $660. For the $685, it will come with BOTH the Small and factory Medium grip module. I will end up selling the Small grip module separately if the buyer only wants the factory Medium grip module.Oh, so Sig returned the P320 with the older style (Concave) cap for the Romeo1, and then sent me 2 more of the same one, but a new one (Convex) will be arriving soon to fit the Romeo1 better. So you will have 3 extra caps that fits over the Romeo1, but don't snaps in.The price is $660 with just one grip module (factory Medium), or $685 with both grip module. Buyer pays for the gun transfer and we can meet at Double Tap Firearms in Bend."

Imported as a pistol, it is a blowback-operated semi-auto in 9mm with a short 7¾” barrel. Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics. Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable. Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws.**** Sorry No Trades****Come in and check it out in store at Gun Commanders on Cleveland Highway or visit online at www.guncommanders.com"

724,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8018724,For Sale:  Digital Headspace Gauge,"Naples, South West Florida, Florida",$ 80,"Listed On: Monday, March 12, 2018",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Our patented Digital Headspace Gauge shows the exact clearance (at the shoulder) that YOUR handloads will have in YOUR particular chamber. Remember, a fired case is like a perfect casting of your chamber (except for break-open actions). Simply calibrate this gauge to your rifle by inserting one of your fired cases, and press the ""zero"" button. Then insert one of your handloads, and the gauge will display your chamber clearance. This is the most accurate way to adjust your die height - without guessing. It's very common to find handloads with the shoulder pushed back way too far. The shoulder of your handloads should be set back no more than -.002"" for a perfect fit. Reloaders that run their shellholder into the resizing die are often pushing the shoulder up to .016"" too far in some rifle chambers. Those shooters that just resize the neck also need to know ""how far"" to bump the shoulder for a reliable chamber fit. This gauge improves accuracy by making your handloads fit much better than factory ammo, and it also reduces case run-out. It provides longer case life by helping to reduce case stretching, and that eliminates the possibility of case head separation. This gauge can also measure bullet ""jump"" to the rifling. It doesn't require special tools or a collection of bushings to operate it, and the gauge provides uniform downward spring pressure to provide the most consistent readings. You can now determine the most accurate height setting for your resizing and seating dies to make perfect fitting handloads. This gauge also compares OAL and case length at the rate of about one case per second. Resizing dies are designed to make handloads fit inside the SMALLEST chamber of a particular caliber. To make things worse, rifle chambers are always made to accommodate the LARGEST factory ammo made anywhere. Machinists call this ""tolerance stacking"". This means that your handloads usually have quite a loose fit in your chamber. The next time you put the crosshairs on a long range target, you have to ask yourself ""If my handloads are small enough to fit any rifle in this caliber, and large enough to not get ripped apart when fired . . . . is that really close enough?""Brand new new needs battery died in storage"

The CZ 2075 RAMI is a sub-compact semi-automatic based on the proven CZ 75 line of pistols. Just like the 75, the RAMI is double action/single action, allowing it to be carried in different conditions depending on the shooter’s preferences. Several safety devices are used including a firing pin block and a manual safety. Incorporating the CZ double-stack magazine design, the little RAMI ships with a 10 round flush-mount magazine and 14 round extended magazine, and a low capacity-compliant version is available with two 10 round magazines. With a 3” barrel and an unloaded weight of less than 26 ounces, the black polycoat, alloy-framed RAMI is ideal for concealed carry.
