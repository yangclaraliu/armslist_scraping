This Check-out Code is not going to waste, it will be used either by somebody else or me, I'm just giving somebody else the chance to skip the huge line to buy a DD so that they don't need to wait 2 months like I did. Thanks*****

For Sale: Check-out Code to immediately build and purchase a custom DDM4 complete rife, or just a custom DDM4 complete upper. 

Why it's valuable: Daniel Defense Custom DDM4 cannot be purchased without a valid check-out code. You must sign up in order to be notified in the future with a check-out code. I signed up two months ago, so if you would rather build and buy one now without waiting that long, you can buy my check-out code and do it today.

Story: Two months ago I signed up for a check-out code needed to purchase a custom built DDM4 from the Daniel Defense website. Earlier today I finally received an email from DD with a check-out code informing me that I can now build my own DDM4. Unfortunately, two weeks ago I bought a Colt LE6920, so because I don't need a second ar at the moment, my plan was to custom build a DDM4 using the check-out code I have and just resell the rife at face value +$200 for the opportunity to have one now and not wait the two months like I did. If you would like to buy the check-out code from me and cut right to the chase, I am offering it for $200. Otherwise I'll have a Colt and a Daniel Defense sitting in my safe, which isn't a bad thing either. Thanks for looking."

Don't get scammed by these people wanting stupid money for .22 rounds.  Prices for .22 rounds should range from the low end of .05 cent each, to the high end competition rounds for .25 each.  You can buy 1000 rounds of CCI Mini Mag 40 grain 1260 ft per second copper jacketed for $80 with shipping to your door.  These fools wanting $85 for 525 rounds of low grade range ammo are insane.  I'm sure those gouging the public will flag this quickly, but if even one person who is thinking about buying reads this and saves their money, then it accomplished the goal.  Academy Sports has ammo come in 3 times a week, and here recently it's been lasting far longer than the 20 minutes it used to disappear in.  Even .223 has become easier to get.  Save your money!

Online vendors like PalmettoStateArmory.com get it a couple times as well.  Sign up for email stock alerts and you can get realistically priced .22 ammo."

This is a used 2001 rifle and rated between 95-98%.  Includes a BSA Classic 3-12x50.  Pictures are of actual firearm being sold. Pre-season pricing.

A very sophisticated bolt action.
With a short 60° lift, the bolt incorporates a non-rotating bolt sleeve that runs the full length of the bolt. When unlocked, three guide ribs on the bolt sleeve align with the three locking lugs to allow the bolt to slide smoothly. When locked, these three lugs provide massive bolt strength. The A-Bolt feeds very smoothly because of its unique, patented cartridge depressor that stays in position, independent of the bolt rotation, as the bolt slides gently over the cartridges in the magazine. The bolt face is recessed, completely surrounding the cartridge base. A cocking indicator located at the rear of the bolt offers visual and tactile firing pin status.

Barrel
The barrel is free floating and glass bedded at the recoil lug and front of receiver to maintain the proper spacing around the barrel for consistent accuracy. The recessed muzzle crown helps protect the rifling. Barrels are triple checked for interior finish, straightness and air-gauged for uniformity.

Trigger
A chrome-plated trigger sear provides cleaner, crisper trigger pull. Screw adjustable and pre-set at approximately 4 lbs.

Magazine
Hinged floorplate with detachable box magazine makes it simple and fast to load a spare magazine. Hold 3 rounds

The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today's shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable picatinny rail extends from the forearm for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and on bottom of the forearm for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left handed shooters. Length of pull can be adjusted with the addition or removal of 1/2"" spacers (one included). The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

This one looks to be in as new condition with it's original box with all the original paperwork. That is not a scratch above the cylinder release thumb piece. It is a factory arrow. These guns were made a very short time only due to the unpopularity of the caliber at the time. Now they are popular and hard to find. The 396 I'm told was made for only 9 months. Most people don't know that S&W made a .44 spl on the L frame and as the word gets out these guns will become even more sought after and more rare. The 396 NG .44 spl has a steel barrel and steel cylinder. I have a 396 that I shoot and can verify they are a fantastic weapon.

I am in need of around 10,000rds of .22lr. The more the better. I am an NRA certified instructor who does work with a few local Boy Scout groups on my range. I also instruct CCW courses and I always include ammo in the price. I feel the more people who have their CCW, and the more the younger generation learns to shoot, the better and safer we are ALL going to be. I am willing to pay about 6 cents a round. I know that your brick of 525 you're asking $60 for is hard to come by and there may be a few hoarders with more money than brains paying $50 for them, but through me this ammunition will actually be used and for a purpose. If you are in the Columbus or thorn vile area and have at least 500rds to sell me, I would be happy to pay you 6 cents a round for as much as you're willing to sell me. I do not get reimbursed for the ammo I give to the boys. If anyone out there has a heart bigger than their greed, give me a call or text. REDACTED thanks, Ken

On a side note, I just got a new XDS and didn't want to pay $23/a box for .45ACP. Anyone who wants to sell me some reasonably priced .45, I'd love to hear from you too. You can find .45 in just about any gun store right now for $23-26/ a box so if you can't beat that please don't call. Thank you."

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

Tips for sniffing out these lowlifes that want to make you travel. 

1. Don't travel to bring ammo - Best choice, sorry real buyers
2. If you still want to sell:
- Get contact information and call it back
- Only go if you have business in the area anyway
- If they don't haggle at all, it is a clear red flag
- Short messages
- When you find these lowlifes, pass the word on before they burn someone
- If they want to meet now, probably a scam

I kind of feel sorry for these guys as they have nothing better to do than try and screw people. Really sad. Go ahead and write me hate mail.

So Matt, or whatever your name is, someday you will receive a just reward for your unbecoming and disdainful behavior.

It is in perfect condition. I have found the compact model to be more accurate than the full size, but that's just my experience. It can nail the bullseye at 10 yards easily. I bought it January 4th from a dealer in Waukesha right when the ""ban"" craze started, so it took me a very long time to hunt one down. In fact, it was built/test fired only two weeks before I bought it. The barrel, take down lever, extractor, and slide catch have all been polished. It actually looks very good. I only have about 150 rounds through it. Since it's so new, it has the desired ""shield trigger"" that pre-12/2012 M&P compacts did not come with. It has the standard 3-dot Novak sights, picatinny rail, etc. Perfect concealed carry firearm.
Here's what you get:

The firearm
Two 12 round magazines- one flush base plate, one with the pinky extension
Three palm swells (back straps) 
S&W Case
Manual, test shell, NRA coupon, etc.

I paid somewhere in the $575 range, plus a $15 BG check, plus $35 in tax. Basically, I'm breaking even.

By purchasing you acknowledge and fully understand the statement below. (copied from http://www.calegalmags.com/Rebuild-Kit-Info_ep_42.html)

Rebuild Kit Info READ PRIOR TO PURCHASING

*IMPORTANT- Regarding Rebuild Kits*

A ""REBUILD KIT"" is a complete magazine that has been disassembled into parts.

It contains all the original parts of the magazine that have been taken apart before being shipped into California to comply with state and local laws. I do not remove any parts of the rebuild kit before i ship to buyers

Rebuild kits are not to be used to assemble a new high capacity magazine which would be in violation of local or state law. These rebuild kits are intended to rebuild a legally owned pre-ban magazine or for assembling a 10 round magazine pursuant to local or state law.

You can assemble your rebuild kit into a magazine when you are outside of CA or at a location at which you are legally allowed to possess a high capacity magazine. For example: You can take your rebuild kit from California to Arizona, assemble it, use it, and take it apart before you return to California. Many of buyers are competition shooters who reside in CA but travel the country shooting and require rebuild kits for competition. Others attend weapon training facilities in other states where they are legally allowed to assemble and use rebuild kits as magazines. Just be sure you take them apart completely before returning to California.

By purchasing a rebuild kit(s) the purchaser accepts sole responsibility to remain in accordance with local or state law and any failure to do so will be the purchasers responsibility. I accepts no liability whatsoever for misuse or negligence on the part of the purchaser.

It is the responsibility of the buyer to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, and federal laws in regard to the possession, use, and sale of any item purchased from me.

I do not sell hi-capacity magazines period."
