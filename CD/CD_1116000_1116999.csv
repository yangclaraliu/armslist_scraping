Action is sitting in a current Remington AAC Hogue overmolded stock with Harris bipod, though the original (and insanely heavy) walnut stock with old style Anschutz forend rail is available for you retro rifle hounds. Bolt was polished and jeweled, action blueprinted, and trigger work done, though in the old style of doing things this means there is no safety lever. God knows why they used to do that, or for that matter why some people still do that, but they do. Its easy enough to add the safety lever back on I guess, but far better to just put in a more modern aftermarket trigger group with proper external adjustments. Base and rings are installed, and an older style scope is included simply because its already there. Works well enough, but the scope really needs replacing with a proper FFP mil-dot scope with turrets to bring it up to modern standards of a tactical rifle.
 Both trigger and scope function as well as they ever did I guess, they put the all bullets in the same hole in the target just fine, they are just of rudimentary design by modern technical standards. Basically I am selling this as a rifle stock and a nicely tuned barreled action for someone to start a project, so no complaints that the scope and trigger are antique pieces of crap! 

  All in all, a good starter long range rifle as it sits, and a good accurate and consistent platform with all the important work already done to build up a very nice rifle from in the future by upgrading those two parts."

If anyone reading this happens to be or know its current owner or have a clue as to its whereabouts, please let me know as I would be willing and eager to pay a generous premium over whatever was paid for it for its return. I would also happily buy another Colt of equal or greater value of the owners choosing to trade.

The revolver once belonged to the father of a close friend of mine--it was his off-duty weapon in the 50s. He passed it down to my friend who passed it down to his own son...who pawned it and everything else not nailed down to feed his heroin addiction. My friend is kind of torn up over the whole deal. I'm hoping to ease his mind in at least some small way by recovering his heirloom.

Please note, the gun was NOT STOLEN. Its current owner, I'm sure, has every right to keep it. It was pawned as legitimately as possible as far as the law is concerned, and the pawn shop sold it just as legitimately. I would simply like to reaquire it the same way. It was sold at a pawnshop in Alabama. It's been several months now, so god knows where it could have gotten to in the mean time.

Thanks to anyone who takes the time to read this, and double thanks for anyone who considers this ad the next time they happen across a Cobra that matches this description."

I would have it shipped to your local gun dealer for a ffl transfer as I live in mn. Call, text or email 612-875-8558. Don't leave a message as I don't check them often. Next it will hit Gun Broker if Armslist fails. Thanks Tim"

3. Series 80 enhanced Combat Commander. Prefer stainless, but will consider blued version. Must have all enhancements (Flat top slide, angled cocking serrations, undercut trigger guard, duck bill grip safety, deluxe hammer, etc.). No lightweights.

This one has addons that u don't get new. It comes with 2additional30 round mags making 3total. I bought a front sight tool and extra front sights that are colored which allows u to shoot with a black backdrop. I also installed a recoil buffer to make the internals last even longer.

It has zero recoil, but pinpoint accuracy, deep penetration, and the flash and report of a much higher caliber weapon (.22 Magnum was designed as a rifle round).  It is also incredibly easy to load, unload, aim, fire, and clean.  Perfect home defense gun for a lady, elder, or inexperienced shooter.

This is a stainless steel revolver with 4"" barrel, rubber grips, and easy acquisition target sights.  It can be fired double-action with every squeeze of the trigger, or the hammer can be cocked back to fire single-action for precise long range shots.  This is a very accurate revolver and durable enough to last a lifetime.  This is a Rossi M515, based on the Smith & Wesson design and imported by Interarms.  It is a high quality firearm.  Round count is low, lockup is tight, and it is in excellent overall condition.  The only reason I’m considering parting with this is to fund another purchase.

I do not have a holster or box for this revolver, but I will throw in 2 boxes of top quality defensive ammunition (50 rounds of CCI V-MAX and 50 rounds of Hornday Critical Defense).  Unlike a .22 LR or .32 ACP, .22 Magnum fired from a 4"" barrel will actually stop someone, and is the best choice for a recoil sensitive shooter.  Unlike most other .22 Magnum revolvers, the spent casings extract easily without sticking, and the cylinder swings out at the touch of a button rather than dropping out in a complicated process as with the Single Six styled guns.

I am asking only $350 CASH for the Rossi and ammo, which is a very good deal.  Local transaction only.  I reserve the right to refuse to sell to anyone I don’t like, or to withdraw this item from sale if my pending deal falls through.  Only trades I’d be interested in would be a K38 or a pre-lock 442 . . . possibly even an older 85CH.   Thanks."

This is a 4th Generation Charter Arms “PUG” from the plant in Shelton, Connecticut, and is the best model they’ve ever designed.  The alloy frame keeps it light, the 2"" barrel keeps it pocketable, and the .44 Special cartridge packs the punch of a .45 ACP with far less recoil than a .357 Magnum.  Magnum recoil is very sharp and snappy, whereas the .44 Special is more like a firm push.  This is the best big bore caliber for short barrels or recoil sensitive shooters, and is a very accurate round.

The PUG has a stainless finish, practical sights, and a snag-free DAO hammer.  Lockup is very tight and revolver has a VERY low round count.  It is practically in like new condition.

This comes with the stock rubber finger-groove grips.  They are offering a new style of rubber grip now, Hogue also offers one, and older wood grips from the Bulldog and Undercover will also fit so there are plenty of options available if you want to swap it out.

I need to recount the ammo, but I’m guessing there’s nearly 200 rounds of Gold Dots and Silvertips.  I can also throw in a cheapo IWB holster to complete the package.

I’m asking $550 CASH for the revolver and ammo, which is a very good deal.  Not particularly interested in trades as I’m funding another purchase, but I might consider a K38 Masterpiece, a pre-lock 442, or possibly an older 85CH.

Trades will be considered but don't waste my time with junk, looking to expand my weapon collection or add an SUV or motorcycle to the driveway collection.  You can't find this ammo on the shelves and no private sellers are selling.

Anderson Manufacturing rifles offer design and build quality that exceeds that of other firearms manufacturers along with a proprietary metal treatment known as RF-85 (reduce friction 85%). The treatment offers significant benefits such as faster cycle rates and cooler operating temperatures. 

This results in significantly less wear on the weapon, thereby increasing its life. In addition, an RF-85 treated weapon does not need any lubricants. As such, the weapon experiences fewer failures due to excess dirt and carbon fouling in the action, thereby increasing its reliability.

The rifles have a lifetime limited warranty

Ive only dialed it in out to 600 due to my limited shooting lane and shocked at the flat trajectory and -1MOA all the way out. a true tac driver! 

Tikka T3 Lite 300 WSM. Free float barrel & detachable magazine. PLUS Lee Deluxe 2-Die Set and about three boxes of Winchester supreme nickel plated brass. Gun sells for 679+tax new ($700) + deluxe dies $50 + nickel brass $50+. Ill sell it for $650. Optic is not included, but i will leave the scope rings on it for you.  I put the bushnell DOA 600 reticle on all of my guns and the reticle works perfect for 180 grain bullets.  You can (or have someone else) reload these premium rounds for less than $0.50 per round opposed to paying $2.50+ at store.   A nice package for game of any size or distance all in a 6.12lb rifle system!

I recently built an AR10 which also shoots the 30 caliber bullet so dont need two guns in the same class, BUT i i kept her, id probably pay $50 at a local gunsmith and have the barrel ported or threaded to put a muzzle brake on it and pull 70-80% of the recoil out.  Nice to squeeze the trigger and watch the bullet hit the target through the optic! 

22"" barrel on a 1-10 twist to really stabalize a wide variety of bullet weights.  the sweet spot on this gun will be the 160-180 grain bullets.  

The trigger is about 4.5 lbs and brakes like glass.  Smoothest bolt ive ever operated.  acts like its on liquid ball bearings.

This rifle has had exactly 120 rounds through it and is in PERFECT CONDITION, just time to move out of the safe to someone who will appreciate her!   msg me if you have any questions and ill respond as soon as i can.

This pistol had the same specifications as the matte finished version but with the addition of a tritium night sight dovetailed into the barrel and an express style rear sight dovetailed to the slide. The tritium version gave the shooter a glowing front sight to reference during low light shooting conditions. This model is also referred to as the Alley cat. 
This makes it a good gun for undercover agents, off-duty police officers (or on-duty as backup), and private person(CCW). The design is simple and small, and very easy to conceal.Light weight when compared to a full sized service pistol. Easy to perform a basic field strip and clean.
The barrel can be released to pivot on a pin under the muzzle ('tip-up' barrel). This feature allows a round to be inserted into the chamber directly, without manipulation of the slide. Likewise, the chamber can be easily inspected for its load status, or cleared with a fingernail.Ammunition companies have also improved on the base .32 ACP load, by producing loadings in 60 grain (3.9 gram) hollow-point, yielding higher muzzle velocity and energy.

Comes with factory 2- 9 round magazines (no pinky extenders)  Gun has original box and paperwork.  I purchased this gun new from Vances back in 2008.  I have fired an estimated 500-600 round through it over the years.  I have lightly used it for off duty carry from time to time and it has been well taken care of.  The gun is in great shape, no scratches or marks.  These guns tend to get a slight graying on the slide from normal wear and that is evident.  I have a black leather belt loop holster (right handed) that I will give with it.  It had a snap on it, I didn't like the snap so I cut the snap strap off.  Theory was to make it easier to take out and re-holster.  Works as I expected.  Holster has a tension screw that can be adjusted to you desired tension.

I have an RPB industries (ingram's buyer when they went under) OPEN BOLT RPB industries Mac-10 .45 acp. They made the manufacture and import of open bolt firearms illegal in 1982 and that's not going to change so this is truly PRE-BAN. Anything made before the ban is grandfathered in like this one, any open bolt firearms made or imported AFTER the ban requires a form 3 (maybe form 4? Either way those need something special, mine does not). I acquired this in a trade and am interested in other things. Feel free to do a nationwide search on armslist for another like it. I did before posting and only 2 RPB anything came up and they were both 9mm. Cash or trade. Literally, get it while you can. They don't make them anymore and never will again. Super rare firearm. It's not the greatest shape. Has handling marks and wear on powder coat on back left corner. The interior is in far better shape then exterior. Super clean bore and chamber. Cash price $1700. Wont find a cheaper one currently for sale. This is NOT one of those cheap copies like Vulcan, velocity or masterpiece(of crap) arms."

There are tales of soldiers in the Middle East using these knives to clear walls by inserting them into cracks to act as a step. The following is from Gerber and other than the photo of the boxed knife the rest are stock pictures.

Down behind enemy lines? Left to fend for yourself? These are the scenarios that inspired the LMF II. Former military man, Jeff Freeman led the charge to engineer this fearless new 10"" survival knife. And we field-tested with the troops.

This knife is as adaptable as the personnel who carry it. Use it to cut through the skin of a fuselage. Or sever a seat belt. Or egress through the Plexiglas of a chopper. Plus, the LMF II does a slick job cutting firewood and building shelter.
LMF II Survival Knife

The over-molded handle successfully limits blistering. There is complete separation between the tang and butt cap, so the knife absorbs the shocks from hammering and prevents the shocks of electricity. Smartly situated grooves and lashing holes let the LMF II convert to a spear. The low-profile sheath facilitates movement, limits noise, works for parachuting, and attaches to a belt or Molle vest. The patented, integrated sharpener means edge retention in the field.

This is not a numbers matching gun. The receiver dates from 1911 and the barrel is a surplus trench model dated 1944. You can see the barrel has retained its blue while the rest of the gun has gone to patina.  Barrel has appropriate cutouts for hand guard/bayonet attachments.  This is a takedown model.

This gun is a late model, manufactured in 1975, making it one of the highest-quality and most reliable Commandos out there. It uses 30-round M3 Grease Gun mags, which are still cheap and plentiful on GunBroker - much cheaper than actual Thompson 20-round stick mags. The receiver, 16-inch barrel, compensator, and magazine have been recently refinished in DuPont Teflon black at a cost of $250, and look excellent. It has been thoroughly cleaned and lubed, and only 5 rounds have been fired since the refinish to ensure proper function. 

I am also including a spare lower receiver, which I had planned to refinish and convert to use a genuine Thompson wooden handgrip and trigger, as well as the mechanism required to convert the stock to a push-button release, again emulating a genuine Thompson. The wooden buttstock can be easily removed with two screws, and the gun is quite fun to shoot without the stock. I am also including a spare ejector, ejector pin, and ejector spring, good spare parts to have around. It has the rock-solid feel and fun of a Thompson to shoot, at a significantly lower cost. 

33rd-edition of the Blue Book of Gun Values places the value of this rifle in good condition at $825, which does not include the spare parts. I am willing to accept offers in the neighborhood of $725. As much as I don't want to admit it, it may not be possible to sell this gun (or mag) without a costly FFL transfer in Colorado soon, so this is a good opportunity to pick this gun up before that nonsense goes into effect. 

I am in need of funds quickly, so I would like to sell this today or tomorrow. For this reason, please call me at REDACTED to arrange a meeting."
