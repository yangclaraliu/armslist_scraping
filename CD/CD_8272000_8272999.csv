This is an exclusive model that has been finished with a flat dark earth (FDE) cerakote.   Ruger® Rapid Deploy folding rear sight provides windage adjustability, and pairs with the elevation adjustable front sight for a solid, reliable aiming system. The rear sight can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.   Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock and Mil-Spec buffer tube allow the rifle to be properly sized for different shooters, or varying levels of outerwear or defensive gear.   Made from aerospace-grade 7075-T6 aluminum forging, the flattop upper receiver includes a forward assist, dust cover and brass deflector, and is Type III hard coat anodized for maximum durability.   Bolt is machined from 9310 alloy steel and is shot peened and pressure (proof) tested to ensure strength, structural integrity and durability.   Front sight post is elevation adjustable, and a front sight tool is included. The A2-style F-height allows co-witness with many optics.   Patent pending Barrel Nut and Delta Ring are designed for one person handguard removal and installation. The design accepts most standard carbine length handguards. The barrel nut uses a standard wrench and can be swapped with a Mil-Spec barrel nut if desired.   Milled gas block is located at a carbine-length (M4) position for improved balance and handling. Multiple attachment points include a QD socket and bayonet lug, for many sling and accessory mounting options. Serrations on the angled face of the gas block provide a low-glare surface.   Medium contour cold hammer-forged barrel with ultra-precise rifling provides exceptional accuracy, longevity and easy cleaning. The 1:8"" twist rate stabilizes bullets from 35 to 77 grains, and the 5.56 NATO chamber allows the use of both 5.56 NATO and .223 Rem. Ammunition. M4 feed ramps provide improved operational reliability, and the matte black oxide finish reduces glare and provides corrosion resistance. A Ruger® flash suppressor is provided, and the 1/2""-28 threaded barrel allows for standard muzzle accessories to be installed.   Ergonomic pistol grip features an extended trigger reach for more precise trigger control.   Chrome-plated bolt carrier inside diameter and chrome-plated gas key inside diameter provide exceptional resistance to hot gases. The gas key is staked so that it will not loosen after extensive firing. A matte black oxide finish on the exterior of the bolt carrier provides corrosion resistance.   Single-stage trigger provides durable and reliable fire control. The enlarged trigger guard is designed to allow gloved shooting.   Handguards are made from heat-resistant glass-filled nylon for shooting comfort and durability.

The SIG Sauer P320 is a modular design of semi-automatic pistol made by Sig Sauer, Inc. of Exeter, New Hampshire, United States and SIG Sauer GMBH of Eckernförde, Germany. The handguns made in 9mm, .357 SIG, and .40 S&W calibers can be easily converted among each to be the other. A change from .357 Sig to .40 S&W requires only a barrel change. The change between 9mm to .357 Sig or .40 S&W and vice versa are accomplished using a caliber exchange kit. On January 19, 2017, it was announced that a customized version of the SIG Sauer P320 had won the United States Military XM17 Modular Handgun System competition and was issued to the 101st Airborne.
A key feature of the pistol is its modular design. The main module of the P320 is an internal stainless steel frame fire control unit, which consists of the integrated fire control group (trigger, and all necessary linkage and springs), ambidextrous slide release (one on each side of the pistol), ejector and four slide rails. This steel receiver unit is used in every P320 grip module, top end, and chambering combination and is inserted into the grip frame module and held in place by the axis pin of the disassembly lever. The firearm's serial number is on the fire control unit instead of the grip module. The fire control unit allows the operator to interchange differently-sized slide assembly or top end modules and polymer grip frame modules and trigger shoes and (limited) chambering conversions to adapt the gun to the individual user and address different needs.
 
Recoil mechanism
Like other SIG Sauer pistols, the P320 pistol is a short recoil operated, locked breech pistol. It uses the Sig Sauer System cam-operated barrel, which locks into the ejection port on the slide.
Slide
The slide is made of stainless steel and is often finished in a durable black finish called Nitron®. The slide contains the breechblock, striker, disconnector, ejector, and safety systems. State compliant versions may also mount an ambidextrous external safety lever. Some slides are machined for the Romeo1 type of optical sight.
Safety Mechanisms
The standard P320 has no manual safeties, promoting instant readiness. The use of an automatic firing pin safety combined with a disconnector ensures safe carrying of the weapon, while preventing accidental discharges if the gun is dropped or roughly handled. As mandated in some USA states, some models come with an external safety. The Modular Handgun System (MHS) (now known as the M17) version of the P320 has an ambidextrous thumb safety. Law Enforcement and Military versions can also be equipped with a tabbed safety trigger on request.

The trigger releases a pretensioned Double Action striker. The trigger system has a pull weight of about 5.5 lbs., 28.95 N"

Buy this pistol online at www.copsgunshop.net.  All FFL rules and regs apply.  Buyer pays shipping or sales tax.  Sorry, no trades.   Part of the 2016 Urban Grey Suppressor-Ready Series, this pistol is clad in urban grey (a mix of grey and FDE). With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options. A further evolution of the 75 B Ω, the new Convertible version allows users to swap from decocker to safety operation in the same manner as the popular P-07/P-09 pistols. Using the same simplified, more robust variation of the 75’s trigger system as the previous Omega, trigger parts use an interlocking design that allows for easy disassembly and reassembly without the need for tools. Not only does this simplify maintenance, the trigger parts themselves are made of different materials to enhance durability, operation life and reliability.

The FNX™-45 is the result of years of innovative product development and advanced engineering techniques. Modeled after the FNP™-45 service pistol introduced in 2007 under the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX™-45 is a double-action/single-action hammer-driven pistol with highly enhanced ergonomics. Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever, and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel. The FNX™-45’s checkered polymer frame has multiple interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD-1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.

ONLY ONE ROUND AT THE FACTORY..Unique to the supremely elegant Damascus steel slide is a sculptural texture which is as much an aesthetic addition as it is a deliberate consideration of combining form and function. Cabot has developed a super-etching technique, which when applied to the Damascus Ladder Deluxe’s slide turns the entire top-half of the pistol into a tactile surface, providing a true and sure hold while racking a round into battery and running the gun.Designed in-house by Cabot’s very own Mastersmith Rob Schauland, a custom-made extended rear sight complements our unique reverse dovetail at the slide’s forward end. The Damascus Ladder Deluxe’s extra-long sight radius, running the entire length of the slide, assures the shooter precision-grade aiming and rock-solid reliability.There are three primary interfaces between shooter and weapon; the front and rear straps and the surface of the trigger itself. Attention to subtly in these areas is one of the defining characteristics of a Cabot Gun. The straps of the Damascus Ladder Deluxe each feature our 24 line-per-inch Rhombus Checkering. The flat-faced all-business trigger has been hand-serrated to ensure a steady and repeatable pull. Coupled together, these features are what inspires the inexplicable confidence one feels as this pistol comes on target.***************************************************************************************************************************************************************Features Include:Modern 1911 stylingAvailable in 45 ACP Cabot Slide Crafted From Stainless Steel Damasteel DamascusCabot Frame From 416 Stainless Steel BilletProprietary Super-Etch Damascus Finish5 in.
