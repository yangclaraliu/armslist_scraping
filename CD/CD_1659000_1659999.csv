Remington 541-T Standard/Sporter contour barrel. I am relatively certain this gun is unfired. There is very little bluing loss on the sharp edges of the locking lugs and bolt, the kind of thing you’d expect to see after working the action a couple dozen times. The original grub screws covering the scope base holes do not appear to have ever been removed. Stock is nearly immaculate, except for a very small nick in near the heel which measures approx 1/8” x 1/16”, and is very shallow. I do not believe you could find an example of this gun in better condition unless you had a time machine. This gun does feature the 3 screw fully adjustable trigger. This gun also has the 2nd action screw, and has NOT been drilled for sling swivels. Includes one factory 5 round magazine. Includes is the original factory owners packet (manual, ect)."

S&W M&P 9 Shield = $475

Apex Tactical Hard Sear = $42  http://www.midwayusa.com/product/551730/apex-tactical-hard-sear-s-and-w-m-and-p-9mm-luger-357-sig-40-s-and-w-steel

Total = $534 before any taxes or shipping was added 
I rounded down to an even number which gives what I believe is a very fair price for this carry setup.

Price is $530 

This is everything that you need to start carrying this pistol minus ammo.

Factory New



The Taurus Tracker family includes a full range of calibers and sizes to perfectly suit any hunting adventure. Chambered in everything from .17 HMR to .22 LR to .44 Magnum, these rugged, durable revolvers also make a practical choice for backpacks and tackle boxes, especially where there are bears and other predators around. Extremely comfortable to fire and easy to control - the Tracker Series continues to grow in popularity thanks to its high level of accuracy, rock-solid performance and near- indestructible construction.


Features

Porting Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.

Ribber Grip Exclusive Taurus orgonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.

Taurus Security System (TSS)rs Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one- quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

Transfer Bar The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol.

The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine.

The patent pending two-piece modular construction allows us to create the ultimate magazine for many reasons. In addition to the proper magazine form, we are able to achieve maximum strength and integrity when the components are molded. Precision molding is achieved much easier on two small parts versus one large one. We can also mix materials, impossible with conventional plastic magazines. We can offer transparent lower/high tensile strength upper sectioned magazines that avoid the brittle feed lip issue of all-transparent material construction. Modular construction makes perfect sense for the unprecedented strength- we eliminated the removable floor plate, so the magazine becomes a five-sided box. ARC Mag survives the impact that crushes metal magazines.

ARC Mag takes full advantage of the latest polymers available from the aerospace industry- materials impervious to the effects of solvents & lubricants. After molding, we permanently bond the two sections together with advanced adhesives during manufacturing, so no disassembly is possible, or required. ARC Mag has a unique low-friction semi-floating follower that is slotted to allow for easy magazine cleaning. Just dunk the ARC Mag in hot soapy water, rinse and invert to drain. That’s hassle-free maintenance. ARC Mag also features a premium chromium-silicon spring that is heat treated, stress relieved and moly coated. Life expectancy for this spring is 100,000+ cycles."

This charging handle does not come with a latch, so you will need to re-use your factory polymer latch or any custom latch. You will also need to use your spring and latch pivot pin.

Features
 •Machined texture and sand blasted for the least reflective surface possible.
 •Made from 100% aluminum, not plastic.
 •Ergonomically designed for quick, easy pullback.
 •Designed to fit (ONLY) the Smith & Wesson M&P15-22.
 •Each charging handle is 100% guaranteed for life against breakage and is proudly made in Oregon, USA.
 •Machined to the highest quality standards by modern machinist artisans.
 •Hard anodized for years of trouble free service. A lot of ""Mil Spec"" parts are not hard anodized.

Compare Us Against The Competitors

What's the Tacticool22 difference you ask? Compare our charging handle to the right side of your factory handle. There you'll find a flattened pyramid shape that stops the handle from moving forward. Other handles do not have that feature, or there is a bunch of material machined away to make that shape, making for a weaker handle.

Product Description

The Sig Sauer P250 is the one gun that changes everything, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. The P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned Sig Sauer quality, performance, accuracy, and reliability into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. It has the ability to be configured in everything from full-sized range pistol to a deep concealment weapon, in any of four calibers and, the selection of grip modules, coupled with a standard or short trigger, means it can be fitted to a wide range of hand sizes. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality Sig Sauer pistol that perfectly meets your needs, you have the foundation for building a new Sig Sauer pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance.

I bought this because it is a great barrel and was available for a reasonable price, since the fancier barrel I really wanted was temporarily unobtainable. Since ammo was also nearly unobtainable, I only shot two 30-round magazines through this before the barrel I really wanted came in. The low-profile gas block and gas tube included are actually unused. When I changed barrels, I just used the same gas block and tube, so these were extras. Unfortunately at the moment, I don't have a roll pin for the gas block, but I may be able to get one from a friend. For those not familiar with these FN barrels, I'm including their spiel below:

A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system.   The M4 profile barrel is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.

The only trade I would consider is an equally good 300 blackout barrel, gas block and tube, as that is what I plan to buy with this sale for a hunting upper I'm building."

Wanting to donate some money to the Red Cross in light of the recent events that just happened.   I am currently working overnight in Marietta and will return tomorrow (Thursday, May 23rd), therefore I am currently unable to load a picture.  

I purchased the firearm brand new, and have the box and all original paperwork to accompany the firearm.  I also have an extended magazine that will go with it.  The pistol has had 50 rounds fired since it was purchased new, and has since been kept in a safe.  The pistol cannot be technically flawless, since it has been fired, however it is in as good of shape as one would ever find.

I am only asking $400 to promote a quick sale so the proceeds can be used immediately.  I will be posting a Browning X-Bolt 270 rifle with a Zeiss Conquest scope, that has only 10 rounds through it, on here as well for the same cause.

Please feel free to contact me this evening or tomorrow if you'd like to reserve the pistol.  Again, I will be back in Newcastle tomorrow afternoon / evening and can meet you anywhere you'd like.

I can be reached far easier on my cell rather than email.  I'd prefer if you'd call or text me at 4zero5-six2six-one8one4.

The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle. If you have any question please email me, thank you"

For AR-15 / M16 type rifles, optical sights provide superior performance at longer ranges, but iron sights can be more effective for close-range engagements. However, attaching an optical sight either prevents the use of iron sights or results in a setup that produces a front sight ""shadow"" on the optical image, and/or results in problematic transitions from optical to backup iron sights. Not anymore. Dueck Defense Rapid Transition Sights (RTS) provide shooters with the quickest possible transition between longer- and closer-range target acquisition, greatly increasing their efficiency and effectiveness in battle and competition. Designed by Barry Dueck Director of SureFire's Suppressor Division and a top 3-Gun shooter these sights mount directly to a weapon's Picatinny rail, offset from center by approximately 45°. This unique offset position makes transitioning from optical to iron sights simply a matter of quickly canting the weapon with your wrists and locking on to the target. There's no removing a hand from the weapon or making a manual adjustment, and no cluttered field of vision or iron sights blocking the optical sight. Just smooth, quick transitions that could mean the difference between winning or losing a competition, or more importantly a gunfight."

Answers to most frequent questions:
- Gun is in great condition, with less than 500 rounds through it, and very minor wear.

- No, gun does NOT have a de-cocker because it is the LE series, but one can be easily put on there for about $40-50. 

- And yes, the gun can easily be converted to .40cal, by simply buying a .40cal barrel.

I asked about it and they said they are professionally done reloads that they have been selling for years. I paid $18 each bag of 50 so not trying to gouge anyone here but I already have about 1000 rounds of reloads that I made when I first bought my reloader so I absolutely would not sell any of those since I am not that confident in my reloading skills since I am so new to it, so please don't ask.

JUST TO BE CLEAR!!! THE AMMO I AM SELLING IS PROFESSIONALLY RELOADED, THE STUFF I HAVE FOR MYSELF WAS RELOADED BY A ROOKIE (ME) AND I WOULD NEVER SELL THESE SINCE I WOULD’NT WANT TO HURT ANYONE IF I DID ANYTHING WRONG. BUT WHAT YOU WOULD BE BUYING IS EXTREMELY RELIABLE AND PROFESIONALLY RELOADED AMMO!!!!!!

I guess these were just an impulse buy since it is so hard to find 9mm but I really don't need them so I know there are people out that could really use this ammo more than me so just trying to help out.

If you want them I am at Southfield Rd near downtown Allen Park.

Price is $40 FIRM each bag is $18 x 2=$36 just give a whopping $4 profit for my time, otherwise I will just keep them and shoot them someday. Please I will not sell just one bag, not worth the hassle!  Also, if you want me to ship these somewhere, expect the price to go up since I have a broken foot and I am on crutches, it is not easy for me to get out to ship them, so better not to even ask or be prepared to pay for my trouble.
