EXETER, NH (January 2012) —The SIG SAUER Adaptive Carbine Platform (ACP) allows any handgun with an accessory rail to be quickly modified into a personal defense weapon or submachine gun-style firearm. Regardless of the brand, most pistols equipped with an accessory rail can be mounted to the ACP without the need for modification to the base gun. 
Fabricated from solid aircraft-grade aluminum, the ACP sports M1913 rails at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions with a full-length top rail at the 12 o’clock position. Compatible accessories such as lights, red dot sights and lasers can be mounted for additional functionality.
 “The ACP brings Personal Defense Weapon (PDW) features to almost any handgun,” said Bud Fini, SIG SAUER Vice President of Marketing. “For law enforcement or executive protection details looking for the quick deployment of a submachine gun, but with the controllability of a handgun, the ACP offers everything in one package.”
 An integral hand stop permits the user to get a forward grip without the danger of covering the muzzle. The integral quick-detachable sling mounts allow an ACP-equipped pistol to be carried on a sling for fast access.
 The new SIG SAUER ACP allows the shooter access to the pistol’s frame mounted controls, providing an easy training transition and familiar manual of arms. The ACP is also compatible with most sound suppressors.

It was collecting dust in his closet, and now it's collecting dust in mine. This gun has never been hunted with, or shot very much at all. I use it occasionally when a groundhog makes me mad, but that is pretty rare. in the 15 years I have owned it, I have put less than 100 rounds through it. My uncle put even less through it in the 20 years he owned it. The serial number ( as pictured ) indicates that it was built in 1964. Considering its age, it's in very good condition. The only issue is the buttplate has a part broke off ( from sitting in the closet ), but I bought a new old stock one today, and it will be repaired within the next few days. I am also including a box of Hornady Lever Revolution 30-30 ammo with the gun. 


quick edit.. This gun operates and shoots flawlessly. It is of MUCH better quality than the new Marlin 30-30's. I have hit varmints with this rifle with just the iron sights at well over 50 yards, easily. It is very dependable, and the sights are right on with no flaws or issues."

It came from Midway and they are now sold out but the product number is 149377 if you want to check it out for yourself. All buyers were very happy with it and rated it either 4 or 5 stars out of 5. If you want a spare bolt for your AR15 this would make a good choice. If interested please include a phone number to contact you on, the price is firm $70 and cash only.

Product description from Midway:
This AR-Stoner Complete AR-15 Bolt Assembly is manufactured from high strength 8620 steel that has been magnetic particle inspected to ensure a defect-free part. This high quality, 223 Remington / 5.56x45mm NATO bolt comes fully assembled and ready for use with an extractor, ejector and gas rings installed. The supply of AR-15 bolts is very limited, so make sure to pick one up for your next rifle build or for use as a spare before it's too late!

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.

The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

When you happen to be looking for Original Magpul MBUS(made in Colorado), make sure you're not getting sold PTS products. PTS(Professional Training and Simulation) are made in China(licensed to do this by Magpul) for purposes of Airsoft. Either the seller is unaware of the difference between PTS and original MBUS or they are lying to you. A set of genuine Gen2 MBUS should cost around $70-80. PTS sell on Amazon for around half of that for a set. If someone is trying to MBUS for $40, they're full of you know what. Hope this helps."

This is a thousand rounds of Aguila 124gr. FMJ, brass cased, reloadable 9mm rounds. These are THE rounds to be shooting in a 9mm AR, or other carbine rifle, but are equally good for target or match shooting. Even decent for defense carry rounds, if you don't want to shell out a buck a bang for 147gr. hollowpoints. 

I landed these cheaper than usual, so I'm passing the discount forwards. This is a thousand rounds for $500, though I will split into two lots of 500 at $250 each. Prefer pickup in Leesburg Wal-mart, or Sterling Wal-mart, but I'm willing to be reasonable about meeting - the more ammo, the more reasonable I'll be. I can take credit card too, if you're strapped for cash.

712,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1542712,For Sale:  Beretta 92/96 Stainless Guide Rod,"Westside Brownsburg, Indianapolis, Indiana",$ 20,"Listed On: Monday, May 20, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Our buffer for the Beretta 92/96 is a departure from our original line of buffers. It was not possible to place a cushioning buffer between the slide and frame, as with our other recoil buffers, without making our own guide rod. This new design includes a stainless steel guide rod with a slide bushing and, of course, a recoil buffer. The guide rod and slide bushing are made from a high carbon stainless steel which has a hardness of 48-52 Rockwell. During our testing, we fired in excess of 1,000 rounds through a Langdon Tactical Technologies 92 Vertec. Not a single malfunction was experienced! By installing the new guide rod and buffer you too will reduce felt recoil, enhance muzzle control, and lengthen service life. The guide rod and buffer will fit both the 92 and 96 series of Beretta handguns. Installation is a simple: slide the bushing into the guide rod hole in the slide and swap your old guide rod for our new one, complete with buffer. When you pull the slide to the rear, the slide contacts the buffer before it impacts the frame. Note: This buffer will only work in the full size variants of the Models 92 and 96. Also works in Taurus 92/96."

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel
(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. 

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years."

829,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1542829,For Sale:  Lee Pro 1000 complete rig for 40SW and 45ACP,"Topeka, Topeka, Kansas","$ 1,100","Listed On: Monday, April 29, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have my complete Lee Progressive 1000 reloading rig for sale. Everything you need to begin reloading hundreds of rounds per hour. Now before you waste your time sending hate mail about the seemingly overpriced $180 Lee Pro 1000 press, it's the total package that must be considered. You do your research and if you're interested, I'm open to offers for cash and handgun trades or possibly ammo. Keep in mind, cash is king, and your trade will be valued based on reasonable market values. In other words, a brick of 22 is $25 at Walmart, that's what it's worth, not $60. 

Now that all of that is out of the way, this rig includes the press, two shell plate carriers and sets of dies for 40 and 45acp, auto disc powder measure, primer trays for each size, and case feeder. Essentially, all you do with each crank of the lever is place a bullet on the appropriate shell and a fresh round drops out. Midway tumbler, old school powder scale and kinetic bullet puller also included. 

Also included:  about 3 1/2 lbs of Winchester 231 powder (about $100)
4500 Winchester large pistol primers and 4300 Winchester small pistol primers. ($400-$600 worth of primers alone.) 
600 185gr fmj 45acp bullets ($130)
Several thousand of each (see shoeboxes in the pic, that's only some of it) of 40 and 45 brass. (About $150 in brass) 

I simply do not have time to spend reloading and I haven't used this for a while so someone else should get some use out it. Keep in mind, I know standard pistol primers are hard to find, and I don't want to break this up and have components go to waste. But, if that's all you want are the primers, either buy it all and you sell off what you don't need, or pay a premium for them.

The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used.

Very solid rifle and a blast to shoot. Only taken to the range once and put about 150 rounds through it - rest of the time it has been put away in my safe. Comes with original box, paperwork, and included magazine. Need the cash for a new project. 

This is the first official Heckler & Koch MP5 chambered in .22 LR. Authentic in looks, feel, and operation, this replica MP5 is engineered as a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It’s built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. A 25- and 10-round version of the magazine is available. Both are proportionate in size to the centerfire version’s mag to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine. The estimated retail price for the MP5 A5 is $475.
Operation

The .22 caliber HK MP5 A5 operates on a blowback system. The bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its front sight is adjustable for elevation and comes with interchangeable posts. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety switch rotates in the same manner as the 9 mm MP5.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game."
