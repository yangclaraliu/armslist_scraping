I am selling mine for $500 because it doesn't have the original stock. The D model uses the same stock as a regular SKS, just sometimes it had a filler piece in front of the mag well and the mag well is widened to fit the AK mags. 

The D models prefer Chinese AK mags and the gun comes with 1 Chinese mag. Also comes with the bayonet (not pictured) as well as the pin that holds the bayonet on. Also comes with a receiver scope mount and a Leapers 4x scope. The stock it is in is an ATI Dragunov stock and I'm aware it sucks, but again, that's why I'm listing this for $500 and not $800.

Yes there are alot of guns and no I am NOT a dealer.  I simply am working on alot of projects/getting projects started- at one time.  I have a passion for firearms and like to collect.  Although I am a collector, I'm not looking for limited releases, gold/silver plated firearms, decoratively etched, or safe only pieces right now.  THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR READING ALL OF THIS.  Sorry I had to spell everything out in specifics but there are people that just don't get things.  I'm in Newport News and can meet mainly in Newport News, Hampton, Williamsburg, and York County.  I will however drive to the tidewater side IF the deal is just sooooooo good.  I hate the tunnel and the traffic.  Unfortunately that will also have an affect on the price.  Email your info on the firearms like manufacturer, model, caliber, pics, condition, any accessories, your contact info.  If your price is higher than what I have listed then please don't even bother.  I will NOT buy it."

Description: Up for auction is a Ruger .44 Magnum carbine in incredible shape! I tried to get as many pictures as possible to show what amazing condition this is in. Serial number starts with 110,xxx so according to Ruger records, it was made in 1967. There is no warning label on this gun. It is a metal and wood gun - no plastic parts, a truly awesome example of American gun manufacturing. Stock is a very nice dark walnut. This is one of the rarer monte carlo stocks. It has the Ruger logo on the bottom of the knob and sling attachments. Already has weaver rail scope mounts on it so a scope can be attached and the original sights can also be used.

Please see the pictures, you'll see the fine condition of this sweet Ruger carbine.

Model: Alamo (Frontier Scout)
Serial Number: 3468A22 
Year of Manufacture: 1966. This revolver is on the ATF C&R List. 
Caliber: .22 Long Rifle 
Action Type: Single Action Revolver 

The top of the barrel is stamped, “Colts Pt. FA. MFG. Co. Hartford CT. U.S.A.” The left side of the barrel is stamped and gold filled, “ * Colt Alamo *.” The left side of the frame contains the rampant Colt logo. The right side of the barrel is marked, “Colt Single Action Frontier Scout .22 L.R.” There is some engraving on the heel of the butt. 

This revolver is mounted with a fixed front blade, and a notch rear sight. 
The grips are white Ivory-like material, starting to yellow a bit from age. The correct Colt medallion is on each panel, with a gold star on the left panel. There is a bit of color from the presentation case lining starting to bleed onto the left grip panel. The grips rate in about Excellent overall condition. 

This revolver is finished in an attractive black finish, which is accented with a gold cylinder, grip housing, hammer, trigger, ejector button, cylinder base pin, and screws. 
The bore is unfired, and the rifling reflects this. There is no erosion. 

This revolver retains about 99% of its metal finish. There is a bit of marking on the star. The left side of the barrel shows slightly duller gold than the rest of the gun. This is apparently just rubbing from the box. The cylinder does not appear to have been rotated, nor the screws ever turned. The markings are clear. Overall, this gun rates in about Excellent condition. 

This revolver comes in a blonde wood Colt Presentation Case, with a woodcut of the Battle of the Alamo and the Colt logo on the front of the case. The case is lined in purple satin, with a hint of bleed where the top has contacted the left grip panel, and perhaps interacted with hand oils. The fitted case is lined with blue velvet. There is no key, and the hasp has locked on the lower case lock, so the screws to the front plate have been removed at some point."
