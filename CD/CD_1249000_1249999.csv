The gun is in great condition with only a few minor marks from the usual yearly hunting but are barley noticable. Nickel plated trigger assembly, Leopold rifleman 3-9/40mm($200), Burris scope mount, custom camo paint($200). This is the mountain rifle stainless synthetic without the fixed clip or base plate, it has the blind magazine. this model was only made in 1993 and is not a BDL, ADL, or CDL. Very smooth, flat shooting gun. I'm also throwing in a box of .280 rem 139 gr hornady superformance sst rounds. Remington didn’t offer a stainless-steel M700 until 1992. In 1992 the very first M700 in stainless was called the Model 700 Stainless Synthetic. That rifle chambered .270 Winchester featured a blind magazine and a 24-inch barrel. In 1993 that model was changed to the Remington Model 700 BDL Stainless Synthetic, and as a BDL it then featured a hinged floor plate. Also in 1993 Remington introduced what is called the Model 700 Mountain Rifle Stainless Synthetic. It featured a blind magazine and a slimmed-down mountain profile 22-inch barrel and that's what I have here. In my pics there are photos of the relevant pages in the 1993 Remington catalog.

Here is a very nice factory refurbished Nagant revolver.  It has had 21 rounds through it sense refurbishing.  This is the pistol that when you cock it the cylinder moves forward to seal the barrel to the cylinder.  This is suppose to give the gun a little more chamber pressure which it does.  How ever the round is fairly weak anyway.  I holds 7 rds. and shoots a 7.62 x 38R mm and they are getting hard to find and expensive when you do find them.  I am including all of the ammo that I have with this gun which is only one and a half boxes (59 rds.).  This gun also comes with the correct holster and cleaning rod.  I'm firm at $165.00 as I feel this is a very fair price.

I will consider other brands but would like them to be mil-spec. I know I can get a new or like new rifle if the seller isn't price gouging, there is a lot of that going around but I've seen quite a few honest guys on here too. If I wanted to wait a year I could get a brand new rifle from many of these manufacturers for under $900, but I doubt I could be that patient. I'm really looking for a basic flat top M4 style rifle, collapsible butt stock, 16"" barrel, etc. I prefer that the rifle have some sort of sights, but if not it's ok, I also would like two 30 round mags which is fairly standard.

I want to see what I am going to purchase in person, please don't ask me to mail a money order or paypal $1000 to you and tell me you will mail my item when you get the money, it's not happening. Yes, someone actually tried to do that to me on this site.

I have $950-$1,000 cold hard CASH to spend, the finance department has barred the door which means I will have a REALLY hard time getting more. I prefer not to sleep on the couch curled up with my AR for six weeks. All joking aside, if you have something reasonable and are asking slightly more, we can probably work something out. I prefer not to involve an FFL holder simply because it is just added expense on my part, but if you can come up with an offer that keeps me at or under my budget including the $30 fee for the transfer and NICS check, I will be happy to do that. If you have something that fits my description and need cash, not a credit card or check or money order or paypal, just good hard cash, please email me or call or text me at 2-one-0-four-0-nine-2-three-8-nine, thanks for your time."

This is a lightly used and well taken care of rifle that is startlingly accurate with ironsights. It has a vary solid synthetic SVD style stock and foregrip. This is a shooter, an all around great gun, that will last as long as you're willing to oil it. Also comes with 1 30rd Tapco synthetic magazine and a tactical 3-point sling.

I have more Tapco 30rd mags as well.

More details:

The NHM-91 is built on a 1.5mm stamped receiver, making it heavier than the typical 1mm stamped receiver, resulting in better felt and controlled recoil. The longer 20"" heavy barre gives the NHM-91 a longer sight radius, resulting in more accurate shots than your typical AK47."

Uberti has done an amazing job on replicating the original Smith and wesson design of 1875. The Schofield has walnut grips, a glimmering blued finish, and is chambered in .45 Long Colt with a 5 inch barrel. I have only had the privilege of firing 50 rounds through this gun and i have decided to sell it in order to fund further firearms purchases. The Schofield functioned flawlessly through all 50 rounds of winchester factory loaded, brass ammunition that I fired through it. The gun has been thoroughly maintained, oiled, and stored within a climate controlled safe. The gun was bought new and I am the original owner. I have everything with the gun including box, cable lock, manual etc.  Because this gun is in such great condition (no lag in the action/trigger, no grit in the moving parts, no rust or pitting) and is somewhat hard to find I am asking top used dollar at $800.00  I feel this price isn't to high to be unreasonable and not to low to be a loss to myself. New price for this gun  can be found at: http://www.uberti.com/firearms/top-break.php  ($1,069.00 msrp, $900-$1000 is the typical in store price) If you are interested in the Schofield but feel the $800.00 is to much please respond with an offer and i will consider. Please out of respect, no low ball offers. Thank you for your interest in the Schofield and I hope to make a deal with someone who can love this gun as much as I have."

Hornady XTP bullets were designed for hunting, self-defense, and law enforcement. One of the great things about the XTP bullet is reliable performance, it features controlled expansion where six serrations divide the bullet into six symmetrical sections. These sections weaken the jacket to allow controlled expansion at low velocities and ensures fragmentation does not occur at high velocities. The XTP bullet is really known for its stopping power. They were designed from the beginning to expand reliably at a variety of handgun velocities and deliver deep, terminal penetration with every shot. Most handgun bullets are designed to perform at a single factory-specified velocity where the XTP bullet is designed to offer controlled expansion over a range of velocities.

Each XTP Bullet has a swaged core and drawn copper jacket to ensure uniform expansion and in-flight stability. Adding a cannelure to this bullet keeps the core and the jacket locked together while also allowing the cartridge case to tightly crimp, adding security at high velocities. This is not loaded ammunition.

I had a more expert person tell me this about the reifle.  ""What you have there (based on serial number) is a 1917-1921 Model 1903 in .30-06. The buttplate has been replaced (originals came with a smooth one but it doesn't make a difference) and since you've got the 1918 barrel, you're looking at an almost all-original piece. Many were arsenal rebuilt and to have one that close even after a rebuild is good. Prices range from $500 (poor) to $1000 (good) on models made then. Because you have the receiver and barrel from the same time, you can add 20% to your price because the 1917 and 1918 ones are more desirable. If it were mint, you could ask around $2500""

Taurus has expanded its popular Tracker series of revolvers with the 405.  

Taurus has made its name by producing revolvers that are both economical and innovative. Guns such as the Raging Bull and Judge opened up new potential in revolver design, power and performance. A new revolver shows that Taurus still travels that same path. The 405 is a snubnose chambered for .40 S&W.

Built on the same-size steel frame as the 992, the Taurus 405’s .40 S&W chambering and 2-inch snubnose barrel were chosen with another purpose in mind, namely, self-defense. Large-bore, snubnose revolvers have always had a small but passionate group of followers. Revolvers in that class are usually chambered for .41 Rem. Mag. or .44 Spl., but modern defensive loads in those calibers are hard to find. One could argue that greater bullet mass and increased bore diameter more than make up for outdated projectiles, but the 405 offers the big-bore enthusiast the opportunity to carry a snubnose revolver chambered for a round that’s available with the latest modern bullets.

EOTech G23FTS 3X Magnifier with Flip To Side (FTS) Mount

2nd Generation technology that will transition a fielded EOTech HWS into a lethal medium range optic.

The 3X magnifier is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.

This is the 2nd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers a half inch more eye relief, positions the windage and elevation adjustments inside of the optic rather than in the mount, less moving parts in the mount which makes the mount even more stable, and has a quick release thow lever on the bottom of the mount which allows the quick removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accomadate the 7mm raised sights.

Quick Switch to Side (STS) mount is faster than ever, just push the magnifier to the side and it will lock securely in that position until you push it back into place for magnified viewing.
Flip to side (FTS) base allows immediate transition from 3x to 1x shooting
User maintains 1 MOA aiming dot in 3X
Ambidextrous mount allows magnifier to flip left or right
Includes 7mm riser that perfectly aligns to both EOTech sight heights

Just look online. The price these jackwagons are asking is way out of line. These people that gouge ammo prices are taking advantage of you, refuse to pay their prices.

I hand selected this one as best out of 20. The main deciding factor was the test target. This is the most accurate AK I've ever owned or shot. I've tested it against my milled Bulgarian SLR 95, VEPR , both stamped and milled MAK 90s, standard Saiga conversion, SAR 1, WASR, and SLR 106 in 5.56 caliber. It always had a tighter group than the rest although the VEPR was comparable. I'm not saying it's a tack driver but it's definitely the most accurate AK I've ever fired in 7.62X39. It's a great shooter. Ammo mostly used was the old WMC 124gr HP.
This is not a FIME group SGL. It's marked LEGION IZHEVSK RUSSIA, ARSENAL LAS VEGAS NV USA. It has the Izhmash arrow in a triangle marked trunnion, Izhmash logo on the receiver with 08 under it (08 being the year it was produced). It doesn't have all the ugly import markings that the regular Saigas or Fimes (Fimes only have a couple different markings but more none the less) have so it's more authentic and can have an AK100 series side folder installed and not have to cut through any markings. It also doesn't have all the extra ""sporter"" holes/fake rivets in the receiver that the regular Saigas have. These were produced to have the correct AK103 parts (selector, rear sight leaf, clover leaf trigger guard, markings ETC). SGL 20s were assembled by LEGION with the finest hand selected parts. Legion is Izhmash custom shop. Arsenal did a limited run of SGL 10s and 20s but the 21s are still in production. With this being a limited edition AK from Arsenal it is a collectors piece and is as close as we can get to an AK103. I'm not sure what the actual suffix number of the model number is with the Midwest quad rail but I believe it is '66' (SGL 20-66). I had the trigger lightly polished so that it's smoother than the horrible factory Arsenal US trigger. I also had it refinished anodized then painted with Norell's Moly Resin. It does have some handling marks/wear from shooting and some scratches from the safe in the finish. I would rate the finish at 95%. The wear is all finish wear, not deep scratches/dents or anything like that. I've never had any problems with it. I've put around 1k rounds through it and kept it in a climate controlled safe. I've never fired any corrosive ammo through it. It will come with an AK cleaning kit, cleaning rod, AK103 muzzle brake, and 30 round Bulgarian circle ten waffle pattern mag. Payment must be by USPS money order. Thanks for looking."

 The Bushmaster C15 Carbines are a unique hybridization of traditional AR-15 type features with space-age Carbon 15 composite molded receivers for light weight and rugged durability. The Carbon 15's lightweight 14.5"" M4 profile barrel is made of chrome-lined chromemoly steel and includes an Izzy flash suppressor pinned and welded in place to achieve 16"" overall barrel length. The barrel and other critical steel parts are manganese-phosphate-finished for corrosion and rust protection. The Carbon 15's safety levers have color-coded markings on both sides of the receiver for quick visual check of firing condition. Package includes a 30-round .223 Remington magazine and a Red Dot Sight.
