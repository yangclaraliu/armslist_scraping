The strengths of the XD-S 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD pistols safe and easy to use.Comes with 3 mags including 1 extended mag."

The hand guard is a Samson Star C-EX-P Free Float Carbine Length Rail that wraps around the gas block.The BCG is full auto design, no cut backs in that aspect, the back end of the BCG is wider, with the corners rounded so as to reduce carrier tilt and wear on the buffer tube when it passes the receiver in the tube. The Bolt is marked “M” for magnetic particle inspection.On the inside of the receiver, were the cam pin rotates into the little pocket on the side, Adams Arms rounded off that corner to assist with wear mitigation so the cam pin slides into place instead of wearing that corner down on the receiver wall making for a smother transition when locking and unlocking the bolt into position.The gas block is railed at receiver height, providing for continuous rail down the length of the rifle, with the adjustment knob at the end for quick and easy access. This is a very nice quality rifle. $1,000 for the whole package, or $800 for just the complete upper"

The stock seems to have been cut down, and I have never fired it. I don't have any reason to believe it's un-fireable, but due to other stringencies, it's unlikely I'll be able to put it to good use, hence the sale.That said, it comes with a cleaning kit, and I did recently clean and oil it myself. I'm pretty sure the part numbers don't really match. As a note, I did see some, what looks to be, minor pitting near the end of the barrel. I myself have been a welder and worked with metal that deals with various pressures, and would say it's probably safe to shoot, as there is no severe structural damage, or anything, seemingly.Price is $130 firm, and I am willing to travel, perhaps for a small bump in price, just to cover the gas.717-202-7120 is my number. I have both calling and texting. Feel free to contact me anytime. Thanks."

If you're unsure what exactly that means you'll have to watch a YouTube video on it because it's hard to explain with just words. I picked the gun up new at the beginning of February. It's a great gun but I just got a performance center shield that I carry. This model has the real deal tritium night sights. Some models have the glow paint, which in my opinion aren't true night sights. I also have a +1 pinky extender that I had to order extra and that cost me around 30 bucks. This model with tritium sights on Grabagun is around 650 which is a great price. In gun shops they usually charge well over 700. I'm really looking for a fair trade but I'd prob take 525 cash. Guns I'm interested in are...chiappa rhino 200 or 300ds.sig 229,226, 220, arex zero 1, m&p9 2.0. Really I'd be open to any modern guns that aren't true subcompacts.

The 45 colt only model is fully rifled which will deliver better bullet performance and prevent the tumbling often seen on the 45/410 models which only feature 1/2 inch of rifling. The great thing about the Bond derringer however is how easy it is to change the barrel, it takes all of 30 seconds to switch out barrels which are available in a wide variety of lengths and calibers, with enough barrels this derringer can potentially shoot 22, 32, 357,380, 9mm, 40mm, 10mm, 45 colt, 410 shot, and 45 acp in barrels between 2"" to 6"" with less than a minute to switch out.Included with the sale is a carrying case, 140 rounds of Hornady critical defense, 20 rounds of Hornady leverevolution, and 40 rounds of spent .45 colt brass. The derringer has had roughly 100 rounds fired through it.I really like this gun, and I plan on getting another soon, but for the time being Ruger recently starting making 3"" .327 federal magnum SP101s again after a few years hiatus and I need some extra cash to get one."

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8044998,For Sale:  Christmas Trees/ Crappie Reefs,"Moncks Corner, Charleston, South Carolina",$ 5,"Listed On: Thursday, March 15, 2018",Fishing,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a few Christmas trees leftover from the holiday season that I planned on using for artificial reefs/ crappie beds but haven't got around to putting them out and don't know if I will. Instead of letting them go to waste I figured I'd let someone else get a few of them. They're all in 6-8' range. Some of them are already opened up, most are still wrapped up in twine for easy transport. I'm asking $5 a piece or 5 trees for $20. Please don't call me and try to lowball me as I'll just keep them and put them out when I get a chance or use them for bonfires with the kids. 8four3- 4one2-0100"
