Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. Ship with FFL"

371,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1228371,For Sale:  380 ACP ammo for sale FS 250 rounds Two lots,"Central Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada",$ 110,"Listed On: Saturday, March 9, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have two lots of two different kinds of 380ACP ammo for sale. Both are consisting of 5 boxes or 250 rounds total. They are all FMJ ball ammo in brass casing and are both reloadables. 

First is the RWS Sport line (Hungarian I believe). It is 95gr and shoots wonderful out of all my guns (more on that later). Second is the Sellir and Bellot aka S&B (Czech) and it is 92gr and again great to shoot. Personally I think it shoots a little hot but I always get consistent grouping to the point I think it is as good as the corbon defensive rounds.

Now as for the prices. If you buy both lots I will sell it for $210 which saves you $10. Also, before anyone start getting on my case for selling these for $22/Box I took the liberty of taking a couple of photos from Wal-Mart for references. The first picture isfor the WWB 380 and it is $22.47/box which is $24.29/box after 8.1% sales tax.

As for quality of the ammunitions. Some will argue WWB or other U.S. brands are superior in quality. Well folks, I am here to tell you that is incorrect. I currently own four different 380acp caliber pistols including two P232, PPK/S, and  P238, so I consider myself a sort of connoisseur. Not remington (junk, at least in 380), not WWB (two ftf in my p232) but rather the Europeans are better at manufacturing these rounds than we do. There's a big reason why 9mm kurz are written on all the boxes and that's because 380's are what police and civilian uses all around the world (look it up). Simply it is a much more popular catridge over there than over here. And these two manufactures are great at what they do.

This listing is for a used Colt 1911 Commander 9mm. Very little used and was stored well, no rust or pitting anywhere. Has slight wear marks in the normal places but in excellent condition. Barrel is 4 inch and in superb condition also. From the wear marks this gun has probably been fired about 100 times. A Colt web search for this serial number indicates 1972 manufacture date. Original wood grips with Colt Medallion on both sides. Has serrations on arched mainspring housing. Has serrations on trigger. Vertical serrations on rear of slide. Has serrations on Commander hammer. Has serrations on safety and slide stop. The spring plug button is checkered. All parts are original. Finish is original. Fixed sights. I would rate the finish at 90%or better. Includes one 9 round original Colt magazine. The gun looks like it has never been holstered or disassembled.

I mite take a partial trade if its something I like.

This car is meant to be driven and that is what I do with it. I have had this car for 3 years and built the whole drive train. I am an ASE Master Certified tech and have both an automotive and motorsports degree, so it was built right.

I am asking $ 22,500 OBO or $ 15,000 obo without the engine and transmission, I offer this because the engine alone cost me 7k in just parts to build. ALL OFFERS CONSIDERED.

If you have never shot one, you are missing a great experience and piece of our military history. This carbine is an Inland. It is an original USGI with no import marks and came from CMP a few years back. It has a low 900K serial number so was made in early WWII. Stock is walnut and in good shape but shows it has been around.

I am selling it with 50-rds ammo, one 30-round magazines, and a carbine pouch with two-15 round magazines (15-round mags are loaded with ammo). It also includes the sling and oiler.

Will also make available to buyer additional 15- and 30-round magazines and several boxes of carbine ammo at very reasonable prices if desired.

I had no intent of selling any of my carbines but with the craziness in Colorado (proposed high-capacity mag ban, limitations on private sales, etc.), I figured here is a chance for someone to get a great piece of history and with 15- and 30-round magazines legally at a fair price.

If you are not familiar with the M1 Carbine, you should check them out. These are America’s first real a$$ault rifle. My favorite gun to shoot - they always go to the shooting range. The AKs and ARs are more intermittent.

Please send me a message if you have questions. Not interested in trades and price is firm. Thanks for considering."

The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. Ship with FFL"

It would be fine. It goes about an eighth too far. However if it is fed like a single shot

This is a sealed battle pack of 200 rounds of Hirtenberger Short Range Lead Free Ammo.  I have read many different stories on the ""net"" about it's original purpose.  Some say nuclear power plants, some say submarines, some say a gun range imported a ton of it because it didn't damage their backstop, etc. etc.
""Janes"" lists the ammo as the following: Frangible short-range ball: 1.8g bullet (that's 28grains) consists of approximately 80% copper and 20% plastic; MV 1,050 m/s; maximum range 750 m; effective range 180 m; specially designed to function in automatic weapons up to 600 rds/min; also available with primers free of heavy metal (lead, antimony, barium)
Anyone who tells you this is a training bullet is not reading the specs correctly because 1050 m/s is over 3000ft/sec and an effective range of 180 meters (about 200 yards) means it's lethal at that range.  In military terms, yes, that's short range for a rifle.
It's a brass case cartridge with a copper sabot wrapping a black plastic projectile with a truncated cone  I opened one of the battle packs and can show you what they look like, but will not open the sealed battle pack that is for sale.  If you want to open it on the spot after you pay for it, I will give you your money back if it's not 100% what I am advertising.  Comes in an olive drab vinyl battle pack with a built in carry handle.  I'm 90% certain the brass is reloadable.

IT IS NOT TRAINING AMMO ! !  I guarantee it is quite lethal and should never be fired at a live target.  Per the specs it's about the same weight as an ultra high velocity 22LR like CCI Stinger, but at about 1000ft/sec higher velocity.

This link has photos of someones packs and discusses the round.  They are not my photos but mine look identical with identical markings.  http://www.ar15.com/archive/topic.html?b=3&f=16&t=484961

It has a beautiful ""Collector GI"" walnut stock, which is a completely refinished M-14 stock. This stock retains the original US military M-14 acceptance cartouche on the left side near the receiver (photos 2 and 5). The stock is beautiful straight-grained, oiled black walnut (see photos) which retains the right hand cutout for the original M-14 selector switch (photo 6). Because the Seller is a novice photographer using bright indoor lighting, photos showing the stock make it appear lighter than it actually is in normal daylight. All metal parts are beautifully Parkerized. Note that the Collector GI walnut stock is no longer offered by Springfield, having been discontinued during the year 2000.

This rifle features: A new National Match (NM) premium air-gauged, 22 inch, medium weight, 1 in11 RH twist, 6 groove, carbon steel barrel; two stage match tuned trigger (4.5 - 5 lbs pull); NM .062"" military post front sight; .0520"" non-hooded aperture, adjustable GI Match Grade rear sight (one-half minute windage, 1 minute elevation); NM flash suppressor. The rifle retains the M-14 flip up butt plate to assist in proper rifle positioning when shooting prone. Being an M-14 stock, there is space within the buttstock for storage of cleaning gear, etc. Rifle accessories (some of which have been added by the Seller) include: Four new 20 round GI mags; new Third Generation Springfield M1A scope mount; new leather sling with integral hardware; copy of Springfield M1A Rifle Information Guide; copy of latest Springfield M1A Rifle Manual; gun lock; original box.

This 1994 ""Clinton Ban"" was in effect from Sept. 12, 1994 through Sept. 12, 2004, and has thus expired. Under current Federal law therefore, this rifle and magazines are fully legal for sale, purchase or possession by members of the public.

It has been enhanced with several $$$ added features. Springfield built this gun on a Springfield Series 70 frame and slide.

It has been Enhanced with a Wilson Combat (match) barrel with attached screw on compensator (also takes a suppressor or just a knurled thread protector) a Wilson bushing & link. Has S.S. Mag well, Target grips, Wilson Extended takedown and safety and an extended mag release button. Also has the Wilson two piece solid guide rod with spring and reverse rod holder.

This gun with the enhanced trigger group including combat hammer, has as nice of a trigger pull on it, as guns costing twice as much as I'm asking. I believe the series 70 frame and slide has something to do with that as well.

Slide and frame fit like a glove, and move as smooth as glass together, with no play or hesitation at all and makes the gun much more accurate than I am as a shooter. I would consider the overall finish as 98%+.

If you are looking for an easy shooting (reduced recoil because of the compensator) .45 for pleasure, tactical use, or to possibly get into a little competition, without a lot of investment, then this is the 1911 for you.

I already have (5) other .45's so I decided to sell this little treasure to someone that can do it justice.

May consider the following pistols as potential trade material with some added cash on your end, if they are in excellent LNIB condition:

The blue is worn off the gun, but is very slick and nice,it has no rust at all. I was told that the grips alone are rare and worth $300.00 and they are hard to find, especially not busted. These are perfect. This is a true collector's peice, and the fact that it functions perfect is a real bonus. A great peice of history... The pictures are very up close, the gun looks very good in person, there is no rust or roughness at all to the gun. It is very smooth and functions just like new. I need mostly cash for this gun, but I am open to a little trading for part of the money.Looking for extra ammo for 22lr, 40cal, 9mm, and 32 auto. Also if you have a little 22 auto cheap gun to through in, I would be interested in a little 22 auto, a Mosin-Nagant, a 22 lr, 12 gauge shot gun, and a few others. So please don't waist my time with other offers that want to gun for gun trade, because like I said..I need the money mostly, but am willing to take ONLY a partial trade. Thanks for your time"

888,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1228888,For Sale:  1942 Mosin Nagant - Beautiful!,"Southeast, Wichita, Kansas",$ 250,"Listed On: Wednesday, March 20, 2013",Rifles,no type,7.62x54R                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"I have a 1942 Mosin Nagant made in Izhevsk. It's a round receiver, war-time manufacture, which means the receiver was milled with less attention to finish. As a result, the more aesthetic features such as the ""low-wall"" milling and smooth finish were not performed in the interest of producing more rifles, more quickly, as the Soviets had that whole Nazi invasion thing to worry about.

Some people prefer the pre-war rifles because they're prettier, some people like the war-time rifles because they represent a response to a very specific threat. (Some even think the war-time rifles were built more sloppily, but there's no evidence to support that. Externally, superficially only, they aren't made to the same standard. They function every bit as well.)

Now you can run down to the local store and (provided they have them) pick up a virtually identical rifle for less. But that rifle will come caked in cosmoline. If you're not familiar with cosmoline and, more importantly, the chore of its removal, you're in for a real treat. And by treat I mean ""endeavor likely to prompt you to learn how to cuss fluently in Russian if you don't know how already."" It gets into every little nook, cranny, soaks into the stock... you name it.

And that's what sets this rifle apart. Pictures do not do it justice. It is cleaned up and ready for the dance. I've stripped it down to individual components, gone through and removed all the cosmoline, cleaned and lightly polished the chamber, checked the head space and it fully passes, reassembled and lightly oiled everything inside and out, and then just to be certain she was every bit the Russian beauty she was meant to be, I completely refinished the stock.

The reddish shellac they used to give these rifles their distinctive color is gone. I stained the wood back to the original color, then sealed it with polyurethane. Now we can see the beautiful grain of the stock. All the markings or ""cartouches"" are still there, I didn't touch them. I put a lot of effort into maintaining the character of this war horse - she's almost certainly seen battle in WW2 and it didn't seem right to erase the little dings and such she picked up along the way.

I'm willing to listen to offers, but don't try the ""my buddy saw this at a gun show for $150, can you do that?"" line. A: No he didn't. B: If by some stroke of luck you saw a Mosin for anything near that price it was caked with cosmoline and in who knows what kind of condition. Let me be clear: this rifle came out of a crate, just like any other, but it's not in that class anymore. She's ready to shoot and won't sweat cosmoline when you shoot it.

Comes with the tool kit (no canvas pouch) NUMBERS MATCHING bayonet (the rifle is also numbers-matching, but the magazine floorplate is a forced-match), but no sling. Yes, there's a sling on it in the picture, but that actually belongs to my ""main"" Mosin. I *might* part with it, but you'll have to talk me into that. Roll for charisma."

It is a marked +P+ round and will batter most semiautomatic pistols to death with continued use.
They are intended for use in Glock and other premium 9mm semi autos.

You don't see it around much anymore, but it is very effective. 

This ammunition is non-corrosive and is loaded with boxer primmed (re-loadable cases).
