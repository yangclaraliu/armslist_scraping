Now you have. This is the S&W Model 547. It is a heavy barrel, 9mm (9x19 luger) version of the legendary K-frame, 6-shot M&P revolver. S&W made 10,270 of these from 1980-1985; 6486 round with butt (and 3"" barrel), and 3784 with a square butt and 4"" barrel (as pictured below).   Supposedly, this was the most difficult-to-manufacture revolver that S&W ever made. 

This one is like new with the box with and cleaning kit (copy of owners manual), This is the scarce one with the square butt and the 4 inch heavy barrel there were 3784 made of these in the early to mid 80's. I am the second owner and I have not fired it and I was told by the first owner that it had a total of 6 rounds fired.

I was keeping this sweet revolver as an investment but with the new laws going in to effect soon I have decided to sell it and not pay a dealer consignment and other fees that would drive the price up for the buyer.

Fully serviced and shooting like a champion. The action is incredibly smooth, the head space is perfect and the bore is in great shape.

It has been stripped of cosmoline and given a light sanding. I have not yet replaced a finish on the rifle so it is still 'raw' Chu wood ready for the finish of your choice. This is without question one of the best Type 53's I have encountered to date. Like 99.99% of these encountered, there is no cleaning rod but any 30/30 cleaning kit will work just fine.

If you are a fan of the T-53's you'll know finding one with a stock and barrel in good shape is tough to do, add all matching numbers to that, add the matching numbered stock and you come up with a pretty uncommon piece to say the least.

My camera died last week and I have no way to take pics just now. All I can say is I know these models & this one is one any milsurp collector would be proud to own. 

Face to face trades only in Camdenton/Linn Creek. I live in a rural area so you will have the opportunity to shoot it a few times & see what you think.

They come with the magazine dust covers. They're new in sealed package. You get 5 of the next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HKÂ® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FNÂ® SCARâ¢ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.Â

This is not a ""plinker"" or a ""fun"" setup, this is a pretty serious setup meant for some pretty hard stuff. I have fired 0 (ZERO) rounds through this and have had no attachments put on it. I bought it and put it in my AR parts box.

 Shoot me an email if you are interested, looking for cash or possible trade, depends on what, shoot me an offer. Least I can say is no.

PLEASE - no personal checks or trades will be considered.  This price is actually $500 less than what I paid for all.

ITEM FOR SALE:  A virtually new (purchased last year - only 200 rounds fired) Rock River Arms Elite Comp custom ordered AR rifle.  This was not a stock model - rather it was ordered from Rock River Arms.  This is an exceptionally tight shooting model - a real tack driver.   If you want a superb tactical AR - then this model will hit all the right buttons.  Features a stainless barrel and bolt - along with a 1:9 twist.

Comes with the following (See attached photos for visual reference):

1.  Original Box and a black tactical carrying case that also holds 5 magazines.
2.  Five (5) - 30-round magazines
3.  Unique tactical forearm with various rails
4.  Muzzle Compensator (not your typical A2 suppressor)
5.  Command Arms Tactical Rear Adjustable stock with rails, various compartments and an adjustable cheek riser assembly.
6.  Bipod and a folding forward pistol grip.
7.  BSA Tactical Majestic 3-10X Scope with quick adjust finger adjustable elevation and windage knobs (no having to use a screwdriver or coin to make adjustments).  This is one accurate and highly durable scope.
8.  BCM Gunfighter Extended Charging Handle Assembly.
9.  Additional (removable) rear metal sight assemblies.

REASON FOR SELLING:  Over the past few months I've been cutting back on my collection.  As much as I hate to sell this beauty, I'm not doing much shooting anymore at all - so it's best that it belongs to somebody who can use it (and appreciate it).  

OTHER REQUIREMENTS:   

1.  I really prefer to sell this rifle locally and I will cover the cost of legally transferring ownership to the buyer at my local gun store - which is only 5 minutes from my home. 

2.  If the buyer is out of state, then buyer must assume all shipping costs up front and I will only ship to a confirmed authorized FFL Dealer to ensure full legal transfer.

BEST METHOD OF CONTACTING ME:  Just call me direct on my mobile, which is REDACTED anytime between 9 AM and 10 PM EST daily.   Ask for ""Ben.""

Now, for the serious buyers:

Up for sale is a Burris Fastfire II with working battery, tools (pictured allen wrench not included), hardware, seals, original box, and picatinny mount.  Also included in the package is a new and unused AR-F3 elevated shock mount that enables the user to co-witness the Fastfire II with iron sights.

The sight has only been used on a .22lr pistol, and (although it is robust enough for large calibers), never used on anything else.  It is in PERFECT, like new condition.

I'm only selling it because I recently sold a rifle that was intended as the mount for this sight.

Burris says:

FASTFIREâ¢ RED DOT REFLEX SIGHT

The FastFire Red Dot Reflex sight is the most versatile red dot sight on the market. Mount it on your favorite handgun, shotgun or hunting rifle for greater accuracy and faster target acquisition. You wonât need to worry about sight alignment, eye dominance or finding your target. Just put the red dot on your target and pull the trigger.

Compact and lightweight, the FastFire wonât affect the balance or handling, plus it offers unlimited eye relief, parallax-free 1x magnification and simple operation.

Choose from two models âthe FastFire II with its 4 MOA dot, or the new FastFire III with 3 MOA or 8 MOA dots. The FastFire III offers upgraded features such as windage and elevation adjustments that donât require a special tool; a convenient power button with three levels of brightness and an automatic brightness setting and battery access on the top of the sight making it easier to change batteries. Weâve also added a low battery warning indicator and see-through protective cap. 8 hour automatic shut off. FastFire III is not compatible wih the AR-F3 FastFire Mount (410348) or the Picatinny Protector Mount (410330).

Ideally suited for use on pistols and AR-15s where fast target acquisition is desired, the FastFire red dot sight will also match up well with carbines, lever guns and shotguns. Both the FastFire II and III are ruggedly designed, impervious to the elements and will hold up to years of punishing recoil. Youâll find a wide selection of mounts for either model that will fit on most popular shooting platforms.
Fastfire II Battery type - CR2032. 
Fastfire III Battery type - CR1632."

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

Features: Cold Hammer Forged Barrels M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver T-Marked Upper Receivers USGI 1/7 Twist Rates USGI 5.56 NATO Chambers Mil-Spec 11595E - Certified Barrel Steel (CMV) Chrome Lined Bore and Chamber Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sights USGI Government Profile Barrels HPT (High Pressure Test) Barrels MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) Barrels

Cold Hammer Forged Barrels This process of manufacturing barrels has been used for European small arms for generations, and it is gaining popularity in the United States because of the increased barrel life and outstanding accuracy of a hammer forged barrel. The BCM BFHâ¢ series of barrels are made right here in the USA! (Just like all the BCM products.)

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today's infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.

T-Marked Upper Receiver The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its' superior ballistics.

Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E) BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets its' additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960's was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.

5.56 NATO Chambers The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.

Government Barrel Profiles Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking."

I have 10 rounds through this rifle. I started off with a Billet POF Nitride Lower. It has the ambidexetrous bolt release. It has a standard Lower Parts Kit with the addition of KN anti-walk pins and a chromed DPMS fire selector. I did some white color fill as seen in photos. I attached a Hogue Pistol Grip. The Upper is a DPMS Flat top. I purchased a chrome bolt carrier assembly from Red X Arms. The Buffer is an Enidine Hydraulic style buffer device. I have a MagPul CTR 6 position collapsible stock on the buffer tube. I modified a regular charging handle with a ""tactical"" ambidexterous latch. I installed a GGG end plate with left and right side sling attachment points. The barrel is a 18"" DPMS SASS fluted barrel with a 1 in 10"" twist. The barrel extension does have M4 feedramps. The Muzzle Device at the end of the barrel is a JP Bennie Coolie. I added a JP Free Float handguard ready for whatever JP rails you want to attach. I put the included JP 4 slot rail on the top front of the handguard. I modified a Non-JP 7 slot rail to fit on the bottom. I am including the bipod. I used a low profile gas block for the midlength gas tube. I am also including three (3) 20 round MagPul magazines. I did have to modify the POF receiver takedown holes by slightly enlarging them for the after market ""Infidel"" takedown pins. The Upper and Lower are very tight when pivoting on the front takedown. The takedown pins are slightly ""loose"" when pulled into the open, pulled out position. Here is what happened at the range. The rifle loaded without issue from the magazine. I was NOT using a bipod and was utilizing the magazine as a ""monopod"" steadying device due to the rifle NOT being ""light"". After the 2nd shot the 3rd round failed to feed completely. It was then manually chambered properly and fired. Next round fed properly and fired. The next round, again the 3rd round in the series failed to feed properly. It too was chambered manually and fired without incident. This cycle continued once more. After discussing the issue with my fellow shooter we came to the conclusion that it was possible the magazine was ""rocking"" a little too much and might have caused the failure to feed on the 3rd round(s). I then fired the last single round, bringing total rounds shot to ten (10). I recommend anyone who purchases this rifle to have it inspected by a certified gunsmith. I am not a certified gunsmith, this is more of a hobby. Please do not hesitate to ask any pertinent questions. I am not interested in ANY trades.

I've owned all sorts of ""black rifles"" and I'll tell you what; I know what to look for when doing a build.  This build is off of a HD-16 (since people were gouging parts), but has only the highest quality parts that I had to scour the internet for.  Personally, I think this is my best build to date and I am rather proud of it.  Unfortunately, my girlfriend has a young child and she raised concerns about the AR-15 looking too much like a toy, so since it's the building part that I like, I figured I'd offer it to you guys. :)


Now, I know everyone's screaming ""The ban is dead! $500 for an AR!"", but that's simply not going to happen.  You can find cheaper rifles, yes, but their fit, finish, and over all quality are going to reflect that.  The market will take quite some time to get back to normal and I see ""custom"" rifles still selling for $1,400 and they're just stock black rifles with a new grip or buttstock.  This rifle has 18 modifications (the ones I remember) and they were installed with care and precision as this was going to be the build I kept.


I am asking $2,400 o.b.o. and I legitimately want you guys to shoot me offers, even if they're a good amount lower.  I'll also look at partial trades if you have pistols in 9mm, a full sized 1911 in .45 cal, or a Remington 700 or 870.  Seriously, it's not about the money (I HAVE to recover cost at least, though) it's about building the rifle and my girlfriend feeling safe.  Unlike the other rifles, unless you want optics, you won't have to add anything to this rifle; it's 100% finished.  Face to face and cash only.  Valid FL driver's lisence and bill of sale required.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me!  Have a good one!

I've owned all sorts of ""black rifles"" and I'll tell you what; I know what to look for when doing a build.  This build is off of a HD-16 (since people were gouging parts), but has only the highest quality parts that I had to scour the internet for.  Personally, I think this is my best build to date and I am rather proud of it.  Unfortunately, my girlfriend has a young child and she raised concerns about the AR-15 looking too much like a toy, so since it's the building part that I like, I figured I'd offer it to you guys. :)

Now, I know everyone's screaming ""The ban is dead! $500 for an AR!"", but that's simply not going to happen.  You can find cheaper rifles, yes, but their fit, finish, and over all quality are going to reflect that.  The market will take quite some time to get back to normal and I see ""custom"" rifles still selling for $1,400 and they're just stock black rifles with a new grip or buttstock.  This rifle has 18 modifications (the ones I remember) and they were installed with care and precision as this was going to be the build I kept.

I am asking $2,400 o.b.o. and I legitimately want you guys to shoot me offers, even if they're a good amount lower.  I'll also look at partial trades if you have pistols in 9mm, a full sized 1911 in .45 cal, or a Remington 700 or 870.  Seriously, it's not about the money (I HAVE to recover cost at least, though) it's about building the rifle and my girlfriend feeling safe.  Unlike the other rifles, unless you want optics, you won't have to add anything to this rifle; it's 100% finished.  Face to face and cash only.  Valid FL driver's lisence and bill of sale required.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me!  Have a good one!
