Buy your first AR15 then need to sell it to finance a build for a different one. That's why this one is for sale, I'm building a dream rig and I need the money for parts. This PSA AR15 is about 3 years old (you can call PSA and ask from the serial number if you want) and I have put a lot of furniture on it. It was originally a truck /hog gun so about 700 rounds from that and I'd say another 300 rounds from the range, so I'd guesstimate about 1,000 rounds have been out through her. If you add everything up it's about $330 in furniture, and that's before shipping and taxes. This is easily an $1,100.00 rifle. But that's unrealistic and I know better. I'm asking $950. If you'd like to strip the parts down and sell them individually to turn a profit, feel free, I just Don't have the time. Will only sell to current LEO, current military, or current CWP holder. ID and proof will be asked for so don't bother contacting me if you don't have the credentials. This is non negotiable.P.S.

I have the run of the mill $35 bi-pod with tilt lock as well as the nightforce 2.5-10x42 NXS with zero stop mounted with the ultra light titanium 30mm nightforce rings. It has never cared about the ammo for accuracy or reliability. This rifle has always been on point as well as reliable and well taken care of. I have a hard case for it as well. The second rifle is from Tac-ops, it is the X-Ray 51 with a titanium suppressor, need i say more...okay fine i will.It has a hot rod reminton 700 action that is at the top of its class. You might leave your wife for this rifle (cause it's that sexy) and ALWAYS consistent. ""I am not saying, I am just saying, thats all I'm saying."" It has a 18 inch barrel as well as a custom cut pelican hard case. It has a 5.5-22x56 nightforce scope that is mounted with the 30mm ultra light titanium nightforce rings. I have ran a lot of different cans on a lot of different gear and will stand by the statement that Mike at Tac-Ops know the trick to making a quiet rifle.The suppressor can be put on either rifle and does an amazing job. I am willing to negotiate with price as long as it is not ridiculous.

The Daewoo DR-200 is the civilian version of the Daewoo K2, the replacement rifle for the Colt M16, built in the Colt plant in South Korea. The DR-200 uses an AK-style long stroke gas piston and recoil spring, an FAL-style gas plug with three position gas adjustment, an AR-style bolt, and fixed ejector like the Stoner 63. The DR-200 has a unique rear sight that does both windage and elevation adjustment and a hooded tapered front sight post. The trigger group is similar to the AR with a crisp break and short reset. The overall balance of the rifle is quite good. The DR-200 uses AR15 magazines and takes down like a FN FAL, and with the precision manufacturing of an AR-15 has the dead nuts reliability of an AK. The DR-200 is both accurate (1 moa) and reliable and comes drilled and tapped for optics rails. This DR-200 was imported by Kimber of Oregon, is new and unfired, and in excellent condition having been stored in my gun safe for 32 years and cleaned/oiled regularly. Comes with 2 magazines. Daewoo K2 folding stock available. Price is $1200.00"

7 inch barrel length-compact isn’t the word haha
 
(Put a picture of it lying on a standard-sized pillow for size comparison)
 
*NOT to be confused with the “AK-Pistol” that’s CIA themselves manufacture in Florida that’s a basic knockoff to the Draco- this is an actual stamped Draco mini AK-47.
 
Fired exactly 30 times- fun shooter and surprisingly accurate with krinkov-style adjustable sights. A definite head turner at the range.
 
Comes with 3 30-round mags (1 steel & 2 p-mags)
 
Over 200+ rounds of ammo( good mix of brass cased, steel cased and berdan-primed)
 
 
$800 firm. It’s Sold out mostly everywhere (besides the occasional pawn shop turn-up) due to the importation limits on these yearly. Pawn shops are selling them without the original packaging and just 1 mag for the original retail cost so my price is extremely fair for everything included"
