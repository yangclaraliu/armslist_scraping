I managed to find (and pay too much) for a milspec 5.56 BCG and a Bravo company BCMGUNFIGHTER charging handle to finish the build.

I added a Magpul gen2 MBUS rear flip up sight so that you can have fun with this one whether you add optics or not.

Also comes with PSA foam lined shipping box.  

I just managed to purchase the last of the parts and get it together so it is brand new and has never been fired.   

If you need magazines, I recommend you sign up for the magpul boulder airlift.  If you need one right now with the purchase of the rifle, I would be willing to sell you a 30 round mag at additional cost.

I probably spent too much getting this one assembled after parts became hard to find, so I need to sell it to pay for all the other things that I have purchased over the past few months, since this isn't my only 16"" AR in 5.56.  

Sale will be FTF in a reasonably public place, and I would require picture ID showing Colorado residency, with preference to those with Conceal Carry permit or LEO.  And a statement that you are not prohibited from purchasing or owning a firearm.  Cash or USPS money order please."

This is the bill attempting to ban most semi-auto rifles and ""assault weapons"", various magazines, etc. ""Lack of support"" is code for knowing their bill was DOA and they didn't want to force any of their leftist colleagues to have to publicly vote on it.
As I stated in the past, REAL Democrats don't support unconstitutional gun-grab attempts, and the people proposing this BS aren’t real Democrats like we all know, they are socialist pigs. Every politician in Washington knows full well that a vote for ANY anti-gun legislation WILL cost them their seat in the next election. This is the exact outcome that we expected. I would have LOVED to see it go to a vote though... for nothing more than to out the few commies who would have supported it.
SO... if you went out and bought an AR or Mini-14 hoping to gouge someone to death on Armslist, you may as well learn to like your new rifle because the prices are now going to collapse in short order.
Ammo is a different story, it is going to take manufacturers more than a few months to catch back up, but at least the panic purchasing and hoarding should be over with now.
The only thing I want for Christmas now is a video of some of those people who are so hungry that they have to EAT the ammo they have been hoarding with the sole intention of gouging someone with it. You are despicable and I hope you lose half of your money on the scam you were running.
ME? I've been saving my money for when the price collapses on all these shiny new rifles that the hoarders bought to try and profit from. By summer, I should have a real nice selection of low-priced rifles to choose from.
Thanks gougers! I can't wait to buy your NIB rifle for 75% of retail."

Price Breakdown, it's a bargain.
Rifle at this time = $1200+
Ammo = $200+
Optics and mounts = $300+
Mags = $100+
22 Conversion kit = $150+
Misc Accessories = $150+
Total = $2100+
I'm asking 1900 or best offer, won't be able to buy any of this new, possibly for the next year due to shortages and huge backlogs of orders. So prices will remain high on the used guns. My price is very fair considering, it's practically what I paid when the items were available.

Rifle price 7 months back when I bought it was $900, so, either way, it's a bargain considering current prices and shortages.

Engineered with today’s big-game hunter in mind, the R-25 boasts some of the most advanced design features available in AR-style rifles. The 20"", chromoly free-floating, button-rifled barrel helps even the beginning marksman shoot tighter groups. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block increase rigidity, reduce weight and enhance barrel cooling. A recessed hunting muzzle crown aids accuracy as well. Much of the barrel is surrounded by a machined-aluminum forend tube. The R-25’s overall light weight and ergonomic design make handling it a joy. It points instinctively, and a receiver-length Picatinny rail atop the action accommodates your choice of optics or accessories. The clean-breaking, single-stage hunting trigger is factory set to 4-1/2 lbs. For concealment, the R-25 is covered in Mossy Oak® Treestand® camo. Includes a four-round magazine, making them legal for hunting in most states. Compatible with magazines and accessories that fit other AR-type rifles chambered for .308 Winchester-based cartridges.

This rifle is not picky about ammo at all. This rifle was built for accuracy and reliability and I have had no failures of any kind. This rifle comes with 1 butler creek 25 round steel lips mag and 1 ruger 10 round mag. A simmons 3-9x32 scope with quick detach riser. Also included is a beat up old tube fed marlin 22 from the 70's. I have no use for this old Marlin and its just taking up space so Im throwing it in with the 10/22 at NO EXTRA COST. THE 10/22 IS $900. THE MARLIN IS FREE.  Feel free to contact me for more pictures. I would be happy to meet any interested party at the range so that you can see for yourself how accurate this rifle is."

The enemy side is saying there will be no vote on the so-called ""assault weapons ban,"" but the reason for this is because that is not the ultimate aim for the establishment at this point (also, they are trying to get us to let down our guard by thinking we have won the fight when we have not yet). Instead, they want to register and track all our guns, including ""universal background checks"" for trades between private parties. ""Background checks"" are intended to lead to a gun registry, which is intended (eventually) to lead to ""confiscation"" when another ""crisis"" comes along and private citizens are no longer to be trusted, according to the elites, with the tools to defend themselves. And we see from the 20th century what gun confiscation can lead to in countries that go tyrannical.

I have 2 of these and have only fired rounds through the one I decided to keep. I love this gun and intended on keeping it but have since decided to start saving for an AR rather than keeping unfired versions of historical reproduction guns. The PPS-43C looks awesome, has a high capacity magazine, and fires a ridiculous round that is said to be armor piercing (7.62 x 25 Tokarev). From what I read, will also fire the 7.63 x 25 Mauser ammo. This gun has a folding stock but it is tack welded down so it is classified as a hand gun. You shouldn't break the welds unless you pay like $200 for a tax stamp to classify it as a short barreled rifle. I'd rather keep it as a pistol and have some money for ammo, myself. Anyways. Its a great pistol, is extremely accurate, is very easy to field strip and clean. I'm asking $500 for the pistol and 2 35 round magazines. I have 140 rounds available for 60 cents a round if interested. I also have about 200 rounds of 9mm ammo for 50 cents a round. I can meet in Knoxville, Lenoir City or possibly surrounding areas as long as we time it right. I travel to several counties daily for my job anyways. Face to face only, must have valid TN license. No felons. This won't let me upload pictures for some reason so I will email or text them upon request. Watch some videos on this gun and look at some pictures. Its really cool!
