This was purchased last month brand new from Sportsmans Warehouse here in Lexington. I intended for it to be my main carry weapon but I'm a 45ACP guy and can't let go of my XDs. In full disclosure this gun has had exactly 26 bullets down the chamber in one trip to the range at Bud's. It's as close to new as you'll find and this model seems to be sold out everywhere right now. Included with the gun are the original carrying case and factory 6rd mag as well as an additional factory 7rd mag (purchased from Bud's for $50) and a Crossbreed IWB Horsehide Mini Tuck holster ($80 and never used). This is the perfect setup for someone looking to carry an ultra compact 9mm pistol and comes with factory Sig Night Sites. I also have two additional 6rd factory magazines that I will sell with the gun for $45 each. Email or call/text REDACTED with any questions. Firm on the price as worst case I'll put it in my carry rotation or keep it in the safe for a rainy day.

From H&K:
A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.
Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls. 
The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.
During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.

Key Features:
•Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates
•MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessories
• Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
•Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life

this ad is for 1 new in the packaging magpul pmag generation 2 30 round ar 15 mags. i am shipping them free usps priority mail and i take money orders or paypal WITHOUT the 3% fees! Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE Window AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Window Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. It incorporates a transparent MagLevel window on either side of the body to provide the shooter with an approximate determination of ammunition remaining in the magazine at a glance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers (sold separately). Made in the USA. Specifications: Caliber: 223 Remington / 5.56x45mm NATO Capacity: 30-Rounds Body Material: Polymer Follower: 4-Way Anti-Tilt Spring: Stainless Steel w/Orange Ammo Indicator Coil Floorplate: Polymer, Removable Extras: MagLevel Window Additional Info: Impact/Dust Cover Not Included NOTE: While an Impact/Dust Cover is not included, the original Pmag dust cover is still compatible and can be clipped to the magazine's floorplate if purchased separately.

this ad is for 1 new in the packaging magpul pmag generation 2 30 round ar 15 mags. i am shipping them free usps priority mail and i take money orders or paypal WITHOUT the 3% fees! Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE Window AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Window Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. It incorporates a transparent MagLevel window on either side of the body to provide the shooter with an approximate determination of ammunition remaining in the magazine at a glance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers (sold separately). Made in the USA. Specifications: Caliber: 223 Remington / 5.56x45mm NATO Capacity: 30-Rounds Body Material: Polymer Follower: 4-Way Anti-Tilt Spring: Stainless Steel w/Orange Ammo Indicator Coil Floorplate: Polymer, Removable Extras: MagLevel Window Additional Info: Impact/Dust Cover Not Included NOTE: While an Impact/Dust Cover is not included, the original Pmag dust cover is still compatible and can be clipped to the magazine's floorplate if purchased separately. The dust covers for the new Pmag Gen M3 and MOE Pmag are NOT interchangeable."

If you are not experienced or able to take a good kick to the sholder, keep moving. This thing hits harder than a Mosin. I am selling/trading because it is difficult for me to enjoy this with my son and neices. I need a smaller gun to kick around at the range with them. I want a caliber that is smaller, or at a minimum has a recoil suppressent. I am open to most options. As far as cash, this is all about condition. Great condition. Very well maintained. Always stored inside and kept clean. Have just under 100 rounds, all surplus. Have (3) stripper clips, I know at least (1) has nazi Markings. History lesson - Nazi Police seized many of these guns and used them for their purposes. This rifle has marking that would suggest it has a storied past. 

Price is $375. You may feel this is high, but check out the quality and remember that C&R Rifles will be the last ones to be taken away so this gun is OBAMA Proof.

These were purchased by accident.  One was inserted in 5.56 AR 15, but not used for shooting.  The other two are BRAND NEW in packages.  One package ripped.  

Since the one has insert marks on the sides near the top from being installed once, I am calling it used.  It was never loaded.

Will ship lower 48 states where legal.  
Don't ask to buy if not legal in your state.   I have the latest listing of states, etc. banning these.
Shipping all three for $14.95 USPS priority mail. 

They are Ammunition Storage Components(ASC) Stainless Steel 30rd 5.45x39 caliber AR style magazines. They feature a black dry film finish and anti-tilt follower.

Sold as is, no warranties expressed or implied.  No returns accepted. 

Thanks for looking."

This non-expanding, deep-penetrating bullet has a lead core enclosed by a strong metal jacket. It provides smooth, reliable feeding in all types of semiautomatic handguns. All PMC cartridges must pass through rigorous inspection at an electronic powder check station. This station accurately measures the propellant charge in each round. If the propellant in any cartridge varies by just two tenths of one grain, the system stops and that cartridge is discarded. Few other ammunition manufacturers can truthfully assure you greater uniformity and reliability.

No other Accessories come with this besides what comes from the factory.  Local pickup only...willing to drive but will be added to price and require non refundable deposit

This is very powerful ammo for .22lr. It has 140ftlbs energy at the muzzle and still have 92ftlbs left at 100 yards! Most standard velocity .22lr doesn't have 92ftlbs of energy at the muzzle, this is awesomely powerful and fairly rare ammunition.

Emergency necessitates the sale of this ammo. Don't like my price? Don't buy it. I wish I didn't have to sell it as (I have read several places) the major ammo manufacturers are not making .22lr due to the huge contracts w the gov't for center fire rifle and pistol ammo. There is more profit in center fire for the manufacturers, so when and if the .22lr becomes available again is anyone's guess."

Actual Police Ballistic Vest Bullet proof - $1000 (80134)
Used for only 3 months, no damage or blemishes. I am looking to either sell or trade my Police Department Ballistic / Bulletproof Vest. I purchased this vest and received it in December of 2011. I used the vest from January 27th to April 24th, just shy of 3 months total use. Due to physical injuries(not while wearing vest), I resigned and no longer work with any departments. The vest is flawless in condition, no tears, and very little use in total. It has been kept in a ballistic armor plastic hard case and left untouched since April, kept away from moisture and other degrading conditions. This vest is normally not available to civilians, and is sold only Police/EMT/Fire/Military. I am selling to whomever is interested with cash, as I am no longer in a Department due to medical condition. The specs are as follows:

Diamondback Tactical N-Force MH34-06 vest is certified to ISO 9001/2008 and tested against NIJ Standard-0101.06, the N-Force is a robust, special threat tested armor package that balances performance and comfort for daily wear. This N-Force is a level IIIA (male) and is customized in a Dynamic carrier. The Dynamic carrier enhances the comfort of the N-Force with added adjustability for an optional 5"" X 8"" and currently comes with 7"" X 9"" dual plate pocket with an actual 7"" x 9"" KAP plate inserted.

Standard threat protection of vest itself is .357 Sig V50 @1854 FPS, and .357 Mag V50@ 1660 FPS with an area density of .85 lb / ft squared, and is a whopping 3/8 inch of thickness for a ""concealable vest"" your are talking a vest that is concealable with the protection of a normally overt vest.

NIJ standards provide safety in the face of 9mm 124 gr, FMJ RN / .357 Mag 158gr, JSP / .357 SIG 125 gr, FMJ FN / .44 Mag 240 gr, SJHP / .357 SIG SPEER 125 gr, GDHP / .40 S&W SPEER 165 gr, GDHP / 9mm Aquila 65 gr, HP / 9mm GECO124 gr, FMJ / 9mm WIN Ranger 127 gr, SXT HP / 9mm S&B 115 gr, FMJ / 7.62X25 Tokarev FMJ L

This armor also meets DEA protocol for 9mm 124 gr, FMJ / .40 S&W, 165 gr, GDHP / 9mm 127 gr, +P+ WIN SXT Fragmentation tested in accordance to USASOC MIL-STD-662F:2 gr , 4 gr , 16 gr , 64 gr RC

The 7"" x 9"" KAP(kick ass plate) I am including offers more protection, turning the vest into a THREAT LEVELLevel III!(Better protection that IIIA) WEIGHT/THICKNESS is 4.3 lbs (1.95 kgs) REC; 1.0 inches (25.4 mm) / COMPOSITE is Proprietary ceramic-infused technology with mil-tuff finish / THREATS&SPECIAL THREATS protects against
7.62mm X 51mm (NATO) at 2800 fps
7.62mm X 39mm (AK47 MSC) at 2400 fps;
5.56mm X 45mm (SS109 Green Tip and M193Ball) at 3300 fps

Not sure if the warranty transfers but it is normally a 5 year warranty, extremely well made vest.

Vest was $847.23 and KAP plate was $133.77, totalling $981 dollars, the case I will include was $100.00. I also have an actual vest hangar for the closet which was $20.00. That's a total value of $1101!.

Note to interested parties: This vest is not normally sold to regular civilians. This is only sold to Police/Fire/EMT/and Military personnel. This is NOT your run of the mill ballistic vest and even provides protection against stabs in case you work corrections or other dangerous jobs. You are responsible for verifying legality of use, and abiding by local laws. I offer no warranty and this setup is sold as is.

Serious offers only, I will not respond to low offers/begging/scams.

Size information. The front panel of the vest is approximately 19x13, the back panel is approximately 18x15. It is cut to allow over-flapping from front to rear for added protection. While it is adjustable for 2-4 inches in length and width, as a median measurement I am 5'10"", at 200 pounds, with a 44 inch chest area and at the base of the base approximately 37 inches. There is no traditional size in the sense that the vest has more of a fitment based on customized sizes that allows for give of 10-15 pounds either way (humorous in the thought that this is police based equipment). I also forgot to mention that it comes with two outer coverings. This means that one has under three months of use and the other is brand new, never used. This allows you to wash one after some use and swap to another to prevent odor. Simply another bonus. Most vests have lasted around 5-7 years on average, this vest has a complete additional set of covering and straps, including redundant over under strapping for comfort and stability. Feel free to PM me if you have any other questions or are interested in the vest, and always open to other trade offers within reason. 

Final Note: I am NOT a police officer."

Century is pleased to be the new importer for the Grand Power line of pistols! These awesome handguns are jam-packed with all the features you need and want in a modern handgun. Grand Power pistols are all made on 4140 steel reinforced polymer frames with a significant design emphasis on ergonomics and ease of function. Each pistol has an integral Picatinny rail in the frame and comes with four interchangeable backstraps, so it is like having a handgun that is custom made for you! Attention southpaws! Each pistol is fully ambidextrous, the slide lock, mag. release and safety are fully functional on both sides of the frame - right out of the box - no modifications required! All of the barrels are high quality stainless steel and use a patented rotating lock, rather than tilting, during cycling for super smooth work at the range. The trigger has a very short reset, so accurate and fast follow-up shots are a breeze. The slide and the steel reinforcing in the frame is finished by nitrocarburizing. This creates a deep, matte non-reflective finish that is actually as hard as tool steel, for unsurpassed ruggedness. Used by the Slovakia military = where there is no shortage of quality locally made sidearms from the former Czechoslovakia - Grand Power pistols were put through, and passed with flying colors, incredible torture tests that other internationally famous brands failed miserably. Such as 100,000 rounds without any changes in critical dimensions. 20,000 consecutive rounds without any feeding failures. And a silicone dust, wind chamber test (think desert sandstorm) that ground the competition to a halt - literally. Attractive, tough, comfortable to use and light weight to carry, Grand Power makes a pistol that you will be proud to own for years to come. Whether it's the full size K100 Mk7, the compact P1 MK7, or the sub compact P11 MK7, Grand Power makes a pistol that's just right for you!
The P1 Mk7 is a shorter, compact version of the K100 using the same Mk7 frame and also made in the Slovak Republic by Grand Power. The P1 has a shorter slide and barrel making it the perfect choice for concealed carry. Like its full size brother, the P1 also comes with four easily interchangeable grip backstraps that ensure a comfortable ergonomic grip for almost any user! Comes with two 16 rd. mags. and plastic case. Barrel: 3.66"", Overall: 7.38"", Weight: 1.71 lbs. Not available for sale in CA; DC; HI; MA; Cook County, IL or where prohibited by law. Comes with a 1 year manufacturer's warranty! Condition: New.

I love carrying my glock but it's just too heavy and bulky, I want something that is light-weight and easy to conceal. The raven is ideal for this but I want something that shoots a bigger round i.e. .380 or 9mm or 38 special.

I will give both or just one depending on your offer. The raven does have a lot of holster wear but fires as it should and does exactly what it was intended to do. The 12 guage looks great and functions great. I will text you pics. if interested. You can contact me at REDACTED, text only please as I normally do not answer numbers that I don't know. Thank you."

$750 is the lowest price I could find for it new and it's out of stock.  See specs here:  http://www.natchezss.com/product.cfm?contentID=productDetail&prodID=LU66565

I'm looking for a scope with MilDot reticle or varmint reticle with lower power with an equal or greater retail price for an even swap.  Also, if someone had a scope for trade worth much more than mine, I would add cash."
