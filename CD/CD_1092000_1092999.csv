159,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1092159,For Sale/Trade:  Supercharged BMW 3 Series,"NW, Airport, Greensboro, North Carolina",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 19, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Want to go fast with style and comfort, here’s your chance. Up for possible sale/trade is my supercharged BMW. Yeah, it’s a blower car and a blast to drive. It’s not quite an E46 M3, but extremely close and a lot cheaper. The car is in extremely good condition and was tastefully built and very well cared for by adults. It’s my second car which I drive when I don’t feel like driving the soccer Dad wagon or just feel like having fun. 

I've been thinking of putting the supercharger on my wagon but thought I would see if anyone wanted to do some trading before I did so. The car can be available without the supercharger as well making it a very good condition and quick playtoy.

It’s the perfect mid-life crisis opportunity for us older guys allowing you to trade some things that the wife probably hates anyway. Now you can get something you want without her knowing what it actually cost and demanding a new kitchen because you spent $20k on an M3 or M5. On a good day, you might even get lucky because she’s so happy you got rid of some of the guns she hates. 

If you wanted more than the rated 320hp, you could easily get in the 400hp range with a few additions such as installing high flow headers and removing the pre-mufflers, front mount intercooler and smaller supercharger pulley. Can still be a DD or a track beast when you feel the need, the need for speed without a slightly agitated law enforcement official informing you that doubling or tripling the speed limit is frowned upon. 

To clarify a couple of things up front since I’ve owned and sold numerous high end performance cars:
1. The car has been paid for since the day I bought it with the title in my safe (I don’t need to sell it)
2. Did I mention that I don’t need to sell it
3. This is a cash car meaning you can’t get a car loan for near its value due to age
4. If you don’t have thousands in cash, can get a personal loan for thousands from your bank or have thousands of dollars in cash and/or tradables, you can’t afford it. Don’t waste your time or especially mine
5. I’ll take you for a test ride to help determine its value to you once I believe you’re serious.
6. *Absolutely* no test drives unless the agreed upon cash/trades are present when I hand you the key. I’m old school so if you break it or wreck it, you bought it; no questions
7. In case you forgot, I don’t need to sell it

--- Now that we've had the dreamer disclosure, on to the car itself ---
Year: 1999 
Model: 328i (2.8l inline 6)
Exterior: Titan Silver (8/10)
Interior:  Black leather (9/10)
Trans: 5-speed
Trim: 4 door sedan
Miles: 226,xxx but you would never know by looking at or driving it (I’m OCD about cars and would swear it had half the miles)

--- Very recent work: ---
- It had a bad rear wheel bearing so I upgraded the entire rear end with heavier duty 330i parts; 3.46 rear differential (stock 2.93 is included), trailing arms with larger wheel bearings, sway bar, axles and larger brakes with new pads.
- 2 new front fender liners
- K&N air filter service at last oil change

--- Current needs (that I haven’t gotten to yet): ---
Depending on the buyer and deal, I can have these done prior to delivery since I would do them anyway as needed maintenance
- Valve cover gasket seeps like they all do in time
- Power steering hose leaks like they all do in time
- Right front control arm bushing worn so I have an entire front suspension kit on order including control arms, bushings, tie rods, and ball joints. The only parts not included are the sway bar links and the upper strut mounts.
- Shifter bushings/pins are likely worn or the shifter height adjustment loosened up (3rd and 5th gates are tricky to find at times)
- The Carbon vinyl wrap on console trim surrounding the shifter boot needs to be replaced (I have some extra)

--- Mods and goodies: ---
- Active Autowerk Stage 1 supercharger kit with 7000 rpm redline/limiter and top speed limiter delete 
- Driveshaft center support replaced
- Headliner upholstery sagged a little (common) and was replaced with a new headliner
- Steering wheel showed some wear and was replaced with a new one
- VANOS seals replaced
- ZHP front bumper upgrade
- Professionally tinted with UV film on all glass (interior stays cool in Summer and glare is substantially reduced)
- Remus cat-back exhaust 
- UUC Short Shifter
- Weighted BMW M-sport knob
- Koni FSD shocks (nearly new)
- Eibach sport springs
- Larger 330i front/rear sway bars
- 18"" CSL replica wheels w/ Continental DWS tires
- M3-style trunk lip spoiler
- Clear euro tail lights
- Smoked euro front turn signals (1 is cracked arghh!)
- HID headlights w/ halogen angel eyes (wrapped with clear vinyl to protect from stones and scratches)
- Carbon vinyl wrapped interior trim
- Pioneer Avic Z1 in-dash touch screen with DVD, aux A/V inputs, built in 30GB hard drive, blue tooth phone, iPod connection, steering wheel control integration, navigation (quit working a couple of years ago. May be a connection or the antenna but haven’t bothered since I use the phone GPS anyway)

--- Extra parts available for the serious buyer ---
- 19” Beyern Mesh wheels and Nitto 555 summer tires
- Factory grey seats and door panel inserts (was thinking of doing two tone seats and door panels with factory leather)
- Lots of other trim, seals, switches, ect for OCD purposes or when something fails including 3 window regulators"

Scope mount included. Here are the specs:

The AK-54R rifles are built upon Category 1 (nice, minty, un issued) Romanian PSL rifle parts kits, using a special receiver that allows for the use of regular AKM type butt stocks and pistol grips. They also feature a correct, and fully functional, scope mount, installed on the left side of the receiver . The barrel is shortened to 16.5 inches, and is re-profiled, allowing the gas block and handguard retainer to be moved rearward, so that standard AKM length gas pistons (we use a Tapco stainless unit, which provides an extra 922r compliance part) and standard AKM type handguards can be used! The idea is simply to give the end user an AKM sized package that delivers the powerful punch of the 7.62x54R cartridge. This initial batch of rifles will feature a non-pinned Romanian PSL muzzle device, on 14x1 LH threads, K-VAR synthetic furniture, in plum, beautiful gun kote finish . 

These are very hard to come by. Plus the ammo is still affordable. I can add ammo for the right deal. More pics upon request. Thanks!"

The original owner purchased this rifle in the early 60s to go hunting in Alaska.  He took it to a Colorado Springs gunsmith to have a muzzle brake installed, but there was some discussion about installing a muzzle brake on the original barrel of this rifle.  The gunsmith was also concerned that the original Winchester stock might not be strong enough to absorb the recoil of the new 338 caliber. 

It was finally decided to install a new 338 Winchester barrel on the original Winchester action, add a muzzle brake and fit it into a new Winchester synthetic stock. This is the current configuration, but the original stock and barrel are included in this sale if the buyer wants to restore the rifle back to original.

Leupold 2-7 Vari-X II scope and rings available for $200 extra – original mount will stay on the rifle with or without the scope.

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Norinco SKS with an ATI collapsable stock, original 10rd mag, 2-30 rd mags, 200 rds of ammo, original stock and sling. Milled receiver, pinned barrel, blued bolt cover, very clean, you won't find a speck of rust. All numbers match. Imported by ACT III. Early model. 
The stock has 3 short picatinny rails, I put 3 knights armorment rail covers on them as a grip, but a bipod would go sexy on there. Also, it has a 4x28 scope. I don't have a clue who makes it, my guess is that its original. 

2 M40 gas masks. All new parts. 2 new sealed filters for each mask. Mask carriers. Clear and dark eye lens covers. And 2 voice amplifiers. ( hooks on the front of the mask so the other person can hear you talk. Takes a 9v battery) I didn't get a pic of those. 

Chem/bio resistant camelbak. This model allows the user to drink with the gas mask on. Adapter included. Also, the special bladder and hose is resistant to chemical and biological agents. 

Also in the deal, a used Second Chance level IIA bulletproof vest. Its a medium. Its used, but still keeps the lead out. And no I'm not willing to demonstrate its capabilities. 

I feel this is a decent deal for a plane Jane AR-15. If I need to sweeten the deal, let me know, I have more gear to trade. A good trade is when both parties walk away happy, so hit me up and see where it goes."

Brand new premium Upper..! Specifications: Barrel, Forged, Hammer (BFH)

Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired. These do not include bolt carrier groups, charging handles or handguards.

BCM barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistant with these quality control procedures.

Cold Hammer Forged Barrels
This process of manufacturing barrels has been used for European small arms for generations, and it is gaining popularity in the United States because of the increased barrel life and outstanding accuracy of a hammer forged barrel. The BCM BFH series of barrels are made right here in the USA! (Just like all the BCM products.)

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.

T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.

Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E)
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.

5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.

Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking.

This is some of the most difficult ammo to find in the country, and rightly so.  For its exceptional accuracy, expansion, and weight retention/penetration through barriers, the FBI and numerous LE agencies use this as their standard round. I bought this ammo in 2010 for a pistol that I never bought, and am selling to help pay for a wedding.

I am located in San Diego and willing to do FFL transfer as far north as Oceanside.  Here is a review from Police Link dot com: The Winchester-produced Model 1300 Defender series of shotguns is derrived from the base Winchester Model 1300 that first appeared in 1978. The Model 1300-series itself features roughly twelve different models including the Model 1300 Black Shadow Deer Combo and the Model 1300 Ranger Deer. The Model 1300 Defender, which is billed to effectively handle 'security situations' can fire both rifled and buckshot slugs from a pump-action 7-shot tubular magazine system. The slide-action system is also billed as the fastest operating system available to any shotgun of this type. The surface construction of the weapon system is coated with a non-glare finish and is made of steel and composite materials. The Defender is available in 12 and 20 gauge. Combat models include the Model 1300 Police, Slug Hunter, Marine and Stainless Security. A removable TRUGLO fiber-optic sight is available. Due to its high magazine capacity and shorter than normal barrel length, the Defender and its related types of shotguns are banned for use in some European countries."

Was considering a trade for Russian AK, but would be wiser for me to sell them outright right now.  Medical bills and stuff.  However, all fair offers considered.

Complete PSA forged multi-cal lower with Del-ton upper with Del-ton bcg. Bcg is really nice parkerized and chrome lined. Stamped m and hpt for high pressure tested and magnetic particle tested. Upper is flat top rail mid length carbine with forward assist and front sight post. 1:9 twist. Perfect condition, never fired, brand new.

I also have a short length m4 type carbine from Palmetto State Armory. Comes with multi-cal forged lower, the 1:7 twist barrel, flat top upper rail with forward assist. R-Guns BCG included (that's actually what PSA sells them with nowadays); it's parkerized and chrome-lined milspec. Mint, never fired, brand new.

Both rifles are all Milspec, brand new, never fired, top quality. Serious offers only please. Thanks.

Asking 1250 or best offer for either rifle.  Will actually sell both rifles for 2300 if you want both of them.

Cash or Paypal accepted (you can pay with your credit card with paypal).  If you pay with paypal, consider that fee will be negotiated into price.

Also, for those of you who say these prices are crazy, look at what they are going for on gunbroker and other sites.  Right now, I could part these rifles out on gunbroker like this: BCG 300 bucks, complete lower 400 bucks, Complete Upper 550.  That's a 1250 dollar rifle. I'd rather sell as complete rifle as it's a lot less hassle and I know how hard it is to get some parts right now (just try and buy a bolt carrier group anywhere right now, you can't).  Thanks."

Per my time in the US Marine Corps I will be more than happy to teach you how to effectively and safely use your AR, as well as how to properly maintain it.
The course will go as long as needed by the individual student (up to 8 hours), and covers the following in order:
1) Nomenclature, fieldstripping, and proper maintenance procedures
2) Effective ranges, sight usage, and proper shooting fundamentals as well as combat mindset
3) Basic hand to hand combat techniques and dealing with jams
4) Legalities
5) Live fire practical application (optional)

By the end of this course you should be able to: field strip, clean, and lubricate your AR; properly use iron sights and other optics; use proper shooting fundamentals and techniques to fire with accuracy; know and perform basic hand to hand techniques using your AR; basic techniques to deal with jams; have an idea of your combat mindset and levels of force; and much more!

PLEASE READ! Do note that while I am offering this course I will screen any and all potential students beforehand, and if I do not feel warm and fuzzy with teaching any student: I have the right to refuse to teach that student this course! This is effective from the prescreening to any time in the course. Teaching bad guys isn't my style; never was and never will be. 
This course is made especially for those who intend to use their ARs as a home/self defense tool as well as a fun gun to plink with at the local range.


Since I am also a full-time college student the best day that I can do classes is on Sundays. I cannot do any live-fire during the course until a local range opens up on the weekends again which likely won't be for another month or two. Until then I'm open to doing the course without live fire. Also: ammunition is to be paid for at your own expense, especially if it's an oddball caliber (6.5 Grendel for instance). AR15 ammo in general (5.56mm and .223 Rem) is pretty hard to find and between my college schedule and everything else I do I simply don't have the time to go find ammunition for you (however I can provide online sources where I've last seen ammo for under $1 per round). I apologize for this and hopefully things will get better and ammo availability will be somewhat back to normal in the future without gouged prices."
