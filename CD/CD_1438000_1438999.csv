They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below.

Face to face only. Trade only. Prefer to Meet in Auburn or Montgomery or close to Auburn, but will make exceptions.

They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

Just trying to trim down a little. 

It's surprising this statement is necessary but I guess it is……I had this pistol sold recently but the deal fell through at the last minute because the buyer didn't know the law or I was being set up. Regardless, my time was wasted. It’s ok to not know. I’d just suggest educating yourself one way or another before trying to buy a weapon. 
~ If you transact a private party sell across state lines and are caught & convicted- it is a felony. According to the law- private party transactions should only happen inside the state for which you live. Secondly, if you get the buyer to come off the price- it's not always smart to suggest they drive an hour to meet you (that part is OP ED). 

Bottom line is, this is a fantastic weapon. I love the GLOCK 30. In my opinion, in an urban combat situation where concealment, high capacity & functionality is required- there's not a better pistol available at this price point. If you've ever owned a GLOCK, you know they function clean or dirty/ wet or dry and with pretty much any kind of ammo. Also- there's a TON of accessories.
I have a standing offer of $525 from a guy locally that I’ve done business with before. Good luck"

This platform is very reliable and accurate. It is currently zeroed’ at 325 yards with ballistics for the 690 grain summit ammo attached to the side. Range, dial and shoot. We actually hit a small can of tannerite at this distance (the size of a bean can) confirming the zero. The scope and 30 moa mount will get you over 2000 yards –w/the 690 grain summit- if you post up on the mil-dots. 
Included in the purchase is 90 rounds of aforementioned summit 690gr. and 10 rounds of fedral, 618 gr tracer ammo for fun. Valued at over $500 alon. Ammo can, 50 brass casings,  Air lock pelican case, cleaning supplies also included.

Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.

This gun was made in the mid 90s and is an ex-Swiss law-enforcement weapon. It was once issued to an officer of their State Police or Highway Patrol. The slide is the heavier milled stainless steel part instead of the earlier stamped one, and has the Swiss canton regional crest(Vaud) on the left side. Since it was an issued weapon there is some finish wear, but this doesn't affect anything. In fact I think it gives the gun some character. This gun was made in 1996 so it avoids the problems that some newer post-2004 Sigs have with QC. It was made at a time when Sig made nothing but the best.

With the pistol comes 5 high capacity mags: 3 factory 15-rounders(including one '94 Ban-era 'zipper-back'), a new Mec/Gar 17-rounder, and a Mec/Gar 20 round mag. If you are left-handed I will include a kydex OWB holster by Shadow Holsters of Minnesota. Ammo in the mag pic not included."

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Our Exclusive ArmorLokt™ process seal the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in."

Laser is spot on from the factory. Six shots fired, six dead on hits. Laser has solid and strobe capabilities. Gun features an easy break down system, slide lock, iron sites, and laser. It is absolutely perfect for concealed carry. The only reason i am consodering trading it is because i have a syrong itch for a larger caliber semi auto with night sites and a match batrel. So i want to trade for that or something that i can easily put night sites on or drop a match barrel in, such as glock, Xdm, or M&P. O alsoa looking for a CZ75b because i miss mine. I am the original owner.
Face to face only. Trade only. Prefer to Meet in Auburn or Montgomery or close to Auburn, but will make exceptions.
I love this gun, so I dont want to sell. But if you make me a strong cash offer on it, I may take it just to get something else. I am mostly Just seeing what I get offered for trades."

This is the least I will take for 2100 I have invested! So again please do not try and insult my level of intelligence as I know what I have and what it is worth,aswell the value and worth~ I am NOT out to be like the others in the GUN Community. Just an Honest sale of my rifle! I could sell the Ammo and Mags and make nearly half as much as I am presntly asking for what ALL comes with this weapon! I will be doing a Bill of Sale as well asking for Copy of your State ID etc. 

I am not being like those ""GOUGERS"" that are asking 3000 to 2700 for them! Although I do have 2100.00 invested!! The Ammo comes with it and as per the Ammo it is the 1080 count tin and is opened but never shot any of it as our local range does not allow FMJ! Then I have 9 boxes of the Wolf WPA Polyformance Ammo 5.45x39 55 grain HP left ,and 30 to a box so that is 370 of those. I only used to of those boxes so 60 rounds instead of 40. So the rifle has been shot 60 times now and sighted well at 50 and 75 yards so far. I have the bullet Trunion guide so you can use the standard AK 74 mags in it and not JUST the Arsenal/Saiga ones. I have 6 Tapco 30 round Mags and then 4 factory 10 round Mags that come with it. So it will  shoot ALL forms of AK 74 mags! 

Bought Rifle, Scope ,Scope bracket,All Ammo,Trunion Bullet Guide Kit,Muzzle Break,Lifetime Nylon Sling,Higher quality Sling Brackets,6-Tapco 30 rnd Mags, 2 10rnd Tapco Mags and of course it came with one factory 10 rounder,and the extended mag release button!

Model TA01NSN-RMR
Trijicon 4x32 ACOG Riflescope with Center Illuminated Amber Crosshair and 4.0 MOA RMR Sight TA01NSN-RMR combines the technology of the battle-tested Trijicon ACOG 4x32 gun sight with the 4.0 MOA Trijicon RMR red dot sightimage. This Trijicon Riflescope provides the shooter with the option of quick acquisition close range sighting with the Trijicon RMR sight and the precision for longer range shooting with the Trijicon ACOG 4x32mm Scope. This ability to adjust to tactical situations gives the user the needed edge when the lives are on the line and success is the only acceptable outcome. The ranging reticle allows for bullet drop compensation out to 600 meters without any manual adjustments. The reticle will appear black during the daytime and will glow amber in the dark, thanks to Trijicon's patented tritium illumination.

Riflescopes by Trijicon from ACOG series equipped with BAC allow use of the both-eyes-open aiming method along with scope magnification sighting for rapid target acquisition - in any light. Trijicon scope has maximum eye-relief for larger caliber rifles and large exit pupil for faster target acquisition. Multi-coated lenses provide superior clarity and light gathering capabilities with zero distortion. Aiming reticle glows in low-light conditions for quick target acquisition. Lamp is guaranteed to illuminate up to 15 years

Beretta 96A1 Semi-Auto .40 S&W 4.9"" 12Rds Synthetic Grips Black Finish. The Model 96A1 represents Beretta's evolution of the world famous 92FS pistol. Combining the best elements of the 92FS this pistol features a higher magazine capacity and is completely interchangeable with any other 92 family magazine. The A1's frame includes an integral Mil-Std 1913 rail for attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. Internal recoil buffer increases service life by reducing stress on the receiver. The single one piece captive recoil spring assembly simplifies the assembly and disassembly process and minimizes the possibility of spring loss. Three magazines included per pistol.

The body is designed with a constant-curve inside dimension and a self-lubricating follower for reliable feeding. The textured magazine body and flared floorplate improve handling over standard magazines. The snap-on impact cover protects the feed lips from impacts and debris while in storage. The impact cover also allows loaded magazines to be stored long-term (over 1 year) without compromising the integrity of the feed lips.

I'm the original owner, purchased about 20 years ago. Gun is in good shape. Includes 2 factory 13 rd mags and a Blackhawk Serpa paddle holster. Also has night sights, but they were installed so long ago, its pretty faded now so not really a factory in my asking price. The gun has also been compensated. I don't believe I've put more than 500 rounds through this gun, so barely broke in.

The lower is a Special Forces commemorative made by US Autoweapons. The lower has the Special Forces logo engraved and is black anodized aluminum.

 CONDITION: Factory new, in factory box.  (I bought this to convert to .458 SOCOM, but found a .458 SOCOM rifle)
