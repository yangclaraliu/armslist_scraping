Beretta JS92F300M 92 FS Inox 9mm 4.9"" 15+1 Syn Grip Bruniton Black

The 92 series of semi-automatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed
blowback system, which yields faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and
greater reliability. Double/single action provides a very safe and time
proven design and the open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove
piping, allowing one cartridge at a time to be loadedshould the  magazine
be lost or damaged. A reversible magazine release is positioned next to the
trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid
reloading. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as
well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat
muzzle crown to protect the rifling. The most tested and trusted personal
defense weapon in history, the 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military,
meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines. These models were
made in Italy.

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. 

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

Marked, United States Property and M 1911 A1 U.S. Army on the right side. An exceptionally nice example of this iconic WWII sidearm!! Finish about 98+ - 99% original Parkerizing. The muzzle and the sharp edges have some very slight silvering and the common scratch from the take down lever and that's it. There is no rust or pitting anywhere. The grip straps have no graying. All parts match and are correct for the gun. The grips are in great condition. The bore is razor sharp and mirror bright showing little if any use. The slide and frame are ""p"" proofed along with an Ordinance stamp and the FJA inspectors mark. There is one correct magazine included with the gun.  This weapon was made with NEW tooling in 1944, the Browning way, with the proper tolerances, which means reliable and acurate. Todays tooling have tighter tolerances in their specification. This is why todays 1911s' have multiple FTF, FTE and are not reliable. They must be modified or customized to be reliable. However you can trust this guns' reliability to go bang EVERY TIME without issues. ALL 1911 parts fit, no matter who makes them, or when they were made and the gun will still go bang when you pull the trigger, every time. All 1911 magazines work no matter who makes them or when they were made, again, with no FTF or FTE. You couldnt ask for more than that. The only other gun in todays world that has that kind of reliability is the one made in austria; thats why more people trade for them and companies copy them. They go bang every time without issues when you pull the trigger. I know, I own many.   Dont own a copy, own the original. This is a real value..... $2395.00.   I will entertain all fair offers from serious inquires. You will need to have a current blue card or ccw, if not, transfer to be done at a METRO station.  :)"

This rifle is basically new. I've only fired around 100rnds through her. I bought it in early 2012 and its been sitting in the safe and only brought out to clean. This was built from a 1980s Romanian kit. It was installed with a NODAK receiver and a new chrome lined barrel. I also had the builder install a Tapco double hook trigger. These triggers are smooth as butter and break clean. 3/30 rnd mags will accompany the rifle along with sling and bayonet. The barrel is threaded and has the tapco slant brake on it. The rose wood furniture is beautiful and the overall condition of the rifle is excellent. The coating was done professionally and in my opinion is far better than the cheap thin paint job you get on the arsenal jobs.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states. Oversize packages may cost more to send. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.75% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

I have a Yugo SKS made in 1977. Includes original wood stock and handguard as well as a black polymer folding stock and handguard. All serials match except for a mismatched receiver cover from a norinco. Has the factory bayonet, grenade launcher, cleaning rod, etc. Mini-cleaning kit in the buttstock is missing, but they're easily replaced.

Everything is in OK shape on the gun except for the gas valve. It is stuck in the semi-auto fire position, but since it's worn it allows a slight gas leak where the gas tube meets the valve. This may cause short-cycling. A new stainless steel over-spec valve can be bought for $20 online, plus shipping. The valve is stuck in place, but a wood block and some hammering should pop it right out. This is a VERY common problem in Yugo SKSs and happens to most of them at some point.

Everything else checks out, gas piston holds a seal in the tube. Bore has some wear like any Yugo of this age, but it cleaned up really well.

I acquired the gun not knowing of the valve leak issue. I don't have the time or motivation to fix this small valve, so i'm letting the gun go. On top of that, it's just not what i need most at this time. Selling at $300 is an immediate loss of almost $200 to me, so i don't really want to sell for much less, and if it doesn't sell I'll just fix it when i get around to it and either keep it or sell it for more. I think the price is fair but i'll entertain other offers.

feel free to email me any time, i should be checking it often. Thanks for looking!

I may throw in some ammo for good measure, based on how soon i can sell it."

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

I have a Springfield XDM 3.8 45 ACP that I would like to sell. I will also include a combat cut horse hide crossbreed super tuck with it. Plus, an extra 9 round flush magazine. 

Comes with all the original things that in came with in the case of course, mags, holster ect.

I am looking to get 750 for everything. Gun has less then 200 rounds through it, (Bought it about 7 months ago) and the holster was hardly ever used. Just looking to fund something else.

FTF Bucks County preferred, but will drive for the right deal. Will ship at buyers expense.

Only trade I am interested in is an SR 1911, or an lcp so if you happen to have one and want to trade, let me know. Obviously some cash may have to be added on your end for these.

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

THE PRESS WILL COME SETUP READY TO RELAOD - OTHER THAN SETTING UP THE POWDER MEASURE TO YOUR LIKING, ADJUSTING THE BULLET SEATING DEPTH TO YOUR LIKING, AND PUTTING THE TURRET HOLDING THE DIES ON THE PRESS YOU WILL NOT NEED TO DO ANYTHING ELSE!

This press in brand new in the box, not factory reconditioned like others on here. You need nothing else to start reloading 45 ACP!!! I have been reloading with Lee presses for over 30 years. In my opinion they are the best reloaders on the market, and when you bring in the price it is hands down. The Lee pro 1000 is an un-real press; I currently own 3 and switch out calibers on all of them, doing almost 12 calibers on these presses. I attached some pictures of one of my reloading setups just to show my experience with the presses and possibly some ideas on how to set yours up (these are the last pictures). The Lee pro 1000 will come with literally everything you need to start reloading 45 ACP; all you will need is brass, bullets, primers, and powders. With the price of .45 ACP ammo going through the roof with no stop in sight, this is a great way to save money and assure yourself you will always have ammunition. Also keep in mind this press will do all other pistol calibers, all you need to do is get the 3 die set for which ever caliber you desire. Switching from one caliber to another is very easy with this press, taking 5 minutes or less!

My experience with Lee customer service has been a truly great experience from day one; they have some of the best customer service representatives and are VERY knowledgeable especially on the Lee Pro 1000. If you ever have any types of problems or just have general reloading questions you can always get through to a representative at Lee, unlike many other companies you may be on hold for an hour. Also they have great how to videos on their website, they are short clips that show you how to do everything imaginable on this Lee Pro 1000 from changing calibers, setting up dies, cleaning the press, changing the shellplate (if desired), literally everything. I WILL ALSO BE HAPPY TO HELP AS I FEEL I AM AS KNOWLEDGABLE ON THESE PRESSES AS ANYONE ELSE, THEY ARE MY PASSION, I SERIOUSLY LOVE THEM!!

THESE PRESSES ARE NOT ""FACTORY RECONDITIONED"" LIKE OTHERS ON HERE. EVERYTHING IS BRAND NEW IN BOX WITH A 2 YEAR WARRANTY NO QUESTIONS ASKED

Everthing you will receive is new in the box. I will only take the turret and the dies out of the box to set them up saving you time. Again if you would like to do this yourself or just dont want me to for whatever reason feel free to let me know. 

Below is some information on the press from the manufaturer, feel free to ask me any questions at all. 

Thanks Matthew, 

please ask any questions you would like :)

Product Information

The Lee Pro 1000 Progressive Press is a great press for beginning reloaders or seasoned veterans. Just add a bullet and load a cartridge with each pull of the lever - all other operations are automatic. For added safety, primers and powder are fed only if a case is present. For fine adjustments or for experimenting, an alternate loading sequence allows for loading only one case at a time. Makes learning easy for the first time user. Turrets sold separately.

This is five hundred rounds of Aguila 124gr. FMJ, brass cased, reloadable 9mm rounds.

Even decent for defense carry rounds, if you don't want to shell out a buck a bang for 147gr. hollowpoints. 

I landed these cheaper than usual, so I'm passing the discount forwards. This is 500 rounds for $250. Prefer pickup in Leesburg Wal-mart, or Sterling Wal-mart, but I'm willing to be reasonable about meeting. I can take credit card too, plus a little if you're strapped for cash.

The barrel was a 16"" chrome moly steel barrel (non-chrome line) that I lathed down to 11.5 inches, crowned, threaded for the 5.5"" flash hider (pinned & welded), and opened up the gas port hole.

The upper also contains a high gas block with a picatinny rail, a low profile removeable front sight, and a quick detach front sling swivel. The rear sight is a tactical type with both windage and elevation knobs that can be set to your desire. The holographic sight on this weapon is an EOTECH copy (made in China). This type of holographic sight is weather-proof and shock proof, and has performed well (not this one as this sight is BRAND NEW) on my other AR15's that I have built and stashed away in my safe.

This is a P-64 9mm Makarov pistol, and is in excellent conditionm with near perfect bluing. (A little holster wear by the crown) This semi automatic pistol takes 6 round magazines, and is a double action/single action, with a manual safety which doubles as a decocker.

I've had the trigger polished by a gunsmith, and had the double action spring replaced with a lighter spring to facilitate the double action pull - the stock spring is really too stiff for double action. However, I still have the stock spring, which is included. 

The gun comes with the original holster, two ""pinky rest"" magazines, the original cleaning rod, and the stock hammer spring. I'll also fill up the magazines with hollowpoint defense rounds, so you can carry it right away. 

I carried this for 2.5 years, and its still the lightest, smallest pistol I've ever carried. I bought a $10 dollar fabric holster which I carried it in the entire time, and it worked great. It's also small enough for pocket carry - just decock it, and you are good to go."
