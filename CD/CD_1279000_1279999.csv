With Federal Gold Medal Match ammunition, this rifle shoots groups that fit underneath a nickel. The twist rate on the barrel is 1:10"", so it excels with 175 grain bullets, and can probably take heavier if you're adventurous. It also has a big fat brake, and underneath that brake it has 5/8""-24 threads if you'd like to attach a suppressor. I've put a Warne one piece scope base on it, and I can include the Leupold 1"" QD medium height (I think they're medium height) rings as well. The pictured scope is a Mueller 4-16x50 illuminated mil-dot, and I can include that as well. It's got a dent on one of the turret caps, but that doesn't impede function. I took pictures with the bolt out because that's how I transport it, but if you really want I can put the bolt in and take a picture of that, too.
$850 includes the whole thing. If you don't want the glass/rings, knock off $200.

If I'm able to sell this, I have at least a brick of CCI large rifle primers, and a handful of boxes of 168-178 grain bullets I could sell with it. I also have a Lee Deluxe die set for .308 (FL sizer, neck sizer, seater). These are extra on top of the rifle -- I'd only like to sell these if I can sell the rifle."

We all grew up hearing the phrase, ""Faster than a speeding bullet...,"" but not when it is fired from Smith & Wesson's new Model 460XVR, with the highest muzzle velocity of any production revolver on earth. The Model 460XVR is so revolutionary that it required an entirely new designation...XVR, X-treme Velocity Revolver.

Starting with their Extra Large Frame, the Smith & Wesson engineers worked to deliver maximum velocity - over 2,300 feet per second - to reach the target faster than ever before. The 460XVR™ has interchangeable compensators to accommodate every load and its ""gain-twist"" rifled barrel means superb long-range accuracy (beyond 200 yards) with every shot! Only Smith & Wesson could deliver this much power, this much velocity and this much accuracy in a precision, production revolver."

I bought this ammo some time ago and shot it a good deal of it in my M1 and was very impressed with it's ability to penetrate hard targets. In fact it makes today's SS109 .223 ammo look pretty feeble. Of course it's original design was for use against lightly armored vehicles and it was very effective. Today it is becoming quite collectible. It passes the magnet test and your are welcome to bring yours to check it before you purchase.

Yes, 13 years.  I received them as fluff for a deal way the hell back.  I've never been a shotty guy, not knockin' that crowd, just not my thing.  These have been kept in earned ammo cans since acquired.  I tried looking online but forgive me if I have these valued wrong.  Simply send a link on what they should be and that will be that.  From what I can tell this stuff goes new for around the $5.00 - $7.00/per 5 round box range, sometimes more. 

The brass is good on these (see pics) so I figure around $3.50 per box is more than fair.  You're basically saving by buying old packaging vs full rate for pretty new cardboard.  If you're in my neck of the woods I figure it might be worth your while for use as cheap range ammo if nothing else.  You may even want to combine the purchase/trade with some of the ammo from my 9mm & .22 LR ad.

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns ... and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art."
