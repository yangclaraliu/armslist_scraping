Beautiful engraving all over the receiver.  There is some bluing loss and spots of discoloration on the barrel, but I dont see any pitting on it.   I can ship to an FFL, but they must accept from an individual.  If they require FFL to FFL, it will cost more to ship.The only trades I'm interested (full or partial), are Oberndorf sporting rifles, European SxS shotguns, Martini rifles, and Brno sporters (not military sporterized).  We can meet locally in my area or I can ship to an FFL on your dime.  Please see my other ads for other guns I have for sale."

This is one of the more rare models with the 6.5 inch barrel and brass trigger guard and grip frame. The grips are beautiful with a very nice grain. One of the things I really like is that it was patterned after the Colt Single Action Army. When the hammer is pulled back, it makes the same familiar clicks the Colt SAA makes. It is in great shooting condition, but does have some external pitting on the barrel and ejector shroud that could be fairly easily repaired. Will explain further upon inquiry. The barrel bore and cylinder chambers are in great shape. Shoots very well, has great trigger and would be great for cowboy action type shooting. Comes with a nice, Bianci flap style basket weave holster. Will consider offers. I accept cash or USPS money order for payment.

Cleaned regulary and the barrel shows no wear. Was able to shoot MOA and sometimes better depending on the ammo used.  I am selling this because I built a new upper with a heavy barrel and free float handguard.

Bluing I would estimate at 99.5%.  Shiny bore and cylinders.  This revolver is super clean and in outstanding condition, but unfortunately does not have the original wood grips.  It currently wears Hogue rubber finger groove grips.  The previous owner put a dab of red paint on the front site.  The paint was easily removed.  It has a tight lockup and functions flawlessly.  I personally put only about 12 rounds through the pipe, and it does not appear to have been shot much at all.  No box/papers.  Price is negotiable but no low ball offers will be entertained.  WI only, no travel, CCW permit holders preferred.  Bill of sale and current DL required for my records.  Not interested in trades unless it’s for a gas/oil/advertising signage of similar value or difference is made up with cash from either end.  Thanks for looking."

This is quite a rare rifle. You should do some research if you’re unsure what it is. I can see no cracks or splits in the stock. The bore is exceptionally nice. It should make a good shooter. There is some pitting along the woodline. I have not taken the stock off so I can't attest to what the metal is like under the wood (it's probably fine). I posted about it on the milsurps website. According to them (very knowledgeable on Enfields), the only part that isn't original is the front band. It is from a No4. This is apparently very common on these rifles. All parts are stamped matching. There is no import mark. I would also be interested in trades of comparable value. I am happy to send additional pictures and answer any questions you have.
