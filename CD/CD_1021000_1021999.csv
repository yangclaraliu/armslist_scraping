Description: New

The Vortex is machined from 8620 bar stock steel, then case-hardened to provide a tough core and hard surface for maximum strength, black-parkerized finish. 21⁄4″ long, .861″ diameter. It is Sound Suppressor capable. It is not a timed item, when it is tightened that’s where it is. The Vortex does not required the use of a lock washer.The Vortex conceals the flash essentially 99.999% - even on full auto.
The Vortex carries a conditional lifetime guarantee. It is in service with many Law Enforcement agencies throughout the U.S. The Vortex has been used in combat by the U.S. Military.
Four specially angled flutes dissipate the gas but contain the unburned powder allowing increased residual burn for less visible flash. It incorporates a helix design essentially tightening itself when the weapon is fired and helps align exiting barrel gas to improve accuracy with all bullet types.
The Vortex can be permanently attached to the new 14.5″ M-4 barrels the result is a barrel with an over-all length of 16.1″.

Fits your favorite 5.56 or .223 rifle.

ONT CA as marked on receiver. Chambered in 7.62x39. 21"" barrel with an adjustable rear sight and Bi-Pod.

The NHM-91, a version of the RPK, is built on a 1.5mm stamped receiver, making it heavier than the typical 1mm stamped receiver, resulting in better felt and controlled recoil. The longer barrel gives the NHM-91 a longer sight radius, resulting in more accurate shots.

The NHM-91 comes from the factory with a front barrel bi-pod, one 5 round magazine. The NHM-91 does not come from the factory with a bayonet lug as this would interfere with the location of the bi-pod. The barrel is threaded and capped off with a thread protector, however, the retention clip is not spring activated and therefore welded onto the threads. It is, however, possible to remove the retention clip to add on a muzzle compensator.

Most notably, the RPK has a heavier and longer barrel than an AKM. This allowed the Full Auto Machine Gun version of the RPK to fire for extended periods of time without major loss in accuracy due to the barrel heating up. The chrome-lined barrel is permanently fixed to the receiver, and cannot be replaced in the field. It is fitted with a new front sight base, gas block (lacks the bayonet lug). The barrel also features a folding bipod, mounted near the muzzle, and a front sight base with a lug that limits the bipod's rotation around the axis of barrel. The barrel's muzzle is threaded, enabling the use of muzzle devices such as flash hiders, compensators, and blank-firing adapters. When a muzzle device is not being used, the threads on the muzzle can be covered by a thread protector. The barrel is pinned to the receiver in a modified trunnion, reinforced by ribbing, and is slightly wider than the trunnion used on standard AKM type rifles. Symmetrical bulges on both sides of the front trunnion ensure proper fit inside the receiver.

The RPK's receiver cover is stamped from a smooth 1.5mm sheet of steel (compared to the 1 mm sheet metal receiver cover used on standard AKM rifles). Interchangeability of parts between the RPK and AKM is moderate.

The RPK uses a modified AKM recoil spring assembly. It consists of a rear spring guide rod from the AK, and a new forward flat guide rod and coil spring.

The weapon can use standard AKM detachable box magazines."

Its been very well taken care of, there is no rust anywhere on this rifle, its in excellent shape. The scope is a Center Point 4x16x50, with IR, AO, flip up covers.
I reloaded for this rifle and got some good accuracy with it. With the twist rate of this barrel it prefers light bullets (130gr and under).  I sluged the barrel and its a .308 bore with a 1 in 12 twist.
So far I have found this rifle likes 110gr Hornady V-max and Hornady 110gr Soft Point bullets. It also likes 100gr Hornady Short Jacket and Berrys 100gr Plated FMJ, both very cheap (economical). The powders I used where AA1680 for the Hornady bullets and Trail Boss for the Berrys.  I will share my load data with the buyer if they want, but I will not post it here, or tell anyone else.
I used it mostly for coyote hunting and ground hogs with the V-Max loads, and took a deer last season with the 110gr SP load.
Its a very light and economical rifle to shoot and I have enjoyed it a lot, but I have moved on to other projects and rarely shoot it anymore.
These are not manufactured anymore so they are rare in this caliber.

I live in Smithville, but I'm willing to travel to Cookeville, Lebanon, Sparta, or McMinnville to meet halfway.

Once you BUY/OWN a Lancer AWF Mag....you will throw away your PMAGS!

The L5AWM is the only HYBRID AR magazine available today, featuring the best characteristics of Polymer and Steel magazine designs. The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.

Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve that has been maximized to feed the 5.56X45mm NATO round and has a non-tilting follower for trouble-free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET.

The L5 AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160 to name a few.

Do some homework and you will figure out this is the BEST MAG MADE!

  You are looking at a Remington 700 that I set up last October to do some hog hunting in Missouri with.  It is the heavy barrel version.  Comes with a Nikon BuckMasters BDC .308 scope, a sling, a Harris bi-pod and a Pelican case to transport it it.  Everything is new and I have only put about 150 rounds thru it.  Very, very accurate rifle.  Problem is, I still prefer to hunt hogs with my M14 so I have no real use for this rifle.  So, I will sell it lock stock and barrell for $950.00  All rules apply, you must be legally able to own this fine rifle and must present your FOID card.  Additionally, you must sign a bill of sale."

This rifle has a picatinny rail on the gas block instead of the fixed front sight, so it is ready for the optic of your choice. The Sig M400's have a 1:7 twist mil-spec chrome-lined barrel, an ambidextrous magazine release, mil-spec tube, and ambidextrous quick disconnect sling mounts built into the lower receiver. 

For those looking for an optic-ready platform, the SIGM400 SRP removes the front sight tower and replaces it with an M1913 railed front gas block. This sight-ready platform allows the operator to mount any optic without worrying about the sight tower. The gas block accepts all iron sights designed to work on the Mil-Spec Picatinny rail.

THE SIGM400 SERIES TACTICAL RIFLE, designed for use in law enforcement, military operations, or the sporting field as well as competitive shooting. The SIG M400 is a true AR platform tactical rifle. Provides unparalleled accuracy, with a 16"" chrome-lined and phosphate coated barrel that provides maximum durability and corrosion resistance. A 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum forged lower receiver adds to the durability and reliability.

The rifle cycles flawlessly with any ammo you throw at it.  I have shot roughly 200 shots through the rifle and cleaned it every time it was shot.  The Nickel Boron never needs lubricated.  Pretty much the best of the best hand picked parts were used when building this rifle.  

No low-ballers.  I know what this is worth and I don't need to sell it.  Most of these parts you can't find in stock anymore....and if you do they are double what they used to be.  I could part it out and sell the parts for more than I am asking....that just takes time I don't want to waste.  I built this to be my Coyote gun but don't get out enough to warrant keeping it around. 

Will only sell face to face or ship to your FFL.

It appears to be in very good condition and everything functions correctly on it.

""FMJ"" brand double barreled derringer.  This was made by the same company that mass produced MAC submachineguns before the 1986 ban.  It's more functional than pretty, but has its own aesthetic appeal.

Two barrels, with a selector on the hammer for which barrel to fire.  Single action--cock it and fire.  Has a safety, which must be engaged to swing open the barrels.

Each barrel can take either a .45LC cartridge or a .410 shot shell.  The barrels have a little rifling in them so it is classified as a pistol, not a shotgun.

This is a perfect little hold-out belly gun for short range protection, or great for throwing in your pocket when walking around the farm to protect against snakes.

I'm sure it kicks like a mule with full strength .45LC cartridges, but if you ever have to use it, you won't care.  Would have much less recoil with lower power .410 shells.

Interested in a straight up sale or trades.  Will entertain any trades on other firearms, but would prefer a straight-up trade to anything .22 (pistol or rifle) or a single-shot shotgun."

Various police forces use them due to their reliability and performance, and that is often the same reason civilians purchase them.  They group well, perform well, and can handle being dirtied up some.  They are compact and lightweight, so they would make for a great multi-purpose carbine.  Just handling this one almost makes me want to buy one.  If you are in the market for an AR-15 but do not feel as though you would trust yourself with getting the best quality parts to do a build-it-yourself, the Colt 6920MP-B is probably one of your best choices.  They are more expensive than other AR-15s that are capable out-of-the-box, but the quality and fit of the Colt can't be matched.  You can tell they come from the same factory as the military rifles; the left side of the magazine well is even stamped ""M4 CARBINE.""  So, again, if you're wanting a good-to-go-out-of-the-box AR-15, I highly recommend the Colt SP 6920MP-B.
