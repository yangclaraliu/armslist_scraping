The stock has never been sanded and only has a few minor dings and scratches with no cracks noted. There is a small 1” x ¼” gouge in the bottom of the butt just to the rear of the trigger plate but it appears to be a very old, period ding. The original buttplate is present and is convex-surfaced with a straight rear profile that measures 4 1/8” by 1 7/8”. The tang is 2 1/8” long and is round ended. Both the tang and buttplate screws have unmarred single-slot screws and the buttplate has a pewter patina.The Deringer Rifles known to exist are in either .54 or .58 caliber with the .58 caliber versions being the more common of the two. Deringer Rifle examples are also known with both brown and bright metal finishes. All rifles manufactured by Deringer are believed to have been produced in 1861 and only 100 to 200 are believed to have been manufactured, making this one of the rarest of Civil War rifles.There is yet another mystery surrounding these rare rifles and that relates to whether any were purchased by the U.S. Government during the Civil War. Deringer traveled to Washington, D.C. with a sample rifle in July 1861 and offered to furnish 500 to 600 rifles to the Ordnance Department. General James Ripley, Chief of Ordnance, wrote to Deringer on July 11, 1861, stating that the rifles could not be purchased unless there were sufficient numbers to arm an entire infantry regiment and the purchase was authorized by the secretary of war.Postal Money Order Only.This is an excellent example of one of the rarest of Civil War rifles from one of the most famous manufacturers of the 19th Century. This is the Deringer Original Percussion Rifle, sometimes referred to as the 1861 Deringer Rifle, in .58 caliber. These rifles are similar to the Model 1817 rifles manufactured by Henry Deringer of Philadelphia years earlier."

It is evident that at one point in time there was some slight surface rust, but the gun has been reblued and is currently rust free. The original grips are missing and have been replaced with some custom (more than likely homemade) target grips. The stampings are light but still visible.The Llama functions well, I test fired it with 50rds of light 38 super loads (well within the firearms original designated chamber pressures) with no apparent failures. The safety is functional, and the gun is a good copy of a 1911, sans grip safety.The model IV was the first gun produced by Llama and were not produced for the American market. The caliber is 9mm largo or 38 acp. The 38 acp is the exact same dimensionally as the 38 super auto, albeit the 38 acp is lower powered than the super. With light 38 super loads, the gun functions marvelously and all internals, including the bore, are in very good shape. It has a 5 1/2” barrel, slightly longer than a standard 1911. Production of the Llama IV started in 1932, with this specific firearm being produced in 1941. If any reference material is needed on this firearm, please email me and I will forward you to where I have found all of my information. I can also send more pictures if needed. These are extremely scarce on the American market, and it is truly a collectible that you will not find anywhere else.Asking price is $700 obo, willing to meet relatively close to Salisbury, NC.Open to any trade offers. Looking for 9mm carbines of good quality, AKs, ARs, big bore revolvers, old revolvers, military firearms... any decent offer will be considered. I’m not a jerk, and not opposed to multiple firearm trades.Will not ship."
