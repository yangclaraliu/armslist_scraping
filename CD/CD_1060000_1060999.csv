Ordered 2 of these from different retailers thinking I would cancel the order for whichever one shipped last.  Of course, they both ship the same week and I end up paying for both.  Can't afford to keep 2 of the exact same rifle (nor do I really want to).  Took its twin to the range last week and the build quality is exceptional.  Very similar in quality to my PSA and Ruger.  No FTF's or FTE's after several hundred rounds of high end brass, reloads, and low end Wolf/Bear steel cased ammo. Seems to like them all.  Anyhow, if you want a brand spanking new AR IN STOCK, come get mine.  Will not ship.  Will not sell to just any dummy off the street. Will only sell to CCP holder or will need copy of your valid SC driver's license.  Will consider partial trades if you are sitting on a pile of 223 ammo.  Text REDACTED if you have questions.

Price includes rifle and scope bases/rings, but not the Burris scope.

This rifle was a competitor of Weatherby back in the 70s, and is chambered for the 7mm Apollo Mach IV cartridge. It's in excellent condition with a bright and shiny bore, original finish on the wood and Duracoated metal for complete rust resistance.

This is a wildcat caliber that is very easy to handload. Take a 300 Winchester Magnum case, neck it down to 7mm with a 7mm neck sizer (I'll supply the Hornady die to do this), and you're ready to load powder, primer and bullet. The manufacturer's printed data (I still have the owner's handbook) claims 3400 fps with a 140 grain bullet!

The Voere action and barrel is noted for extreme strength and accuracy. It was used in the Kleinguenther K-15 which had a 1/2"" accuracy guarantee!"

IMPORTANT NOTE! You must go through an FFL (even if local) which means an additional $30 paid to the FFL for the background check.

If you are not local and we are shipping, you must send me your FFL's license information because I can only send to them . 


The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of Russian made 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

So beware... if you are selling ammo for 2x the price, what is stopping someone from meeting you and robbing you for the ammo? .22LR ammo use to cost on average $20 for a box of 500 rounds. That's $.04 a round, not $.10 a round. So be careful selling your ammo for more than it is worth, because many consider that robbery. And whats stopping them from taking it from you for $.00 a round.

Also included in this sale is 3-20 rd factory magazines, 2-5 round magazines, and 60 rounds of quality ammunition. The availability of this firearm, magazines, and ammo is minimal.  The value of this being together in one package...priceless.  Make me an offer, worst thing I can say is no."

These lights only list at about 100 lumens but seem brighter than some of my 500 lumen lights because they have a very far throw of 130 meters. They are xenon and run on 2 CR123 batteries. Due to the lights being compact, they will not accept 18650 batteries.  I originally paid $50 each but will sell for $25 each. There are brighter lights out there but Pelicans have excellent build quality and are the most dependable flashlights I have used. Each light has a detachable belt clip.

Hard to believe, but I have NEVER fired this gun. Never even loaded the clip.
I strictly bought this gun to protect my family, due to the economic issues. But now I need to sell to pay off credit card debt.
It comes in a soft case and has a 30 round clip.
Also included are brand new: two ruger rails, and one universal rail, true glow red dot 2x42mm scope, which needs to be sighted in, since I have not shot the gun. I also have iron sights, and a brand new New UTG Combat Foregrip. I also changed out the factory grip with a Ergo grip. The old grip will be included in the package.

Included is 200 rounds of American Eagle 223, and 100 rounds of Black Hills 223 ammunition.

The FN bolt action rifles are based on the Winchester Model 70 action with controlled round feed and a huge claw extractor. The bottom metal included with this action accepts a 4 round DBM, FN also offers bottom metal for their 5 and 10 round DBM as a kit so there are a few options. A Near Mfg. 20 moa scope mount rail is also included. All the SPR and PBR bolt actions came with these from the factory, it is not an add-on.

Markings read ""HERTER'S SINGLE SIX .401 CALIBRE"" on the ejector side of the barrel, and on the other side of the barrel it reads ""HERTER'S WASECA MINN. USA - MADE IN WESTERN GERMANY"" Serial number is V20XX. This may have been made by Sauer, but I dont know for sure. Of course this is single action only.

Please view the pictures for condition. Action seems to be correct. I dont think it was fired much based on looking at it and talking to former owner. I have not shot this. There are some irregularities in the bluing on the grip straps, which I have tried to picture. While the last owner did not mention it, it could be he touched it up with cold blue, or maybe its just some irregularities associated with age and wear, etc. The picture is probably a bit worse than reality, which was why I chose that one so hopefully no surprises. You can be the judge. I will post a few pictures here, and a lot more on the photobucket link. The gun is not perfect, but I believe it is an overall very nice example of this powerful revolver.

*It will come with approximately 220 unprimed brass cases, approx 33 wadcutters, roughly 95 or 100 semi wad cutters, approx 48 round balls, and another 43 semiwadcutters that you see in the red box, in addition to a few spent shells. The owner told me the only reloads were the ones in the red plastic box but not being a reloader, I cant really tell by looking at them. He has owned this and several other guns, most of them bought in the 60's and 70's, so there is a chance he has forgotten which ones were factory, etc. On the other hand, he is pretty sharp for his age so I don't personally doubt him much. Ammo has been in storage for years (if not decades!) and so the boxes show some wear. Some of the rounds may show corrosion or residue on the brass. If this concerns you, contact me and we can dig deeper into condition of ammo. I am also including a Herter's holster and belt. I would describe the holster as functional, but relatively low grade leather. The cartridge loops are too small for the 401 and I am not sure what size they are for. If its a concern let me know and I will try to plug some bullets in it and see what fits.

It is the style with the carry handle and it has a Tapco brand picatinny rail mounted on the carry handle for a scope/red dot etc. It comes with a (1) 10rd mag but you can get 25rd mags for it. It also has an ATI 6-position stock and a paracord sling. Its is basically brand new (only 70 rds exactly through it) with not a single failure to feed/fire/eject. It was cleaned right afterwards and kept very clean and well oiled since. With the prices of ammo recently this gun is still cheaper to shoot than any other caliber. This rifle is steadily gaining value/price with the proposed assault style rifle ban approaching. I have seen other people selling these for $450-750 so I figure $400 is very fair. I also have a tactical soft case/bag i can put with it that has 6 mag pouches on the outside and 300rds of high velocity ammo for the right trade. I like this rifle and dont have to sell it, I just want something new to play with. Let me know if your interested.

Here is detailed description from manufacturer site:

The MK1 series, developed by Primary Weapons Systems, is a significant product improvement for the M4/M16-type carbines and rifles. Utilizing our proven long stroke piston system, the MK1 series greatly reduces fouling in the action of the weapon making it as reliable as the AK47 that it was designed after. 

The MK1 series has been used in Iraq and Afghanistan, and has gained wide popularity with security personnel, law enforcement and civilians alike. 

The origins of the MK1 series began with the fascination in the simplicity and reliability of the AK47 combined with a deep-rooted appreciation for the ergonomics of the M4/M16 platform. Having a significant understanding of the deficiencies in the direct gas impingement operating system found on conventional M4/M16-style weapons, PWS developed the MK1 series with the professional in mind. 

Significant improvements have been made over both the direct gas impingement operating system and previous offerings of piston-driven operating systems. The product improvements made by PWS have addressed reliability and performance issues as well as reduced carrier tilt, cam pin wear and carrier bounce. In addition, we have one of the lightest systems on the market today! 

An innovative hand guard system utilizes a proprietary non-free float system that allows the end user or unit armorer to replace individual rails as needed without removing the barrel, barrel nut or even other rails. This system allows the user to attach numerous Picatinny rail-mounted devices such as sights, lights, and laser aiming devices. 

The PWS proprietary operating system utilizes an operating rod that is attached to the carrier and a floating head piston that is attached to the operating rod. The MK1 series is built to be a true combat carbine. With no unnecessary gas adjustments and only one moving assembly, this is the most rugged, simple and versatile piston operating system available.

The octagonal barrel and receiver are mostly smooth silver. The only blue to speak of are the trigger, hammer, and falling block.

MUZZELITE BULLPUP RIFLE STOCK
for the Ruger10/22

The most striking feature of the MUZZELITE bullpup stock, when attached to your action, is the overall length of 26-1/2"". This allows you to carry the rifle with much greater mobility. Whether your sport is hunting or plinking, the MUZZELITE bullpup stock will convert a long rifle into a compact weapon system in just a matter of minutes!

The stock itself has fixed sights which are adjustable for windage and elevation. The windage is done with the rear sight and the elevation is done with the front sight. The stock also comes equipped with a scope mount which attaches in the handle.

Construction is of fiberglass reinforced plastic and fits stander barrels and heavyweight barrels (with minor modifications).

Required Allen wrench is included.

Please note:

    Bullpup stocks cannot be fired in a left handed position and are therefore only suitable for right handed shooters.

    Some high capacity magazines may not clear the pistol grip."

The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and a anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. 

The PMAG MagLevel features transparent windows on both sides of the body and has a painted indicator on the spring for quick determination of approximate rounds remaining in the magazine. 

Our latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips. Along with larger windows and round count numbers on the body, the PMAG MagLevel's stainless steel magazine spring is now coated with mil-spec black oxide and the indicator coil painted with a high visibility orange color."

The rear sight is a sliding ramp style with the name ""D. W. King, Denver, Colo"" stamped on it.  The front sight is stamped ""Marble 2S"".  It has lots of character and is about the oldest (lowest Serial #) I have seen for sale.  May trade for tactical shotgun or 9mm folding stock rifle/pistol.  Please call Mike @ REDACTED.  Thanks"

It is the style with the carry handle and it has a Tapco brand picatinny rail mounted on the carry handle for a scope/red dot etc. It comes with a (1) 10rd mag but you can get 25rd mags for it. It also has an ATI 6-position stock and a paracord sling. Its is basically brand new (only 70 rds exactly through it) with not a single failure to feed/fire/eject. It was cleaned right afterwards and kept very clean and well oiled since. With the prices of ammo recently this gun is still cheaper to shoot than any other caliber. This rifle is steadily gaining value/price with the proposed assault style rifle ban approaching. I have seen other people selling these for $450-750 so I figure $400 is very fair. I also have a tactical soft case/bag i can put with it that has 6 mag pouches on the outside and 300rds of high velocity ammo for the right trade. I like this rifle and dont have to sell it, I just want something new to play with. Let me know if your interested. 

$400 cash firm or trade. Face to Face in Tulsa. Must be an Oklahoma resident and willing to sign a bill of sale/trade.

This functions flawlessly. There is roughly 500 rounds through it, without a single FTF or FTE. With good ammo, using the scope, it is capable of 1.5 inch groups at 100 yards. The only issue is that the front hand guard is a little loose. These are no longer for sale at any retailer, and are going to be on the immediate list of banned guns if the AWB passes by spring. If this does not sell, I have no problem keeping it as an investment.
