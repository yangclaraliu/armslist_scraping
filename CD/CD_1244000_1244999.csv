I love this thing, but I think it's time to move on for me.  These are no longer made by HK.  Super rare to find a Subcompact P2000SK in 357.  Uber rare to get one that's LEM.  Unheard of to find one with all the options and in this condition!

HK P2000 SK with AF date code. SN 125-000525. Factory LEM with light spring kit installed. Green Tru Dot night sights (2yr old, $110).

Has an extra HK factory barrel ($252, bought separately). Factory box (HK box but not matching to the SK). additional backstrap, SK manual, blank warranty card, original sights, and original LEM springs. One 10-rd mag and three 12-rd mags ($49 each) plus two x-grip extensions($17 each). Light LEM springs ($33).

Carried a bunch but shot very seldom as evidenced by the lack of wear on the barrel and slide rails. Approx 50 rds of 357 sig and 50 rds of 40 through this gun TOTAL.

That's $576 in extras, not counting the expense if you had to pay someone to swap the sights with a tool and swap the springs for the light LEM. 

Whats your offer?  Understand that these are SUPER rare and ""normal"" HK pricing does not apply.  DO NOT waste my time with lowball offers with less than 4-figures.  Seriously.  Email to bamachem@yahoo.com. More pics available.

Face to face with cash, USPS Money Orders, or Paypal GIFT Option will work for payment. Personal check is acceptable, but a minimum 10-day wait will be required so funds can be verified and check can clear before it will be shipped. Shipping can be from an individual or from a FFL, depending on what your dealer will require, and will be via FedEx only. 

Have 200+ rds of Gold Dot and another couple hundred assorted 357SIG ammo. Also have 550 rds of Blazer Brass in 40S&W, 150 rds of Federal Premium Law Enforcement SXT Hollow Points, and another few hundred assorted HP and FMJ. Also have some 357 brass too if you reload.

About Gen II Tapco Intrafuse AR15 mags (from the manufacturer):

The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.

We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. 

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."

St. Louis Ordnance Plant in 1953, in lot numbers one through four . It was a contract for the U.S. Government, for ammunition for use in whatever convert operations they chose to use it in. It was not made specifically for the ""Bay of Pigs"" fiasco.
Similar rounds were made by Twin Cities (AN) and Lake City (CN).

These rounds are, like all ammunition, collectible, but are not rare. It is packed in a standard olive-drab 6six-pocket U.S. bandoleer, each pocket holding two, five-shot Springfield-type steel clips, with end tabs, nestled in a carboard pocket within the pocket of the bandoleer intself. Standard U.S. packaging, although the use of Springfield clips in a 1953 contract is interesting of itself, and I have no information as to why that particular arrangement was done.

The bandoleer has no markings other than a stampled representation of the cartridge's headstamp on it.

The ammunition is Ball M2 Alternate, which differs from Ball M2 in having a GMCS bullet jacket, rather than a GM jacket. Bullet weight is 150 grains.
The primer is non-corrosive.

Here is what sets this AR apart from the rest.

In addition to the rigid quality controls of manufacturing, the feature that sets the Anderson AM15 Rifles apart from the masses is the proprietary RF85treatment allowing Anderson weapon systems to operate efficiently without“Wet” lubricant. In a coefficient friction test performed by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the reduction of friction on all steel surfaces was reduced by 85%— without traditional “wet” lubricant, hence the name RF85. An RF-85 treated weapon cycles faster and more reliably, operates at cooler temperatures,experiences significantly less wear and, without traditional “WET” lubricant, doesn’t experience failures due to excess dirt and carbon fouling in the action.

lowballer disclaimer-- some people have an attitude that ""it doesn't hurt to ask"" regardless of how ridiculous an offer is. Fair enough, I guess, but if you're dealing with me, it does hurt. It hurts your reputation as a buyer and it hurts your ability to get a deal with me in the future. I'm not desperate and I will not fool with someone who has no concept of what current market prices are. 
P.S. I love it when this disclaimer ticks people off and I get ehatemail- The only type of person this disclaimer would infuriate is.... you guessed it... Lowballers... Which I want lowballers to send me emails identifying themselves anyway, so I can add them to my blocked email list- That way I don't ever have to waste time with them:) Hatemail and rediculous offers result in blocked email.

    Cylindrical receiver design provides a solid bedding area in the stock for consistent shot placement.
    Recessed bolt face locks up inside the counter-bored breech of the barrel which is surrounded by the receiver, forming ""three-rings-of-steel"" enclosing the cartridge case head for unparalleled strength.
    Integral extractor is set in a groove inside the rim of the bolt face, uniformly supporting the cartridge head.

This is a World War II era gun.  If only it could talk…

Before the fall of Belgium to the Nazi’s, FN moved what they could to England for building the FN/Browning Hi Power 9mm pistol; one of the few weapons of the war that was used by both sides. Once in England, it was decided to move production to Canada to support the war effort. The Inglis Company was chosen and the rest is history.

The name Hi Power speaks for itself.  This is a bit of a Frankenstein gun, but it shoots very reliably and is very accurate.

Many Inglis Hi Powers were made for the Chinese Army and shipped from Canada. This is one of them. I call it Frankenstein because none of the numbers match which was common with Chinese guns as repairs were made to keep them in the field with other parted out guns.

The frame has a serial number of 19655 which indicates that it was a pre-war built frame.  I've been told it was 1938.  The slide is 4CH575 and the barrel is 3CH4932, which indicate both of these were built in 1945. 

The grips are authentic Inglis grips with the cooresponding proof marks on the back sides (I have pictures if needed).

A unique feature of the Chinese Hi Powers was the wooden Mauser Broom Handle-like stock they came with, hence the cut-out on the rear of the grip. The stock to this one is long gone but a replica can be made to restore it to original condition. Also unique the Chinese Hi Power is the tangent rear sight.  It was designed for use out to 500 meters with the stock.

If you have any questions or want additional photos please text me (9one8 6two5 2629) with what you’d like to see.  I will include a hard case and 50 rounds of UMC 115gr 9mm."

It is a matching numbers true German police used weapon. It is dated March 1983 and was imported to the USA in 2000. This month will mark its 30th birthday and I will match it to any 9mm out in the market for its durability and accuracy.  It is as solid as you would expect from any Sig and is one of the most desirable older Sigs around. This is in pristine condition with slight holster wear at the front of the barrel. It is as accurate as your skill will allow. It comes in the original blue Sig box with papers and the original 8 round factory clip. I have purchased 2 other original Sig Sauer 8 round clips for it at $35 each. 

This is a piece of German history and is 100% Sig Sauer. I have meticulously maintained this weapon from the day I got it. I know how to disassemble and care for all of my guns. The pictures are not very good and the target picture is my skill level at 10 yards at an indoor range. My price is fair and I am only looking to sell it to a person that will appreciate its original condition."
