That being said I'm putting the date of manufacture in the mid-nineteenth century. There are no caliber markings but we measured the bore and it looks to be a .50 caliber. This weapon features a fowl scene on its receiver, a 27"" octagon barrel, a brass butt plate, trigger guard, front sight, and various other fittings. The trigger guard is missing one screw and the receiver has one modern screw in it. The stock has a few cracks in it which should be visible in the the pictures. The wood appears to be a very nice tiger maple.The trigger and hammer function properly. It also includes a ram rod.

The only markings that appear on the weapon is the following ""Remington & sons Ilion, NY Pat May 3d 1864 May 7th June 11th Nov 12th Dec 24th 1872 Dec 31st 1872 Sept 9th 1873 Jan 12th March 18th."" The year at the very end of the marking is too faded to read. The barrel bands are marked with ""U."" The gun features a bayonet lug, Hex receiver, ladder sights that go out to 1100 yards(which appear to need a new spring on the adjustment), and a cleaning rod that appears original. The 32"" barrel has, hands down, the nicest bore I have ever seen in a vintage rifle. I would go so far as to say that if this gun was ever fired, I'd be surprised. The stock is original and in good condition with a few minor repairs. The finish is mostly gone but the exterior is free of any significant corrosion. The hammer and trigger mechanisms function perfectly. Overall this weapon has survived over the years quite well.

AK-47s have participated prominently in the transfer of power in many countries over the years. One country, Mozambique, even displays an AK-47 on its flag. No other weapon in modern times has this level of notoriety. Unlike most AKs for sale in the U.S., this one was 100% made in its country of origin (China). No U.S. parts needed and no U.S. company modifying it. It's as close to a real AK as you’re going to get. They haven’t imported these in almost 25 years and there’s no reason to believe you’ll ever see another one like this imported again, ever; and if Congress passes an assault weapons ban, you may never be able to buy one of these again, ever."

Never fired. Comes with one Magpul 30 Round Mag and Magpul Rear MBUS Sight. The photo shows a metal mag but that mag is not included. It was inserted to show the rifle with a mag attached. The Magpul mag in the unopened plastic wrapper shown is included. This is the sporting model and does not have a cover over the ejection port, nor does it have a forward assist on the upper receiver. I'm scaling down to one AR-15 in my collection so this one has to go. It's a nice rifle.

Fact-to-face in Winston-Salem or local Triad area only. Must have Concealed Carry or an original Pistol Purchase Permit from your Sheriff, and a NCDL or some other official NC picture ID. We will do a Bill-of-Sale (duplicate originals) so we each will have a signed copy. If your only proof of demonstrating that you can purchase a firearm is a Pistol Purchase Permit from your Sheriff, that's fine, but please bring an original permit with the Sheriff's seal. No copies. This is not debatable. I am not going to keep your original, but I want to see it is an original, and will just write the permit number on the bill-of-sale and maybe take a snap shot of the permit with my phone.

$950 Cash Firm. This price is not debatable. Trades based on this price also."

The Bushmaster Carbon 15 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AR-15's or for veteran gun owners. This line of rifles is among the first to come stock with polymer receiver, making it 40% lighter and more shock resistant than a standard aluminum receiver. The slim pencil style barrel, low profile gas block, and CAR-15 style stock only enhance what is already one of the lightest and most maneuverable AR's on the market. The included red dot scope is light, simple and reliable while the sight allows the user to quickly aim the weapon in any situation.

-Bushmaster Carbon 15
-Standard 30 round magazine

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

We will do a Bill-of-Sale (duplicate originals) so we each will have a signed copy. If your only proof of demonstrating that you can purchase a firearm is a Pistol Purchase Permit from your Sheriff, that's fine, but please bring an original permit with the Sheriff's seal. No copies. This is not debatable. I am not going to keep your original, but I want to see it is an original, and will just write the permit number on the bill-of-sale and maybe take a snap shot of the permit with my phone."

I have only fired around 100 rounds through this rifle since I bought it new. This rifle features a factory collapsible folding stock, a flip-up rear sight, and I have also installed the Sig Sauer Red-Dot sight, which co-witnesses perfectly with the fixed sights. I also installed a Grip-Pod fore-grip that converts to a bi-pod with the push of a button.

My small collection goes back to US Army Trapdoors (the musket in the photo is my brother’s).

To represent the modern end of my collection I would like to buy 2 NIB or 1 NIB and 1 LNIB of the latest version of the FN 57 pistol. (My plan is to keep one NIB and occasionally fire the other.)

This latest version, the only type I want, has the new serrations at the front of the slide.

Buying from a dealer is no problem, I did that several times last year, I have not even had a traffic ticket so far in this century, knock on wood.

I won’t claim to be an expert on the latest prices, but it reminds me of the Dirty Harry/Model 29 rush of the early 1970s. List price was $187 and I finally got one for $375, wooden box and all.

Anyway, we have the FN 57 list price, the peak Gun Broker prices of the recent past, and the latest Gun Broker prices.

Please respond if you have one or two of these for sale, only the latest version, please let me know the price and for how long you would give me to reply.

It's a great rifle and I really love to shoot it. I love even more how cheap it is to shoot. There are a lot of aftermarket parts available for it. The thing is made from aluminum and you can feel its a solid rifle. The stock is adjustable but I don't have it extended in the pictures. It's a GREAT rifle for the young shooters because it gets them familiar with handling an AR style rifle without the recoil or cost of shooting .223/5.56. The ONLY reason I am selling is because I need money to repair my vehicle. I'll even take $100 off if you can prove to me you're a veteran."
