Serial number traces date mfg date of 1980. A 33 year old full size government model .45 with the prettiest bluing I have seen short of a Colt or Kimber. It literally shines. No rust, clean bore. I've owned it 5 years and have never fired it. The man I bought it from claimed he never fired it. Looking at the internals leads me to believe it is true. I know these guns have a splotchy reputation, but I owned several of them in the 1970's that always worked good for me. The picture does not do it justice. Looks and fits better than any of the knockoff govt models out there right now. Nice solid wood grips. 1 magazine. Takes standard 1911 magazines, but my understanding is the internals are different, so no other 1911 parts would interchange. The magazine with the gun is the original made in Spain that came with the gun new.
 I know it's just a Llama, and not a Colt, but it sure is nice. I don't think you would be disappointed, and it hurts my feelings to sell it. New baby needs diapers, and doc bills are rolling in. $400 (the newer ones sell for $475 on gunbroker, plus tax, plus shipping, plus FFL fee, and don't look near as good, so no lowballers)

In as new condition and possibly is unfired but there is no guarantee that some rounds have not been discharged over the past 68 years or so. However, there are two spots of flaking, one on the left side of hammer, the other on the loading gate. The back strap shows several nicks and scratches. No letters are generally available in this serial range as I believe all were destroyed in a Colt fire. There were only 25 made in this caliber and only a few in this configuration ever manufactured according to Colt records. I've had a lot of inquiries on this fine revolver, a lot from Europe where I can't ship this to because of the caliber and quite a few from the USA by folks who don't realize what the price is going to be. This is a fantastic piece! The original, perfect grips, matching of course, have been in place so long that the serial numbers of the backstrap and trigger guard have embedded into the right inner grip. The blemishes on the backstrap can no doubt be removed with professional polishing but I leave that to the next owner.

It has about 600 rounds through it, about half of which was tulla-ammo (steel case) and it has had ZERO malfunctions. The reliability of this gun has been top notch, but I would like to sell it so I can build an AR-15. It is mostly stock, all I have changed on it is the recoil spring which I changed out at about 400 rounds to a Wilson Combat 18.5# spring (because Hilton Yam of 10-8 Performance did this to his SW1911TA and had zero problems; btw I changed the spring before any reliability issues came up). 

I have carried this gun on occasion so there is slight holster wear, and there is slight wear on the bottom of the rail where I attach my light (not included). 

Included in the sale is:
200 rounds of Remington 45ACP,
110 rounds of loose ammo (almost all Federal brand, kept in a cool dry location for up to 1 year),
2 original magazines,
3 Kimber magazines,
20 rounds of Winchester PDX Defender (purchased a couple weeks ago),
crossbreed Supertuck holster with a slight cut out of the leather to enable a full grip when drawing the gun,
Bravo Concealment double magazine holder,
Bladetech double magazine holder,
Wilson Combat spring replacement kit (minus the recoil spring which is in the gun),
set of black rubber grips in addition to the stock wood grips,
Wilson Combat extended slide release.

This gun has been very well taken care of, cleaned after every range outing, never tossed around etc.

The P220® Carry Elite Stainless is an 8+1 capacity carry-sized pistol with a full-size frame. Chambered in .45ACP, the P220 Carry Elite Stainless features the new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The new SRT was designed by SIG SAUER® to deliver the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset 60% shorter than the standard DA/SA. This short reset provides for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting making it ideal for competitive shooting. With its enhanced ergonomic features of a beavertail grip, front strap checkering and front cocking serrations, the P220 Carry Elite is an excellent choice as a big bore carry pistol. Its beavertail grip allows the shooter to obtain his or her grip quickly and with confidence even under stress. Each P220 Carry Elite Stainless comes equipped with SIGLITE® Night Sights and the all-stainless construction provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long."

The cylinder bores are excellent and the barrel bore is very fine. The action works excellent. The colors have grayed on frame with little showing.

Only 6 months old, 500 rounds of everything from aluminum Blazer to Hornaday Critical Defense HP. No FTF's or FTE's absolutely flawless, exactly what you want on the gun you depend on to save your life. 

The best thing about this gun is it's a great range gun and comfortable to shoot all day with the Houge grip. This also comes two extra pierce mag extenders for any extra mags you want to put on them. Also to boot I am throwing in 300 rounds of Winchester .380 ammo.

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.

It comes with a factory mag, case, all original paperwork and extras. It has fired less than 300 rounds. I had been looking for a Mosquito for my wife as she cannot tolerate the recoil of my XDm 40 but wanted to join in my passion. I mentioned this to my brother told him that if he found a good deal, get it and I would take it. A few days later, he called and told me he had picked up one. This was after I already purchased this one and had a gunsmith check out pistol, polish the feed ramp and true the breech face. I only needed one so I am just trying to get some of my money back. There is nothing mechanically wrong with this pistol as it feeds and shoots great. The only issues found are that some of the digi camo coating in the valley of the rail has been rubbed off. There is also a small spot on the inside of the slide. Both can be seen clearly in the pics. Let me know if you have questions. Face to face only.

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the 6920 carbine is less than 32"" collapsed in length and weighs only 6.91 lb - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's 6920 carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher mounts directly to the Carbine without modification
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation

Dual core CPU
120 Gig Solid state hard drive - brand new, this is what that makes this thing fly

This is not your run of the mill computer, and you will not find anything this fast off the shelf unless you're ready to drop a ton of money. Yes, this will even eat a Mac for lunch. 
I just timed it and it boots in 17 seconds and installs/runs programs extremely fast!

The next thing I have is a high dollar camper shell for an 04 and similar F250/350 6.5' bed
I'm asking $900 cash, but willing to trade for a firearm. 
It retails for $2600 new, and is in near perfect condition. 
It's silver, but could always be painted to match your truck. It has a full hatch on the back that replaces your tailgate and has a walk-in glass door. All glass opens. It has one ding on the top of it, not noticable once on the truck. This really changed the look of your truck, in a good way. Has all the mounts and key. Has an internal light for the bed and tail light on the back.

Authentic in looks, feel, and operation, this replica MP5 is engineered as a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It’s built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.
The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. A 25- and 10-round version of the magazine is available. Both are proportionate in size to the centerfire version’s mag to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine. The estimated retail price for the MP5 A5 is $475.
Operation

The .22 caliber HK MP5 A5 operates on a blowback system. The bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its front sight is adjustable for elevation and comes with interchangeable posts. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety switch rotates in the same manner as the 9 mm MP5.

11.5"" barrel, have 2 flash suppressors, one which could be welded on to make it a rifle upper or a standard if you have a class 3 or pistol lower.

I am not LEO or a lawyer, you must be aware of your laws regarding this type of barrel length. If this is placed on a rifle lower then it would be a SBR and require a tax stamp. You could put this on a pistol lower. This upper is not illegal when it is not on a rifle lower.

Check http://ammoseek.com to see the prices prople are actively paying for this ammo, when it's available. I know the prices seem high, but they've been high for months, and this is for people looking to shoot.

**NOTE: .223 is USUALLY perfectly safe to fire in systems chambered for 5.56, but the inverse/opposite is NOT the case. We're talking 50,000 PSI a few inches from your peepers- better to ask questions and play it safe than blow pieces of your weapon (or yourself) into the guy standing next to you."

The LWRC REPR is being currently deployed with U.S. and British troops overseas. The REPR is accurate enough that it is substituting for the bolt action sniper rifles in some multi role applications.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. This rifle is the Sniper version which includes the Geissele trigger. To complete the system all you would need to get is a short barreled upper.Cash only."

The LWRC REPR is being currently deployed with U.S. and British troops overseas. The REPR is accurate enough that it is substituting for the bolt action sniper rifles in some multi role applications.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. This rifle is the Sniper version which includes the Geissele trigger. To complete the system all you would need to get is a short barreled upper.Cash only."
