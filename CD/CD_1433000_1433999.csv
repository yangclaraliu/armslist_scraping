As far as extras go you get a IWB, OWB left or right hand holster fits the gun perfectly. I also have a extra mag so a total of 3 mags 2 normal mags and one extended grip mag all 10 rounders and for 2 of the mags I have addon metal last round hold open followers witch is a feature the gun doesnt stock have they work perfectly and dont detract from your magizine capacity. I also have 2 extra slide springs because eventually they will wear out so you have those on hand. The gun also comes with 2 adhesive shock rods unused that will help the wear of the gun be far far less then without them. The pistol also comes with a extra safety that has had the magizine lock safety disabled so if you need to go back to stock to ever send it in to be worked on because your getting a lifetime warenty then you can take it back to stock or you can keep it stock your choice.

The Equinox® is the balance between day and night. So it should come as no surprise that the SIG SAUER® P220® Equinox has evolved from the SIG SAUER® Custom Shop. The P220 Equinox is a limited .45ACP designed by SIG SAUER Custom Shop master gunsmiths. It features a two-tone accented Nitron® stainless steel slide with a lightweight black hard-anodized alloy frame. The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox™ comes with gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function."

If it's not worth what I'm asking I'll take the posting down.  I don't want to be ""That Guy"" on here.  I bought it from Sportsman's Guide last year, anyone know what they were selling?  

This is a NIB 75-round drum designed for use with an AK-47.  This drum loads from the back, comes with the original directions, and accommodates 7.62x39mm ammo.  

I’m not sure of the country of origin.  The instructions only list Century International Arms as the distributor and no country of origin.  It looks identical – to me – to the Romanian drums.  The rivets are in the same places and other details all appear the same.  Either way, I’m sure when you fill it with ammo it’ll go ""Bang"" seventy-five times followed by an audible, “Click”.  

This was purchased in 2012 and never used.  It sat forgotten about until last week when I wondered what was in the plain brown box and opened it.  I’m a bit of a traditionalist and prefer to fire from standard 30-round magazines and I don’t anticipate using it anytime soon.  So, it’s up for sale.  

I see these are all the way up to a ridiculous almost $300 on MN Armslist.  Homey don’t play that game.  I’m selling this for $175 which seems fair.  You can get them for as cheap as $160 on this site.  Mine is unfired / NIB and comes with the original directions.  I’m thinking that’s worth the extra $15.  Heck, if you want to go up to $200 I’ll throw in the first 75-rounds of AK ammo to fill the drum.  The extra $25 actually makes the ammo a few cents less than I paid for it.  

I don’t need to see a permit or require a DNA sample to purchase this.  It hasn’t come to that for magazines and drums… Yet.

What more can I write? If you don't know what a Rossi Wizard or holographic sight are, then let me refer you to those places on the internet called ""Google."" or ""Bing."" You'll learn all about ""reflex"" sights and the concept of interchangeable barrels without a gunsmith or fitting. 

I took the 243 & 20 gauge combo in trade thinking my nephew would use them - I was wrong. Don't get me started on what taxpayer funded schools are teaching our kids! There's a hard side carrying case, an extra battery for the reflex sight & IF I can find them, a few .243 carriages from a long-gone rifle."

The TAVOR assault rifle was especially created to answer these varied demands, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the 21st century. The TAVOR was developed in close cooperation with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor is today in service in the IDF infantry troops as well as in the forces of other countries throughout the world. The rifle family has an excellent performance record in the battlefield with its attributes of high precision, reliability and human ergonomics being its leading characteristics. Characteristics: • Bull pup configuration. • Optimized ergonomic design. • 30 Rds. Magazine capacity. • Body built of high strength impact modified polymer. • Detachable barrel. • Uses standard AR-15 type magazines • 100% Ambidextrous thus making the use by right or left handed shooters easy. • Has true “OTB” (over-the beach) capability and can be safely fired after being submerged in water and not completely dry. • Designed for Minimum operator and armorer level maintenance, thus reducing maintenance and life cycle costs. . • Very easy field striping into 2 parts. • 100% interchangeability with parts of the Tavor family, thus reducing the overall costs of the system. • Equipped with a last round stopper. • All the metal parts of the weapon are corrosion resistant. • Recoil absorbent butt pad for rifle grenade firing. Comparison tests have proven the Tavor to possess the following significant operational advantages: • Increases hit probability under fatigue and pressure. • Superior reliability under extreme conditions. • Ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease of use. • Short rifle convenience with long barrel accuracy. • Right and left handed operability. This is one of the first of this rifle available. 16” barrel, with flat top to add any sighting system you may desire, also includes rails to add other accessories.

This rifle is hard to get because of the caliber and hard wood stock/forearm. Here is a chance to own a rifle that uses the same bullet platform as your AK or SKS. 
The wood stock and forearm are real nice in excellent shape as you can see in the pic. Bore of the gun is perfect. The rifle is topped with a brand new $119 Bushnell Banner 3x9x40 lighted recticle scope, and it was professionally mounted to the gun by the Gander Mtn. gunsmith. The gun also has a new sling (not pictured) and the sling is still in the package. I also have a new, uninstalled  factory Rossi hammer extension to make it easy to cock the hammer and clear the scope.
This rifle would make a good candidate for a suppressor. You can get the rifle now without any universal background check, and this 7.62x39 rifle will be legal everywhere. After totaling the price of the rifle, the scope mount, scope, and sling, I have more in it than I'm asking. I'm asking $450.00 for the whole package.
I prefer a USPS postal money order. I can do paypal, but you'll need to add 3% because of their fees they tack onto a seller. I'm not interested in accepting a check. Shipping will be $25.00 from my FFL to yours. I'll need info so I can validate your FFL has a valid license, and their address info. If I need any other info that I've forgotten to ask, I'll answer via email. You the interested buyer can always email me with questions. I live rural, so it will take me a couple of days to get into town to the FFL to mail the rifle since they have limited hours during the week. Thanks an good luck. This is an excellent rifle and I know you will be happy to own it."

563,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1433563,For Sale:  Ruger Mini 30 Plus Goodies,"Westchester County, Hudson Valley, New York","$ 1,800","Listed On: Wednesday, April 10, 2013",Rifles,Ruger                                                                                ,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I've got a Ruger Mini-30 7.62x39 semi-automatic rifle. It's just like a Mini 14, except it shoots the AK round instead of the AR round. The AK round is for sure more powerful, and cheaper.

It's got the regular, NEW YORK LEGAL wood stock, void of a collapsible butt stock or a pistol grip, meaning the commie lawmakers won't call it an ""assault weapon."" This guy is just about as good as it gets in New York. It's a hell of a rifle, light and handy, but powerful enough to blast your way through a cinder block wall. If you've never seen one, it looks and comes apart like an M1 Carbine, but it shoots like an AK-47. I've put high quality American Winchester ammo through it, and I've put cheap Golden Tiger and Tula surplus ammo through it, and it eats it up. Steel cased ammo is no problem.

In addition, I also have a black ATI tactical stock. This item is a black stock built for the Mini 14, except I used a dremel to widen the magazine well to accommodate the Mini 30 magazines. It could use some smoothing down, but it works just fine. This stock has a pistol grip and telescoping stock, as well as side and top rails. The item must be sold SEPARATELY seeing as, once it is placed on the rifle, it makes the rifle become an ""assault weapon."" I would like to stress this again. This item is to be sold separately, but is included in this price. Since it itself is not a firearm, I could ship it. But it needs to be in two orders.

In addition to the extra stock, I have an Accu-Strut put on, and a 4x scope with its own rail. The scope rail is to be mounted on the rifle's sights. I have never mounted it as I am not much of a scope guy. I also have a flash suppressor, but unfortunately, the commies in New York don't think you should be able to have one, so it's not for sale. I'll have to get rid of it somehow else.

The rifle comes with a 5-round Ruger magazine that's only been used once or twice, and two 10-round aftermarket magazines that I normally use. It also comes with a bolt lock.

I'm from New York originally but I moved down to Virginia where basically everything is legal. We shoot AUG's and G3's down here. Cigs are $4.95 a pack down here in America. You can literally go to a drive-thru liquor and fireworks store. Not kidding. A drive-thru, that sells LIQUOR and FIREWORKS at the same establishment. I bought this rifle so that I'd have something to take to New York when I come back for visits if I feel like doing some shooting, but I've moved on to bigger and badder guns now.

I'll be up in New York in mid May, so in case anybody wants to do face-to-face, then is the time to do it. If you want to do a face-to-face, you have to show me evidence that you passed a background check. I need to see a pistol permit and you need to sign a bill of sale. No deals in NYC or Yonkers. I'm pretty sure they have additional laws that I don't want to mess with."

Take a bit of time and look around. Its out there with a bit of effort.  These people who are marking up guns and ammo up for a profit are just greedy. HAlf of them have no Idea of what they are even selling. I've talked to a few guys about AR's they are selling, and they are clueless to what they even are. They have no technical knowledge, or firearm knowledge at all. I had one guy call the bolt carrier ""the chamber"" and thought the chamber was the ""thingy"" that removed the bullet. He also thought the Buffer was the thing at the end of the barrel that buffered the sound. I guess the old adage ""you can't fix stupid"" is correct. Don't play into these foolish thieves. Maybe you could buy high priced Wal-mart ar's and a pet rock at the same time."

The Omega X™ Rails feature a unique blend of Omega Rail™ technology along with the strength of our proprietary Bolt-Up Design. The Omega X™ Rails offer a smooth transition from the upper receiver offering the most useable rail space in conjunction with a standard front sight base. It boasts a continuous upper rail platform along with integrated, limited rotation, sling swivel attachment points on either side for ambidextrous use. This two piece free float rail system secures to a proprietary barrel nut with our AR15 Lite Rail Barrel Nut Wrench so initial gunsmithing is required for installation. Once the rail system is completely installed, it can easily be removed from the barrel nut to allow the end user to perform maintenence to the barrel and gas tube while still maintaining a true free float design.

The Omega X™ 12.0 Rail System will mount flush to your Front Sight Base on a Rifle Length gas system or can cover a variety of low profile gas blocks on either Carbine or Midlength gas systems.

The Omega X™ rail system comes standard with three black ladders to proctect the 1913 rails as well as the shooters hand. The Ladders are contructed from santoprene, which can handle heat up to 350 degrees.

Comes with matching parts, blade bayonet, and sling.  Could possibly include a Tapco 20rd mag.

Stock has been refinished, but still has a large crack.    Could be a good project gun for you if you have the skills I lack.  Crack has been glued and clamped before refinishing.  The condition of the stock is pretty rough.  There is a small amount of ""trench art"".  Bluing is still good, not an expert at rating but I would say maybe between 80-90%. I put a lot or work into cleaning this gun up.

Good shooter, good addition to any collection.  From what I understand, and have concluded from my own research, rifles from this batch have been pretty desirable by collectors.  I've been seeing a lot of these in worse condition (stocks broken in half, missing parts, no bluing at all, rust, etc..) going for around $400 or more.  My price is negotiable to a certain extent.  I will not respond to low ballers, or those asking for a ""bottom price"".  Please include an offer if you are interested. 

Cash only.  Must have FOID.  Must be willing to provide DL and FOID with a signature on Bill of Sale.  

Contact me if interested or if you have questions.

Also.... the bad apple ruins the bunch.  Not willing to sell, meet in, or have anything to do with Cook County.  Sorry.  Bad experience, not putting myself through it again."
