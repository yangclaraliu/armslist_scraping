$1,700 firm in cash, higher in trade value and no hurry to sell.  At places that actually have this model in stock online, I'm seeing them for $1,800 with the standard trigger and NO Sig iron sights.  If you can find it cheaper in stock, buy it.  Might take another excellent condition model 92A1/M9A1, P938 or Pak-9 and $1,300 cash.  If you don't want the upgraded trigger, be sure to let me know.Not interested in other trades, unless it's a worthwhile deal.  On trades, let me know what you have and EXACTLY what the deal is up front and I'll get back to you either way.  No reason to go back and forth only to find out the deal doesn't make sense. Must be legally able to own a firearm in TX and have valid ID.  No scammers, lowballers or flakes, if you can't keep your word after you confirm a deal, please do not contact me."

Get yourself a nice one with a scope for a decent price from me. I've taken good care of her. Shot my first deer with this rifle. Still has a really good looking bore with strong rifling. Bore is on the darker side as they go but it's not eroded or pitted. Lightly sticking a .312 hornady SST in the muzzle it stops immediately. It's still a pretty new bore as they go, just wasn't cleaned regularly by the previous owner. The Huber Concepts trigger I put in it along with a light stoning of the sear and striker have made it a really light pull. Haven't measured it but I've pulled a lot of triggers. I'd call it well under 2 1/2lbs. I refinished this wood and put the cheekpiece on with a nicer scope and had given it to my father as a gift bit the light pull surprised him in a bad way so I decided to get him a nicer CZ Mauser finally. It's a really nice enfield though. Pretty minimally altered too. I wouldn't call it a collector but people want a lot even for a really bubba'd one now. Considering that I have dies, brass, bullets, scope and mount, the trigger, cheek rest, it's worth what I want for it and it's hard to find a nicer hinting rifle for the price. Ammo I loaded is on the light side but 150gr SST still hits like lightning. Come right with my asking price and don't bother haggling or I won't respond. Don't have time to shorten my life span stressing over clowns."

Also, there is a Custom Sig Sauer Paddle-Holster too that fits with the Laser BOTH on or off the pistol. The Custom Sig Laser can easily be removed as well, and just as easily put back on, too.. And it has an ambidextrous ON/OFF button on both the right and left side, and is also already sighted in completely accurate up to 50yards!This Sig Sauer P290 .9mm pistol is the P290-RS model, which is the Rapid Shot Re-Strike model of the P290 series, which means it has a rapid fire Re-Strike Trigger Mechanism that is capable of being continuously pulled if for some reason the bullet does not fire, or a bad/older .9mm round won't fire with the first trigger strike; then you can simply just pull the trigger again to get it to Re-Strike the cartridge and fire, instead of having to stop and clear the bad/old bullet or manually clear the chamber (which is a GREAT OPTION to have if your life is on the line and you don't have time to fix a ""mis-fire"")This a perfect and complete carry package that includes everything one would need, and is ALL made by Sig Sauer; including both mags, the laser, the night-sights, and even the custom P290 holster that fits with the laser and engraved with the Sig Sauer logo! The price for EVERYTHING included here is only just $460cash EVEN! No tax, no extra fees, no shipping; just a FTF meeting IN or AROUND the Oxford area! I am not looking to travel far so if you cannot meet in Oxford then the price will be more than just only $460 depending on how far away from Oxford. I hate to part with it, especially since Sig Sauer is no longer making these models in this complete package form, but it is just far too small for how big my hands are.. As I said, it is brand new, and was bought brand new in February of 2018 and has no previous owners.Thanks for looking!!"
