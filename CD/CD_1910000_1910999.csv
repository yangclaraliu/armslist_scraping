It has Trijicon night sights, dated 2002, which still glow dimly but are replaceable if desired.  I used this pistol for IDPA competition for a few months before I moved on to a custom Beretta, and it performed well.  I've replaced the stock hammer spring with a Beretta 'D' spring, which lowered the double-action and single-action trigger pull weight.  Except for the custom 92 which I'll be keeping, this 92G has the best trigger of any of the 92 series pistols I've owned.  

I'll be including (3) 15-rd genuine Beretta magazines and a DeSantis Yaqui Slide belt holster with the pistol.  The holster retails for just under $50, and here is a link to it: http://www.desantisholster.com/store/SEARCH-BY-GUN-MANUFACTURER/BERETTA/92F-92FS-M9/BELT-HOLSTERS/Yaqui-Slide

Some background info:  

While the 92FS practically grows on trees in terms of availability, the 92G is a variant that many people haven't heard of or seen before.  On the 92FS, the lever on the slide acts as a decocker and will also latch downwards into an ""on safe"" condition.  That same lever on the 92G is springloaded and doesn't have a ""safe"" position.  The reason for this is that the safety can be accidentally engaged while racking the slide on an FS variant, and certain agencies didn't want this to be possible in the middle of a gunfight.  The G variant actually uses a different slide than the FS, and safety/decocker parts don't interchange between the two.  Beretta didn't make the G variant commonly available to the public because of liability fears, so they're hard to come by.  Their most popular usage today is for self defense by shooters ""in the know,"" and for action shooting use where the lack of a safety means one less thing that can go wrong in a fast-paced competition.   

LOCATION / SALE INFO: 

I'm located about an hour west of Charlottesville in the Harrisonburg area. It's often easiest for me to meet at the Mt Crawford Park and Ride off I-81 Exit 240 if that's convenient for you.

Patented BDC reticle: The BDC reticle allows hunters to hold “dead-on” at ranges exceeding those previously thought possible. The BDC’s unique see-through ballistic circles offer an incredible advantage for long range shooting—yet allow a normal sight picture for shorter-range shots where the crosshair itself is the aiming point.
Large exit pupils: Improved low light hunting at dawn or dusk, when the game is usually moving.
Precise, hand-turn 1/4-MOA click adjustments: Positive-click reticle adjustments get you zeroed-in quicker and maintain your setting even with heavy recoil.
Sunshade adaptable: Optional accessory sunshade eliminates glare in particularly bright conditions and keeps dust and rain off of the objective lens on rainy days or in dusty environments.
Brightvue™ multicoating: Bright, multicoating optics deliver up to 92% light transmission.
Side focus adjustments: Long Range models include adjustments for parallax-free sighting.
Quick focus eyepiece: Allows the shooter to instantly bring the reticle into sharp focus.
Waterproof, fogproof, shockproof: Nitrogen filled and O-ring sealed."

Included is a never fired factory S&W 9mm barrel that can be dropped into the 40 Shield to convert it to a 9mm Shield instantly. I have tested this with my brother's Shield and this conversion is well documented on the internet. These barrels are very sought after and now practically impossible to find since you can no longer order one from S&W. They've restricted the sale of these once people caught on to the simple conversion that pretty much gives you two guns in one. Now the only way to obtain one is to send your 9 Shield in to Smith with a faulty barrel for them to replace. The following video proves that the barrels are identical in every aspect except bore diameter. The 40 mags will be able to load 9mm cartridges with room for one more round than the 40 S&W cartridges. Being able to shoot both calibers gives you more options and can save you money at the range since 40S&W ammo is more expensive than 9mm. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flnFIzI6MIw&feature=share&list=TL0M6XeB3NonM

Also included are three 6 round flush mags, there is no extended mag that would normally come with a Shield. I traded for a 6 rounder and then bought an additional 6 rounder because I found they were easier to conceal and I actually had a more positive grip when I held the Shield with the flush mags. 

Two holsters included, DeSantis Insider Black Leather IWB and Uncle Mike's Reflex Holster OWB - both top quality 

Also throwing in a Pachmayr Tactical Grip Sleeve makes a huge difference in terms of positive grip, less felt recoil and better accuracy.

Shield has three dot sights painted with Glow-On gun sight paint that is more durable, glows bright in the dark, and stands out better than original low quality white paint that the three dots come with out of box. Most Shields end up with the factory white dots falling out of the dot holes after so many rounds.

Stamping on the frame and 40 barrel has been painted silver.

Also included is a 20 round box of Speer Gold Dot 40 S&W - best defense ammo imo

And a like new Smith & Wesson Extreme Ops Folding Knife:

I'm the original owner and purchased this firearm in March for $490 out the door.

I'm far from desperate so any low ball offers will be ignored, and I love this pistol so the only way I'd let all of it go is to get a lot of what I paid for back out of the deal. The barrel is worth $200 easy.

Asking $800 or best offer for everything or $600 or best offer without the 9 barrel. Original box, lock and papers all included, email me with a phone number and I can shoot you a text. Must sign bill of sale. Would consider a partial trade for boxed 9mm ammo (no hand loads)

Originally designed for the American market the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol.

All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. HK pioneered this use of polymer materials in the production of handguns more than 30 years ago with the development of the VP70Z and P9S pistols.

The USP control lever a combination safety and decocking lever is frame mounted and quickly accessible unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols.

Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models."

100-150 rounds fired

The first of the many recent additions to the Heckler & Koch handgun line, the P2000 and incorporate features of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with the latest innovations of HK engineers. A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 is available with a traditional double-action/single-action trigger mode and the LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system first introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" model.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system.

Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols.

With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 - 8.5 pounds (27.5 - 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7N).

The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.

Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol.

A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike.

Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines.

A limited edition P2000 German Police Model features a ""closed"" accessory mounting rail system and a tapered trigger guard.

But there are a lot of Chinese and Pakistani knockoffs out there. This knife was made by a 5th generation knife maker whose whole family has worked for LaGuiole En Aubrac. Each maker puts his own design on the knives and this man and the 4 men before him uses feathers. The attention to detail on this knife is amazing and you really need to see it.

 Fine Moore 7 Shooter Revolver  
This is a 7 shot revolver with a 6 inch octagonal barrel in 32 rimfire caliber. These were made in the early 1860’s and I have owned numerous examples inscribed to Civil War officers. They were very popular before manufacturing stopped due to the Rollin White patent infringement suit won by Smith & Wesson against numerous firearm companies. The silver plated brass frame is beautifully hand engraved with scrollwork and retains about 30% of the silver plate. The cylinder and barrel retain some of the original factory blue finish. The barrel is marked “D. MOORE. PATENT. SEPT, 18. 1860.” A very fine example."

SMITH & WESSON 610-3 10mm REVOLVER

DESCRIPTION
Up for your consideration is a Smith & Wesson model 610-3. This Model 610 is a 10mm/.40 S&W caliber stainless steel round butt N frame 6 shot revolver with a 3 7/8"" barrel and fluted cylinder (barrel is actually 3 7/8"" - S&W manufactured this series to assure that it meet the under 4"" qualifications) for competitive shooters.

1/8"" pinned serrated black ramp front sight and adjustable rear sight. The gun shoots beautifully. The only reason I am parting with it is due to a very high end 1911 project that I need funds for. The trigger is sweet & smooth both in single action and double action. The timing is perfect. It has some handling marks but overall looks great. Comes with the original factory box, paperwork, lock, internal keys, 3 metal moon clips & 6 Rimz Plastic moon clips, etc. 

Has been stored lubed with Frog Lube & stored in humidity controlled safe. No New York or International sales.  It is your responsibility to know if this gun is legal in your area.  Please do not bid if it is not legal to own in your area.  Actual images of item for auction are listed. Manufactured with a stainless steel frame, the six-shot revolver features a satin stainless finish and Hogue rubber round to square conversion grips. 
*RARE NO LONGER MADE!*

The 4-inch model measures 9 ½ inches in overall length with a weight of 42.5 ounces. The Model 610 revolver uses full moon clips and can be used to shoot .40 S&W ammunition.

I WILL NOT accept personal checks at all. Any payment other than US Postal Service Money Order will be delayed!

In good condition other than when we were riding it a rock flew up and cracked the windshield in the middle, but it is still ride-able though. It was recently greased up as well. We paid $1500 for out from an older couple who took really good care of it. It has about 5.5k miles on it. we only drove it about 100 miles when we owned it. Works well if you are looking for a good price on a snowmobile. We have the titles as well and the manual that came with it. Also comes with a pull behind sled that can attach to a stationary hinge on the back of the snowmobile that we paid $150 for.

MAGPUL CTR Buttstock Commercial Model - Olive Drab Green

The Magpul CTR (Compact/Type Restricted) – Commercial-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement butt stock for AR15/M16 carbines using commercial-spec sized receiver extension tubes. Designed for light, fast action the streamlined A-frame profile avoids snagging and shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. The extra-power lock mechanism uses a premium chrome-silicon spring to avert auto-collapse failure and maintains strength by resisting spring relaxation. The CTR also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes wobble* for enhanced weapon stability and accuracy. The Commercial-Spec Model includes an extended 0.55"" rubber butt-pad to provide positive shoulder purchase and accommodates the longer, slanted back common to most commercial-spec tubes.
Commercial size buffer tube required for assembly.
