The current version of this revolver has a 3-inch barrel and ""express"" sights (v-notch rear and fiber optic front), and retails for $769.00.  The revolver for sale is about three years old, and I originally paid $609.00 new for it.  It is very lightly used, and in near-new condition.  The 5-inch barrel and conventional square notch adjustable rear and black ramp front make for an unusually accurate kit gun.  Take it along on a fishing trip and if they're not biting, you can plink, or actually pot a squirrel or two.  Also makes a great practice piece if your carry gun is a .38spc. J-frame.
                       PLEASE NOTE ! :
I do not know how to send pictures, so don't ask.  I'm sorry, I'm an old fart, and my ignorance of electronic gadgets is only exceeded by my lack of interest in them.  You can get a good idea of what a model 63 looks like on the S&W website.  Just keep in mind that the one I'm selling has a longer barrel and more conventional adjustable sights.  Face-to-face only.  Cash only if purchase rather than trade.  I am retired, and my time is pretty much my own, so if you have a serious interest, I'm happy to meet you at your local gun shop or range for a personal inspection.  Rimfire revolvers of this quality do not come on the market very often."

It is a Belgium made by FN (says it on the barrel) but was assembled in Portugal (also says that on the barrel).  If you buy Browning's you know about these.  It is nowhere near perfect condition so I do not want to represent it that way.  This gun has been used.  Has a scope but is nothing to brag about.  3X9 and is functional.  Has some marks on the stock and one spot with a deep gouge in the fore end checkering.  Not sure how much it is worth so make me an offer.  Would prefer to trade but will accept a reasonable cash offer.

Product Information

Shop more Hornady products  The Hornady Lock-N-Load Sonic Cleaner takes cartridge case cleaning to the next level. By using a combination of intense ultrasonic cleaning action and the unique One Shot Sonic cleaning solution, this extremely efficient and effective method will remove built up carbon residue from the entire case. The sonic cleaning action cleans the inside of the case, as well as the primer pockets, and outside of the case quicker and more efficiently than any tumbler on the market. Ultrasonic action creates ""Microjets"" that take off the most stubborn carbon from brass cases, gun parts, and other equipment that will fit in the machine.

Special Notes: 
•Hornady suggest only using the approved cleaners above in the sonic cleaner as other cleaners could damage brass or firearms parts
•Ultrasonic Cleaning removes fouling from cases, it does not polish cases. Reloader's looking for polished cases still need to run cleaned cases through a tumbler to achieve a shiny finish"

I purchased this brand new for my 4th gen Glock 23 just over 2 weeks ago. It was an impulse buy and I thought it would be ""tacticool"" to have. Now I have buyers remorse and could really use  the money back in my checking account.

The laser is Literally Brand New! The batteries have less than a minute of use. However, I'm not going to sell it as new because it was installed on my glock briefly and it has a minor blemish from where the punch slipped and left a mark during installation. This does not effect the laser in any way! It is strictly cosmetic but I have lowered my asking price because of it.  (Please see pictures) You get everything that comes in the original packaging.


Specifically designed for the unique contours of 4th Gen GLOCK Compact pistols(19/23), the rear activation LG-851 offers a repeatable sighting advantage for your pistol. These Lasergrips provide the versatility of instant activation from a rear switch - maintaining adaptability with Crimson Trace Lightguard models.

It goes without saying that LMT's are the most reliable and highest quality AR15's you can buy. They have more military and government contracts than any other manufacturer. They also make their rifles 100% in house aside from the barrel which is made by Rock Creek. No other manufacturer does this.

The PMAG (Polymer MAGazine) is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO, M-16 compatible magazine. Fits all standard AR15 style rifles in 5.56mm/.223 caliber.

For those looking for an optic-ready platform, the SIGM400 SRP removes the front sight tower and
replaces it with an M1913 railed front gas block. This sight-ready platform allows the operator to mount
any optic without worrying about the sight tower. The gas block accepts all iron sights designed to work
on the Mil-Spec Picatinny rail.

THE SIGM400 SERIES TACTICAL RIFLE, designed for use in law enforcement, military operations, or the sporting field as well as competitive shooting. The SIG M400 is a true AR platform tactical rifle. Provides unparalleled accuracy, with a 16"" chrome-lined and phosphate coated barrel that provides maximum durability and corrosion resistance. A 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum forged lower receiver adds to the durability and reliability.

Features
- Direct impingement gas operating system with rotating locking bolt
- 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Chrome-lined barrels with phosphate finish
- Accepts most M16 type magazines
- M16A2 Type flash supressor

XS SIGHT SYSTEMS - AR-15/M16 XTI XPRESS THREAT INTERDIC

The XTI express sight system from XS Sights is an offset sight system for the AR-15 style rifle designed in collaboration with Lone Star Armory. The Xpress Threat Interdiction sights are designed to be used as back-up iron sights with magnified optics. The XTI sights are offset so the primary optic will not interfere with the sights and changing between the primary and XTI sights are fast. To transition to the XTI sights simply cant your rifle outboard by approximately 15 degrees and the sights will be visible. These sights are the perfect back-up to a red dot optic in a CQB situation or patrol rifle with a magnified primary optic. The XTI sights are also an excellent addition to a Tac Optics class 3-Gun rifle for those close hoser targets.

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. With the 10.5 inch barrel, it is ideal for close quarters battle or fighting in built up areas. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. And with the 16.1 inch barrel, the M6A2™ rifle can be used as a Squad Dedicated Marksman Rifle.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."

It is topped by a 4x Leupold scope that appears to have been purchased around the same time period as when it was new. I bought this rifle a couple years ago from the original owner. It has a couple of minor scuffs, none through the clear coat of the wood. I have 80+ rounds of commercial ammo that can go with this. the action is glass smoth and has been jeweled. this particular rifle is built upon a Husqvarna action.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

I started making this a more custom but working on something else now. 

The rifle also has a 20 MOA base on the rifle giving almost 100 MOA of elevation and includes Warne quick Detach rings. 

This is an excellent setup long distance shooting, hunting or for whatever you choose. I just put 5 rounds in under a 1/2"" and another 5 at 900 yards with ease using 175 grain Sierra BTHP match. This rifle has exactly 25 rounds through it. 

I have over $2900 in it and will sell for $2450 as I am working on another gun. 

I will take some trades:
3 1/2"" camo semi auto shotgun. A decent brand and like new. 

SOCOM 16 or a Scout and prefer camo stock and if you want more than what they are worth I will pass. 

Decent AR's if priced right. 

1911's Kimbers, Springfield, 

Heavy barrel 7 prefer Remington or Savage as I have triggers and parts for both. 

That's pretty good for trade options and again this rifle is worth every penny. 

Plus pics will be up tomorrow.
