I'm trying to start an Open Carry meetup to support and promote the safe and responsible open carry of firearms in the Onslow county area. Open carry of firearms is completely legal in North Carolina, with a few exceptions (schools, state and federal government buildings, restaurants that serve alcohol, etc). Remember, Open carrying opens up many opportunities to educate fellow citizens about the right to keep and bear arms. Learn more at OpenCarry.org, join us at our next event, and start exercising your right to open carry. If you might be interested in this please e-mail me and I will e-mail you all back with more information on how we can get this started. thanks and I look forward to meeting more 2nd amendment supporters in the near future.

Model: 1911-A1, British Lend Lease, Canadian Contract 

Serial Number: 934715 

Year of Manufacture: 1943 

Markings: The left side of the slide is marked ""Patented Apr. 20. 1897. Sept. 9. 1902. / Dec. 19. 1905. Feb. 14. 1911. Aug. 19. 1913./ Rampant Colt logo / Colt's Pt. F.A. Mfg. Co. / Hartford, Ct. U.S.A."" There is a Canadian Broad Arrow in a C on the left rear of the slide. The top of the slide is a ""P"" a British Proof mark and ""Not English Made"". The barrel, as visible through the ejection port is marked with three British Proof Marks (Please see detailed photos of these). The right side of the frame is marked with the Springfield crossed cannons, an ""8V"" proof, ""United States Property / No. 934715"" and ""Not English Made"". There is another proof mark behind the trigger on the right side (please see photos.) The right side trigger guard bow is marked ""41"". The left side of the frame is marked ""G.H.D."" / ""p"" and with another Canadian Broad Arrow in a “C"". The top of the frame, under the slide is marked ""G"". The underside of the slide is marked ""0"". The left side of the barrel at the lug is marked ""Colt 45 Auto"" and the lug is marked ""P"". The underside is marked ""F"" and ""G"". The rear of the slide, under the firing pin stop, is numbered ""934 / 715"". This is a very well-marked, all correctly marked, Canadian 1911. 

Barrel Length: 5"" 

Sights / Optics: The front sight is a fixed blade. The rear sight is a dovetail set notch. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are checkered brown plastic, with large reinforcement rings. The checkering is sharp and there is little wear at all to the panels. The grips rate in about Excellent overall condition. 

Type of Finish: Parkerized 

Finish Originality: Original 

Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling is sharp. There is no mentionable erosion in the bore. 

Overall Condition: This handgun retains about 90% of its metal finish. There is slight marking to the fragile matte surface, especially on the top of the slide and underside at the dust cover. The British marks are crisp and several are absolutely over the finish. The finish has only barely begun to age and there is general and light edge wear. There is no pitting or erosion, and except for a few surface rubs, this is about the highest condition Canadian 1911-A1 we have ever seen. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are crisp. Overall, this handgun rates in about Excellent condition. 

Mechanics: The action functions correctly. We did not fire this handgun. 

Box, Paperwork & Accessories: One unmarked blued magazine is included. 

Our Assessment: This is a rare gun, one of 1,515 Canadian Lend Lease Colt 1911-A1's, properly marked and in about as sharp of condition as could ever be asked for. These are a well-known segment of 1911 collecting, and no Colt or 1911 collection is complete without one. There is an interesting discussion of these guns here: http://coolgunsite.com/images/1911/1943Colt/1943Colt1911A1.htm 

""Pistols in this serial range (From about serial #930000 to about serial #940000) are often seen with commercial marked (apparently leftovers) slides or commercially marked receivers (marked “S” for “sales” on the top of the receiver). Also in this serial number range all of the known 1,515 Canadian “Lend-Lease” pistols. These Canadian pistols can only be identified by their “Broad Arrow enclosed in a “C” mark” that was applied to the Left rear of the slide and to the left of the receiver above the magazine release. To make things even more interesting, most of the Canadian pistols were returned to England after the war, and due to British proof laws, they were proof marked on the receiver, slide, and barrel with normal British proofs at the time they were disposed of. Therefore a normal Canadian 1911A1 pistol will have both the broad arrow-C marks on the receiver and slide, but will have the normal British proofs as well. Not all of the Canadian Lend Lease pistols were returned to England after the war as some were apparently used in Canadian prisons and possibly elsewhere. These Canadian prison pistols received the “Broad Arrow enclosed in a “C” mark” but did not receive any of the normal British proofs. 

Several years ago the Canadian Government decided to get rid of their “Evil Handguns” by selling them to the “Yanks” and about 6 Canadian property marked M1911A1 pistols were sold at auction in the USA. These pistols were all described as 70% original finish with property numbers electric penciled in the right side of the slide. (The plot thickens!) Several months later a Canadian Lend Lease pistol appeared in the catalog of a well-known, nationally advertised Southern California dealer of US military pistols. The pistol differed from normal Canadian Lend Lease pistols in that it did not have the normal British proofs. Its serial number was IDENTICAL to one of the pistols sold at the auction a few months earlier. However the Southern California dealer described the pistol as having 99+% original finish and had the original shipping box. If only the Monarch Butterfly could match the miraculous metamorphous of this pistol? 

Our pistol has no such irregularities and is exactly as it should be."

Steel, wood grips, brass trigger guard. Made in Italy (Pietta) and imported by Navy Arms of Teaneck, NJ (still in business, but it no longer markets this type of firearm).

The original was made in two versions, one for the Navy (in .36 caliber) and one for the Army (in .44 caliber). One of the identifying features of the Remington New Model revolver was the octagon barrel, which Pietta has kept true to that tradition. The brass trigger guard was also a feature of the original.

The Remington New Model was used quite heavily by the Union Army during the War Between the States and, of course, after the war many found their way to the west and were used during the years of expansion from the late 1860s until at least the 1880s."

This is FMJ ammo with green primer and case mouth sealant.  I believe, from my research on the web, that this is Chilean ammo.  From looking at the head stamp it was made in 1970.  I can not get a better pic of the head stamp than what I have included in my ad.  The round in the pictures is a very good representation of the condition of all the ammo.  I have owned this ammo for many years, though I can not recall how many, prbably since around 2002 when I bought my M1A, or 1995 when I bought my Ishapore Enfield in .308, and it has been in a climate controlled environment the whole time.  I don't know that I ever shot any of it, I collect stuff, but my memory fails me as to if I used it, I haven't shot the M1A or Enfield since 2002 either, as far as I remember.  UPDATE: I'VE RECEIVED INFO. FROM A BUYER THAT IT SHOT JUST FINE IN HIS RIFLE, ACCURACY WISE, THOUGH NOTHING FANTASTIC TO REPORT EITHER, AND THAT HE HAD 2 FAILURES TO FIRE OUT OF 100 ROUNDS.  SO, THAT IS ABOUT WHAT I'D EXPECT FROM THIS AMMO, FUN TO PLINK AND PRACTICE WITH.  The head stamp has: at 12 oclock an F (manufacturer), at 6 oclock 70 (year made), at 9 oclock NA and at 3 oclock TO (NATO).  If I knew for sure what the manufacturer was, I'd probably ask more for it, but since I don't, and I haven't shot it to the best of my memory, I'm asking .50 cents a round.  I will only complete the transaction face to face in the Jacksonville/Richlands/Hubert areas.  I have the ammo packed 80 to a box, in 7 boxes, and 1 box of 70 rounds.  I've listed this as honestly as anyone possibly could, I can't think of anything else to better describe the conditon of this ammo.  If you are worried about age, I wouldn't be, I shoot Winchester .45 ACP ammo from the 1940's with no failures to fire.

Ruger 10/22 Takedown stainless with multicam stock. Gun is factory new in box. I also have a aircraft aluminum 25 round mag to go with it. This will be the last chance to make an offer before I will post on gun broker where they are selling for 700 to 900 make me a fair offer for cash or trade and its yours the last one to sell on gunbroker sold for 700 so if your offer is less don't bother. This rifle will only increase in value as there were only 1000 produced last year for one distibutor in the world. Get it now while you can. Willing to travel within reason to make sale. If ad is still up rifle is still available. 

If you’re not familiar with the 10/22 Takedown, it’s Ruger’s newest version of the 10/22, designed to be broken apart at the barrel for transportation, and comes with a custom backpack and carrying case that’s large enough for the rifle, spare magazines and plenty of ammunition, plus anything else you might want to take on a short hiking or camping trip. Ruger’s Takedown uses a set of adjustable locking lugs with a lot of mass to latch the barrel in place. Unlike the threaded screw-in barrels of other takedown rifles, Ruger’s system will last longer and endure more wear. If it ever gets to the point where the locking system gets a little loose, it can be easily adjusted for a tight fit again. It’s also a lot faster to break down and reassemble. 
It may weigh a little more than other takedown rifles at 4.67 pounds, but it is a 10/22 so it has a massive aftermarket and will last forever. Other specifications include an 18.5-inch barrel, a 13.5-inch length of pull and a gold bead front sight."

Below is my reply: 
    Apparently I have hit a sore spot with you about this rifle.  Obviously, you don’t understand commerce.  Simply to buy something and sell it at a higher price is not price gouging.  Neither you nor anyone else is under any obligation or need that I am aware of to purchase this rifle.  The price that I have put on this rifle is actually a  below the going price for the same product.  Please note the other ads on Armslist, Gunbroker, Guns America or any other venue where individuals can sell guns online.  Besides, a mere 22% gross margin could barely be called profit.
   I have included below a definition of price gouging for your edification.  In the future, if you have an issue with me or one of my ads, please do some research before accusing me of something that is not accurate.  Also, I would give more credence to your claim if you were civil when stating it.

To all users,
I'm confident this individual's response to my ad is not indicative of the caliber of people using Armslist.  I would like to know what you think.  The definition used for price gouging was omitted due to space constraints and may be verified on Wikipedia.

This particular model is the “Civilian or Gunfighter” model in that it has the 4 ¾” barrel and is obviously a black powder frame. The gun has definitely been used. The finish is all but gone and the gun has gone primarily mottled silver. There is still some faint blue left on the frame parts. The roll marks are still discernible on the barrel but very light. The patent roll marks on the left side of the frame are still readable with some imagination. The cartridge designation on the forward bow of the trigger guard is still very clear. When I first saw this piece I really thought someone had worked it over with emery paper but I no longer believe that to be the case. I believe it has just been carried a lot. Mechanically it is very tight. The cylinder times and indexes exactly as it should. There is no hesitation or “Failure to Carry Up”. It locks squarely at top end/dead center at the precise moment the hammer registers on the sear. The bore is what one would expect of a gun of this vintage bearing in mind everything was black powder. There is some small degree of pitting but the rifling is still very pronounced and quite strong with nice sharp edges. The charge holes in the cylinder are not pitted. The frame, grip assembly and barrel all are serial numbered correctly. Pretty neat old gun. Wouldn’t it be great if it could talk. C&R is fine for this piece."

This rifles are known to be insanely reliable in any weather conditions and Remington even put a lifetime warranty on all the nylon material from cracking, breaking or even fading because back in those days if it wasn't wood people didn't trust it.  There is a period correct scope mounted on it right now that is somehow still spot on after sitting for quite a while.  The Nylon 66 is known to be very accurate with just the iron sights and even was famous for attaining the aerial shooting record.  It's in good shape with a few scratches that you could buff out if that's what you wanted.  It has just sat inside the house, we did take it out and shoot it the other day and it was flawless and so accurate that we considered keeping it.

Here is some more info on the Action Slide:
Comparison of action slide lengths: top 7-5/8”, bottom 6-1/2” Measure from top of threads to bottom of collar that holds the action bars. This measurement is critical to fit when ordering forearms or stock sets that include a forearm. For the most part, 20-year and older sporting shotguns and new tactical shotguns use the 7-5/8” slide. New sporting models have used the 6-1/2” slide for almost 20 years. There are exceptions, however. To be sure, measure!  NOTE:  Since 2006, most new 500®, 535® and 835® sporting shotguns with synthetic forearms may not use an action slide tube at all; rather, the pump handle will have two integral bars pinned into the handle itself.  If you have one of these, you cannot use a forearm that was designed to go over an action slide tube without first buying the correct length tube and action slide tube nut."

Pre-panic prices:
Springfield M1A standard black composite rifle: 1650
Boyds Walnut stock with all metals: 200
Archangel stock: 225
Springfield Gen 4 scope mount: 120
Springfield Scout forward scope mount: 112
Springfield Scout handguard: 30
10 Mags, eight 20rd, and 2 10rd, mix of GI and Springfield: 350
M1A black sling: 40

That's over 2700 dollars before prices went through the roof. M1a's are now going for 2500-3500, mags are 50-60 each.
The gun has less than 200 rounds through it, and comes with all original packaging and manuals. Everything is in new or like new condition, The Boyds stock is new.
I have match and ball ammo I can add to any trade or sale too.
Trade value in today's market is easily 4000. Cash offers should be close to that too.
I can trade at pre or post panic values, but you will have to do the same."

I simply don't have a use for this gun and would rather let someone shoot it than have it sit in the closet. Cash only please, I'm not interested in trades. The M-66 model averages $450-850. Due to its condition I'm asking $250.

Springfield Armory® SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. 

They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the 

shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle 

brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new 

Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other 

accessory designed to fit a
standard picatinny rail.

I have had more than a few of these rifles, and this one is by far the most accurate one I have ever owned.

Cycles perfectly, sights are actually ZEROED. Rare for a mosin.
At 100 yards, with iron sights, it will shoot sub 1.5"" (I'm no marksman by any means) very slightly above bullseye.  Perfect 200yd zero. With a scope MOA should be easily achievable.

The KSG is our first entry into the shotgun market.  The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward.  The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel.  Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gauge 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells).  The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube.  The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.  The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine.  A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser.  The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights.  Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included.  The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil."
