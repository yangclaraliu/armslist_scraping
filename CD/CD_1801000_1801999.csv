I bought this new and have never used it.
Review from ""American Rifleman""...The Buffalo Classic is available only in .45-70 Gov’t and features a medium-weight 32"" barrel, adjustable sights and an American black walnut schnabel fore-end and straight buttstock. Nostalgic touches include case coloring on both the receiver and crescent steel buttplate. Locking is accomplished by means of a horizontally sliding locking bolt that engages a bite in the barrel underlug. Depressing a lever just to the right of the hammer retracts the locking bar and allows the barrel to be rotated downward. As the action opens, the automatic ejector snaps rearward, propelling the fired case or live round out of the chamber. There is no active safety on the rifle, but the action includes a transfer bar mechanism that prevents the hammer from contacting the firing pin when the gun is in the hammer-down condition.
The Buffalo Classic’s long barrel produces increased muzzle velocities—as much as 100 f.p.s. higher than nominal published results with the Federal and Winchester loads. The advertised and attained velocities with the Garrett load corresponded almost exactly. Ballistic uniformity was very good, especially with the Federal load, which demonstrated an extreme spread of only 25 f.p.s. Accuracy was excellent, with the Winchester load producing the best average grouping of 1.68"" at 100 yds...with Factory Steel Sights!
At 3¾ lbs., the trigger-pull weight was fine for precise shooting, and its clean, creep-free break made it seem even lighter. The machine-cut, 16-line-per-inch checkering on the wrist and fore-end was reminiscent of 19th century stock work.
There’s not a lot we’d change about the Buffalo Classic. A rubber buttpad might have been preferable to the gun’s steel buttplate, but it would have detracted from the rifle’s authentic look. In sum, the H&R 1871 Buffalo Classic is simple, rugged and gratifyingly accurate.

Comes with what you see in pictures, plus box and papers.
The custom made butt-pad/sling is easy to remove but fits the period and I would imagine make recoil more pleasant than the steel plate that it has from factory.

I have almost $600 in this package:
* $425 + tax for rifle.
* $55 + tax for case
* $40 for leather butt pad
* $45 for sling 
* $35 + tax for ammo

I have a trade value of $500 for this package.

Ruger 22/45 pistols have offered shooters the familiar feel of a 1911 pistol with the performance and value of a Ruger rimfire pistol. Sturm, Ruger is proud to introduce a thoroughly modern family of autoloading pistols, which combines the best of both - the New Ruger 22/45 Mark III pistols. All 22/45 Mark III pistols feature: An unobtrusive internal lock that locks the safety in the ""SAFE"" position. A magazine disconnect to prevent accidental discharge when the magazine has been removed. The first-ever visible loaded chamber indicator for a .22 rimfire pistol. New front and rear sights for faster, more precise target acquisition. New precision-molded polymer grip frame with a serrated front strap and checkered grip panel areas and back strap for a great appearance and comfortable, non-slip hold. A manual safety that positively locks the sear. An internal cylindrical bolt construction ensures permanent alignment and higher accuracy potential than conventional moving-slide designs. A new, contoured ejection port and tapered bolt ears. Two ten-round magazines and high-impact case included with each pistol. All adjustable sight .22 pistols come drilled and tapped for a Weaver-type scope base adapter, included with each pistol.

The HK45 pistol series (compact and full-size models) were chosen as the first firearms made at HK’s American manufacturing facility so it is only fitting that a modified variant would be adopted as the new pistol of a major U.S. special operations unit.
The HK45 Compact Tactical (CT) is the closest a civilian can get to that military pistol. The HK45 CT comes standard with a threaded barrel, 10-round magazine with extended floorplate, and replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the pistol to suit individual hand size and shooting preferences.
The HK45 pistol series were originally developed as candidates for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition so there is little wonder that the HK45 CT is so well-suited for military, law enforcement, and security use. Each HK45 CT comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.
An HK proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces effecting the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.
An “O-ring” barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy. And the threaded barrel on the HK45 CT is made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.
The HK45 Compact Tactical uses all HK45 magazines, from 10-rounders to the smaller capacity 8-round magazine. A Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for mounting lights and accessories is molded into the polymer frame of the HK45 Compact Tactical.

This pistol comes with night sights, two 10rd mags, box and paperwork."

I haven't owned a gun for over 30 years. Since I went deer hunting back in my home state Mississippi, where I was born and raised. I shot my first deer and didn't like the feeling that came over me so I sold my guns. I stuck to fishing which I truly love. Seems like killing a fish is a lot different to me than killing something warm blooded. 
I've recently taken a couple of on line gun safety courses even concealed carry to refresh my memory. 
Now that I'm getting older, ( in my 60's) I don't feel dangerous anymore like a man should feel, and I think that's probably the worst thing thing about getting old. I don't think I should rely on a baseball bat anymore. I need a gun. This gun would be fired at an appropriate place to test and after that go into my night stand by the bed and hopefully never be fired again by me. It would be in the house for protection for me and my wife. The kids are grown and gone so it's just me and her now. I've been looking on this site for awhile and their are so many available and most are so expensive. I've gone on line and googled which is the best to buy for my purpose and there are lots of blogs with lots of different opinions so I've come to the conclusion that I needed a gun that is reliable, easy to load, not to big and not to small. It would have to have enough power to stop a target yet not penetrate to hurt something else behind it. That's why I think a 380 or around that would be choice.
I'm on social security and not rich by no means , I looking at 250-350 range for money.  if anyone has something they feel would work for me and don't want an arm and leg for it let me know, and please don't try and sell me the race horse of guns when all I need is a plow horse as so to speak.

Benelli semi-automatic shotguns operate on the same basic principle of inertial operation with fixed barrel, utilizing the kinetic energy of gun recoil, which still today represents one of the most important and ingenious innovation of sporting weapon production.
This system requires no outlet for gas operation nor barrel recoil, but operates by means of a spring freely interposed between locking head and bolt."

This one somehow escaped the modernization plans of the young Soviet republic, which converted most of the M91 rifles to the M91/30 configuration in an effort to standardize the arms of the Soviet Union. As such it bears the Imperial Arshin rear sight and early style barrel bands. It even bears a Spanish sling hanger indicating it likely saw use during the Spanish civil war! It ranks 8 out of 10 (10 being the rarest) on the Mosin rarity scale at http://62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinRarity.htm . This rifle is clean lacking import marks making it a true collector! Cleaning rod while not shown in the pictures is included with the rifle.

Condition overall is very good. Tula Arsenal markings are clearly stamped on barrel. The Soviet stamp is also visible on the hex receiver. Blueing and finish is about 90% intact. Wood has no splits or cracks, minor scratches are present on left side visible in pictures. Bore is dark, as is common with these guns having fired corrosive ammunition for most of their lives. However the rifling is still strong and passes the ""bullet test"". Bolt operates smoothly and trigger pull is smooth as well. Bolt and magazine are non-matching, also common as these rifles were often rebuilt at some point in their lives. Rear sight leaf spring is broken, replacement is inbound. The buttplate has some rust, however overall this rifle is in very good condition considering it is 85 years old!

$375 OBO Can meet for a FTF deal in Lincoln county, or ship at your expense. I can ship to your door if you're in Nebraska (yes, this is completely legal under state and federal law) but I will need a copy an 01 or 03 FFL to ship to if out of state. Trade interests include ammunition (5.56mm, 7.62x39mm, .308, 6.8SPC, 9mm, 45acp), a .357 magnum revolver or lever action, or other pistols/rifles. Let me know what you got, the worst I'll do is politely decline.

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

The Daniel Defense v7 is one of our latest additions to our M4 rifle family. With the incorporation of our new Modular Float Rail (MFR) 12.0, this rifle provides each shooter with the ultimate in modular adaptability. Should the shooter desire, the tube can be run “slick” with an uninterrupted top rail that runs the length of the tube. In addition, the 3” Modular Picatinny Rail sections allow the shooter to customize the rail set up.

The v7 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down."

About 375 H&H:

The .375 Holland & Holland Magnum is a medium-bore rifle cartridge. The .375 H&H was only the second cartridge ever to feature a belt, now common among magnum rounds. The belt is for headspace, due to the narrow shoulder. The belt replaced the rim in function on these new rimless cartridges.

It was introduced by the British company Holland & Holland in 1912 as the .375 Belted Rimless Nitro-Express. It initially used cordite propellant which was made in long strands – hence the tapered shape of this cartridge, which was also to ensure smooth chambering and extraction from a rifle's breech.

The .375 H&H is often cited as one of the most useful all-round rifle cartridges, especially where large and dangerous game are found. With relatively light bullets in the region of 235 to 270 grains (15 to 17 g), it is a flat-shooting, fairly long-range cartridge ideal for use on light to medium game. With heavy bullets of 300 grains (19 g) and greater, it has the punch necessary for large, thick-skinned dangerous game. In many regions with thick-skinned dangerous game animals, the .375 H&H is seen as the minimum acceptable caliber, and in many places (in Africa, primarily) it is now the legal minimum for hunting such game. African game guides, professional hunters, and dangerous game cullers have repeatedly voted the .375 H&H as their clear preference for an all-round caliber if they could only have one rifle. A similar preference has been expressed by Alaskan game guides for brown bear and polar bear country.

Unlike what is seen in most calibers, many .375 H&H rifles also achieve nearly the same point of impact over a wide range of bullet weights at all commonly used distances, further simplifying a professional hunter's choice in selecting different grain bullets based upon the game hunted. This requires less scope or sight adjustments, which further serves to popularize the .375 H&H Magnum among professional hunters (PHs).

.375 H&H Magnum is the result of competition between British rifle manufacturers to develop new cartridges to take advantage of the new smokeless powders. The 9.5x57mm Mannlicher-Schönauer cartridge had a major influence on British rifle manufacturers and was soon adopted by Westley Richards and Eley as the .375 Rimless Nitro Express 2.25"". In an effort to compete, Holland & Holland introduced the .400/375 Belted Nitro Express. The .400/375 H&H (also known as the .375 Velopex) as it is sometimes known was the first cartridge manufactured to feature a belt. The addition of a belt to a rimless cartridge design provided the advantage of allowing for correct headspacing of highly tapered cartridges (an advantage of flanged cartridges) and smooth feeding through magazine rifles (the advantage of rimless cartridges).

The introduction of the 9.3x62mm Mauser cartridge in 1905 had a profound and lasting influence on hunters in Africa. Compared to the British double rifles, the Mauser was a far cheaper rifle to manufacture and therefore cheaper to acquire. The double rifles gained little from industrialization whereas the Mauser rifles had gained from mass production due to contracts to produce military rifles for many countries. The result was cheap magazine rifles capable of firing one of the very best candidates for the all round hunting cartridge in Africa. The influence of Mauser's K98 action should not be understated; British gun makers such as Rigby were purchasing the Mauser K98 actions for use in their own rifles with their own cartridges. The popularity of the 9.3x62mm Mauser was such that everyone from the German farmers in Africa to the White Hunters from Europe discarded their previous doubles and less powerful magazine rifles and took to the 9.3x62mm. The 9.3x62mm demonstrated that it was adequate for everything from the Elephant to the dik-dik and had acquired a reputation to match.

This trend did not go unnoticed by British rifle manufacturers. Between 1909 and 1911 Holland & Holland, Jeffrey, Rigby and Westley Richards introduced their own competing designs: .375 H&H Magnum, .404 Jeffery, .416 Rigby and the .425 Westley Richards in an effort to stem the tide of the 9.3x62mm. Furthermore, the influence of the high-velocity craze begun by the Canadian .280 Ross rifle had a marked effect on the Holland & Holland’s final design which also drew from their experience with the .400/.375 H&H cartridge.

Holland & Holland decided that the rifle had to fire a bullet with an adequate sectional density as the 286 gr (18.5 g) bullet of the 9.3x62 mm Mauser cartridge which had demonstrated that it had the required penetration on thick skinned dangerous game. Secondly, the cartridge would require a high velocity so as to provide this penetration at extended ranges. The high velocity of the cartridge would have the added advantage of serving as a marketing tool. Thirdly, the cartridge must function reliably through a magazine rifle in tropical conditions and this required a tapered case working at lower pressures. Holland & Holland had determined that to provide adequate penetration a bullet with the sectional density similar to the 9.3x62mm required impact velocities of about 2,150 ft/s (660 m/s). Drawing from anecdotal evidence of hunters it was also determined that high velocities provided impressive kills on game. Another added advantage of the high velocities was that a range misjudgment would be mitigated by the flatter trajectory of a HV projectile.

Holland & Holland’s new cartridge was released together with a flanged or rimmed version (.375 Flanged Magnum also known as the .375 Nitro Express) and was named the .375 Belted Rimless Nitro Express. It featured the belt from the .400/375 H&H cartridge, fired a 300 gr (19 g) bullet which had the same sectional density of the 286 gr (18.5 g) 9.3x62mm bullet at a velocity of 2,500 ft/s (760 m/s). The cartridge burnt cordite and had a rather low working pressure of 47,000 psi (3,200 bar) by modern standards so that spent cases would extract reliably in tropical environments of India and Africa.

The new cartridge was a proprietary design unlike the 9.3x62mm and was considerably longer than its German counterpart. While many .375 H&H rifles were built on the longer magnum Mauser actions, these actions were considerably more expensive and rarer than the standard actions. Standard actions could be used but required modifications to allow for the feeding and cycling of the .375 H&H Magnum cartridge. So while the .375 H&H provided considerable advantages over the 9.3x62mm the significantly greater cost of the H&H rifles presented a roadblock to the adoption of the .375 H&H over the 9.3x62mm cartridge and remained for a time a less attractive option.

At the end of World War I Holland & Holland released the cartridge to the public for general trade. Also, new markets opened in America as more hunters sought to hunt in Africa. The .375 H&H was seen by many as the best medium bore cartridge available and which could be easily put to use hunting dangerous game in North America. Winchester was the first US gun maker to produce rifles chambered for the cartridge and did so beginning in 1925.

The end of World War II saw many gun makers turning to the civilian shooting market when war time contracts began running out. FN, Mauser, Remington and Winchester began turning out quality bolt action rifles and with increasing number of sportsmen taking to Africa saw the .375 H&H increasing in popularity. A further boost in popularity came when African colonies enacting legislation stipulating that the 9.3 mm (0.37 in) or the .375 in (9.5 mm) be the minimum bullet diameter for dangerous game. The legislating away of sub minimum cartridges forced the users of these cartridges to pick up a cartridge which qualified for the shooting of these game species and the logical choice was to move up to the .375 H&H Magnum."

On the frame just below the slide stop is stamped “FJA”, below the mag release is stamped “P”, right side of the trigger guard is stamped “2”, top of the slide in front of the rear sight is stamped “P”. Of the Ithaca 1911's that I have come across, the condition is definitely one of the nicer ones I have seen, also comes with a leather military flap holster stamped “BOYT -42-” on the back.

Up for sale is a 32 caliber black powder rifle that has been restored for shooting in 1958. This piece of history was found at the Pea Ridge Battlefield in Arkansas in the late 1800's. The restoration was done by Jackson Arms in Dallas. The outside metal pieces were plated to strengthen. The hammer was welded and also plated for strength. The stock was cleaned to reveal a beautiful piece of burled wood and an epoxy finish was added to seal the wood. It could be restored to the original condition if it was so desired. This would include removing the epoxy and giving the wood an oil finish and having the metal refinished to a brown or rusty appearance. The rifle was shot successfully in 1958 and hasn't been shot since. Any further shooting should be done after a complete look over by a gun smith since the metal is over 150 years old. After doing some research into the battle it appears that a Cherokee Chief and 400 warriors fought tenaciously for the Confederate cause. Its theorized that this rifle was used by a wealthy Indian in the battle. The two regular armies facing each other had larger caliber weapons with bayonet attachments. This rifle, although likely made in a small gunsmith shop, was obviously well crafted and expensive far above a federal issue army rifle. It would seem reasonable that this deer caliber rifle was used in the battle by an Indian and not a Confederate or Yankee soldier. The Indians were fighting to preserve their acquired wealth and property in farming using slaves, a fact not known by many Americans. Some of the personal effects of the Indian Chief at the Pea Ridge Battle can be seen at the museum in Jefferson, TX.
 I am listing this for my father and can field most questions of the rifle. There is documentation for the rifle and a photo copy of a map where the rifle was found. Not sure what the value of the rifle actually is we will be taking offers for the rifle. Please no low balls and only serious offers. If you have taken the time to read this then you know as well as I that anything with documentation to the Civil War there is an added value placed on the item. Call REDACTED"

All you guys talking, ""I can go get THIS from HERE for this PRICE..."" DO IT. Then you'll find out exactly how stripped and cheap those ""Great Price"" AR's are. I understand that most of you don't know an AR from an AK (everybody starts somewhere) but this is one sport where you're stupidity WILL cost you... and cost you a lot! And at the same time Trying to be the Cool Kid with the most expensive stuff isn't necessary either.

AR's are like Tattoos... Good Tattoo's aren't cheap and cheap Tattoo's aren't good.
My rifle's price is cheap because I want someone else to enjoy it, but by no means is it cheap... I'll put it up against any Colt, DD, Noveske, ect.. any day of the week. And if you wanna bet some money on it... ""I'll be your huckleberry.""

It comes with 3 20 round FN Factory magazines, lock, factory cleaning kit, factory case and paperwork. The FN Five-seveN® pistol was developed in the early 1990s and features a cold hammer-forged barrel that is chrome lined for extended service life. The polymer-framed FN Five-seveN® offers single-action operation, low felt recoil, 20-round magazine capacity and is equipped with an ambidextrous, forward-mounted manual safety and an accessory rail that accepts tactical lights and lasers.

At the buyer's discretion, I will also include five or six boxes of once fired brass. The Five-seveN deserves the hotter loads it was designed for (I don't have the talent for making such rounds but I always hoped I'd find someone that could locally... never did).

It's had around 200 rounds put through it and was originally planned for use in IPSC when my local organizers were assuring me it was going to be a legal gun to use. Love the gun but have no use for it!

This is a older model as seen from the case and model in the pictures. It's spring is designed for military spec loads (SS190) but FN was offering a free spring replacement for lower velocity rounds. I found that it had no problems feeding SS192 and SS195 the small amount I shot it.

I'm unlikely to take trades but will entertain any reasonable offer. I work at times in Santa Fe and would be perfectly willing to bring it along for a sale. Please bring a driver's license and be willing to sign a statement that you are not a felon.

It shows a pellet symbol next to the stock, so it will shoot lead free pellet, I have never tried shooting a pellet. 

It is very hard to make a clean shot because the rear sight is loose, it needs to be secured to the barrel and sighted in, once it is sighted in, you can make a clean shot, this is an easy task, I just don't have the time to secured it to the barrel and sight it in for a bulls eye.

I'm sure you guys know how that is.  Don't need or want to sell all, but figured it would be easier to make one ad.  So here goes...

I have a Saiga 12 with a Tapco adjustable stock, original 4 round mag, and a nib Pro Mag 20 round drum.  Has maybe 500 rounds thru it. No damage, but it is used and works great.  Also has different barrel thread protector and different sight on top(not a big deal, but they're aftermarket).  I want $1,500 for it.

I have a Springfield XDM competition model with fully adjustble rear sight (elevation and windage) with the 5.25 inch barrel chambered in 9mm Luger.  This gun has maybe 80 rounds or so thru it.  It will come with 5 total 19 round mags, and 100+ rounds (brass cased) as well as all the XD gear (mag holder, holster, case etc).  This gun is looks and functions like new.  This obviously isn't like rifles, this is full size model which can only accept 19 round mags.  That being said, you will not see these for sale in Colorado next week.  In addition to that, you cannot buy a handgun from neighboring states like you can long guns.  This may very well be your last chance to get your hands on one of these.  I want $1,200 for everything.  

Last but definately not least...my Draco pistol.  This is a Romanian AK style pistol chambered in 7.62x39 imported by C.A.I. (I believe).  I have two original steel mags and rubber Hogue grip and 760 rounds of Tul-ammo (some FMJ but mostly HP).  This gun has no more than 25 rounds thru it and looks and functions like brand new.  I want $1,300 for everything.  

I am only selling the guns with the apropriate things with them and will not split things up (like mags, ammo etc).  I will make a deal to you if you buy multiple guns.  I am not accepting trade offers, sorry guys!!!!!  All prices are firm.  I'm not trying to gouge anybody, just trying to get what i have out of these things.  I unfornuately can't find a deal on anything to save my life so I need what I need.  Please don't tell me you just bought one for x amount, I know there are deals out there to be had, I just wasn't so lucky.    Best way to get ahold of me is to call/text me at REDACTED.  If i don't answer, it's just because i'm busy, so please leave name number and what your interested in and I WILL get back to you when I get a chance.  I am a motivated seller, as I only have 6 days to get these sold.  Sorry, but in can only text pictures.  FYI, I live in Byers (which is about 40 miles east of Aurora) but will meet in Aurora (somewhere around Tower and I-70) if your a serious buyer.  Sorry, but i cannot drive that far to have people take a look.  If you come to my place you could test fire (that's a couple rounds, not 100).  Will do Bill of Sale!"
