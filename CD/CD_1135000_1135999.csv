Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide
extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming
chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to
accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™
flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX
III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories.
The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high
hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also
a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme
corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a
single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened
steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement
in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind
even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium
ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible
life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower
strength S7 more commonly used. 

Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with
Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a
Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by
MagPul Industries. One windowed 30 Magpul magazine is included.
i will also include a box of 20 Hornady VMax 110gr target ammo.

I had to have it. I was toting around my Russian made SKS 7.62x39mm which got a lot of attention. At the time I did not want to sell it. This gun is milled so it is extremely accurate at 100-150 yards. Its curtains for any animal on all fours with this hell fire round. Gun bore is shiny as any BRAND new barrel. It's been well taken care of. No pitting or any rust for that matter. All serial numbers match from butt stock to barrel. Dealer offered me 750.00 at the gun show. Like I said I wasn't ready to sell earlier. Not until I took the hit when I checked my balance. Don't get me wrong I am not hurting but got to explain Momma where the money went if I don't sell my ever so reliable and extremely clean SKS all Russian. Not a Chinese piece of junk. Sorry Norinko fans. I will let this gun go for 750.00 firm. Pretty soon this wont be available, not for this price. At the gun show they were selling ones in worse shape for 1200.00. That is highway robbery if you ask me. Anyway I think in todays environment with prices for these gun just going up. 750.00 is an honest and fair price for this all russian made beauty. Made by Tula in Russia. It is so cool cause it's got russian writing all over it. Adds flavor to an awesome rifle. Gives you some wiggle room to add new furniture if you want. If I were you I would keep it just the way it is. Eats rounds flawlessly. Gonna protect in times of need. I would choose this rather than a Wasr 10/63 anyday. Plus for a lot less too. Hit me up if your interested. Setup for the quick sale. Must have valid ID and not be a felon. First 750.00 gets it. Oh it has all the original cleaning kits with original bayonet with original military green strap. Barrel is hammer forged and chrome so this will eat any ammo corrosive or non corrosive.

The pics speak for themselves on the quality of his work and just how meticulous he is... The brass has been polished to the point that it looks brand new.

Anyway... All of this was done on a Dillon Super 1050 with all the bells and whistles including a powder check station.

It's Once fired brass loaded with 5.0 Grains of Bullseye, Federal Primers, and 165gr Rainier Ballistics Bullets.

Can meet in Lake of the Ozarks area or Jefferson City or close to either...

This is an affordable, military surplus, semi-auto rifle that shoots the 7.62x39 (ak47)cartridge.  It has matching serial numbers, a 10 round internal magazine and can be loaded quickly with the use of stripper clips and comes with cleaning rod and bayonet .  This rifle would probably be at the end of any future ban list. There is a fair amount of aftermarket stocks and hi cap mags from Tapco and other companies for the sks so this rifle is highly customizable if so desired.

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle with the 14.7 inch barrel is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600+ meters.

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs.

LWRCI™ has engineered a complete solution to the deficits found in the direct impingement M16/AR15/M4 family of rifles and carbines. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature a patented short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, because it eliminates the venting of hot, carbon-laden gases into the receiver and bolt carrier group, thus eliminating the intensive cleaning regime of the legacy rifle. It also means the bolt carrier group and associated springs are not subjected to the searing heat of the tapped gasses, this being one of the major causes of small parts failure. This translates into carbines that are far more reliable than the legacy direct impingement carbines regardless of user maintenance, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing the need for both user and armorer maintenance.

Another benefit of the LWRC short-stroke gas-piston system is the improved handling characteristics of our weapons over the direct impingement legacy weapons. Recoil is lighter and muzzle rise is greatly reduced. Amazingly, this is accomplished in a carbine that is ergonomically identical, weighs almost the same, and retains 80% parts commonality with the legacy direct impingement carbine.

All LWRCI M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown, made from 41V45 steel alloy blanks. Cold hammer forging takes an oversized barrel blank, and using high pressure rotary hammers, compacts the barrel blank over a mandrel. This forms perfect rifling without any tool marks. It also compacts the molecular structure of the metal making it denser and stronger. These barrels can take a lot more use and abuse than a standard barrel before any degradation in accuracy or loss of velocity.  After forming, the barrels are treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology. vNiCorr™ surface conversion has proved more lubricious, harder wearing, more heat and corrosion resistant than the hard chrome normally used in the bore. LWRC barrels can handle 20,000 rounds before replacement, as compared to 6,000-10,000 rounds on a standard M4. The NiCorr™ surface conversion technology extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon.

The bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the LWRC M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts. The nickel-boron surface conversion nearly eliminates corrosion while providing greatly increased lubricity. This nickel coating is similar to that being used by the US Army Research Lab and USSOCOM to extend the service life of their weapons systems.

The M6A2™ rifle is the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and LWRC’s M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

The only down side is the previous owner carved his initials into the wood stock. I simply covered it with a shell holder which is included in the sale. The three slugs in the pic also go with the gun. I have fired this gun a few times at the range. It is pretty picky on what shells it likes for example it fires Winchester ammo without fault, but with Remington it takes two falls of the hammer to ignite the primer.  Simply sticking to Winchester ammo solves the problem.

Included with each pistol is a 100rd value pack of Winchester 165gr FMJ ammunition.  When I purchased both of these pistols, I chose them from a lot of about 20, and picked out the ones in the best mechanical condition.  Both of these pistols do show some external wear from holster carry, but they are in excellent mechanical condition with excellent springs.  I was a Glock armorer for my police department back in my law enforcement days, and I've disassembled these pistols completely, inspected them, and thoroughly cleaned them.  I've also fired about 100 rounds of various ammo through each of them with no malfunctions.  These pistols are cleaned, lubed, reliable, accurate, and ready for use.  If you check around the local retailers and gun shops, you'll see that the package I'm offering is for a good price.  Most retailers are selling these police trade-ins right now in the $500 range + tax, and with only one mag.
