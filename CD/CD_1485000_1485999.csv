This firearm was purchased from a guy in Kansas City who said that before he acquired the gun, this gun was sent to a gun smith who performed a trigger job, smoothed ramps, and a couple other modifications.  If necessary, I can put you in touch with him as I'm not really familiar with what was done or why.  It doesn't feel any different then the other Taurus PT1911 I owned.

With that being said, this gun was sold to me under the pretense that is is new and never fired.  I also havent fired this weapon.  Primarily lookng for a nice carry conceal weapon, bayonet weapons, or just about anything of value.  Would like to get 800 cash or if its some oddball trade, would like to get 1000.  Have been offered quite a bit of deals where the other person value was closer to 600 and I'm not really interested in a deal like that either.  I have two sets of grips, one is the factory black grips where as the other is a nice set of wood grips.

Call / txt me with any questions, comments, or concerns!

Thanks

-------------------------------------------------------
This is a S&W M&P 22 that I bought in late fall 2012 for my son and I to plink with in the back yard.  We shot about 100 rounds (I bought a 333 22lr box for it and still have 200-ish rounds left) through it before winter set in.  My son just bought a 22lr revolver for himself so I don't need this any more.

The gun is in absolutely mint condition - there are no scratches, scuffs, marks or blemishes anywhere on the gun.  All the factory packaging, accessories and paperwork that was with the gun when I bought it is still there.  You literally are getting a brand new gun condition for much less than brand new price.  The pictures tell the whole story.

This Western style 6-shooter will allow you to practice good old fashioned iron sight shooting with the dependability of a revolver.  The only thing it’s missing is the leather holster, which is available at:  

http://www.huntercompany.com/

This is a fully functional pistol with a 6 ½” barrel, blue finish, and cocobolo grips. It’s a cowboy pistol that’s still made in the USA - like they're supposed to be. This Heritage is both classy and functional.  

Spring is here and the wagon trains filled with .22 ammo can’t be far off.  What better way to spend a warm spring day than to take your new pistol out to the range and shoot up some cans.  In case those wagon trains are delayed, this will shoot .22 long, .22LR, .22 short, and .22 birdshot rounds.  

This is a newly manufactured steel frame pistol. This is not an aluminum frame like many of the old .22 revolvers were. Feel free to bring your own magnet and stick it to the frame. :) 

This firearm comes with the original box, all of the paperwork, and a light coat of oil from the factory still on it.   I will also include 100-rounds of .22LR ammo.  

This revolver is suitable for wearing at your side while cooking beans over a campfire, moseying down to the local saloon, or meeting Black Bart and Ned Pepper at High Noon.  

I'm not interested in shipping this firearm. FTF sale and I will need to see a permit to carry or purchase and valid ID. I will fill out transfer paperwork for my records; the paperwork is not intended to go anywhere else. 

The price is $200 firm, suggested MSRP is $199.99 (plus shipping, tax, FFL fee, and hard to find ammo). Heritage website:

Model Number: RR22B6.

I am also interested in: Savage bolt action rifles with an AccuTrigger in .17HMR or .22LR. I understand the value of your rifle may be more than my pistol.  Let me know if there's a price difference."

I recall when I bought them (they are in a DSA bag and are greasy) the guy told me he had hand-picked them, and they are really in near new shape.

These are Steyr magazines and have stickers on them that say ""Made in Austria""....three are new and the other seven have been used and carried, but very little. Some parkerizing is rubbed off the edges of the used ones but all should function flawlessly. One has a ding in one side but the follower slides well and if you are concerned, pull the thing apart and it should easily tap out from inside with a block of wood....never used it so haven't bothered.

The pics are hi-res so you can save them and zoom in to see the details.....the mag in the front is the one with the small ding in the side - you can see it if you look hard.

I have a friend who says these are quite scarce now....really hard to find nice metric ones, let alone at this price, and he advised that I price them at $40 each, but I would like to move them out quickly so am asking $25 each, or ALL TEN (10) FOR $200.00 cash.

Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers.

EASY TO CONCEAL. IMPOSSIBLE TO IGNORE.

The P229 is one of the most popular SIG SAUER pistols ever made, and carried by thousands of law enforcement professionals throughout the country. The compact size of the P229R makes it ideal for concealed carry. The P226, like the other members of the SIG Classic family, operates by the locked breech short-recoil method pioneered by John Browning. On firing, the slide and barrel are locked together for a few millimeters of rearward movement, after which the barrel is cammed down at the rear. By this time the bullet has left the barrel and the pressure has dropped to safe levels, whereupon the slide completes the rearward stroke, ejecting the spent cartridge. The recoil spring then propels the slide forward, stripping a round from the magazine and in the last few millimeters of forward movement the barrel is cammed upwards, locking the slide and barrel together again. This new version has the new designed slide profile and ergonomic grip.

While its Full-auto ancestor was made famous in the Battle of Berlin in 1945; the New PPS50/22 is styled like the PPSh-41. It is Semi-Auto, Drum fed, caliber .22LR, Solid Wood Stock, and the Barrel has a Full-length, Perforated Heat Shield, just like the Soviet PPSh-41.

The PPS50/22 looks like the soviet PPSh-41, especially when equipped with the Quick-release Drum Magazine. Made in .22LR caliber, you can Shoot All Day Long, because .22LR ammunition is inexpensive and reliable. With its adjustable rear sight and sharp-blade front sight, it rivals far more expensive rifles in accuracy.

The PPS50/22 has a secure, semi-auto action, a smooth trigger, a high-quality and nicely-fitted stock, making Shooting All Day Long very comfortable and a lot of fun! The PPS50/22 is equipped with studs to accept swivels and a sling.

Preserve the original Soviet WWII look with the 50-round drum magazine. Buy Your Own PPS50/22 You can re-live a bit of History, and have fun doing it! It’s a Perfect Rifle for target practice with its sharp outline sights – tin cans and small varmints, Beware! Simple to use, very inexpensive to operate, and utterly reliable. Not nearly as heavy as its center-fire ancestor, you can have fun all day long with your PPS50/22; and, at the end of the day, you won’t be tired and then you can go buy some more .22LR ammunition."

The FNS series is an all new autoloading service pistol design introduced to law enforcement in 2011.

The manual safety lever, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel and the checkered polymer frame has two interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.

The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the pistol ensures a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting.

Available in 9mm, this firearm can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals.

Call REDACTED for info.

The ASC-H, or Advanced Squad Carbine – Heavy, is the beefed up bother of the ASC previously released from ECHO 1. It features a larger 7.62mm style magazine and has a slightly bigger lower receiver. While externally this rifle might just look like a more muscular version of the ASC, internally the two rifles are worlds apart. This rifle is cloned after its VFC counterpart and therefore inherited many of its innovative features.

One of the most noteworthy things about this model is that the whole rifle can be broken down after pushing out only one body pin. The rifle uses contact plates at disassembly points instead of fishing the wires through the body which allows it to be field stripped in under thirty seconds. Then by loosening six captured screws you are able to lift the whole barrel group out of the upper receiver. The rifles feature laser etched markings and are finished in a non-reflective flat finish giving them a more tactical appearance than previous models. Overall the ASC-H is a well built rifle with a long list of features.

•Metal upper receiver with polymer lower. 
•Compatible with VFC Mk. 17 series magazines. 
•6 position retractable side folding stock, locks in open position. 
•Flip-up front and rear sights are adjustable and can be removed if desired. 
•4 sling attachment points. 
•MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rails on top, sides and under barrel. 
•Ambidextrous selector switches and mag catch. 
•Functional bolt catch. 
•14mm CCW threaded muzzle. 
•Metal Version 2 gearbox. 
•Steel gears running on 7mm bearing bushings. 

When we locked in one of its magazines and turned this bruiser loose on the range it quickly proved it has the muscle to back up its looks. Clocking in at an average of 400 fps at the muzzle this rifle quickly disintegrated our target and with only small amount of its massive high capacity magazine depleted it was ready for more. With a 9.6v battery the ASC-H pumps out a steady 700 rounds per minute which is only slightly faster than that of its real steel counterpart. ECHO 1 ships this rifle with a custom 9.6v battery pack although we found you are able to use a regular mini type 9.6v battery in the rifle which only inhibits you from collapsing the stock to its last position.

For those of you who have been wanting to get your hands on one of these rifles but could not quite see dropping the money for a VFC, the ECHO 1 ASC-H has certainty proven that it is a highly capable rifle which offers a lot of bang for your buck.

Model: FNS-40
Caliber: .40S&W



The FNS series is an all new autoloading service pistol design introduced to law enforcement in 2011. Chambered in the hard-hitting 40 S&W, the FNS-40 offers the simplicity of double-action striker-fired operation with the additional security of a manual safety. The manual safety lever, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel and the checkered polymer frame has two interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers.

The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the pistol ensures a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting. The FNS has a low bore axis providing minimized perceived recoil and reducing muzzle rise for perfect weapon controllability. The handgun features a newly designed three-dot combat sights with deep rear sight notch which has improved accuracy significantly.

All modern semi-automatic pistols trace their roots to the famed Colt M1911 pistol, designed by John Browning. The design was so good that it was the standard-issue U.S. military sidearm from 1911 to 1985. Destined to become the standard that all 1911 pistols are compared against, the Taurus 1911 offers you the most accurate and feature-laden model on the market today. Starting with their own hammer-forged -not cast- ordnance grade steel frames, slides and barrels, Taurus machines each and every part to tolerance levels that surpass industry standards. Taurus’s skilled pistol smiths hand-fit and tune each gun, using quality parts that are built 100% in their state-of-the-art factory. Then they mark the slide, barrel and frame with matching serial numbers. Available in the powerful .45 ACP, this aggressive, rock-solid firearm is ready to go right out of the box. The Taurus 1911 is an unbeatable gun that is also an unbeatable value.

One at factory.
Two by me to insure correct operation when I purchased it new.

Extras/upgrades:  A set of Speedsights tritium night sights were installed by the famed XD HS2000 - they look stock and trust me, they are spot on.  The contrasting white diamond rear and orange diamond front is very easy to pick up, and the tritium glows quite strongly.  I also still have the factory white 3 dot sights.

I've got:  Henry Golden Boy (.22 lever action rifle) NEW IN BOX, comes with Brass Buttplate, Brass Receiver and the optional and coveted Brass Barrel-Band; also has the preferred Octagon Barrel with the gold engraving on both sides. It also will come with the Henry Model Cantilever scope mount that I ordered from the Henry website. Henry doesn't drill and tap nor cut scope grooves, in the brass receiver of the Golden Boy, so they make and sell their own scope mount just for this rifle. The scope mount attaches to the top of the barrel by removing the rear site and bolting scope mount to top of barrel. It's all new, it's all Henry. I intended on putting a scope on here, that's why I ordered their scope mount off of the Henry website. I went through some pictures of Henry Golden Boys with scopes and found the scope that looks great on this cowboy rifle...it looks right- so I ordered it. It will likely be here after the rifle is sold. I'll put it on something else I guess. Bought this for my wife's birthday,  but it is too heavy for her, she couldn't handle it, so I had to go right back out and buy a regular Henry (the blued model with the round, not octagon barrel) that one is a little lighter and she can manage it. The wood is very dark and is beautiful on this rifle. As I mentiioned, I now have the regular Henry, the ""blued"" .22 lever rifle; the wood on this Golden model is so much nicer. I have never had anything like this rifle; the lever action is smooth like butter, the brass gleams all over like it's made of gold...it will be hard for someone to shoot it because it is so incredible looking. It came with a velvet ""sock"" wrapped around the brass receiver, Henry shipped it that way. It's a piece of art. It's not cheap, but there's nothing else like it.
I've got $695.00 in it, ..they are a little hard to find, Henry Manufacturing experienced a Hurricane and then a fire at the plant and production halted. I drove for a 5 hour round trip to get this one. Then ordered the scope mount from Henry. All total I've spent 695.00, I need 600.00 cash for it or 650.00-695.00 in trade, or I won't sell it. I won't give it away. The pictures are with the Henry scope mount installed. I put it on so that you could see it installed. You can see how it sits over top the receiver without touching the receiver. It's ready for a scope. The Henry box for that mount is in the picture too. I will take the mount off if you want...and put the rear site back on if you like. Or leave it the way it is and give you the rear site in a ziplock. However you like. Email if you want 10 or so more pictures.
The pics don't do the brass justice...not at all. It's perfect. I'll also give you 200 rounds of ammo just in case you have none."

9mm and 40S&W brass is available in cleaned condition, once-fired. Stamped Win, Fed, Rem, S&B, and Speer.  Some others but only a low percentage.  There may be a few military cases but very few.  Nickel plated 9mm is mostly Federal.  
Once-fired 223 brass is also available. mostly LC Lake City, some commercial brass is mixed in. Brass cases are cleaned only. May or may not need primer pocket swaged/ crimp removed. Most dinged cases are removed. This is not loaded ammo, and no other components are available.  All brass is counted by weight and usually is exact or a little over. Cleaned to reloading standards, not necessarily ""bright like new"". Annealing discoloration is a very common factory process that adds to longer case life.

No silencer comes with it! You must get a special permit to put one on it! This is a very rarely seen and very unique German WWII P-38! It is a GI's war trophy bringback, it is Not Russian, Not import marked, Not dipped, Not refinished! It is the wonderful original German Mauser Phosphate finish from 1944! Of course there is no way to prove if the gun came straight from the Mauser factory with the threaded barrel! But there is what appears to be original phosphate finish in the threads, that is the only sign it could be so. The gun could also have been made up by the German police, SS or other Gestapo group at a field repair depot, or even a captured arms plant like FN in Belgium for example. Just like they made up so many K98 sniper rifles! The gun could have been made up by the French or Belgian resistance is another possibility. Of course it could have been made up with the silencer stateside by the Mafia! There is just no way to prove or know anything for sure, so you must decide for yourself! The gun does have all original, all phosphate finish, a scarce variation in itself! Most are dual-tone. It does have the normally seen blued parts, trigger, rear sight, and magazine. The threaded barrel protector is blued as well. The gun is all matching, serial 7008d, and has the correct Mauser ""sawdust red"" grips and WaA135 proofed magazine as well. The bore is mirror bright with deep rifling, there is a mark or partial ring in the bore, near the muzzle, apparently from being threaded so deep. The pistol functions just fine but you must have your gunsmith inspect and approve it before firing. This is a fantastic find! Could be Gestapo, resistance or Mafia! A World War II P-38 with threaded barrel for a silencer!"

It has steel floor plate, a steel trigger guard, and adjustable trigger. I've polished the action until it is very smooth. There is no hitch in it at all.  The Trigger beaks like glass. And a fully bedded fiberglass hunting stock.  You're probably wondering why I'm selling my Ruger treasure.  Along with that sledge hammer killing power goes sledge hammer recoil.

Details are below:
TAVOR SAR Flattop 16.5"" Barrel Black Finish

At the end of the 1982 Israel-Lebanon War arose an understanding that the modern battlefield had changed. One of the conclusions from the war, particularly relevant to the small arms industry, was that the battle had moved from open field conflicts to close-quarters engagements – and there was a need for a seamless transition from daylight to nighttime capability on a single mission. Out of this understanding, and after more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts.

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

I have 4 high-capacity Ruger Mini 14 mags for sale.  3 of these are (I believe) pre-ban PMI, the company that made the ""factory"" mags for Ruger.  I have one factory ruger mag to compare them to, and the PMI mags are just as heavy and made just as well as the factory one.  They have welded lugs on the back, the same followers and springs, etc.  They also function flawlessly in my Mini-14 Ranch.  Two of the mags are 30 round, and one is 20 round.
The last mag is an aftermarket, probably a Promag or something like that.  It still works fine in my Ranch, but is slightly lighter with a stamped lug.  All the mags are lightly used.  The PMI mags are in a line in the pics; the aftermarket one is in the last pic.

I would like $40 for the 20-round PMI, $50 each for the two 30-round PMI's and $35 for the 30-round aftermarket mag.  If you purchase them all I would sell them for $150, plus I'll throw in the military magazine pouch and free shipping.

Also comes with the Henry Model Cantilever scope mount. Henry doesn't drill/tap nor do they cut scope grooves into the brass receiver of their Golden Boy, so they make and sell their own scope mount just for this rifle. The scope mount attaches to the top of the barrel by removing the rear site and bolting the scope mount to the top of the barrel. It's all new, it's all Henry. I intended on putting a scope on here, that's why I ordered their scope mount. I went through many pictures of Henry Golden Boys with scopes installed and found the scope that looks great on this cowboy rifle...it looks right- so I ordered it. It will likely be here after the rifle is sold, so I'll put it on something else I guess. The wood is very dark and is beautiful on this rifle. I have the regular Henry, the ""blued"" .22 lever rifle; the wood on this Golden model is so much nicer. I have never had anything like this rifle; the lever action is smooth like butter, the brass gleams all over like it's made of gold...it will be hard for someone to shoot it because it is so incredible looking. It came with a velvet ""sock"" wrapped around the brass receiver, Henry shipped it that way. It's a piece of art. It's not cheap, but there's nothing else like it.
I've got $695.00 in it, I need 600.00 back, to sell/trade it.   These are a little hard to get right now.  Henry Manufacturing experienced a Hurricane and then a fire at the plant and production halted.  I drove for a 5 hour round trip to get this one. Then bought the scope mount from Henry. All total I've spent 695.00, I need 600.00 of it back, I won't give it away. The pictures are with the Henry scope mount installed. You can see how it sits over top the receiver without touching the receiver. It's ready for a scope. The Henry box for this mount is in the picture too. I will take it off if you want...and put the site back on if you like. Or leave it the way it is and give you the rear site in a ziplock. However you like. Email if you want 10 or so more pictures.
The pics don't do the brass justice...not at all. It's perfect. I'll also give you 200 rounds of ammo just in case you have none."

Known officially as: M3, sniperscope, infrared, set no. 1, 20,000 volts. Made by american optical co. Buffalo, NY 6-23-51. Made to be mounted on a special M1 carbine known as the M2 carbine making the whole setup a M3. 

Very good condition. Really nice for how old it is. How does it compare to others? I don't know. I've never seen one that wasn't in a book or on the internet. This is the only one I have ever seen. Very rare, very cool piece of American Military History.

What is there and what isn't. This comes with the IR scope, IR Light, Foregrip/ Handle with the trigger, power transformer box, all necessary original wiring, 1 tube, original rubberized backpack(nice), and original chest. As far as what is missing? I'm really no expert but I think there was a tool set and more tubes. These are not there. And of course no .30 carbine. No rust anywhere and looks to be the original finish. Some scratches on the scope but not bad. A little corrosion on a small copper piece behind the light source. And it looks like the red filter is a little rough. The outside plastic of the light source is fine, its the red filter inside. I have not taken this apart or tried to clean any of it. 

Because this is so rare I did not want auction it, I wanted a lot of people to have a shot at owning it. Same with gun broker. I found it in Mn I would like a collector in MN to give it a good home. So I figured the only fair way to do it wold be to take offers. So, if you want it, take a shot at it and email me your best offer. If you know what it is, you know what its worth, and how often you can find one.

As far as trades go... I might, might, take one of the following as partial trade with cash. 1. Ruger .44 carbine semi-auto. Prefer older tube fed. 2. Ruger No. 1 in 270 win, 280 rem, 30.06 or 303 brit. 3. HK usp Tactical all black. Of course these guns must be nice.

Of course all cash is always nice. FTF meet. Leave your name and number or I will not get back to you.

Thanks for looking."
