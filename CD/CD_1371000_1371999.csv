 Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles are the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles."

The finish on this pistol is about as good as it gets. 

While waiting for this pistol to be completed, we stumbled on a Browning Medalist which she instantly wanted and never shot this Ruger.

So this Ruger has sat in my safe for 28 years.  It was test fired by the gunsmith only.  Sorry no box or paperwork.

I'm looking to get a Taurus Judge or a 357. I'm looking to get a shorter barreled gun so I can have the option of easily concealing it when I want. Shoot me an email with what you have that meets these specs - please include your price, where you're located and info about your gun (specs, condition, estimated round count, etc).

Also, for trade I have the following that I could potentially use in a deal:
1. Mosin Nagant 91/30 with 400 rounds of ammo. This has been fully decked out - custom camoed Monte Carlo stock, professionally cut & crowned barrel (to 22""), scout mounted pistol scope.
2. I also have various rounds of ammo, but I'm honestly not too eager to trade on these - but I might if the deal was right (22, 22mag, 9s, 223, etc)

Again - just let me know what you have. I'm just getting in the market for one of these so I wanted to see what the fine folks of armslist have available. Thanks and be blessed!"

Bump firing is the act of using the recoil of a firearm to fire multiple shots in rapid succession. This process involves holding the foregrip with the non-trigger hand, releasing the grip on the firing hand (leaving the trigger finger in its normal position in front of the trigger), pushing the rifle forward in order to apply pressure on the trigger finger from the trigger, and keeping the trigger finger stationary. The firearm will recoil and then return to its previous position after the round has been fired first resetting and then pressing forward against the trigger thereby firing successive shots. The relatively-rapid bursts from semi-automatic firearms crudely simulate the discharge of automatic firearms. Even though a large number of rounds are fired in rapid succession, the trigger finger initiates each discharge; therefore, fully automatic fire is not actually taking place"

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

Scope by itself retails for $200, so you're basically getting the binoculars for free (which retail for $115). Willing to ship for $15.00 extra.

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

Bump firing is the act of using the recoil of a firearm to fire multiple shots in rapid succession. This process involves holding the foregrip with the non-trigger hand, releasing the grip on the firing hand (leaving the trigger finger in its normal position in front of the trigger), pushing the rifle forward in order to apply pressure on the trigger finger from the trigger, and keeping the trigger finger stationary. The firearm will recoil and then return to its previous position after the round has been fired first resetting and then pressing forward against the trigger thereby firing successive shots. The relatively-rapid bursts from semi-automatic firearms crudely simulate the discharge of automatic firearms. Even though a large number of rounds are fired in rapid succession, the trigger finger initiates each discharge; therefore, fully automatic fire is not actually taking place."

Because all of our Concealed Carry-Handgun (CCH) instructors are Marine Veterans who possess Criminal Justice expertise, we know first-hand how best to prepare you for two of the worst fights you could be in; a gun fight in the Civ.Div. and the legal fight that will surely follow. 

Though we teach the state mandated materials, we spend the majority of time teaching and explaining what you must know about North Carolina concealed carry and use of force law. If what you are looking for is both a challenge of your handgun skills and an educational course that will teach you much more than the N.C. CCH curriculum requires, this is your course.

The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine.
 This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.
 A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. 
 This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included).

 The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities. From the 20 round magazines of the 92 and Px4 pistols, to the 17 round magazines of the .40 caliber Px4, there is a Cx4 configuration to complement every Beretta pistol."

Bump firing is the act of using the recoil of a firearm to fire multiple shots in rapid succession. This process involves holding the foregrip with the non-trigger hand, releasing the grip on the firing hand (leaving the trigger finger in its normal position in front of the trigger), pushing the rifle forward in order to apply pressure on the trigger finger from the trigger, and keeping the trigger finger stationary. The firearm will recoil and then return to its previous position after the round has been fired first resetting and then pressing forward against the trigger thereby firing successive shots. The relatively-rapid bursts from semi-automatic firearms crudely simulate the discharge of automatic firearms. Even though a large number of rounds are fired in rapid succession, the trigger finger initiates each discharge; therefore, fully automatic fire is not actually taking place."

Bump firing is the act of using the recoil of a firearm to fire multiple shots in rapid succession. This process involves holding the foregrip with the non-trigger hand, releasing the grip on the firing hand (leaving the trigger finger in its normal position in front of the trigger), pushing the rifle forward in order to apply pressure on the trigger finger from the trigger, and keeping the trigger finger stationary. The firearm will recoil and then return to its previous position after the round has been fired first resetting and then pressing forward against the trigger thereby firing successive shots. The relatively-rapid bursts from semi-automatic firearms crudely simulate the discharge of automatic firearms. Even though a large number of rounds are fired in rapid succession, the trigger finger initiates each discharge; therefore, fully automatic fire is not actually taking place."

He bought it new last year, and has shot a total of 20 rounds through it. 17 to zero in the scope he put on, one to take an elk last season, and two more last week to make sure it still held zero.
He replaced the factory scope with a great Bushnell 3-9x40 that can produce MOA at 200 yards, and has great groupings at 300.

I am aware that you can find this gun for in between $300-$400 online, but after taxes, shipping, FFL, and the new background check, that will come out to $450+.
It's stocked at local gunshops for $430 or so, depending on store. Which comes out to near $480 after taxes, which is what my friend paid.
The aftermarket scope he put on, he got for $130.
Comes out to $610.

Non-lethal, the same blend of chemicals used in law enforcement Freeze+P spray. These are able to be sprayed, or have the top popped and release automatically. These retail for $22.00 and up, so don't miss out on this! 

All three have an expiration date of May, 2016. Great for self-defense, or the zombie apocalypse. 

Here is some information: 
The Clear Out Grenade has a blend of CS + 1%OC rated at 2,000,000 SHUs as in the other Freeze+P Products, except in aerosol type form. The efficient, non-contaminating aerosol grenade was engineered to equate the weight of a baseball, to facilitate hand thrown deployment. If employed properly a single grenade can diffuse through a 23,000 cubic foot installation in 60 seconds. And because of the weighted dip-tube inside the grenade, will expell all of the contents regardless of the canister's position. Light pressure on the actuator button will allow short bursts while being handheld. Firm pressure will lock the button for thrown applications. Aerko International Clear Out 6oz Tear Gas Grenades are ideal for control and disbursement of crowds, or securing of a confined area. They are hand held units that are designed for throwing. 

The unique ""Lock-On"" style provides for a continuous discharge of the contents of the grenade. Size: 2 1/8"" dia X 5 5/8 ht First aid is the same for other CS/OC agents. These can be shipped as well. Awesome deal, these things are mean and effective. Discount if take more than 1! 3 for sale total."

Two things I need to point out, as I have had some not-so-great experiences with Armslist:  one is that my price here is firm (puhleeze don’t waste your and my time asking for a lower price – I know some moron will do it anyway).  I have priced this fairly, and you will not have to pay a FFL fee or sales tax.  Two is that I am absolutely not interested in trades; cash only.  Not interested in your crossbow, sword, sister or anything else but dollars.

Also, the 72 hr. handgun wait to take possession is required even for private sales.  (I do not want to risk otherwise). You can bring a deposit (say, $100) your FOID and drivers license.  You'll see the gun, etc.

You are probably asking yourself, ""Why is a guy in TN selling offshore tackle?"" Since moving to TN, I no longer have a use for this tackle. There's no offshore fishing in TN. I have other offshore tackle for sale as well: Aftco Stick Gaffs, Aftco Flying Gaffs, Aftco Tailer, Magma Bait Preparation Table and offshore lures, etc.

Why I require payment with a USPS Money Order:
When you pay by USPS (US Postal Service) Money Order and send payment by US Mail, the Post Office is a strong resource in case of any problems. Your USPS Money Order is registered to you (the purchaser). If it is lost, it can be replaced. It is payable only to the person to whom it is addressed and that person is required to show identification to cash it. If there is any fraud encountered (e.g. your purchased item(s) is not received by you after payment); Federal Mail Fraud procedures can be invoked against the seller. USPS Money Orders have a limit of $1000.00. If your purchase is more than $1000.00, multiple money orders need to be purchased. I recommend that you verify this at the US Post Office."

Included with the pistol at full asking price are 2 magazines, a clam-shell case, a ""Sticky Holster"" for IWB carry and 50 rounds of factory target ammo.  Any cash offer for less than my asking price will result in less of the extras starting with ammo.  This pistol is very clean and has been well maintained.  I will listen to interesting handgun trades.  Call/Text 5O5-6IO-5291 and I'll get back with you.  I will ship the gun but you'll pay all shipping, insurance and FFL transfer fees on both sides.  I like .45acp, .357sig, 357/38 special and .380acp and .22 magnum.  What do you have?"
