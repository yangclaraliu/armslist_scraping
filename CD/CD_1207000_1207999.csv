Here is a older ArmaLite AR-7 .22 Long Rifle that was built when they were still a good reliable rifle.  It is not perfect but shoots and functions very well.  It won't fit into the stock any longer as I glued on (epoxy) 2 short weaver rails  to mount a red dot sight.  They can be removed by adding some heat to them in case you don't want the red dot sight.  The stock has had a small crack but has been repaired with a clear epoxy.  It comes with the original magazine and 2 new in the package magazines.  I'm firm at $65.00 unless you want to offer more.

The description is still on the web site, CZusa caries the Dan Wesson line of 1911s.

I am only asking what I have into this setup-but these are hard to get ahold of new because of the scare.  Clips are backordered for quite a while and that is why I bought 4. Picatinny rail allows scope, laser, better sights, or a quick release handle to be added. I have shot this with a handle on the top-it is scary accurate for shooting from the hip.  Tons of fun.

New anti-gun legislation threatens to make any military type rifle impossible to buy, and now that the Freedom Group has closed Bushmaster, they will not be making any more Bushmaster ACRs and they are drying up quickly! So, get one while you can. 

The first of its kind, and the only rifle you need to master the infinite number of extreme scenarios you'll face in the worlds of law enforcement and personal defense. Our new Bushmaster ACR redefines the term ""modular"" with the extraordinary ability to change calibers, barrel lengths and stock configurations in minutes – without the use of tools. Truly the most versatile and adaptive rifle ever conceived, it was born of a collaborative effort between Bushmaster, Magpul® and Remington® to create the ultimate military combat weapons system. We're proud to unveil the evolution you see here – built specifically for our law-enforcement and commercial markets. It's tested and proven reliable in the most brutal conditions on earth, truly ambidextrous and the uncompromising choice when you demand a rifle as mission-adaptable as you are. The Bushmaster ACR.

I'm not the first owner, so I can't tell you much about it other than it shoots really well. The scratches on the left side are from the ejector (there is no ejector return spring, so the ejector just kind of hangs out when pushed). Ejecting can be a pain when the cylinder is dirty and can require a very hefty slap to extract casings, or it may just be the ammo I use.

I was recently lucky enough to get my hands on a brand new/never used/still in box Bushmaster Carbon 15 Superlight ORC Optic AR15 .223/5.56 rifle. I know these guns are pretty hard to get a hold of these days, but I’ve decided to let it go (before getting too attached to it!) for the right price. In addition to the gun and every piece/part that came with the original package, I’m also including an extra 30 round magazine and 110 rounds of .223/5.56 ammo. Below are some specifics about the gun (copied from the manufacturer’s website), ammunition and extra magazine that will be included in the purchase.

Bushmaster Carbon 15 Superlight ORC Optic:
•	Weight: 5.5 lbs
•	Length: 32.75”
•	Barrel length: 16”
•	Muzzel: ½ x 28
•	Barrel: 4150 chrome-moly steel with chrome-lined bore/chamber
•	Durable Carbon 15 composite receivers are an amazing 40% lighter than comparable aircraft aluminum receivers
•	16"" Super Light contour barrel chambered for 5.56 NATO/223 Rem
•	Muzzle fitted with A2 Style flash hider
•	Includes red dot optic
•	Included an operator safety manual, chamber flag, sling and 30-round magazine
•	One Year Bushmaster Warranty

110 rounds of Precision Ammunition (.223 Rem FMJ 55gr – Zinc plated steel casings)

1 ProMag Industries AR-15 .223 30 Round Magazine Steel

So to recap what’s included in the purchase: Bushmaster Carbon 15 Superlight ORC Optic AR15 .223/5.56 rifle, a sling, a red dot optic sight, two 30 round magazines, 110 rounds of ammunition.

If you’re interested in buying, please send me an e-mail. No FFL transfer required, just a bill of purchase. I’d rather avoid the hassle of shipping it, so by all means, let’s keep it local. Thanks and please don’t hesitate to send me any questions."

Im getting a friend started reloading and the only thing we need is powder. worst case scenario I can lend him a pound of hp38 until this panic dies down. 

Option 1- I have small rifle primers I can spare. Going off powdervalleyinc.com prices(21/k primers, $16/lb powder) I would like to trade 800 tula small rifle primers for a pound of powder best suited for lead cast 45 and/or 38 special. namely winchester 231/hp-38, unique or bullseye. I have been using small rifle primers for 223, 45, 38, 357 and 380 without a problem. they are slightly hotter and have a thicker cup than small pistol primers.

Option 2- My buddy will shortly have an excess of large pistol magnum primers. These can be used in place of large pistol stand primers as long as you knock your load down 10% and work your way back up. They are just a bit hotter. I made him order more than he needed so he has a bartering item. Looking for a powder best suited for 40 and 45acp however will trade these for bullseye or unique, maybe even universal clays and him and I can hash it out.

Throw me your ideas.  In these panickey price gouging times, its tough to get someone started. also- only interested in factory sealed cans."
