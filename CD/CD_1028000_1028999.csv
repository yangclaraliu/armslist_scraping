Ive had it for about 2 years and put several hundered rounds through it. The thing is a beast and runs PERFECTLY! I recently bought the TAC47 auto plug but haven't gotten a chance to see how it works. I put a few rounds through it using the Autoplug but ran out of time to really put it through its paces. Anyway, This is Fully and professionally converted. Comes with everything listed below and in the picture. I paint cars for a living and so I had my jobber match Magpul's FDE and I coated the pistol grip, Magazines and but stock with (super hard) acrylic enamel paint. Matches Magpul perfectly! It's cycled everything I've put in it except Winchester Universal birdshot. Because of the upgrades (especially the muzzle break) the recoil is WAY less than any other shotgun I've fired. Cyclic rate is EXTREMELY fast. MY buddy and I were comparing his Benelli M4 to my Saiga and the Saiga was MUCH faster. I still have the original box and stock Parts.

22LR Aguila .22 Interceptor--Copper Plater--Hollow Points--1470fps

Bullet details....40-grain copper plated lead round nose bullet. Screaming hot and hard-hitting! Gives 1470 fps with a 40 grain bullet. Normal High Velocity 22LR ammo goes about 1250 fps with a 40 gr bullet. ""Hyper Velocity"" ammo uses a lighter bullet to go even faster: (For example, the hyper velocity CCI Stinger uses a 32 gr bullet and goes 1640 fps.) So, the Aguila Interceptor delivers the hard impact of the heavier 40 grain bullet at a velocity almost as high as Stinger--an excellent combination of knock down and trajectory. 5% more energy than CCI Velocitor at the same bullet weight and the same energy as CCI Stinger with a 25% heavier bullet! Perfect fodder for semi-auto pistols and rifles that need high energy for reliable cycling. Eley Primed! Ballistics Information: •Muzzle Velocity: 1470 fps •Muzzle Energy: 192 ft. lbs.

Among the most unique magazine designs, the 30/45 magazines were designed with an extendable bottom section that would allow the magazine to be fully loaded to 30 rounds and stored (with the base extended) with the spring under minimal pressure. This allowed long-term storage of fully-loaded mags with no wear to the spring or the feed lips. They can also be loaded with 45 rounds when the base extended, though they shouldn't be stored in this configuration."

236,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1028236,For Sale:  Assault rifle legislation,"Colorado, Pueblo, Colorado","$ 1,000,000","Listed On: Friday, February 8, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Earlier this week, a comprehensive gun control package aimed at disarming and criminalizing law-abiding citizens was unveiled in Denver. While not all the proposals have been introduced, below is some of the drafted legislation that serves to punish the lawful and ignore criminals’ misuse of firearms:

House Bill 1224: Would ban the sale, transfer or possession of a magazine capable of holding more than ten rounds of ammunition. Those who currently own magazines that hold more than ten rounds would be able to keep them in their possession, but would be unable to sell or transfer them! Furthermore, any magazine larger than ten rounds that is manufactured in Colorado on or after the effective date of HB 1224 must include a serial number and date of assembly. Not only will this increase the cost of magazines, it could force law-abiding citizens who currently possess unmarked magazines larger than ten rounds to produce evidence that they possessed the magazines before the ban was enacted.

House Bill 1226: Would overturn the state Supreme Court ruling that decisively concluded that individuals who obtain a Concealed Weapons Permit cannot be denied their right to carry a firearm for self-defense on college campuses. This bill will only create more failed “gun-free zones” that are so often the target of criminals and madmen.

House Bill 1228: Would saddle law-abiding gun owners by imposing an undetermined fee (gun tax) for undergoing a background check through the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) InstaCheck system. The CBI InstaCheck program is failing in its duties and cannot process or handle the volume of checks seen in the last few months. Recently, the Colorado Legislature denied a $500,000 request from CBI to expedite the backlog of checks. Instead, HB 1228 would punish gun owners by forcing them to pay for a defunct program that blatantly impedes their constitutional right.

House Bill 1229: Would criminalize the private transfer of all firearms, even between certain family members! Under HB 1229, you will be forced to undergo a criminal investigation if you wish to purchase a firearm from certain family members, friends and co-workers. This system can only be enforced with gun registration. And, as we know from experiences in California, Canada and Australia, gun registration enables gun confiscation—only from honest citizens—since criminals are not subject to registration or submit to criminal investigations."

Among the most unique magazine designs, the 30/45 magazines were designed with an extendable bottom section that would allow the magazine to be fully loaded to 30 rounds and stored (with the base extended) with the spring under minimal pressure. This allowed long-term storage of fully-loaded mags with no wear to the spring or the feed lips. They can also be loaded with 45 rounds when the base extended, though they shouldn't be stored in this configuration."

As more and more 7mm  bullets become available I will be doing more testing on it. The 307 GNR will be a bit more power than the 300 GNR plus you don't have to do the cutting, trimming and  such that is required on the 300 GNR.

All numbers match.  I own a number of AK-47s, both rifles and pistols. I did extensive homework and research on each and every AK I own prior to purchasing them. This pistol was by far the one I looked into the most. I owed two Draco Romanian and had very little knowledge of the Zastava M-92. It did not take long to realize this pistol was a quality machine with outstanding reviews. After looking at one in person it was quite obvious that it was a far superior AK pistol than my Draco and most of my AKs. My Arsenal is the only one compatible.  Most AKs tend to fit loose and sloppy with little attention to detail. This Zastava M-92 is perfectly fitted and tight everywhere. The only complaint with them is the furniture comes very plain with no finish and often dirty which as you can see I paid a nice chunk to have mine totally refinished in Russian Red. Zastava is Serbian and considered to be one of the best AK makers if not the best period. All thier products are quality and the M 92 pistols are made new in Serbia. She has had two 30 round mags ran through her the day I got her. Unbelievable performance and extremely accurate. The following day I had her torn down and rebuilt.
The Zastava PAP M-92 was taken all the way down and each part was surprisingly well finished but not good enough for me. Each piece and component was hand worked and polished, then washed in an acid solution to remove all micro shavings.  Rivits replaced with a much more supirior rivit. The furniture was taken all the way down and redone in Russian Red Wood and a bulit proof clear coat given for an amazingly tough and beautiful finish.  The pistol grip was coated in a ruberized coating for exceptional gripping as was one of the new TapCo mags.  She comes with 13 new 30 round magazines. 7 of those are new high quality Russian steel mags. The other 6 are a variation of new TapCo 30 round mags.  She comes with just over a case of quality 7.62x39 ammo that can be seen in the photos. I have a few mags loaded with very high end penetration hollow points.  All mags in the photos are full for a total of just over 1100 rounds total.
If you just want an AK then this might not be the one for you. If you are looking for the perfect AK performance and cosmetically as well as superior quality then this is something worth looking into.

Thank you for taking the time to look. Serious buyers interested in a quality custom AK only please."

Comes with Pistol, Case, Manuals, Lock, Two Mags 9 and 17, Easy Loader.

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

2HBCT= 2nd Heavy Brigade Combat Team
1CD = 1st Calvary Division
11-12 = DEC 2011

Also on 15 Decenber, exactly eight months to the day they cased their colors, Soldiers with the 2nd ""Black Jack"" Brigade Combat Team, 1st Cavalry Division assembled again on Cooper Field and uncased their colors, marking one of the last units to leave Iraq in support of Operation New Dawn and allowing Soldiers to be home just in time for the holidays. The Brigade had operated primarily in the Northern Iraqi Joint Operations area.

Being home for the holidays came as a surprise to the Black Jack Soldiers. They didn't know until a couple of weeks ago that they would be back before the Christmas holiday, and they were very fortunate everything worked out.

Many Black Jack Soldiers agreed that being one of the last units to leave their footprint in Iraq made their numerous deployment rotations, loss of comrades and countless holidays away from loved ones well worth it."

These are scarce right now and most places are not taking backorders after the Kalashnikov plant shut down in Russia. It is my understanding that any Saiga's that are in containers waiting to come into the USA are the last that we will ever get. 

I purchased this one because it is very unique, I *think* it is a 1993 model and the only I have ever seen stamped ""Kalashnikov USA"" as the importer, so this is likely Pre-Ban. Furthermore, this particular one takes AK-47 mags straight from the factory without removing any metal or other modifications. It also accepts the proprietary Saiga mags.

Essentially, this is ban proof in my opinion. You can leave the 5 round on it and be legal in all 50 states even after a ""Assault weapons Ban"". Or put the 30 round in, customize the configuration to your preference and you have the baddest AK on the market!

I can offer for trade massage therapy gift cards up to the retail value of the firearm you have to trade. The age/condition of the gun would of course determine the trade value. 

These can be on separate gift cards (Ex: five $100 gift cards, etc.), or all on one card. We can even set up you or your spouse with something like a year's worth of massages. (Valentine's Day is coming up soon...Massages for a year would win you some serious brownie points.)

We are a LEGITIMATE massage therapy office. We have 12 licensed and nationally certified massage therapists on staff. We do not provide ""happy endings"" or anything of the sort. We do offer relaxation, injury relief, stress management, deep tissue, pre-natal, and neuromuscular massage therapy. I will be happy to provide more specific details for serious inquiries.

Its a Very nice looking gun and it shoots like a dream.. The trigger pull and the pump are both as smooth as butter. From what Ive read there wasnt many of these built and not many can be found anymore. Im not sure of the age but its been well kept! My father bought it back in the late 80`s early 90`s and gave it to me 5 years ago. I consider it to be in very good condition. A Few Minor rubs from normal use and age but all Superficial. The mechanics are very sound and It shoots like a dream. They were originally built as skeet guns but people soon realized with the tight patterns, they worked great at turkey shoots, upland hunting, geese, dove, duck and Ive even taken turkey with it from a blind and deer from a stand. Its just a great all around gun and a lot of fun to shoot..  
I just need to sell it or trade for something that my grandson can use. His 10th birthday is coming up soon and I want to get him something other than the 410 and 22 single shot he already has.

I've put about 300 rounds through it and not a stoppage or malfunction in operation. The only reason it's up for sale is that I am upgrading to a S&W. It's a good carry gun for both more and less experienced shooters, as it can handle .357 Magnum and .38 Special +P ammunition. This gives the shooter options based on experience and comfort level with those loads coupled with experience and comfort with using a small frame revolver. The lack of an external hammer assists with a snag free draw from where ever it is concealed.

Purchased this AR  just before X-mas off Armslist. Paid probably too much for the gun, but would like to get some of my money back. Have not shot it since owning. I paid 1500 for just the gun, and purchased the rest of the misc off Armslist as well, including the ammo in the last month or two.
Comes with 2 USGI Mags
~180 rds Steel cased ammo
2 Belt Mag Pouches
2 Over-shoulder mag pouches

Prefer Cash, but may trade on Kimber .45, or .40 Kel-tec Sub-2000, ATV, what do you have? Thanks

Here are the manufacturer specs on it:

CMMG drop in .22 conversion kit with CMMG full body magazine. This model is semi automatic only. All CMMG .22 LR magazines have a bolt hold open follower. For best performance use a rounded style hammer, notched hammers can cause function issues. 36 grain bullets have proven to be the best choice for function. The PRI Gas Buster charging handle will not work .22 Conversion kit.

Note: For Direct Gas Impingement. Not compatible with Gas Piston Systems without removing the piston. Only for use in 5.56 NATO chambered rifles. Set up is less than 30 seconds. Ammo is 1/10 of the price of 5.56 ammo, so a significant savings to you. Only for use in 5.56 NATO chambered rifles.

Up for auction is a very nice Browning Model 71 lever action in .50 Alaskan, These rifles were orginally chambered in .348 Winchester. Gunsmiths wanted the Browning 71 due to its durability and strength when converting rifles to 50 Alaskan. This rifle has a half octagon half round barrel measuring at 34"", an all steal Schnabel forend, the sights have not been clipped and the engraving on the barrel and action are beautiful. the stock also has a hidden compartment for holding 4 rounds. The .50 Alaskan is a wildcat cartridge developed by Harold Johnson and Harold Fuller of the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska in the 1950s. Johnson based the cartridge on the .348 Winchester in order to create a rifle capable of handling the large bears in Alaska. Design: Harold Johnson necked out the .348 Winchester case to accept a .510"" diameter bullet, and Harold Fuller developed the barrel, marrying a .50 caliber barrel to an old Winchester Model 1886 rifle. Since the rifle was designed for use on Alaska’s great bears, Johnson cut 720-grain (47 g) boat-tail .50 BMG bullets in half, seating the 450-grain (29 g) rear half upside down in the fireformed .50-caliber case. It didn’t take Johnson long to find out that the 450-grain truncated shaped “solid” would shoot through a big brown bear from any direction, claiming in 1988, “I never recovered a slug from a bear or moose, no matter what angle the animal was shot at. Harold’s favorite load in the .50 Alaskan was 51.5 grains (3.34 g) of IMR-4198 with a Barnes 400-grain (26 g) flatnose ,jacketed bullet for about 2,100 ft/s (640 m/s) and just under 4,000 ft·lbf (5,400 J)of muzzle energy Shipping/handling is going to be $55 and insurance will be added at 1.75% of the item's value to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping. The price is for $1500 therefore, this item will still be subject to shipping and insurance charges. Because of additional paperwork and time to process the shipment"
