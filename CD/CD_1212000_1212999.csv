It's a single action revolver, and a real throwback to the old west. It's a replica of the legendary Colt Single Action Army 1873. Also known as the ""Peacemaker"". It's chambered in 45 Colt, which is a lot more authentic than similar guns chambered in .357. The Peacemaker was originally offered in 45 Colt, and that's why I have enjoyed shooting this gun so much. 

A while back I wanted to get her a tune up so I sent it off to Long Hunter for some professional action work: (http://www.longhunt.com/gunsmithing/colt.htm). Long Hunter is one of the premier gunsmith operations for working on old west firearms. They did a beautiful job with my Beretta. Turned it from a good shooter to a great one! 

This Stampede is antiqued as you can see, and looks like a relic of the old west. It's configured in a 4 3/4'' barrel, also known as the ""Gunslinger"" model. You're sure to love this piece as much as I do. It's rugged, tough, and will hold up to a lifetime of shooting. 

So why am I selling it? Well, I've decided to build a collection of Cowboy action firearms and I want everything to match. I got a new Single Action Army that looks similar to my levergun so I decided I may as well part with my Beretta. If interested, just contact me. I'm willing to negotiate on the cost, and I'd be happy to talk trade as well. I'd add or subtract cash for the right trade. So let me know!"

 I would like to trade a very nice to excellent example of the 1944 dated Mosin Nagant PU sniper rifle for an original matching New England Westinghouse M91.

 The original WWII PU sniper that I offer up in trade is one of the better examples, this maker and model year is not currently available for purchase by any of the major importers. (the only exceptions are entirely on a luck of the draw basis and the odds are very long, finding a similar example in this condition with all matching numbers even longer).

 This is from the more desired and lower production Tula arsenal and has no visible [I], [X] or [/] refurbishment stamps on the barreled action, stock or scope, it's all stamped matching with the letter prefix's (no line-outs), has an excellent bore and the original crown, the original and matching numbers scope is sharp and clear as well.

 This rifle is not upgradeable within it's category and I would not consider trading it if it were not a duplicate model and year for me.

 So... if you have an original and matching numbers New England Westinghouse Mosin Nagant you would be willing to trade for a pretty scarce, Tula PU sniper please send me a email and we'll talk.

 Many detailed photographs available to ""NEW"" owners considering a trade.

Mec Gar magazines are the only magazines as good as, or better than, original factory mags. They lock the slides open like they're supposed to on the last shot; they free-fall eject correctly; and most important, they are always reliable, even with months of staying loaded.  The buttplates to these genuine Mec Gar 20 round magazines for the Smith & Wesson 59 and 5900 series 9mm pistols are classic polymer, virtually identical to the factory S&W floorplates issued for the past 25 years. Body construction is Blue Steel. Factory code is MGSW5920B. Most of us are aware that Smith & Wesson Magazines will fit into battery just fine on Daewoo DP51 Pistols. These magazines also fit some variants of the Kel-Tec Sub 2000 carbine, but only the ones made to accept Smith & Wesson 9mm Magazines. They also fit the Marlin Camp 9 carbines."

As a gun community we need to come together to rid ourselves of one of the deadliest sins - GREED. We are all tired of seeing $500 AK-47s listed at $2000, and $800 fully upgraded AR-15s posted for $4500. 

Guess what? As gun buyers and members on this and other forums, we are just as responsible for the state of our society as the price gougers and hoarders are. We need to come together and do two things: 
(1) STOP BUYING AT THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES and 
(2) click on the ad, go to ""Flag"" at the top, and press ""overpriced."" This whole process takes 1.3968 seconds.

These price CRIMINALS only have business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement. NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing, BUT YOU CAN ORDER 20 RIGHT NOW THROUGH OPERATION BOULDER AIRLIFT ON MAGPUL'S FACEBOOK.

Every time you skip over a $10,000 ad for a $3000 purchased SCAR 17, you have just became part of the problem. Send them a hate email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly FLAG their ad so we can get prices back where they belong. For the uninformed or misinformed audience, I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy and paste it to another state's/towns listing in the US. Add your own two cents in if you'd like. The regularity will only return if we make it.

AR-15: $700-$1300 depending on brand and usage (shots fired, wear, etc..)
AK-47: $400-$900
SKS:$300-$500
SCAR 16/17: $2000/$2800
AR-10: $1000-1500 (tops)
Glock: $400-600
10/22: $229 (you can buy these at Wal-Mart)
ACR: $2000
1911: $600-1100

Ammo:
9mm ammo: $0.25/round is on the higher end
223/5.56: $0.35/round
.308/7.62 NATO: maybe up to $1/round (on high side)
.22: $0.05/round is high

Again, feel free to add your $0.02, make changes, repost, and then get to the flagging of overpriced scams."

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. These magazines are going to be banned in Colorado very soon, however you will be allowed to keep any that you have bought before the ban.

High quality lower parts kit that includes a superior ALG QMS fire control group. The ALG Defense Quality Mil-Spec (QMS) Trigger is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the QMS is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however the majority of the associated grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the well known reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs. Kit includes everything needed to assemble your stripped AR-15 lower. Parts are 100% made in USA!

It’s in superb working, mechanical and operating condition, only taken out of the safe to be shot 2-3 times in it’s entire life. Other than slight marks by the brass deflector (which is on every used gun) it’s in mint condition. If this gun was to ever break, Springfield has a 100% lifetime warranty on it, and since the gun is out of production they will issue you a brand new M1A to replace it!
I’ve shot less than 100 rounds through it, and all new production/high quality non corrosive non lacquer coated/steel cased ammo. It’s super accurate, very gentle recoil (it is a .308 NATO after all) and an absolute blast to shoot. (10) 20 round magazines are included.
I also have some ammo that I’ll sell with it if you are interested, I’m not going to charge going rate (because that’s stupid) but I don’t think ammo will ever return to it’s previous prices. So I think a fair price is $0.75 per round.

I have 100 rounds of Brass cased Sadu 5.56 (basically M855) steel core penetrating rounds. This is awesome shooting ammo. If you have a capable gun and have only shot 223, you will enjoy the extra pop of 5.56. This ammo has a sealed primer and bullet crimp, so if you chose, you can store for probably decades if thats your thing.

I would like to trade for 9mm, but would consider .22lr and/or .45 auto as well. Please shoot me an email with what you would like to trade. Unfortunately ammo has been going crazy, and I'd like to trade with someone who maybe stocked up on 9mm when times were better so we can both enjoy the sport during this climate.

I hate to feed into the hype, but this is probably the type of ammo that would be the first on the list to be banned or highly regulated if it came to that...I'm not saying I expect that to happen, but its something to think about."

I am looking to purchase a Bushmaster AR-15 style rifle or carbine (M4 style preferred) complete as from the factory with original accessories and little or no modifications in A2 or A3 configuration, like in the picture.  I will consider a M4 A2 with A1 rear sight but that is my last choice.  I will consider other brands if comparable to the Bushmaster.  If you have the Bushmaster M4 that will fire the 7.62X39 cartridge, that would be OK as well, a little less expensive to shoot right now.

Looking to pay pre-panic pricing so $700 to $850 depending on what you have to offer.  Cash available right now in the Fort Collins NorCO area.  I will sign a Bill of Sale if you want one to CYA.

I would like to shoot more with a 22lr pistol  and thought I would offer a trade for someone who needs 9mm. Both are scarce now.

I will consider taking less 22lr ammo if you want to trade some CCI stingers, Winchester 333 packs(plus 5$), or some other, nicer ammo. Also, partial trades of cash and ammo (like 10$ and 250 rounds of bulk 22lr) would be considered. I am not really looking to sell but I guess I will take offers."

Price is firm

lowballer disclaimer-- some people have an attitude that ""it doesn't hurt to ask"" regardless of how ridiculous an offer is. Fair enough, I guess, but if you're dealing with me, it does hurt. It hurts your reputation as a buyer and it hurts your ability to get a deal with me in the future. I'm not desperate and I will not fool with someone who has no concept of what current market prices are. 
P.S. I love it when this disclaimer ticks people off and I get ehatemail- The only type of person this disclaimer would infuriate is.... you guessed it... Lowballers... Which I want lowballers to send me emails identifying themselves anyway, so I can add them to my blocked email list- That way I don't ever have to waste time with them:) Hatemail and rediculous offers result in blocked email.

 I would like to trade a very nice to excellent example of the 1944 dated Mosin Nagant PU sniper rifle for an original matching New England Westinghouse M91.

 The original WWII PU sniper that I offer up in trade is one of the better examples, this maker and model year is not currently available for purchase by any of the major importers. (with small exception, which even then would be entirely luck of the draw and the odds are very long, finding a similar example and with all matching numbers they're even longer).

 It is from the more desired and lower production Tula arsenal and has no visible [I], [X] or [/] refurbishment stamps on the barreled action, stock or scope, it's all stamped matching with the letter prefix's (no line-outs), has an excellent bore and the original crown, the original matching optics are sharp and clear as well.

 This rifle is not upgradeable within it's category and I would not consider trading it if it were not a duplicate model and year for me.

 So... if you have an original and matching numbers New England Westinghouse Mosin Nagant you would be willing to trade for a pretty scarce, Tula PU sniper please send me a email and we'll talk.

 Many detailed photographs available to ""NEW"" owners considering a trade.

 TIA"
