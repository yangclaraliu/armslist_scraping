The SAINT Pistol is highly capable and upgraded out of the box but in stock-free pistol form.
Instead of a rifle buttstock, the new SAINT AR-15 Pistol features a rugged SB Tactical SBX-K forearm brace to reduce size, stabilize recoil, and enhance accuracy in one or two-hand shooting. A 7.5-inch barrel with a 1:7 twist makes the SAINT pistol small, fast, and ideal for CQB. The 416R stainless steel barrel is Melonite® treated to be harder and more accurate than chrome, and is chambered for 5.56 NATO (.223) so ammunition is affordable, versatile, and seriously capable.
The SAINT AR-15 Pistol is built around high-end features that make SAINT rifles so popular. Springfield Armory’s exclusive Accu-Tite™ tension system increases the tension between the upper and the lower receivers, ensuring an ideal fit and reducing slop – no shake or rattle.  Upper and lower receivers are forged Type III hard-coat anodized 7075 T6 aluminum.
The SAINT Pistol’s muzzle is equipped with a blast diverter that pushes sound, concussion and debris forward towards the target — instead of at the operator or fellow shooters — ensuring a more comfortable shooting experience.
The slender, agile handguard is Springfield Armory’s exclusive, patent-pending free float design, with locking tabs and features a forward hand stop. The rifle’s crisp, enhanced nickel boron-coated GI single-stage trigger is paired with a Bravo Company trigger guard. The smooth-operating heavy tungsten buffer system, low-profile pinned gas block, GI style charging handle, and Bravo Company Mod 3 pistol grip are all well-proven in SAINT rifle models. Springfield Armory is known for no-compromise design and, as usual, the attention to detail is obvious.
To ensure durability, the M16 bolt carrier group is precision-machined from Carpenter 158 steel, shot peened and magnetic particle inspected and finished in super-hard Melonite®. For ample shooting capacity, the SAINT Pistol carries a Magpul PMAG.
The compact frame makes the SAINT AR-15 Pistol an ideal choice for home defense.  In addition to high-quality engineering, the SAINT AR-15 Pistol is just 26.5 inches long, and weighs under 6 pounds. This pistol delivers the punch of a rifle caliber in a small, fast-handling frame. It’s highly accurate and it’s seriously fun to shoot."

I am including the OEM Box and orginal grip panels. Currently it has cherry wood grips with a RH thumb rest. Great grip. Recently I experienced a few failure to fire (FTF). I assumed that some of the springs needed replacing. So, I had ALL the springs (4) replaced. With WOLFF Gun Springs. The best. Work done by a gunsmith. Very successful and resulted in a very light trigger pull. Probably 2.5-3 lbs. As a Standard model the MKII has fixed iron sights. And, they are quite accurate. After market sights are available (LPA) and are fully adjustable. EZ install in the OEM dovetail. (I have done so on my MKIII Standard). Additionally, I have included 5 OEM 10 round magazines. And, I downloaded and printed the OEM Owner's Manual. Included. You may have heard of the issues assoiciated with take down and reassembly. Millions were sold so it is quite doable. I have done so weekly for two years now. And, I have added the Hammer Strut Support. Cleaning becomes a snap."

Custom features include feed ramp and barrel inletting done to allow the weapon to feed the pointed 155 Grain SWC's which means that it will feed anything that you can load for the 45 ACP. It will probably feed resized empty cases. It has the long trigger, oversized beavertail safety, skeleton hammer, ambidextrous safety, full length guide rod, Wilson extractor and titanium firing pin, EGW O/S small radius firing pin stop (John Brownings original 1911 design, reduces recoil and muzzle flip), and Pachmayr grips. I am the original owner. I had the work done thinking I'd go IPSC shooting. It ended up being the tightest, most accurate 45 I've ever owned. I decided to keep it that way and only shot it at range sessions. All work was done by Brian Murphy of Murphy's guns in Tucson. At the time he asked me where I got it as it was the tightest fitting, slide to frame, factory 45 he'd held. Gun has probably only seen 1500 or so rounds through it it's entire life and has never been fired without a shock buff. Finish is nearly perfect sans the idiot scratch and the common slide torque wear on the right side of the frame (see both in pics) Comes with 7 magazines, 2 OEM's, 1 GI, 2 Mecgars and 2 Chip McCormick Shooting Star 8 rd. The CMC's and the Mecgar 8 rd are fitted with the new Fobus Immortal Springs, the others are running CMC Rocket Wire springs and I'll throw in a few spare springs. Also comes with the 3 holsters shown, 10 shock buffs and a box of hardball. The price is firm. Local cash face to face sale only, NO SHIPPING, and I will need to see an AZ ID. I can meet in the Greenway Rd. and 32nd St area. More pictures are available if desired and additional ammo is available at $20 a box. Email or text me at REDACTED if interested."
