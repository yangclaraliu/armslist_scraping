KBI brought in a fair amount of the standard 8 round Russian (single stack) Makarovs, but not nearly as many of the Hi-Cap models like this one.

I am the original owner and this pistol has been fired, but not much. It is in excellent condition and the bore is ""mirror"" bright. Pistol fires the standard 9x18 Makarov round and operates with a 10 round double stack magazine making total capacity 11 rounds (10+1). The Russian pistols are not finished quite as nicely as the East German ones, however in terms of accuracy, durability, and reliability they are at least as good if not better. I've always been amazed at how well this pistol shoots given it's size, and I am able to hit 12 oz. soda cans at 25 yards with little effort. If you have ever wondered whether our Comrades to the East are at any disadvantage as it pertains to small arms - trust me they are not!

Pistol comes in it's original box with manual, warranty card, safety info and hang tag. Also included is the multi-tool and cleaning rod it was shipped with. Additionally price includes 3 hi-cap magazines which are routinely selling for as much as $100 each on Gunbroker & Ebay when you can find them. There is also a ""period style"" leather holster with matching lanyard strap included and both are in excellent shape. Finally price includes 250 rounds of Silver Bear FMJ ammo which is produced at the Barnaul Cartridge Plant in Barnaul Russia. This ammo has a zinc plated case and it is excellent ""blasting"" ammo.

Price for everything listed above is $675. FTF with pickup in the Brandon area. You must be a Florida resident and at least 21 to purchase. Thanks for looking."

I have posted some photos taken a few days ago for reference on PhotoBucket...(http://s269.photobucket.com/user/Raiderftbl/library/Sig%20Sauer%20P220R-45-%20BSS%20SIGLITE?sort=3&page=1). I would be able to throw in (3) 7 round magazines (purchased slightly used on GunBroker) and a 10 round extended mag that came new with the pistol. I paid $865 for the pistol, $103 for the magazines and $119 Rosewood grips. I cut the the Sig tag to put the new grips on the pistol. Lastly, included is a voucher for Sig Sauer for a free magazine with 10% off for a purchase from the Sig Sauer store due to the back order issue with magazines. With all that said; I know most dealers mark up the guns 15-20% and then I'd maybe lose another 10% for the pistol not being ""new"" so I have really lowered the price for this listing. Will only ship to an FFL if not local. Also, I play by the rules, so Please have a FOID permit before inquiring. The pistol is brand new and has never been fired... Everything listed and in photos is included in price. Thank you for checking it out!

The Ninety Rounder - AR15 - New in open box - NOB

The MWG 90 Rounder high capacity magazine for the AR-15/M16 provides you with the finest in state-of-the-art high capacity magazine design. The 90 Rounder's innovative snail-drum design and advanced space-age materials are combined to create a very light, completely reliable, low maintenance, high capacity magazine that will withstand a level of heavy field use that would destroy a metal magazine, while weighing 33% less.
The 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 is designed for 5.56mm NATO or .223 Remington ammunition.
The 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 is designed to be close to maintenance free. Never remove the silver-gray Teflon lubricant powder. Never Use any oil-based lubricant. Never disassemble MWG products, and never disassemble the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 .
The 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 contains small parts & springs that may cause injury if improperly released. If repairs are required, return the magazine to MWG Company for repair. Any disassembly, alteration, re-adjustment, improper installation, or misuse of any MWG product voids all warranties.
Never attempt to load the 90 Rounder into the weapon or detach the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 from the weapon, with a cartridge in the chamber. Always lock the bolt back first and visually ensure the chamber is empty.
Because of its unique design, the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 can be left partially loaded for an extended period of time, but never store the 90 Rounder with more than 80 rounds loaded. Leaving the 90 Rounder for the stored with more than 80 rounds loaded may damage the springs and cause the weapon to malfunction. Never attempt to load more than 90 rounds. Loading more than 90 rounds may damage the magazine.
Always avoid lethal situations whenever possible. High capacity magazines such as the 90 Rounder for the AR-15/M16 are intended to eliminate re-loading downtime for persons in unavoidable potentially lethal situations, but no product can fully protect the user from injury or death in a firefight. The knowing use of MWG products, when a potentially lethal situation could be avoided, will constitute an assumption of the known risks of engaging in a lethal situation.

I have 2000 rounds of PMC Bronze .223 FMJ BT 55gr ammo.  Price seems to be between 500-550 on GB currently.  My price is .48 cpr.  (480 per 1k).  I will break it up in smaller amounts if you want.  If you want the whole 2k I will do it for 950.  Each 1000 rounds comes with a dry ammo storage box.  This comes out to 9.60 per box of 20.

I also have 2000 rounds of PMC Bronze 9mm 115gr FMJ ammo.  Price is .37 cpr.  18.50 per box.  370 per 1k.  If you buy a case, it will come with a dry ammo storage box.

For 40 caliber I have some misc. target rounds that are not in boxes (WWB, CCI, Wolf) and some self defense rounds most of which are boxed, some are not.  Best bet is to call me on this (just email me and I will send you my phone number.

I realize you can probably buy this cheaper at Wal-Mart.  3 boxes at a time, if you are lucky.  My prices are firm.  I am saving you the effort of scouring the internet or Wal-Mart to find this, hence the slightly higher prices.

Sniper System: A trained shooter using match-grade ammo and a superior weapon.



You have hand it to the folks at Heckler & Koch. They do make a fine rifle - for all occasions.

The H&K SR9 is a roller-delayed, blowback operated semi-auto rifle.

The SR9 (a new and improved HK91) is a series of target, hunting, military and law enforcement rifles that share common elements with the Heckler & Koch PSG1 and MSG-90 rifles.

The SR9T and SR9TC represent the accurized versions, ideal for sniper applications.

Basic SR9 features include a tool to adjust the weapon's three-quarter-mile (1200-meter) rear sight, adjustable hand grip, carrying handle, sling (leather), 20-round magazine and cleaning kit.

The U.S. Import Ban of 1989 defined what can and cannot be legally imported into the U.S.

The ban precludes guns with folding stocks, bayonet lugs, flash suppressors and a host of deemed assault- or military-style features scary to the left to include separate pistol grips and bipods.

What you and I know that the gun-hating liberals and many in Congress do not is that those fancy gizmo's they deem militarized and scary don't necessarily render a gun any more effective.

H&K knew what red-blooded American shooters wanted: A very good precision rifle.

And they knew what military and law enforcement shooters required.

Fortunately for them, they have something for everybody in their SR9 rifle.

They nixed the bells and whistles and toned down the gun for commercial import.

And they fine-tuned the features the military and law enforcement community needed.

H&K designed and produced the SR9 in 1990, and sales are still going strong.

This gun is chambered for 7.62x51mm NATO (.308). Options include a 5- or 20-round (double-column) detachable mag, a 20-inch polygonal barrel and a fiberglass thumbhole stock.

Overall length is about 43 inches, and the gun weighs about 10 pounds

Rifle is in excellent overall condition with 30 day money back guarantee.  Clean bore and no rust anywhere on this rifle.  Functions 100%.  Comes with 5 magazines. ........NOTICE :I only recieve via post money order..,feel free to ask me any question,,GOOD LUCK"

With the sale you get the hard to find 9mm Shield with a DeSantis Mini Scabbard tan OWB holster, an Uncle Mike's size 4 holster (i used it to carry the gun on my ballistic vest) and a Tru Glow fiber optic front sight.  The gun shoots very nicely, but I purchased a S&W 642.  I am not a fan of a safety on a concealed carry gun, so I had the safety on this gun dismantled and removed by a licensed gunsmith.  I have the pieces for the safety, which can be placed back on the weapon.  The trigger on the Shield is a little jerky and strong right out of the box and have had some trigger work done to make it more smooth and a little lighter.  Currently 8 lb trigger.  

The magazines are the standard issued magazines.  One is a 7 round capacity and one is an 8 round capacity.

Nikon's new 16-48x60 Spotter XL II is designed to provide exceptional optical capability, coupled with high light transmission and superior ruggedness. It is a roof prism design, featuring a precisely aligned optical system with a built-in 16-48 power zoom range. 
Lenses and prisms on the new Nikon Spotter XL II are cut from premium grade optical glass, which is then meticulously finished and polished to reduce diffraction and reflection. The lenses are multicoated with a series of proprietary anti-reflective compounds to boost light transmission and provide true color rendition and flare free viewing. Prisms are given an extra phase-correction coating to prevent light loss and provide the highest level of resolving power. 

The Spotter XL II is nitrogen filled and O-ring sealed for fully waterproof, fogproof and shockproof performance, and is rubber armored for shock resistance and a sure grip, wet or dry. A new sliding sunshade eliminates glare in particularly bright conditions and keeps dust and rain off of the objective lens on rainy days or in dusty environments. The body of the scope incorporates an integral peep sight that makes sighting on distant objects quick and easy. 

Nikon's Spotter XL II can be close focused to just 33 feet, has a field of view at 1,000 yards of 120 feet, and an exit pupil that varies from 3.8mm at 16x to 1.3mm at 48x. The scope is 12.3 inches long and weighs a mere 31.2 ounces. It features 19mm of eye relief, making it ideal for people who wear glasses, as well as those who do not.

This rifle was built by Arizona Response System (ARS). These guys are the best in the business for building a better FAL, HK, or AK. This rifle is based off the FN FAL but much better and more accurate than any FAL could have ever been produced. ARS builds to the highest quality and standards in the business; and stand behind every gun they build.
I purchased all the parts separately to complete the FAL build that I desired.  I sent the parts to Mark at Arizona Response Systems in March 2012 and received a fully Custom Beautiful FAL in October 2012. Since then I have ran about 200 round though it with no problems.  Since December of this year prices of rifles such as this one have skyrocketed.   I don’t desire to gouge along with the arms market.  I have provided the list above, and I have most receipts as proof of what I spent.  I DO have the paperwork from ARS.

Most people have not heard of Tanfoglio, but I have been buying and shooting these quality Italian guns for over 2 years and without exception they are as good or better than any Glock or XD out there.

These are CZ style double/single action weapons.  They have exposed hammers (unlike striker fire pistols like Glock) that can be “cocked and locked” with the safety engaged and ready for action.  The factory trigger is very crisp and the weapon is nicely balanced without relying on a full magazine to do so.

One of the features that makes Tanfoglio weapons so desirable is the fact that they can be modified easily with a number of conversion kits.  EAA makes kits for about $200 each that can convert this 9mm pistol to .22, .40, .45, and NATO 10mm.  With a Tanfoglio pistol you master handling one gun body (one grip, one set of sights, etc..) and can have 5 calibers to shoot from.  The conversion kits ship from Cape Canaveral, Florida and have always been in stock whenever I have called for them.

This is the Polymer full-size version of the Witness and has had literally 50 rounds put through it.  The results are displayed in the images.  I am not a fan of polymer guns like Glocks and XDs because I don’t like the feel of the molded plastic in my hand.

But because I love Tanfoglio, I decided to try their Polymer Witness.  Surprise, surprise, it feels like a polymer gun!  If you are comfortable with XD or Glock, you will be at home here.  It’s just not my thing.

I am selling this because I bought the steel version of this exact gun.  I love the brand, love the ease of modification, but just don't like polymer.  When you buy this I would love to show off my Tanfoglio collection and how the conversion kits work.  
It is all VERY VERY easy and makes a great shooting system for a reasonable price.

Taurus TCP 738 .380, Pink/Black, 6 round magazine, factory box and nylon belt pouch. Bought in May and had 1 shot, and only 1, put through it so far. Got it for the wife, but she doesn't like the size nor the way it fits her hands. She shot it once & said “Not for me”. I certainly won’t carry pink so it has to go. It is in perfect condition. Taurus carries a lifetime warranty. Asking $350.00 because I think it is a fair price for a 'Like New' pistol but I will consider any fair offer. For more info call REDACTED."

959,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1671959,For Sale:  Difference between a Magazine and a Clip,"Learn as you go, Charleston, South Carolina",$ 1,"Listed On: Saturday, May 25, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Terminology... Magazine or Clip: 
 In small arms terms magazine usually refers to a box, drum or tube with a spring inside to help feed the rounds. Magazines can be a fixed part of the weapon, or detachable. Most detachable magazines (often referred to as a clip, although this is technically inaccurate) can be removed and replaced with a full one to reload the weapon, but there are guns such as the Lee Enfield where the magazine is only removed for cleaning, and is refilled by a different mechanism. (more of this in a moment).

 The ammo Clip was invented in 1885 by Mannlicher and provided a way to place a full load of rounds into a magazine in one action. What many people do not appreciate is that the Clip also forms an integral part of the gun's mechanism. If the rounds are not held in a Clip the gun cannot go through the full cycle of chamber, fire and eject."
