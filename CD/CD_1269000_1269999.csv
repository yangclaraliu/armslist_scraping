First is a Saiga .223 which I converted.  These are no longer imported and no longer will be imported, as such are getting and going to be pretty rare guns.  It is a Russian made AK type rifle.  Fully 922R compliant with a bullet guide installed so it can use milsurp magazines.  The gun has a US made laminate buttstock and a custom Rhineland Arms walnut handguard.  The gun is also outfitted with a USPalm pistol grip, Tapco trigger group with retaining plate, Tac-47 industries trigger guard and AKARS hinged dust cover and pic-rail.  The rifle also comes with 6 Bulgarian Circle 10 Gen 2 translucent 30 round magazines, the original Russian black polymer furniture and dust cover.  Round count is around 180 rounds, and it has an exceptionally smooth action rivaling many of my ""higher end"" AKs.  Price is 1150$ for the gun and all the kit.

Secondly I have a Ruger Mini 14 Tactical.  This gun has seen fewer than 100 rounds.  It is a GBP model, meaning it has an 18 inch barrel rather than the standard 16 inch.  GBP models are very rare birds, they were built as FBI/Borderguard issue guns and the overruns were sold to the public, as such very few are in public hands.  The gun has a Hogue OD green rubberized stock and an Ultimak scount 1913 rail mount for optics.  The rifle comes with the original stock and handguard, box, and 11 Ruger factory 30 round steel magazines, as well as 2 Ruger factory 20 round magazines.  Price is 1600$ for the entire package.

Buyer must have an FFL willing to accept transfer from a private individual or pay for my FFL to send to an FFL who will only accept transfer from a dealer.  For local sales I need a copy of a valid drivers liscense."

It has only had about 300 (about half of a 525 round brick) rounds through it.  These are very scarce right now, much like the tactical Knoxx stock it is in.  It comes with all the original equipment (Laminated stock, 10 round mag, weaver rail, soft case, box, manual, etc...).  As you can see I put it in a new stock making it lighter and shorter overall length.  I also added an extra long picatinny rail in place of the original rail and 45 degree AR-15 sights.  I ran this setup with a red dot or scope on top and the 45 degree sights to the side...made for very versatile and quick sighting system.  Internally, i added in a volquartsen recoil buffer, volquartsen extractor, and volquartsen target hammer.  The target hammer made the trigger really nice.  I will also include all of the original parts.
I decided I wanted to sell it and turn it into a bolt .22lr, so all this accumulation is my loss and your gain.  I do have a few bx-25 magazines that I am selling independently.

The CM Series takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.

Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after extended use.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols.

This is the product description from when I purchased it: """"This ammo was 1970's manufacture Russian surplus imported for a government contract which never worked out and the importer had to de-mil this ammo by removing the steel core bullet and replacing it with a lead core bullet so it could legally be sold to the consumer market.

Mossberg International's new lightweight Tactical .22 combines the look and feel of today's AR-style platforms with Mossberg International's reliable and affordable .22 autoloader. Taking cues from the proven 702 autoloader, the Tactical .22 matches an 18"" barrel to a quad-rail forend, giving any shooter the opportunity to easily customize the Tactical .22 with lights, lasers or any number of AR accessories currently in the marketplace. The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13"" length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4"" - 14.5"" LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights. Other features included with the Tactical .22 are sling mounts and a ten round magazine.

We all know CA has the strictest laws and what they are proposing is flat out ridiculous!
We all know the US and the internet is all completely out of AR Lower Receivers and back orders are more than 6-12 months long. Also, complete built new or used AR-15s are ridiculous in price so why not buy a lower and complete the rest when prices are normal.
The Reason why the price is at a premium: I've been looking for an AR Lower for 3 months now, I've spent countless hours trying to locate one and I actually had to camp out 10+ hours to get it. I bought 2 (1 to keep and 1 to sell). I also know FFLs around the Bay Area that will only charge $10 for the transfer + $25 for the background check. This is also a real machined lower, not a polymer one.

It has only had about 20 rounds through it. These are very scarce right now, much like the tactical Knoxx stock it is in. It comes with all the original equipment (Laminated stock, 10 round mag, weaver rail, soft case, box, manual, etc...). As you can see I put it in a new stock making it lighter and shorter overall length. I also added an extra long picatinny rail in place of the original rail and 45 degree AR-15 sights. I ran this setup with a red dot or scope on top and the 45 degree sights to the side...made for very versatile and quick sighting system. Internally, i added in a volquartsen recoil buffer, volquartsen extractor, and volquartsen target hammer. The target hammer made the trigger really nice...thats about it.
I decided I wanted to sell it and turn it into a bolt .22lr, so all this accumulation is my loss and your gain. I do have a few bx-25 magazines that I am selling independently. If you want one or two I will hold one for you to buy if you buy this pistol. Yes, legally this is a pistol not a short barreled rifle :).

Here is a nice clean FEG PA-63  9mm MAK.  Very few marks on the gun and it shoots and functions just fine.  What else do these old military pistols do?  In comes with 2 magazines.  It has a aluminum frame and a steel slide.  Sized about right for a conceal carry but maybe a bit heavy for some.  It shoots the 9mm x 18mm round.  A little less horse power than a 9x19 but will still put your eye out:-)  I'm asking 150.00 FIRM for this pistol.

Testing the waters to see what is out there.
I have a pistol that is begging to be shot,i however cannot bring myself to do it.
I have a Sig Sauer,POW,MIA tribute 1911 with matching Ka-Bar POW,MIA Knife
This is a very limited production tribute edition of only 500 produced.This beautiful piece is number 363
It comes with a certificate of authenticity,all of the manuals,paperwork,lock etc
The pistol is engraved with a barbwire fence pattern on the sides of the slide,an American flag on top towards the rear sight and up front by the forward sight
it has a pair of dog tags .One says,""i will uphold and protect the constitution against all enemies"" and the other says,""Not Forgotten"". It Has custom engraved
POW/MIA grips and all of this comes packed in a Pelican IM2100 storm case straight from the factory.
This is the all stainless model.
It also has very bright night sights
This pistol has not been shot,had a round even inserted in the magazine or anything remotely close and has only seen the light of day a few times.
It is perhaps the most beautiful 1911 I have ever owned and the tribute to those that it honors makes it all the more beautiful.
I can't shoot it,i am afraid to bring it out even to show it off so I am placing this ad for a VERY limited time to see if anybody would like a collectors 
piece of this caliber that either has stronger will power than I or will shoot it.
I am interested in all trades of firearms or firearm related items.Please be reasonable and realistic with your offers and take into consideration that this is not your average 1911."
