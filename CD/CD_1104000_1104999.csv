If you feel the need to tell me that OD Green Glocks are worth the same as regular black ones this isn't the gun for you, you obviously aren't as knowledgeable about Glock as you think you are. LOTS of self proclaimed experts out there. I don't care that your local gun store has a display case full of these for $489, I don't care how much you've seen this at a gun show for, I don't care what your ""current gun value book"" says, and I'm not impressed that you own 2 of these... I'll be just fine without your advice, thank you very much :)"

People that know me know that I change guns like people change their underwear. I recently owned 4 different Kahr pistols because I like them all. But the CM40 and CM9 are so similar I just decided to sell the CM40. It has trijicon night sights installed which is essential for any nighttime situation. Also, they glow so bright if the pistol is on your nightstand in the pitch dark you can see them bright to grab the gun. I attached a photo of the sights in the dark but its difficult to show them properly taking a photo in the complete dark. I do not need any other guns or ammo so please do not ask for any such trade via email or text. I will not respond because the response will be no sorry. Price is firm and my guns always sell FAST because I take care of everything I own in life so everything I sell is always like new. We can meet at a Las Vegas Metro Substation and do the sale and transfer to you. Buying this LIKE NEW pistol saves you from having to pay for sales tax, background fee, transfer fee, or night sights installation.So again NO TRADES NO TRADES NO TRADES, PRICE IS FIRM PRICE IS FIRM.

The subject of this review is my own Bushmaster XM-15-E2S that was made in Windham, (I got mine!). It is an A3 model with an A2 style fixed buttstock, handle sight, 20 inch heavy barrel with 1 turn in 9 inch twist rifling, bayonet lug, birdcage flash suppressor and it came with a 30 round magazine.
This Bushmaster rifle is chambered for .223 Remington and 5.56mm NATO rounds and is marked as such, so both may be safely used. I don't recommend that these rounds be used interchangeably in any firearm that is not specifically marked for both. There are many that believe that the .223 Remington and the 5.56mm NATO round are the same but in fact they are not. According to Small Arms Manufacturers Institute, Inc, (SAAMI), it is unsafe to fire 5.56mm NATO rounds in firearms chambered for .223 Remington. If you do a little Google searching around the Internet you can find the technical information related to that subject if it interests you. Be careful and only use the ammunition your firearm is designed to fire safely."

The Saiga Trigger Guard is a bolt on trigger guard for Saiga 7.62x39, 223, 410, 5.45x39, 410 & 20ga Shotguns and most AK47's rifles, it relocates the trigger guard so that you can add a AK pistol grip. This trigger guard is precision laser cut from 16 gauge sheet metal and then formed in a state of the art facility.  It is then de-burred; PEM nuts and stud are inserted, and coated in a durable black powder coat.  The trigger guard kit includes all of the nuts and bolts needed to convert your Saiga to accept AK Pistol grips without the need to drill holes in the receiver except 308. Two new holes must be drilled for the 308 Rifle. The trigger guard attaches to the shotgun using the two rivet holes from the sporter cover plate and the slot from the OEM trigger hole.  The front hole uses an 8-32 stud into the receiver body.  A low profile hex nut attaches to this stud inside the receiver.  The rear two holes use button head screws from inside the receiver to attach the trigger guard.  Width and height of the trigger guard closely mimic a 'standard' AK-47 trigger guard.

 W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel (Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating.

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.

Hi There Fellow Readiness and Prepper Friends!

Great News!  You have landed on the Southern Readiness Conference Website just in time to join us for the First Annual Southern Readiness Conference.

What does this mean for you?

Basically, that we have secured a first class venue, expert speakers and the top prepper vendors in this area.  All in one place for one day only!

Friends, lets be honest… things are not taking a turn for the best out there and the time is NOW to get serious about being ready for anything that may come our way.  This doesn’t happen by sitting on our couches, hoping for the best… it happens ONE WAY ONLY… we must prepare ourselves, our families and homes for anything that may threaten our ability to protect and provide for our families."

Let's wait until we have all of the facts about what will be presented on the House floor).

""The Magazine Ban and the AR 15 Ban are pretty much dead in the legislature this year. There are not the votes to pass them, and also the Senate Chair of the Public Safety Counterpart to the House, has dropped the bills and said that it is better approached by the Feds. Basically, there is no way now, I believe, that a gun or mag ban will pass in Minnesota. Hopefully, the price of ARs will come down and the availability go up. More important, however, is the saving of our Constiutional Rights in this endeavor. The next thing to worry about is all the other bills, to include the Universal Background Check. It's still alive!!! It comes up this Thurs at noon in the Senate. Pleaese re post and tell everyone to come."

LWRC® M6A2 5.56 NATO 16"" Semi-Auto Rifle Flat Dark Earth

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories. The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

For $3000 I will include the surefire and a Eotech XPS3 (not pictured).


On the top half of the case is a Stag Arms 6.8 upper and lower. The lower has an ambidextrous single point sling adapter and a single point sling. The upper has the free float forend, and a nickel boron bolt carrier group. I pulled it out in the pic so you can see how clean they keep. They dont get any carbon build up on them at all. The optics is a 3-9x50 basic scope zeroed in at 200yds. Its not a super high end scope, but ARs dont kick like mules either. It has been holding up to the 6.8 recoil for around 200 rounds that Ive put down it. It comes with 2 magazines stamped 6.8 and 1 box of Hornady 6.8 ammo.
The lower half of the gun case is a DPMS 5.56/.223 upper with 1:9 twist. It has quad rail forend with all the rail adapters to put over the rails if you want to use them. Also comes with a fold down foregrip attached to it. Standard bolt carrier in it also. The light is a surefire millenium universal ($350) with the M93 mounting base $175(quick release) and the KM3 light head $250 on it (switches between white light and infrared). It comes with a NcStar 4x32 (not pictured) scope that has a red laser on it as well and has the quick detach/attach lever. I have 2 new in the box GI style mags, 2 used mags, 3x20rd boxes of ammo, and a bag of loose reloaded ammo leftover from a box I got at a gun show last year.
The 5.56 upper will mount to the 6.8 lower perfectly and will take the 5.56 mags as well. Basically 2 uppers and 1 lower to make 2 different caliber rifles. I target shoot here and there with the 5.56 and used the 6.8 to hunt hogs in TX, although I did drop a doe with it a few weeks ago.
The entire set up was almost $2500 BEFORE the stupid rise in value of these 'assault' rifles. The surefire alone was over $500."

Mossberg International’s new lightweight Tactical .22 combines the look and feel of today’s AR-style platforms with Mossberg International’s reliable and affordable .22 autoloader. Taking cues from the proven 702 autoloader, the Tactical .22 matches an 18” barrel to a quad-rail forend, giving any shooter the opportunity to easily customize the Tactical .22 with lights, lasers or any number of AR accessories currently in the marketplace. The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13” length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4” – 14.5” LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights.
