I bought this pistol, shot it a little (50 rounds, some JHP, some FMJ) - no failures.  It's a fine gun.  I have discovered that carrying a gun with no safety makes me nervous and have switched back to carrying a different pistol.  I only carried this about a week - no holster wear.  No wear of any kind.  I've owned it for 2 months, shot it once, cleaned it twice, and now its sitting because I think I would prefer something with a safety.  Comes as original - with box, paperwork, and one mag.  I am only interested in trades.   I am interested in something SA/DA with a safety, or if it is DAO - with a safety.  .380, 9mm, .40, .45.   I am in no big hurry to make this trade, want to see what interesting trades are offered.   I could see money included in the deal one way or another depending on trade value.  But, I am not interested in selling outright.   Let me know what you have, and what your offer is.  I am willing to travel moderate distances to accomodate.  Will require you to show I.D., and be willing to sign bill of sale."

This is the nibX or NIB-X model which is also known as a Nickel Boron Treatment. This NIB-X model looks just like the slide has been polished but without the obnoxious chrome look. These models are known to not only wear better but also feed rounds very smoothly and operate flawlessly. This model comes factory like this and has not been re-finished. As you can see in the pics this also has bright, single dot trijicon night sights with an orange dot on the front sight. It looks really cool. This g27 has been fired but not very much and is in great condition. There is no slide wear whatsoever and by looking at the barrel alone you would never know that it had been fired. Round count is less than 20 total. 

I am really looking to trade this one and would possibly consider selling but I am not going to put a price on it. There are not too many of these running around and as much as most people love to throw around the premium price and rare word, this one is a bit more rare than most glocks, especially in a g27. 

I am looking for a couple of things. Mainly I want a new home defense handgun. I am looking at something with a rail and prefer a full size with a minimum of a 4.5inch barrel. I am open to 9mm, .40 or .45. 

I love the Springfield XDM 5.25 Competition and would trade straight up for one. I also like H&K, Kimber, Springfield, etc, higher end handguns and I can add cash, mags, ammo, etc to a deal to be fair. 

I wouldn't mind hearing other offers and won't exclude a good deal including other glocks in gen4 of gen3. If it's a basic gen 4 or gen 3 then I would expect cash, accessories, etc on top to even out the trade. Not looking for revolvers unless you have a ruger lcr or s&w 351pd - both in a .22 magnum round only, I do not want offers on any other revolvers and only in the .22mag model. No lower end handguns, no shotguns, hunting rifles, etc. If you have a nice AR your looking to trade I'd open to offers as well, and again I can add cash on top. I am only open to nicer AR's including colt, sig, ruger, daniel defense, lwrc, etc. I also might, strong might, consider a really nice Spike's if it's reasonable. Please no dpms, bushmaster, etc. 

If you have any questions, please ask

The gun is in good shape with the occasional nicks on the stock consistent with light range use.  Of course comes with the Nasco case shown in the pictures.  Adjustable comb and butt plate as well.

As to why I'm selling it, I don't have time to spend at the range anymore.  When I bought the gun I was single, now I have a family and other commitments and I can never get any time to shoot.  When I do (couple times a year), it is usually just with friends and I have a 20ga silver pigeon I keep for that.

Reasonable offers will be considered."

Whether you choose one chambered for .22 LR, .22 Magnum,  the Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design. Henry selected the Golden Boy as the canvas for the application of fine hand engraving which elevates an already beautiful rifle into a work of art. The result represents the true marriage of state of the art gunsmithing with the centuries old craft of engraving.

1962 Remington® Nylon12™ (Scoped) (15 Round) .22 S/L/LR Rifle:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Built in conjunction with Remington's then parent company, Dupont®, the Nylon line of rifles were the first successful synthetic stocked firearms on the market. These new stocks came with a guarantee not to crack, chip, fade, or peel for the life of the rifle. True to that promise, the stock on this Nylon12™ exhibits none of those problems. It does have minor scratches (most of which could be buffed out), and normal signs of use and wear. 
In addition, Remington's Nylon stocks were found to weigh much less than traditional wooden stocks. With scope, this rifle weighs just over 5 lbs., and just over 4 lbs. without it. 
It features an under-barrel tubular magazine for quick and easy loading and unloading, and holds 15-rounds of .22 short, and 13 rounds of .22 long, or .22 long rifle ammunition. 
	The safety is a convenient forward-back thumb-slide. 
	In good condition overall, this is one you can’t afford to pass up! 
	Feel free to email any questions, comments, or reasonable offers. 

Dating the rifles: 
Remington puts a 2-letter code on the barrels of all of its rifles. This code indicates the month and year of production. This barrel is marked “P J”. “P” is for the month of June; “J” is the year 1962. (See: http://www.nylonrifles.com/wp/2009/11/datecodes/ ). 

Serial Numbers: 
Prior to the Gun Control Act of 1968 rifles were not required to have serial numbers on them, and this one does not.

They know that the story of today’s Colt commercial and sporting rifles began with the Stoner AR-15® design that Colt transformed into a military-grade rifle -- the Colt M16 automatic rifle. First deployed in the early days of the Vietnam War, the M16 followed in the footsteps of its Colt ancestors, establishing the quality, reliability and performance benchmarks by which all tactical military rifles have since been measured.

Nearly half a century has elapsed since the United States Government first fielded the Colt M16. Since that time Colt has never surrendered its position as manufacturer of the world’s preeminent combat rifles. During the War on Terror that followed September 11, 2001, American troops have increasingly been outfitted with the Colt M4 carbine, successor to the Colt M16 and proud bearer of the American and Colt military tradition.

Colt’s rifles are the only rifles available to sportsmen, hunters and other shooters that are manufactured in the Colt factory and based on the same military standards and specifications as the United States issue Colt M16 rifle and M4 carbine. Colt customers want the best, and none of Colt’s competitors can match the quality, reliability, accuracy and performance built into every Colt rifle.

This is the Chinese .45 ACP version of the original 9mm C96 Mauser manufactured at the Shansei Arsenal, China in 1929. It was manufactured at the order of the Warlord of that Province due to the .45 ACP round being in abundance as compared to 9MM because it was the main caliber of the American weapons and ammo being supplied to them at that time by the US. Approximately 8,000 of these Shansei model pistol C96 copies were manufactured in 45 ACP. The Magazine capacity is 10 rounds. This pistol comes with an over the shoulder holster, 2 stripper clips and 10 rounds of old standard 45ACP ammo. The pistol bears the SHANSEI PANEL MARKING. See photos. Serial #1835 all numbers match.

Ok guys and gals. here is your chance to buy some ammo from me. 
I have some 100 bulk boxes sw winchester red/white fmj .40 sw  boxes.
and
I have 2 250 round umc remingtom 180 gr . I am just going to take good nice offers. All of you know how hard it is to get ammo. I have driven all over omaha many many hours and days to get this ammo. I do not want to sell all of it, but am listing it to see the activity.
I will tell you right now at fremont arms and ammo I paid 62 plus tax for the .40 sw winchestyer red and white. yes i know whack me but thats how it is just a few weeks ang and still ammo is all sold out.
I have 10 boxes of the 100 I think.  Offer accordingly and who ever emails me and stuff with a good offer. I dont mean 40 bucks a box for the 100 rounds either, as I just told you how much I paid for them. 
The umc 250 round bulk boxes. Now those i just saw at arms and ammo also for 169 dollars. So now you know the general thought process.

if you are the lucky one I will email you and or call. If you would like email me your cell number to contact you. no i wont call you after 9pm . and i also will not fuss with you. The reason i am asking your number is I live in Fremont and when I have someone that gets me an offer of good amount. I will take them in first come received in the email in case of a tie offer. Then I can call and discuss a meeting. 
If you think this is a dumb idea me taking offers that is ok. I have done offer me on craigs before and it worked out. Now doing ammo it might be I have to just set the price and whoever says i want it can drive over to fremont and pick it up.
I come to omaha often and goto engc range a lot. So if you are a engc member we might meet at the range, or someplace else depending on time and day.
ok, that just about does it. Thanks.

Oh, also say how many you want and the total offer price. The sale depending on how many people get with me might vary as far a quantity as 1000 redwhite and 500 umc is not all that much. 
Then asking yourself why do i want to sell this ammo. Question answer easy. To pay for my birthday pistol i bought at scheels sunday."

The Walther P22 is fascinating in its compact size, while still maintaining all of the features of a full size pistol. Constructed using a modular manufacturing concept, the P22 offers several different equipment configurations. Features include interchangeable backstraps that create an ideal fit to the shooters hand, ambidextrous controls for right or left-handed shooters, an integrated trigger lock and loaded chamber indicator, a magazine disconnect, a hammer safety and firing pin safety for safe and reliable operation, a fixed barrel for incredible accuracy, and a windage adjustable rear sight that combines with an interchangeable elevation adjustable front sight for variations in shooter operations.

The rear sight is adjustable for windage. The front sight is similar to an AR-15 style rifle, and adjustable for elevation. An integrated MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail will accept a multitude of standard accessories. The muzzle is threaded 1/2-28 TPI to accept standard attachments such as a muzzle brake or flash hider. Except for the barrel, bolt, sights, and mechanism, the PLR-16 pistol is made entirely of high-impact glass fiber reinforced polymer.

The guy I bought it from was the inherited it from the original owner, his parents. He sold it due to over crowding on guns and I've been holding onto it since. I haven't shot the shotgun due to a crack in the butt stock. I've read that these were very common to crack in the stocks. It was wrapped in tape by the original owners and seems sturdy so I haven't tried to unwrap it. The gun really looks like its in decent shape and I was told the shotgun was shot right before he sold it but at least its a nice wall hanger. These go for over 350.00 but because it needs a new stock (I've seen stocks going for 70.00 online) I am willing to lower the cost.

They know that the story of today’s Colt commercial and sporting rifles began with the Stoner AR-15® design that Colt transformed into a military-grade rifle -- the Colt M16 automatic rifle. First deployed in the early days of the Vietnam War, the M16 followed in the footsteps of its Colt ancestors, establishing the quality, reliability and performance benchmarks by which all tactical military rifles have since been measured. Nearly half a century has elapsed since the United States Government first fielded the Colt M16. Since that time Colt has never surrendered its position as manufacturer of the world’s preeminent combat rifles. During the War on Terror that followed September 11, 2001, American troops have increasingly been outfitted with the Colt M4 carbine, successor to the Colt M16 and proud bearer of the American and Colt military tradition. Colt’s rifles are the only rifles available to sportsmen, hunters and other shooters that are manufactured in the Colt factory and based on the same military standards and specifications as the United States issue Colt M16 rifle and M4 carbine. Colt customers want the best, and none of Colt’s competitors can match the quality, reliability, accuracy and performance built into every Colt rifle. Also comes with a magpul 30 round magazine"
