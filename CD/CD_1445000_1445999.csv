This powder is the result of combining the technologies of spherical powders and extruded propellants. The chemistry of a spherical powder is combined with the geometry of an extruded propellant, creating a smooth-metering, super short granule extruded shaped propellant with high energy. HYBRID 100V has a burn speed between H4350 and H4831, yeilding superb performance in such popular calibers as 270 Winchester, 243 Winchester Super Short Magnum, 7mm Remington Magnum, 300 Winchester Magnum and dozens more.
As the name implies, this new generation Extreme Extruded rifle propellant is a clean burning powder designed expressly for the 50 caliber BMG cartridge. Because it shares the same technology as VARGET, H50BMG displays a high degree of thermal stability in temperature extremes. Tests have conclusively proven that H50BMG yields very low extreme spreads in velocity and pressure. All this translates into small groups at extended ranges! Available in 1 lb. & 8 lb. containers

I am selling a brand new, never fired, Springfield M1a.  I purchased it last month from a large dealer, but due to family issues have to sell.  standard military style model, walnut stock, flash suppressor. 

With gun legislation in the senate, best-case it looks like this may be your last opportunity ever to buy one WITHOUT getting on any government future-confiscation lists;  Especially for the full-capacity magazines, it may be your last chance ever to legally buy them.

Included with the asking price are the rifle / box / factory documentation / and the ONE factory magazine.

As you know, full-capacity / high-capacity magazines are impossible to find these days (for good reason).  If you buy the gun, I am willing to sell up to 18x 20 round magazines.  8 are factory new GI mags, 10 are pro-mag, I'll sell them for what I paid.

I am from Seattle, but currently living in Boise, in town for the weekend helping with the aforementioned family issues.  I can meet in the redmond area tonight, mount vernon saturday evening, or seattle/bellevue in the morning Saturday or Sunday.

PB is great for Trap, Skeet, and Sporting Clays where heavy 1 ounce and 1-1/8 ounce loads are needed. In pistol it yields top performance in target and plinking loads for such cartridges as the 40 S&W, 45 Auto, etc. The small extruded grains deliver metering that is always super uniform.

This bulky powder really shines as a reduced load propellant for rifle cartridges. Its large grain size gives good loading density for reduced loads, enhancing velocity uniformity.

This scope kit is specifically designed to fit the following Henry rimfire lever and pump action rifles models:  H001, H001L, H001Y, H001M, H001V, H001T, H001TM, H001TV, H003T and H003TM. 

This scope kit DOES NOT FIT the Henry Golden Boy series which require a special barrel mount available from Henry Repeating Arms Company.

Leave the power set on 2x or 3x in the field and you’re ready for close-in, fast moving targets. As the target range increases, turn the magnification ring up to a higher power and you are ready for longer shots. For long shots at smaller targets, turn the power ring up to the full 6X power.

The mil-dot reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your rifle in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

We test a variety of scope and mount combinations on RIFLES until we find a scope package that works best for a particular rifle and application - and this is a great combination of a lightweight mini-scope and mounting system for your Henry rimfire rifle.

The sum of all parts if you wanted to order them new would come out to well over $5,000 and a very long wait. I don't really want to sell this as it has a lot of sentiment with me but I don't get a chance to shoot it and need cash for hunting rifles for me and my boy. The sale includes: Springfield armory barreled receiver in .308 (shoots both .308 and 7.62), unitized gas cylinder. Springfield armory trigger group, cleaned up and frog lubed. Factory LBs, breaks like glass. Sadlak Industries 82nd airborne mount. Rock solid steel 3 points of contact on receiver. Irons sights can be used and ran up to 1K setting underneath the mount. SWFA SS10x42M With butler creek flip ups and long sunshade. Shoots the box like a champ. Chosen for its consistency and durability. Was contracted by the Navy for their 50 cals because of its ruggedness and submersibility in salt water. Burris Xtreme tactical medium rings. JAE Gen 2 Dark Green stock Like new not even marks from the gun safe. Stock was designed to squeeze the most accuracy and consistancy out of M1A and M-14 style rifles. Full aluminum bedded for accuracy. Additional factory options included: Barrel tensioner (Allows to be tuned for accuracy, counteracts accuracy lost from barrel heat during rapid fire), grip rest, front bottom rail for bipod, adjustable cheek rest with spacers, off hand grip with rail for mono pod, QD cups all over the place for quick disconnect sling mounts, 2 quick disconnect sling mounts, butt pad, and monopod (I believe the monopod is made by accushot and supplied to JAE.) These are all JAE parts and can be found on their website. Harris bipod, with horizontal swivel. All rifle metal has been treated with frog lube so that the rifle does not need to be constantly broken down for cleaning and re-zeroed. 1 20 rd Springfield steel mag 7 20 rd ProMag steel mags 1 20 rd polymer mag. 1 Springfield armory 5 or 10 round mag, can't remember which. 1 Black handguard. Brownells chamber brush. A ton of paperwork and books on m1a's. Only has superficial marks in finish at the rear sight and the handguard from installation and fitting. They are visible in the pictures. Has had 210 rounds fired. Very accurate, sub MOA with tensioner adjusted, ammo and shooter dependent. Ships to FFL only. Buyer pays shipping and FFL fees.

For a general description go to STIguns.com

I bought this gun used with less than 1,000 rounds through it. I have ran less than 200 thru it. It has been well cared for and comes with a lot of extras. The gun was cleaned after every range session. Here are some specs:

Barrel(s): The gun comes with 2 barrels, the stock STI bull barrel and a Storm Lake extended and threaded barrel. The thread pitch is 13.5x1MM LH. The only reason I had it threaded in that pitch was the suppressor I had on order had a booster with the metric threads from the factory. I never planned on using my can on another handgun, that’s why I didn’t go with the 1/2x28 on the barrel and buy another piston from AAC. ¾ of the total rounds have been through the threaded barrel. I’ve only shot FMJ ammo out of both barrels. The threaded barrel was fitted by a certified gunsmith. The Storm Lake barrel comes with a thread protector. It was special order from Storm Lake since 5” 1911 bull barrels in 9x19 with metric threads aren’t that common…

Sights: The sights are Trijicon Heine night sights. The front and rear both glow green- one dot up front, one dot in the rear. Rear sight is serrated.

Grip: Grip has been stippled and has a great feel. It does gives more control without being overly aggressive. I left the area under/around the trigger guard untouched. If you wanted to replace it you can easily get a brand new grip with mainspring housing for $115 from Shooters Connection. The magwell is the STI 2011 aluminum magwell.

Internals: Gunsmith installed a Cylinder and Slide 1911 24/7/365 Professional 5lb. trigger pull set (http://www.cylinder-slide.com/index....how&ref=CS0324). It makes for a crisp, clean break. I also had an STI gunsmith blank flat trigger installed. I will include all the stock parts that came in the gun.

Holsters: I will also include a Safariland 6280-5621, a COM (center of mass) kydex holster and a Bladetech single magazine pouch. The Safariland is light-compatible. I bought it for use with a Streamlight TLR-2. The belt loops are 2”. The COM holster is not light compatible and has 1.5” belt loops (I bought if for use with an Ares gear Ranger belt). The Bladetech will fit 1.75” belts. All 3 are adjustable for tension. All are for right-handed shooters. Both holsters will accommodate the extended threaded barrel.

Magazines: I will include 4 magazines: 3 flush-fit 126mm mags (17 round) and one 170mm (26 round) mag. I did use a paint pen to mark the basepads with numbers and my initials (easily removed). Most importantly the mags have been tuned. They all have the stock basepads, followers and springs, but the feed lips have been adjusted for the gun. Originally I had feeding issues with some of the mags when shooting suppressed. The feed lips were to blame. STI mags can be finicky, but I’ve shot all 4 of these suppressed and unsuppressed and haven’t had any problems. Tuned mags can go for over $100 a piece so if you throw on a Dawson basepad/follower you’ll have some competition-ready mags.


Other: The mag release, ambi safety and slide release are stock. The gun has the stock Recoil Master guide rod/spring.

Asking $2,650 but will entertain any serious offer. The gun has to go. I've changed the class I plan to shoot in USPSA and have no use for this pistol. It's a great gun and will make someone very happy.

If you have any questions or want to make me an offer or want more pictures, feel free to email me at REDACTED or PM me.

I'll ship to your FFL or meet FTF near Pittsburgh at FFL.

I had a dream of building an awesome 22 rifle. I sold a few other posessions to collect enough money to afford this. I had purchased everything all at one time and had a local gunsmith put everything together and CLEAN the Ruger 10/22 components before installing. I have the scope sighted in 98% accurate at 150 foot. The laser needs to be positioned a little better, and the flashlight is squeeze triggered. 

However, I'm cursed with having more than 1 hobby and have to direct my interest towards RC Helicopters which are equally as expensive. 
So i am selling my 10/22 if the price is right.

I will be taking a loss but I am asking $850 for everything I have that goes with it.

If you are interested, please send me an email.

444,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1445444,For Sale:   ZASTAVA M57 7.62x25 PISTOL with EXTRA MAG (NIB!),"DU, Denver, Colorado",$ 315,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 28, 2013",Handguns,no type,no type,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Manufacturer: Zastava
Model: M57
Caliber: 7.62x25

 The M57 is the Yugoslavian made version of the Russian TT-33, which is based on John Browning's blowback operated FN Model 1903 (it uses Browning's short recoil dropping-barrel system from the M1911). However, it employs a much simpler hammer/sear assembly than the M1911, and the Soviet engineers also added several other features such as locking lugs all around the barrel (not just on top), and made several alterations to make the mechanism easier to maintain, notably a captive recoil spring secured to the guide rod which does not depend on the barrel bushing to hold it under tension. The Yugoslavian M57 has been popular for decades thanks to its proven track record, reliability and high quality.

The M57 is an all metal single action and is known for its precision and ease of use. It is the ideal defense weapon, as it is easy to handle and maintain. The pistol has fixed iron sights. Its handgrip covers are made of selected walnut or of polymer.

On a practical note, consider what handgun ammo is always out of stock these days: 22, 22LR, 9MM .40S&W and of course .45ACP. This firearm utilizes a FAR less popular and relatively inexpensive round that is much easier to get a hold of nowadays. You wont find people making a run on 7.62x25. Ever. For those of you who reload, Reloadable cartridge cases can be produced by resizing and trimming 9mm Winchester Magnum brass, or alternately by reforming 5.56×45mm NATO.

Designed specifically for lightweight mobility, speed of target acquisition, and potent firepower capability - the Colt® Law Enforcement Carbine delivers. This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military Colt M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Colt Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30.5 in (77.5 cm) in length and weighs only 6.8 lb (3.08 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's Law Enforcement Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. LE6920 comes equipped with a Magpul MBUS backup sight."

It was bought new in 1997, never been fired and has been sitting in the gun cabinet for the last 16 years. And I am looking to find a good home for it. The pictures really don’t do the shotgun justice. 

The action is nice and tight, and is one of the best in the industry. One of its coolest features, it’s a bottom eject. So it would serve a left handed shooter, just as well as a right handed shooter. I’ve listed its spec’s bellow. 

The sale is only face to face. I will not ship the firearm. You will need to provide an Oregon State ID and sign a bill of sale. My asking price is $620. Which is a very fair asking price for a brand new, never been fired shotgun that is 16 years old. Gander Mountain has the shotgun listed for $649. And that is not including shipping/handling charges. And other associated fee’s that are required, when purchasing a new fire from a retailer.

Product Description:

The BPS has a solid reputation for long-lasting durability and an uncanny ability to keep on working no matter what Mother Nature does to stop it. The BPS combines the legendary Browning balance and handling with features that other pump actions don't have. It features rigid machined steel action bars, a forged and machined steel receiver, a convenient top-tang safety, and bottom ejection for ambidextrous operation. The BPS Hunter Engraved is built on a high-quality satin-finished walnut stock with a tastefully scrollwork engraved blued receiver and includes a recoil pad, a ventilated rib, and a set of three Invector-Plus choke tubes.

Up for grabs is a custom PLR-16. This is NOT BY ANY MEANS a stock PLR. It is completely decked out, and rigged for complete control and added accuracy. It has been cleanly stippled. (Don't mistake this stippling for a bunch of these bad mistakes of garbage stippling) it was done from FERAL CHILD GUNWORKS. It has a barrel shroud and magpul HORIZONTAL grip added for better control and when combined with the single point makes a strong platform and can easily be ""bump-fired"". ( it's legal because its not vertical) it has a decent red-dot sight on it(it allows for a fast sight picture for speed, and with it being compact and light is great for close quarters training). A single point sling mount was added, also included is a single point para-chord sling( super strong and is about 100-150 ft survivor rope). A birdcage flash suppressor was added to improve accuracy , Comes with a stippled P-mag, tactical style case, and 2 boxes of ammo. I have it consigned a a new gun shop downtown KYLE for $1300 (it's well under what all is done to the PLR and what comes with it, as you can see if you are not new to this it is far from a stock PLR and is a bargain in today's market) . Here is there number and address... REDACTED..... 109 w. center st Kyle, Tx ..open 10:00am-7:00pm Tue-Sat...... Thanks for looking"

Not ""brand new with only 100 rounds through it"" but totally new. I've never even loaded it! This is a quality factory-built Bushmaster, and not a cheaper DPMS product, or a plastic Carbon 15, or someone's garage build, and a complete ready-to-use package for less than some are selling their used, base model rifle.

Gun comes with:
-Factory box (if you want it)
-2 metal 30-round Bushmaster magazines (comes with only 1 in the store)
-Empty chamber indicator flag
-Lock and key
-Sling
-2 rail risers in case you want to use a big scope
-Warranty
-Owner's manual
-and whatever extra paperwork/coupons/etc are included normally

It has a receiver-length picatinny rail, 6-position adjustable stock, A2 flash suppressor on a threaded barrel, bayonet lug, and sling swivels. And unlike most modern AR's, the calibers are stamped on the mag well so you know it accepts BOTH .223 AND 5.56 ammunition, whatever you can find to use - no guessing that the NATO rounds MIGHT go boom without your gun going BOOM!

Also included is:
-A brand new (in the unopened box) BSA 42 mm red-dot scope sight with built-on sun shade
-100 rounds of new brass PMC X-tac 5.56 55 gr FMJ (perfect military round for this barrel)
-A brand new Tapco Intrafuse AR spanner wrench with a mil-spec castle wrench, receiver extension removal wrench, and A1/A2 flash suppressor wrench. It is manganese phosphate coated for durability, and has a lifetime warranty
-A brand new weather-resistant ammo box large enough for all the extras to fit in
-A brand new Midway USA padded tactical range bag with 4 velcro pockets to hold 30 round magazines, a middle velcro pocket, and a long zipper pocket.  It has handles and an adjustable strap on the back to carry by hand or over your shoulder.

With this complete AR 15 package you have everything you need, and can get it sighted in on the range and have some fun banging away without having to wait a couple months to find some clean ammo, or pay $1 a round.

The base model MSRP on the rifle is $1,391.48, and with this deal you avoid taxes, fees, and snoopy government agents.  I saw these at the last gun show going for around $1600 without any extras, so I'm listing it at $1550 (with ammo, red dot, wrench, bag, and ammo box included).  Face-to-face cash sale, prefer you have a CCW but not required.

I have a brand new rail-mountable tactical laser/light combo with pressure switches I can throw in for an extra $40.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.  However, do not ask if this is still available.  If the ad is up, the gun is still for sale.  Do not e-mail me that you saw this at Cabella's for $850 two days ago – you're lying and we both know it.  I'll just laugh at you, and probably put your idiocy and name on display in my next gun article for the whole gun world to laugh at you.  Ditto if you e-mail me with any other complaints or gripes without actually displaying any interest in the rifle."

The highlight is an M4-style bayonet (if you are aware of Mini 14's at all, you know what a big deal having a bayonet is) mounted on a BRAND NEW M4-style muzzle brake with winged front sight.  Other modifications on the rifle include a rear tech peep sight and a leather/green web sling.  

Extras include:  
-Original front blade sight (beat up a fair bit before I got it)
-Choate birdcage flash hider which slides over original front sight
-5 magazines
	2 metal 40 round
	1 OEM metal Ruger 20 round

-An extra magazine reinforcement bracket (if you want to be able to swap between two different stocks quickly, for example the wood stock and a tactical one)
-100 rounds of loose brass-cased .223 ammunition
-A brand new weather-resistant ammo can with rubber seal to keep out rain, humidity, etc
-A soft rifle sleeve to protect the gun

I have a handful more new Promag 20 round magazines for sale with or without the rifle, or I'd throw in for the right trade.  I also have extra PMC X-Tac 5.56 ammunition I will sell with the rifle only for $15/box.

I haven't fired it since installing the new sights/muzzle break so it will need to be sighted in on the range, but I did bore-sight it, so it shouldn't need too much adjustment.  This is in great condition, but is an older, used rifle so there's some wear to it.  A few dings in the stock and butt, some wear on the bluing, etc.  There's also some deep scratches on the mounting ring of the bayonet where the hole had to be enlarged to fit over the muzzle brake.  But everything is in great working order, and this is a unique Mini-14 for your collection or use.
