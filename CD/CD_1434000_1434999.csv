I have a total of 1,000 rounds of 9mm JHP & 100 rounds of FMJ ammo for sale. There is...

- 100 Rounds of Federal 115 gr. FMJ (not pictured)

- 200 Rounds of Hornady Critical Defense 115 gr. JHP

- 400 Rounds of Federal Hi-Shok 115 gr. JHP

- 400 Rounds of Federal +P+ 115 gr. JHP

- 1 Brand New .50 Cal Ammo Can That Holds 1,000 Rounds Perfectly

All of the ammo is in excellent condition and has been stored in the .50 cal ammo can with a desiccant pack, inside of my safe.

I want to sell all of the ammo in one lump sum, but if no one takes it all, I will sell the ammo in 250 round increments. Whoever buys 750 rounds or more, will get the ammo can and 100 rounds of FMJ for free.

1,100 rounds for $750.00 = .68 cents/round. If you can find 9mm JHP ammo, you will not find it for this price.

If you do not want to buy the entire 1,100 rounds, I will sell it in 250 round increments for $250.00.

I will drive 20 miles from Michigan City to meet for 250 round purchase and 45 miles for 1,100 round purchase.

CETME is the predescessor to the HK rifles. Its cambered in 7.62x51/.308 NATO. Semi-Automatic, closed bolt, gas operated. Very nice furniture, stamped steel reciever, forged steel guts. I have reason to belive this particular rifle was issued to most likely Spanish or Argtine troops, possibly circa the Falkland Islands Conflict. The only bad part about CETME rifles is tat CAI never put a date stamp on them, so there is no real way to know how old it is. It does have a very low serial nuber. In the way of CETME's this is a beauty and a rarity. They are renowned for their ability to be shot, blown-up, run-over, submerged, and generally beat up,but still perform without malfuntion and do so with remarkable accuracy. Many CETME rifles have issues with ""bolt head space"" This is the gap found between the bolt and bolt carrier group when the bolt is in the foreward position. My CETME has virtually NO HEADSPACE GAP. Some are also known to have charging handle malfuncions, mine doesnt. This particular rifle is in outstanding condition. The furniture shows wear less than most, reciever and barrel are like new. All interal parts are also like new. Most parts on this are interchangable with HK G3 parts, but not all. Comes with 9 magazines, and fully assembled and fully functioning CAI CETME. The best things about the CETME is its accuracy, durability, and its cartridge. The .308 has more ballistic energy at a half mile than a .357 Magnum at point blank range. This is a serious weapon, and a tack driver to boot. Let me know if your interested, Its really worth your deepest consideration."

The SpecOps folding stock offers compact storage and the ability to reduce perceived recoil by as much as 65%, even with the stock folded. The rubber coated wire-frame stock incorporates a rubber butt pad and is easy to fold over the top of the receiver for storage or transport. Recoil reduction is accomplished via the heavy spring within the pistol grip that is connected to, and provides resistance against, the shotgun receiver as it moves up and to the rear along an inclined surface during recoil. The receiver's movement and spring's resistance absorb a large amount of the recoil produced upon firing, meaning the shooter experiences significantly less unpleasantness."

In very very good condition, both cosmetically and functionally. 4"" barrel, pinned barrel, no lock. Manufactured sometime in the late 40's-50's. No finish wear where there shouldn't be, and the bluing is still very deep. Has been very well taken care of over the years. It is not a police trade-in and has never been issued to police/military/security etc, so it's in excellent shape. It looks like it hasn't been shot at all, never carried, and has sat in a temperature-controlled safe for most of its life. Put 50 rounds through it at the range and it hasn't had any problems. Look up the history of the Model 10 revolver, and you'll know that this is one of the most distinguished revolvers made. Originally designed in 1899 and widely used until the 80's, when the Glocks took over. Still in production to this day."

Some info about the 300 blackout upper:

This CMMG AR-15 Upper Assembly is chambered for the exciting new 300 AAC Blackout cartridge and is ready for instant, drop-in use on any standard small pin lower receiver. Great for a variety of different uses from hunting, to personal defense, to competition or just fun, the 300 Blackout offers shooters 30 caliber firepower in a standard AR-sized envelope.

The Chrome Moly Steel Barrel is finished inside and out with CMMG's durable Weapons Armament Surface Protection (WASP) Melonite treatment. The WASP Melonite process surface-hardens the metal, extending barrel service life by reducing friction in the bore and lessening bore surface wear. Also referred to as Salt Bath Nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, making for easier cleaning and maintenance. Nitriding converts the steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore."

It's just like the Mini 14, but it shoots the AK round instead of the AR round. It looks like and comes apart like an M1. This little rifle packs a punch and could easily blast through a cinderblock wall. It's just about as good as you're going to get in New York before being officially illegal.

It comes with the standard wood stock, which is perfectly legal in New York because it has no telescoping butt stock or pistol grip. The commies won't call it an assault weapon. It also comes with the ATI stock, which does have a collapsible butt stock and pistol grip. It also has side and top rails.

In addition, it has an Accu-Strut put on it to increase accuracy, and it has a 4x scope with its own rail. The scope rail gets mounted onto the rifle's sights. I've never used it because I'm not really a scope guy. The rifle also has a detachable flash suppressor, but that won't come with the package because it's illegal in New York now. The ATI Stock and the flash suppressor are included in the price, but must be paid for separately, as a second transaction.

It comes with a Ruger 5-round magazine and two aftermarket 10-round magazines, and a bolt lock. Does not come with a case. I prefer face-to-face, preferably some time in the middle of May. I moved to Virginia and won't be around New York again until then."

Hornady's V-Max Bullets feature a polymer tip which enhances accuracy and promotes devastating expansion. The tip raises the ballistic coefficient for faster velocity and helps to stabilize the bullet in flight. It also acts as a wedge, initiating bullet expansion. The copper jacket provides the necessary bearing surface for maximum stability out of the barrel, and the jacket is built to withstand the fast twist rates of the most advanced varmint rifles."

No waiting around in Walmart lines hoping to get lucky and only being able to get a ridiculous small amount or getting only Russian ammo.  Get it now and get back to shooting or add it to your stockpile.  500 rounds for $350.  This is what I paid when I bought it for my personal stock.  This price is firm.    

I get around to most areas of West TN often, so give me a shout.  Tipton, Lauderdale, Dyer, Madison, and North Shelby Counties.  I'm not gonna drive across country at this price, but we can work something out."
