Mossberg's 500 pump-action shotguns offer an amazing amount of gun for an unbeatable price. First and foremost, the 500 is built to the same uncompromising mil-specs as the renowned Mossberg 590. Then a host of features are introduced-Quiet Carry dual-action bars, 3"" chambers, and an ambidextrous safety, to name a few. A simple change of barrel and/or choke tubes is all that's required to take one shotgun from upland birds to waterfowl, to turkey, to deer. Mossberg's incredible Field/Deer Combo includes a 28-inch ported field barrel with a ventilated rib and twin bead sights and a 24-inch ported fully rifled Slugster barrel with an integral scope base. The hardwood stock has been carefully checkered and uses a dual-comb system to allow comfort adjustments. Includes full, modified, and improved cylinder Accu-Chokes.  Cheap scope also included.

Up for sale is a Rock River Arms LAR-8 Elite Operator that I purchased locally from Scheel's in Appleton on 12/31/2012.

Unfortunately I'm now going through a divorce and I need the money more than I need the rifle. The rifle is BRAND NEW from factory. I've never fired a single shot through this beauty, although I have swapped the standard Vortex flash hider for the RRA for a Smith LAR-8 muzzle brake. The original will be included for sale with purchase. I also have a total of 6, 20-round mags that will go with the rifle. 5 are the RRA OEM mags, and 1 is an aftermarket AR-10 style mag I bought from a local gun shop. The listed information from Rock River Arm's site is as follows:

This is a Mike Rock 5R barreled rifle.
Full Leupold scope rail with torx bolts.
Harris swivel, ""S"" benhrest model bipod.
Custom bolt work including, Badger handle, handle has been drilled, tapped and screwed to bolt,(It will never break., see last picture), and then it was all Teflon coated in black.

5R specs:
Barrel

    The rifle has a stainless alloy barrel at 24 inches long. The barrel's twist is RH 1:11.2 (many other rifles like it shoot RH 1:12). Originally, the 700 Milspec 5R was based on rejected rifle barrels that did not pass inspection on the M24 production line. These rejected barrels were then fitted onto the Remington 700 body and retooled as the ""Milispec"" rifle with a shorter twist.

Weight and Length

    The overall weight of the Milispec 5R is 8.25 lbs. (3.75 kg) and the length is 43.75 inches, or roughly 1,111 mm.

Magazine and Trigger

    The 5R's standard magazine is a five-round internal box. The trigger is Remington's own X-Mark Pro. The X-Mark Pro trigger has a pull weight of approximately 3-1/2 lbs. with roughly 2 lbs. of adjustment capability.

Stock and Finish

    The stock on the standard 5R is the HS Precision Composite and the finish is a dark gray/black color. Similar to Remington's Varmint Synthetic stocks, the 5R's stock is speckled with green within the gray/black of the plastic. Unlike the M24, which has a black powder-coated floorplate and metalwork, the 5R's barrel and action are unfinished stainless alloy.

Rifle has maybe 60 rounds through it.

You are looking at a Glock 26, para 9x19, 9mm Luger gun. I am the second owner and I have only maybe put a box through it. My friend that owned it before me maybe put 20 rounds through it. 
With this said the Glock 26 has been the most sought-after concealed carry gun since its release. It’s standard magazine capacity is 10 rounds, length 6.54”, width 1.18” and height of 4.17” and barrel length is 3.43”. Along with great quality of Glock, it comes with Trijicon night sights and would be willing to add ammunition for the right price. I am asking $650 without ammo. I will add ammunition price depending on how much you want. I have the original case it came in and all paper work. It also comes with two magazines and a speed loader. If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call or text me at REDACTED. Thank you for looking, bye."

The gun itself is pretty cool, and functions kinda like an AR. It has an ambidextrous magazine release,  you can lock the bolt to the rear to make sure the chamber is empty, and the bolt catches when your magazine is empty, which is something most .22's do not do."

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

These are the best alternative sights if you dont want to drop $500+ on a gucci real steel grade sight. 

They will fit on any standard 20mm/Picatinny/Weaver Rail. Body of the sight is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Comes with, padded box cleaning pad, double sided rubber dust covers, quick attach locking level or quick thumb screw, and 2x AA batteries. 

Reticle has 2 colors, red and green, 10 levels of brightness and is easily bright enough for the sunniest of days. 

Dont settle for the lower quality cheapo Chinese sights, they have terrible ghosting (shown in green) 

These have the clearest reticle on the market when it comes to replica sights. 
Please note that this is not a Eotech or a true holographic sight, but a red dot sight with reflex style internals.

These were designed and built to withstand recoil of real guns (.223/5.56 in mind), but will work on all airsoft guns with 20mm rails.

I have sold over 250 of these sights without any unit failures. 
Comes with 30 day warranty from manufacturer defects

FAQ:

Q: How long do the batteries last?
A: The included AA batteries should last at least ~120 hours

Q: Will this fit on my .......
A: Does it have standard 20mm rails? If so then yes.

Q: Is it full metal?
A: Yes. The body is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Q: Can it REALLY take recoil?
A: 2500 rounds and counting on an AK. If that doesn't answer the question, what will?

Q: What if it breaks? 
A: 30 day warranty covers all problems including external defects and electronic failures. 
It does not cover obvious abuse (IE throwing it, baking it in the oven, microwaving, using as campfire fuel or a driveway speedbump)
If your sight does fail, send me a message.

409,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1361409,For Sale:  Green/Red Dot Sight,"Milwaukee, Alabama, United States",$ 75,"Listed On: Tuesday, April 23, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Looking for a cool red dot but dont want to break the bank? 
These are the best alternative sights if you dont want to drop $500+ on a gucci real steel grade sight. 

They will fit on any standard 20mm/Picatinny/Weaver Rail. Body of the sight is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Comes with, padded box cleaning pad, double sided rubber dust covers, quick attach locking level or quick thumb screw, and 2x AA batteries. 

Reticle has 2 colors, red and green, 10 levels of brightness and is easily bright enough for the sunniest of days. 

Dont settle for the lower quality cheapo Chinese sights, they have terrible ghosting (shown in green) 

These have the clearest reticle on the market when it comes to replica sights. 
Please note that this is not a Eotech or a true holographic sight, but a red dot sight with reflex style internals.

These were designed and built to withstand recoil of real guns (.223/5.56 in mind), but will work on all airsoft guns with 20mm rails.

I have sold over 250 of these sights without any unit failures. 
Comes with 30 day warranty from manufacturer defects

FAQ:

Q: How long do the batteries last?
A: The included AA batteries should last at least ~120 hours

Q: Will this fit on my .......
A: Does it have standard 20mm rails? If so then yes.

Q: Is it full metal?
A: Yes. The body is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Q: Can it REALLY take recoil?
A: 2500 rounds and counting on an AK. If that doesn't answer the question, what will?

Q: What if it breaks? 
A: 30 day warranty covers all problems including external defects and electronic failures. 
It does not cover obvious abuse (IE throwing it, baking it in the oven, microwaving, using as campfire fuel or a driveway speedbump)
If your sight does fail, send me a message.

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

Stock # MSH230915SP. Serial # K49xxx. Another great addition to Jackson Armory’s growing inventory of Colt Pythons and other Colt “Snake Guns” (see our other listings) this is a fairly RARE Colt Python Silhouette. Designed, obviously, for competition silhouette shooting, the Silhouette, made only in 1983, is chambered for .357 Magnum, has an 8” barrel, and it originally came fitted with a Leupold 2X pistol scope. Looking somewhat like the Python Hunter, the scope mounting area on the barrel’s vent rib is in a different position than the Hunter, and the barrel is marked “Python Silhouette” on the left side. This pistol does not come with the scope. It has a blue finish, Colt factory wooden checkered grips, and a factory red ramp front sight. The pistol may have been refinished, certainly there are areas where it has been “touched up,” and there is minor freckling and service marks here and there, especially on the left side of the receiver –this was a “working gun,” not a “safe queen!”. Overall finish condition is about 85%"

I have a S&W Bodyguard and I tried talking her into getting one as well.  She is very petite though and sometimes had a hard time racking the Bodyguard so when the dealer showed her this Taurus which has the flip up barrel she fell in love with it.  It's a very light gun and feels good in your hand, also like a lot of other Taurus handguns it has a lot of safety features.  I bought it for her and told her as soon as it gets nice out we would go shooting.  So I took her out today for the first time and let her shoot it and after running the first magazine through it I could tell it was not what she wanted.  She's worried it's too under powered.  Obviously, it's a .22.  I have no need for this gun so that's why I'm selling it.  It is in brand new condition other than the 8 rounds that were fired through it today.  It will come with all the original paperwork and the case it came in.  $190 FIRM.  ( Yes, I know that they sell for $219.99 at some places, and you are more then welcome to buy one of those.

These come with the dust covers. The magazines are part number MAG217 and are GEN 2.

Note that these are brand new and have never been fired, however I did use one of them unloaded to test the assembly of my weapon (mags are still unfired). You can see a very slight, insignificant mark from the magazine catch on one of them in the last picture.

Perfect for bench shooting, sighting in your scope, or a smaller lighter setup with the compact magazine allows it to sit well on a bench or rest. The Polymer Magazine (PMAG™) is a lightweight 5.56 NATO, M-16 compatible magazine. The PMAG™ features a pop-off storage/dust cover that alleviates pressure from the magazine feed lips, allowing for storage of loaded magazines without risk of feed lip creep that often causes malfunction in standard aluminum magazines. PMAG™ utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance.

Purchased in 2008, it has been modified extensively and shot rarely, mostly due to no real range facilities.
Also looking to trim down the collection before moving back to the mainland.

Stock firearm is as follows:
- 18.5"" barrel (parkerized), with screw in chokes (two included; one improved cylinder, one modified)
- Barrel is ported for minimal recoil
- Aluminum receiver, anodized
- Tube capacity: 7+1 in the chamber (2 3/4"")
- Chamber accepts 2 3/4"", 3"" 12 gauge
- M16A2 style rear sight (adjustable for elevation/windage) and front sight post
- 1913 optics rail on the top of the receiver

Modifications include:
- SureFire 636 Fore-end with upgraded LED ($350 dollar value)
- Tritium AR-15 night sights (still work, $100 dollar value)
- Magpul MOE stock ($60)
- Magpul MIAD grip ($35)
- Magpul trigger guard ($10)
- Magpul ASAP plate ($30)
- TacStar 6 round side-saddle ($40)
- Mesa Tactical/Enidine Recoil stock ($150) - this is a spring/buffer system in the stock to reduce
felt recoil, it's really helpful for people intimidated by 12 gauge

All told this represents $1600+ dollars of investment

Looking for $1200.  Not looking for trades, not looking for ammo.  Just cash or cashiers check.  No offers.

I'm asking low enough for the shotgun as is.

If you'd like, I can configure the shotgun as was originally purchased (CAR stock, A2 pistol grip, no SureFire light)
