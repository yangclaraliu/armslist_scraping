Comes with one 8 round mag but the higher capacity magazines should work in it as well, and extra witness magazines are pretty inexpensive (about $25).  Most .45 caliber CZ pattern magazines will work in these as well (cz97, baby eagle).  

Im primarily interested in a Springfield XD40 sub compact or service model.  Might be interested in other subcompact or compact .40's.  I would also be interested in a ruger lcr or s&w bodyguard .38, or other similar snub nosed +P rated .38 revolvers.  Looking to trade only.

I think thats everything, its a good looking rifle, I just have several others and don't have a need for this one.  This rifle has had very few rounds down it, I'd guess a few mags just to test functionality.  The price is $900, and that is firm as it is a very fair price.  

I can sell some ammo with the gun if you need some, also have other mags I could sell.  I have my CCW."

Like I said, HK made ONLY 500 of these in OD Green so they are near impossible to find. I have it priced at lower than the norm if you can find one (the last one to go on Gunbroker went for 1,300). I have carried it some so it does have a little holster wear but it is in good condition. Wonderful gun but like I said I need to fund another project. The box, gun and two mags with finger plate will be included. Mine is the V1 configuration (DA/SA with decocker & safety) In 40c. It has standard sights as well. In addition I will include a kydex OWB holster (Fobus). Buyer will need a CCH or permit.

These are not airsoft toys. They are designed and used on REAL FIREARMS. I have used PA before and still have a PA scope on my 308 bolt gun. These are high quality optics

RED DOT:  Modeled after the Aimpoint Comp M2
I used the red dot for less than a year and have had ZERO issues with it. Still holds zero. Great battery life - over 200 hours (still has original battery in it). It uses 2 LR44 batteries or 1 1/3N lithium battery (same as the Aimpoint Comp M2). It's a 3 MOA dot and has 7 brightness settings. It is shock proof and water proof and has an anti-reflective front lens. Will come in original box with instructions, flip up covers, allen wrench, low mount, and sight. 

MAGNIFIER:
I mounted this and never got a chance to shoot with it. It is really easy to center on the red dot and it holds true. Makes longer shots much easier without having to switch to a scope. Has a one year replacement warranty. I purchased this in June of 2013. Waterproof and Nitrogen Purged.

Description:
Remington Core-Lokt was the first and original controlled expansion bullet, and remains the standard of big-game bullet performance. Its level of reliability is only exceeded by the amount of game it has taken over the years. Remington has been the leading innovator in modern centerfire cartridges - not only the bullets, but also Kleanbore, the first non-corrosive primers; the brass historically preferred by serious reloaders, and best blends of the finest powders available.

Express Core-Lokt Pointed Soft Point Bullet
Unquestionably the best all-around choice for modern big-game hunting. By adding a sleeker nose profile and higher ballistic coefficient to the dependable, controlled expansion characteristics of the Core-Lokt soft point, it combines exceptional bullet penetration and performance with flatter trajectory and higher down-range velocity and energy. The result is reliable expansion of almost 2x caliber diameter at virtually all ranges and practical velocities."

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss.
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

92 FS - A LEGEND IN FIREARMS.
The most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history.
The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them.
BERETTA U.S.A. RELIABILITY AND DURABILITY STATISTICS FOR THE BERETTA 9mm PISTOL.
• The average reliability of all M9 pistols tested at Beretta U.S.A. is 17,500 rounds without a stoppage.
• During one test of twelve pistols fired at Beretta U.S.A. before Army supervision, Beretta-made M9 pistols shot 168,000 rounds without a single malfunction.
• The Beretta 9mm pistol was the most reliable of all pistols tested in the 1984 competition which resulted in the award of the M9 contract to Beretta.
• Two-thirds of all M9 pistols endurance tested at Beretta U.S.A. fired 5,000 rounds without a single mal function or, at most, with only one malfunction.
