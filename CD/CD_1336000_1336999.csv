Melonite coated inside and out to resist corrosion. You can shoot cheap Russian surplus all day and not worry about ruining your gun.

I originally bought this to shoot 5.45, because the ammo is still cheap and available for around $180/1000. You can easily spend double that on .223 lately. It's a good investment during this panic--if you shoot a couple cases you've already broken even on this upper.

I am out of 5.45 magazines but I can show you where to get some for $25 each shipped. I would suggest using a heavier buffer and Wolff hammer spring as well, just because the 5.45 uppers function better that way.

He did a very nice job of engineering the milled receivers and assembling the rifle from the Yugo part kits. As i understand it, these kits were from the SOG debacle where the BATFE recalled a batch of M76's as they claimed they were capable of full auto fire. I don't go with that story, but it happened anyway. This was a total package with extra mags, scope and mount. Very nice rig. I have had good luck with hand loaded ammo and have a target to show what it will do in the hands of a semi-skilled shooter (me). The ZRAK scope has been upgraded to a brand new 8X model from PA Distributing. These scopes are pretty much unobtainable these days. A genuine Mitchell Arms M76 will cost you in the $4500 range, so this package is a bargain. $1900 plus UPS ground shipping. I expect the shipping to be around (estimate) $75 due to the heaviness of the rifle. Plus, I will ship the scope and accessories separate USPS Priority mail to ensure they don't get damaged in shipping the rifle. Payment is USPS MO's only, please. Must have FFL signed paper from FFL who accepts from non FFL holder. Will include my TX DL with shipment if that makes the FFL happy. Of course, know your local and state firearms laws.

Steel Picatinny Rail, Mounts Over Rear Sight Block

***PLEASE READ SPECIFICATIONS & FITMENT NOTES BEFORE PURCHASING***

There is no need for bent bolt handle with this Mount.

FEATURES: Allows for mounting of Scout Scope or other long eye relief optics to Mosin Nagant models M38, M44 & T53's without the need to drill & tap receiver or make any permanent modifications to firearm. It is designed to fit over rear sight block in order to allow for continued use of the original fixed/iron sights up to 100 meters. The Mount is rigid steel construction with Black Oxide finish. 100% Lifetime Warranty!

FITS:

 Soviet M38 & M44  Chinese T53

SPECIFICATIONS: This Mount utilizes the barrel pin hole and the pivot pin hole in the rear sight block. The Mount will accommodate a front to back (horizontal, parallel to bore axis) pin center distance of 1.56"" (39.6mm) to 1.79"" (45.4mm) and allows for an up and down (vertical, perpendicular to bore axis) pin center distance of .18"" (4.6mm) to .41"" (10.3mm). The Mount is designed to fit over rear sight blocks that measure between .750"" (19.05mm) and .787"" (20.00mm) wide. The total weight including hardware is 5.4 oz. Please note that we have made every reasonable effort to ensure that our Mount will work with the vast majority of M38, M44 & T53's. If for any reason our Mount does not work with your specific M38, M44 or T53 it can be returned (undamaged) for a full refund.

$63.00 - FREE Domestic Shipping

FITMENT NOTES:

This mount will NOT work for a 9130! See Model 9130-SSM for a 9130.

The pin hole in the rear sight block is often located inconsistently as a result of the original manufacturing process. The pin hole, relative to the pivot pin, is frequently not parallel and may be out of alignment or skewed. The Mount can only accommodate so much of this misalignment. You should measure the center distances from barrel pin to pivot pin on both sides and check those with the dimensions listed in the SPECIFICATIONS to ensure that the mount will fit properly. A 3mm drill is provided and can be used to clean out and straighten (to some degree) without enlarging the barrel pin hole once the pin is removed. The barrel pin hole and pivot pin hole in the rear sight block are generally .118"" (3.0mm) in diameter and the supplied 3mm bolts have a nominal OD of .115"" (2.92mm). This tight fit along with the use of an appropriate liquid thread locker for the screws and nuts, as well as proper tightening of the same should result in no movement of the Mount during normal firing recoil.

TOOLS REQUIRED:

Safety glasses, heavy gloves, solid work surface or vise, hammer, flat blade screw driver, 7/32? (5.5mm) socket driver or wrench, hand drill, and liquid thread locker. A MAPP (Methyl Acetylene Propadience Propane) gas torch and heavy duty punch may be required to remove existing pins from the rear sight block if they are soldered in place. You can usually find these items at your local hardware or plumbers supply. The application of heat, if done properly, will not cause damage. Keep in mind that you only need to reach the melting point of the solder and that this same temperature was achieved during original construction without adverse effects. Procedure provided in supplied instructions.

NOTE:

As with ANY scope on ANY mount, should it receive an impact (dropped, hit, etc.) it should not be trusted to be accurate. Thus the SEE-THRU feature of our Mount. You can always still use the original iron or open sights if you feel the Mount has been compromised. Design subject to change without prior notice.

Caution! Improper installation or use may result in damage to property, severe injury, or loss of life. If for any reason this product does not function properly, discontinue use immediately. Always practice proper SAFETY & ensure an UNLOADED condition before beginning installation."

I currently have an EOTech 552 holographic weapon sight mounted to it that I would be willing to sell. (sold my ar so now it's time to sell the sight) It is the newer model with the BDC (bullet drop compensation) reticle, runs off of 2 AA batteries and it is night vision compatible. Comes with the original hard case, a quick detach lever that I added to it, the original flat head screwdriver knob, and the allen wrench. It is like new. (I think it has 1 or 2 small scuffs) I bought it off my army buddy for $475 so I'll sell it for $425 just to get it sold.

I CAN SELL BOTH RIFLE AND EOTECH TOGETHER FOR $1000. THAT SAVES YOU $50!!!

 If I don't sell the rifle/sight before 4/6/13 I will take them to the wanamacher show and will be asking $700 for the rifle and $500 for the sight. 

MUST BE WILLING TO MEET FACE TO FACE IN TULSA, CASH ONLY OR CASH+TRADE. FOR THE RIFLE - MUST BE WILLING TO SIGN A BILL OF SALE/TRADE, BE AN OKLAHOMA RESIDENT AND A NON-FELON.

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

Shipping is via Priority - I am offering a discounted flat rate of $5 for up to 4 magazines, and $10 for 5 or more.

Prices are $25 each, $120 for 5 or $230 for 10."

In combat operations, aviators and other special operators must be prepared to survive and evade in hostile territory. For obvious reasons, night movement is the best choice for evasive movement, but it is generally discouraged because the evader can stumble into unfriendly hands or get lost. NVEC's ENVIS is the survival tool designed specifically to overcome these hazards. . It is a lightweight night vision pocketscope that fits in one hand for direct viewing. It can easily convert a standard still or video camera into a high quality night vision recording device. It attaches to the objective lens threads of most cameras for temporary nighttime applications. The removable objective lens can be replaced with any C-Mount Type lens for increased range and magnification.

959,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1336959,For Sale:  Sen. Reid Gun Bill - HELP!,"USA, Denver, Colorado",$ 1,"Listed On: Monday, March 25, 2013",Events,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Sen. Reid Beefs up “Base Bill” to
Destroy Gun Ownership 

""Unholy alliances"" could become a concern

We now know a lot more about what's going to happen with gun control legislation than we did a few days ago.

First, the number of the bill we are fighting is S. 649. Harry Reid introduced it on Thursday and brought it directly onto the Senate calendar. This means the bill can now come up at any time — probably soon after the Easter recess is over.

Second, the bill is a lot worse than even we anticipated.

We expected it to contain the Veterans Gun Ban, which would mean that you would sell, gift, or raffle a gun in America at the risk of a 15-year prison sentence because of something you didn't know about the veteran/buyer.

But, surprisingly to us, the Far Left has convinced Reid to include the original Schumer version of the Universal Registry Bill. This would ban private sales of firearms, unless purchasers first get the permission from the government. If Senators can pass this de facto registration bill, they will be well on the way to confiscation (see, for example, Governor Andrew Cuomo in New York, who has a gun owner registry and has called for gun confiscation). If this bill is passed, Senators will claim that they ""broke the back"" of gun owners in America.

Third, there is still every evidence that Reid will move to proceed to the bill under ""regular order,"" which means he will need 60 votes to advance to the ""gun control buffet.""

GOA has been talking and making our case with a host of Senate Republicans, and we would hope that everyone in the Senate understands the importance of stopping the ""motion to proceed"" to Reid's gun control legislation.

Fourth, as we predicted, anti-gun zealots have begun to use the ""ObamaCare Paradigm"" to threaten, bribe, and coerce senators into submission on the most far-reaching aspects of gun control, including Feinstein's proposal to ban shotguns, rifles and handguns that millions of Americans legally own. So if the ""motion to proceed"" to S. 649 is adopted with 60 votes, then Feinstein's ban could be passed in the Senate with only 50 votes (plus Biden). Click here for a more technical explanation as to how this would occur.

Already, articles are being published to intimidate any Democratic Senator who votes against any gun control and threatening them with the prospect of facing an anti-gun primary challenger — just like we saw on ObamaCare.

Fifth, there may be unholy alliances at work which could succeed in achieving a dangerous gun control compromise. One Capitol Hill newspaper is now reporting that ""Sen. Joe Manchin and the National Rifle Association are quietly engaged in private talks on a proposal to broaden background checks on purchasers of firearms."" We hope this is not true, however you should be aware of this report and use whatever contacts you have to prevent this from happening. Be assured, you can rely on Gun Owners of America to never engage in any compromises!

ACTION: The strategy remains: We need to defeat this bill by filibustering and voting down the ""motion to proceed"" to S. 649. Please contact your senators and distribute this alert far and wide.

Here is what appears to be a fairly rare Mossberg S51M 22 rifle.  Looks like they were made late 1930's/early 1940's.  The S indicates it was made for the Spiegel catalog of the day.The Monte Carlo full wood mannlicher stock looks very nice, receiver is tapped for a scope.  It has different front sights that flip up and down, supposed to be made for accuracy.  The main flaw appears to be scratches on the bluing next to the wood, apparently someone must have refinished the stock at one time and sanded it without removing the stock, leaving scratches all around the bluing next to the stock.  I suppose the bluing could be touched up if you wanted to.  Available for local pickup/delivery from Ashland to Chippewa Falls area, as I travel back and forth a lot, or will ship rifles to another Wisconsin resident 18 or older for about $25, or to FFL in other state if legal in your area, your responsible to find out. UPS next day to FFL for handguns. Thanks for looking, will be adding more guns as time allows"
