This gun has seen range time only once. I bought it a few years ago when I considered getting into the assault rifle world but didn't really want to go full blown with a high end AK-47 or even low end AR-15 as made by Bushmaster. It was and is a good gun with a good reputation but at the end of the day, I'm either a pistol guy or a long range rifle guy, that's what floats my boat. This gun comes with Hi-Point's lifetime warranty that is transferable to whomever buys the gun. I don't know of any other companies that offer that. The gun has under 100 rounds to it and that includes the test round from the factory. This gun comes with the standard 10 round magazine and one 15 round high capacity magazine (Sounds kind of funny, 15 rounds being high capacity). This gun also comes with the carrying case shown, I don't have anything else that fits it so my loss, your gain. I know this does not matter to most folks, but this also comes with the box it came in when new. I don't recall if it has a strap or not, if it does, it is probably cheap and needs to be discarded upon opening the box anyway. 


WILL TRADE FOR:

I am willing to consider as a partial or full trade, a 270 win bolt action rifle as made by companies such as Mossberg, Marlin, and other entry level qualities. I also am willing to consider any 357 magnum revolver such as made by Taurus (no snub nose revolvers though). I am also willing to consider the Glock 26 (though I may wind up owing you a little in that). Lastly, I have been looking to try out a Derringer (a gun everyone should have as a collection piece if not actual self defense)."

This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

Summary: SAM7 - 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit."

This VEPR rifle is brand new and has never been fired. The rifle is without issue as everything is straight and rounds cycle through it just fine. If you are not familiar with VEPR rifles, they are the best factory-built AK that you can buy... period. The barrel (chrome-lined and cold-hammer-forged) is heavier than a standard AK, as is the receiver. These rifles make for a very easy conversion being that the trigger group is already where it needs to be for a pistol grip."

This 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. The SAM7K pistol is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

Summary: SAM7K - 7.62x39mm caliber Pistol, milled receiver (hot-die hammer forged), short gas system, front sight block / gas block combination, 10 1/2 inch chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture, original pistol grip made to work with ambidextrous safety lever, and peep rear sight, scope rail.

It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.
The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber.
Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

 Benelli M4 Tactical 12 gauge shotgun. Benelli has long been renowned for their world class sporting shotguns. Their attention to detail, craftsmanship and innovative recoil system make them some of the most desired guns on the market. In the early 90s Benelli released a ""Tactical"" version of their popular M1 Super 90 shotgun. While this gun was exceedingly light and functioned flawlessly in it's stock configuration it did have some short comings. During military evaluation of the M1 Super 90 it was determined that Benelli's standard Inertia system has cycling issues when large amount of weight (such as a night vision optic) was added to the system. Benelli's answer to this problem is the M4 Tactical. This shotgun utilizes their revolutionary A.R.G.O. short stroke gas piston system. This operating system employs 2 short stroke gas pistons as opposed to the 1 long stroke gas piston found in a typical Browning design. This change provides reduced bolt wear, greatly increased reliability and longer time between cleanings. This operating system is also self regulating and self cleaning, virtually eliminating gas system maintenance. The M4 Tactical features ghost ring style sights and a factory installed picatinny optics rail."

The 10mm cartridge is gaining popularity with ballistics better than the 45ACP.

Get it now While you can still find one unfired and new as Colt is no longer making these again. This is not the model they made in the 80's as you can tell by the grips and the trigger, but it is the model recently manufactured by Colt. 

I bought new from the dealer so I am the first owner. But the gun in BRAND NEW!

$1500 FIRM and not a penny less, don't waste your time with offers because I have been monitoring Gunbroker.com and everyone I found identical to this is selling for $1500 then the buyer has to pay double FFL fees, Shipping and Credit card fees. So Get a better deal here and one you can handle and inspect with your own eyes. Also no need to worry about sending $1500 to a stranger out of state and hope you get your gun.  Face to Face is still the safest way to make a deal!

I've never seen another Marlin done like this before, it has a very nice look to it. After the loop was designed, it was cold blued and the blue on the loop is not perfect, but overall, I think you will agree, this Marlin stands out from all the others ! It's slightly used. I'm cleaning out my safe, I'm not offering any return, so I'll put some nice pictures out there so you can see exactly what you are getting. When I bought this gun, I didn't want the micro groove barrel, I searched a little longer and bought this one with the traditional ballard style rifling, I've always heard that it's better for cowboy style guns if you want to use lead bullets.

I hate to sell this but I have no choice!

This rifle is almost brand new. I have only shot exactly 100 rounds through it. It is in perfect condition. 

This is Colt's premier rifle and is used by military personal. The LE-6940 is legendary in it's reliability and accuracy! 

It is stamped LE (Law Enforcement) on the lower receiver making it even more sought after and rare.

It also comes with an Aimpoint Pro Micro Red Dot sight. This can be included in the total price or not.

I have not listed a price because this is OFFER only. I know prices are still somewhat crazy right now but I still need a fair offer. They are currently selling for 1,300-2,000 with no red-dot sight. I am NOT looking for 2,000 as I think that's a ridiculous price but I do want a fair offer.

Please email with your offers and I will reply ASAP. You must be an Ohio resident or I can ship to an FFL dealer. Buyer pays shipping costs and FFL fees.

Sorry if my pics aren't perfect. I had to take them with my phone and in bad light... But believe me, this rifle is perfect and pristine!"

For sale (or preferrably trade) is an Egyptian Maadi AK-47 rifle parts kit chambered in 7.62x39.  Supposedly made on the same equipment as the original Russians, these are declared some of the nicest AK's in the world!  The receiver and barrel have been removed to pacify the BATF but otherwise it's all numbers matching and ready to be assembled!  This is one that has the Egyptian sandscript writing on certain parts which gives it the feel of a genuine service rifle.  Very cool!

**Kit comes with all parts (except barrel and receiver) to assemble a complete rifle.  

**It also comes with a TAPCO G2 single hook trigger group to help with 922r compliance. 

**Lastly AK-47 accessories kit that includes a mag pouch, oil can, and bayonet. 

 Would consider selling for $450 (which is the amount I have totally invested) and I wouldn't take a penny less, but I would prefer to trade up to a complete (fixed stock) AK-47 in 7.62x39 or certain other firearms.  I have trade material (like ammo, mags etc) but do not want to pay cash for trading up.  Please let me know what you have to offer.  The least I can do is say no.  Thanks for looking!"

if you total up the extras in this package you can see that the price I am asking is more than fair. I do not want to sell it, I need to fund a different project however. I will consider reasonable offers but the price is somewhat firm. If you do the math the value is far above what I am asking even without shipping and hunting around for these parts."

I would like $500 cash firm for the gun, or I will sell the gun + ammo for $550. No trades at this time. FTF only in the DFW area. PM me if you're interested.

FYI, the only reason I'm selling this gun is b/c I got my hands on a Shield 40 and I don't need 2 of the same gun in 2 different calibers..."

No issues other than shooter error - I tend to shoot with the shooting hand thumb up and the slide hasn't locked back on the last round a few times for me.  So if you shoot like me then you'll gain a little thumb awareness ;P. However, this didn't happen when I put the largest backstrap on because I had a little more clearance, but I still prefer the small one. Not a big deal, but I thought I should mention it.

Overall, I love the gun and I'll eventually replace it, but unfortunately I'm between jobs.

 The technology developed for the U.S. Military that greatly deters copper fouling is now available in CFE 223 for your reloads!

 Introduced in January 2012, this versatile spherical rifle propellant incorporates in its formula CFE, Copper Fouling Eraser. This ingredient, originally used in military propellant, greatly deters copper fouling. It contributes to longer periods of top accuracy with less barrel cleaning time. Being a spherical powder, metering is superbly accurate. CFE 223 yields top velocities in many cartridges such as the 204 Ruger, 223 Remington/5.56mm NATO, 22-250 Remington and the 308 Winchester/7.62mm NATO, plus many, many more. Match, Varmint and AR shooters will love this one!

The gun does have a little wear on the finish but it was carried in the woods as a sidearm for thirty years. Overall the gun is in great shape and actually looks good for its age. I have a hard case and three sets of grips. I have the factory S&W grips, Rubber Hogue combat grips, and some Badger custom walnut grips. This gun new would run around $1000 if you can find them. They are harder to find now after the S&W 629 being smith's #1 .44 Magnum. I really don't need to sell but I do already have two Rugers in .44 magnum. Just let me know if your interested. Thanks!"
