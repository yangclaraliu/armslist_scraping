The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W, the SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals.

A rare lot of some of the most sought after 5.56/.223 ammo in the world.  If you don't know anything about it, this is what the military elite snipers use and it is far more than a standard bullet.  See review below and ask any questions you may have.

Black Hills produces factory new ammunition equal to some of the best handloads and is quickly becoming one of most popular manufacturers of ammunition. Used primarily by all branches of the United State military, this ammunition is also used by competitive shooters and hunters. This 5.56 load was developed for AR-15 platform firearms.

MatchKing rifle bullets are super-accurate bullets with very thin jackets and are held to exacting tolerances in diameter and weight. Their accuracy has been acclaimed worldwide and they have been used to win more target competitions than all target bullets from other manufacturers combined. Each bullet is designed with a very small meplat in order to achieve the highest ballistic coefficient possible. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.

Please Note: While the 5.56x45mm NATO will fit in a .223 Remington chamber, the 5.56 is a military round that runs at higher pressures than its .223 counterpart and is not recommended to be fired in a .223 Remington chamber.

Up for auction is a very nice Gary Reeder Professional Hunter in their 41 GNR #2 caliber. Also with this pistol is a Leupold M4X Extended Eye Relief pistol scope.

From Gary Reeder:
It is built on our own extra beefy, larger stretch frame that the original along with the BMF was built on. I had another run of 100 frames cast and we got the first batch of them a few weeks ago. The new Professional Hunter will be chambered in any of several calibers, including 357 Maximum, 224 GNR,256 GNR, 284 GNR, 307 GNR, 358 GNR, 375 GNR, 41 GNR#2, 416 GNR#2, 414 Super mag, 445 Super Mag, and 457 GNR. Any of these calibers will work for North American game and the 416 GNR#2, 445 Super Mag and the 457 GNR will do nicely for the big bears or any African game you might want to hunt with a revolver.

The new Professional Hunter will come as you want it. The caliber and barrel length are up to you, as is the engraving and the grips. The prototype of the Professional Hunter shown has a 7 1/2"" barrel, heavy duty 5 shot stretch cylinder, dangerous game engraving and red and grey laminated grips on our popular Gunfighter Grip, full action job, Maxi Throat, Deep Dish Crown, and can be drilled and tapped for a Leupold scope base if you like.

The new Professional Hunter comes with our own gripframe, similar to the Ruger Hunter gripframe but rounded and stretched a bit to get the back of the trigger guard away from your knuckle.

Shipping/handling for this rifle will be $55 to the lower 48. Insurance will be added unless you request it not to be and will cost 1.75% of the price of the gun to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping. The price in this auction reflects a 5% discount for certified funds that is not given if you pay with a credit card. The value of all merchandise traded will be treated like certified funds; therefore, this item will still be subject to shipping and insurance charges. Because of additional paperwork and time to process the shipment."

They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below.

The GPS-02 Grip Pod Exceeds Military Drop Test Specifications. All of mine are brand new and still the original manufacturer packaging.

I have placed a picture of the GPS-02 Grip Pod company stamp located in the on the to show this this is not a knock off.

The Grip Pod System™ (GPA™) is a revolutionary new vertical fore-grip integrated with a strong and stable bipod. The Grip Pod's legs deploy at the push of a button - instantly!

It offers a combination of advantages never before available in a single accessory.

We consider the Grip Pod™ to be an enhanced target acquisition system (ETAS).

Using the Grip Pod System™ an operator can go from a standing CQB position to a prone firing position, and have a stable bi-pod for aimed firing in place before hitting the ground.

Say goodbye to cumbersome bipods that have to be manually clipped on or folded into position.

The GPA™ is manufactured from aerospace materials to exceed military specifications for construction and finish. It mounts directly to Picatinny rail systems, and additional mounting options will be available soon.

The GPA™ is currently in worldwide use by many Military and Law Enforcement units including: US Navy Seals, US Army Special Forces, US Army, USMC, British Army, Canadian Army, FBI HRT, Secret Service, Federal / State / Local Law Enforcement, and several unmentionable government entities. The Grip Pod™ has been selected for use on US Army Designated Marksman rifles. Patents are pending.

Military Grip Pod (GPS-02) Advantages

* Exceeds Military Drop Test Specifications
* Can Support Over 300 lbs in the Bi-Pod Deployed Position
* Increased Speed
* Greatly Increased Accuracy
* Increased Weapon Flexibility
* Stronger than Conventional Vertical Grips
* Smaller than Non-Integrated Solutions
* Retracted Bi-Pod Reduces Entanglement Factor
* This vertical fore-grip is widely known throughout the military and tactical communities of the world to enhance control, accuracy, and speed of long and short range shooting (to include Close Quarter Battle (CQB) target acquisition). This is true for soldiers utilizing all types of small arms (rifles, submachine guns, and light machine guns).

WARNING - Don't be fooled by Cheap Chinese Knockoff Grip Pods!

There are dozens of Chinese manufacturers that have copied the Grip Pod Systems Grip Pod, but use poor manufacturing methods / unskilled labor / cheap materials to make them. These Chinese manufacturers stole the unique Grip Pod design from a Patriotic American Citizen. Please do not support the Chinese Knockoff manufacturers.

The Cheap Chinese Knockoff Grip Pods will NOT hold up to repeated use. Please do NOT use a Cheap Chinese Knockoff Grip Pod on a real weapon.

Up for bid is a GPS Grip Pod System Military Bipod GPS02.

1.) 1905 Swedish M96 ""Sniper""
Swedish M96 with holes drilled and tapped by pro gunsmith. Includes a BRAND SPANKING NEW Redfield 2-7x33mm rifle scope (still have box/papers). Bluing is in excellent condition, no pitting or rust anywhere. Stock appears to have been refinished but I bought this rifle in the grease so not sure who would have done it, but it is VERY nicely done. Bent bolt is not the original one, it is one that I bought and worked to clear the scope (I must say it came out very nice too!) but I DO HAVE THE ORIGINAL MATCHING STRAIGHT BOLT that will be included. Muzzle is threaded and currently wears a flash hider. Original Swedish M96 rifle sling also included.

2.) 1941 Kar98k ""DUV"" code
Nice Kar98k. Mostly a mix of parts, but all original Nazi markings are intact, eagles, waffenamts, etc. Markings still on stock too, some are easier to make out than others but they are there. Barrel and receiver match, floorplate and trigger guard match, and bolt matches itself except for the safety. Bluing is in good condition throughout, bore is frosty but still has some shine, should shoot out and clean up better. Missing cleaning rod, but I have a sling and bayonet for it and since it didn't come with a sight hood I put a Vz.24 one on, just thought it looked cool with it on.  Pictures to come soon.


3.) 1943 Izzy 91/30
One of the cleanest 91/30s I've had or shot. The bore is MIRROR sharp, not a single defect in it, looks like the rifling was just cut yesterday. All bluing is %100. Serial numbers are truly matching too, meaning all the parts have the matching cyrillic prefixes followed by the serial number. Bolt is so smooth I almost can't believe this was made in Russia during ww2.

4.) 1908 Swedish M96

 The run on assault rifles and AR style rifles has calmed down since Pesident Obama and the Senate finally realized that their push for a ban on assault rifles was going to far and not popular with the majority of the US population. As a result people are realizing that they are not going to get inflated $1500 + prices for their AR's as they have over the last few months. 

 This AR 15 that I am selling is reasonably priced to sell and a great buy with the many extras that are included. I could have gone much further fitting this AR with sights and a scope or a red dot sight but I will leave that up to the buyer who can choose from the many styles of optics that are out there on the market.

 The run on assault rifles and AR style rifles has calmed down since Pesident Obama and the Senate finally realized that their push for a ban on assault rifles was going to far and not popular with the majority of the US population. As a result people are realizing that they are not going to get inflated $1500 + prices for their AR's as they have over the last few months. 

 This AR 15 that I am selling is reasonably priced to sell and a great buy with the many extras that are included. I could have gone much further fitting this AR with sights and a scope or a red dot sight but I will leave that up to the buyer who can choose from the many styles of optics that are out there on the market.

Due to its compatibility with all generations of night vision device (NVD), the CompM2 is ready for use around the clock. The CompM2 holds up under the roughest physical handling and can withstand the most severe weather conditions and temperatures. In fact, the CompM2 is completely submersible and will withstand pressures up to 2,5 atmospheres allowing it to be taken up to 25 meters underwater. When the CompM2 was released, it became the benchmark against which all other combat optics are measured. While primary utilized by armed forces, hunters and sport shooters who want a professional grade sight can also use the CompM2.

The run on assault rifles and AR style rifles has calmed down since Pesident Obama and the Senate finally realized that their push for a ban on assault rifles was going to far and not popular with the majority of the US population.

VZ2008 Sporter Rifle
Originally issued to the Czech army in 1958, the VZ58 is still in use by both the Czech and Slovak armies, their police and customs agents. Though similar to the other rifles of this style in appearance, the VZ58 uses a completely different bolt and fire control system. This semi-auto version features a U.S. made receiver machined out of a bar of premium steel and a U.S. made barrel (1 in 9.5 twist). All metal parts are bead blasted and coated with a non reflective finish. Barrel: 16.25 inches. Overall: 27 inches. Weight: 7 pounds. Will not operate with AK 47 mags. 

This is a newer model that I bought last year, I am selling it so I can buy a boat. I am selling at price I paid [before prices went up]
Includes: 6 30rd mags, 1 10rd mag, 20 Czech made stripper clips, sling, recoil pad, mag pouch [holds 6 mags] bandolier [holds 100rds on clips], 400rds of ammo. It also comes with a really nice UTG padded soft case. If I can't get photos to upload I will email to you.

Please don't waste my time with your comments, ideas or whimsical notions (or idiot notions Scott) of how much you know about guns, prices, or your ego. Save that for your mom. I'm sure she cares what you think (except for you Scott), I don't. There is no doubt that you can find a better deal elsewhere. I don't need to know about it. Just go and do your deal elsewhere. But if you have $1000 cash now and want the rifle and ammo and can legally own this rifle, email me. Serious inquiries only. Trade for gold or silver coin as well. (that's real money Jackson).
FYI: the premium price is due how much I value the greenback. It won't be long now. These rifles will be priceless before too long. And for those who didn't buy these when they were $89, don't feel to bad. I didn't buy my AR when it was $150. I paid 10 time that."
