The Gold Standard of AR15's:
This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4.  With the 4-position butt-stock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb. (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.  Furthermore, the hand guard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.

-  Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components.

-  Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, as well as civilian .223 caliber ammunition.

-  Utilizing a 16” barrel with rifling of a 1 in 7"" Twist, which allows for heavier grain ammo to be used effectively.

-  4-position sliding butt-stock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations.

-  Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both RIGHT and LEFT HANDED shooting positions for increased tactical applications.

-  Muzzle compensator/Flash Suppressor further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures.

-  Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories.

-  Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation.

-  Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud.

-  Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance.

-  High strength materials add durability to the forearm, butt-stock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness.

The Firefield 2.5-10 x 40mm Tactical Riflescope with Red Laser is equipped with a Green/Red Illuminated Mil-Dot Reticle that is used for range estimation to help find the distance between the shooter and the target.  Precision multi-coated optics are the distinguishing feature of the Firefield Tactical Riflescope line and offers the clearest view in both bright and low light situations.  Nitrogen filled, the Firefield 2.5-10 x 40mm Tactical Riflescope is both waterproof and fogproof, adding durability to the scope and allowing you to use it in the rain, snow, or in humid environments.  These components are packed into a lightweight and shockproof frame, then outfitted with reliable windage and elevation knobs.  The adjustment turrets even have separate caps for improved portability of the scope.  Featuring a built in 5mW red laser, the Firefield Tactical Riflescope, is used for quick target acquisition in rapid changing environments, so it hits the target every time with precision accuracy.  The lowest magnification setting at 2.5x can be used for scanning, while offering a much broader field of view, while the highest settings in the magnification range are more than adequate for mid to long-range shots.  A respectable zoom from 2.5-10x allows the shooter to make an accurate shot at a long distance and keep a tight grouping. The scope also includes a 100-500 yard bullet drop compensation turret, which adjusts the elevation of the reticle ensuring that the shooter can achieve zero by moving the compensation turret to the correct yardage."

Will trade for:
 Looking for newer mini 14, xdm 9mm, ak, ar, sks, s and w shield 40 or 9mm. Or just try me, maybe I don't know what I am looking for yet. 

I don't have the time to reload, I have too many other hobbies and can barely get out to the range at all. 

I do not want to seperate. Amount invested in this is well over $1200, not counting today's crazy prices on brass,powder, dies, and primers. So let' be realistic in doing a deal.

Thanks,"

You could have more the three rounds because in the magazine tube there is a plug that prevents you from putting more shells in so if you were to remove it the gun would be able to hold more.

I've owned this rifle since about 1978. Six digit serial number starts with zero. Barrel code I read as D R, for September, 1968, the second year of Model 788 manufacture. This is no safe queen; it's been in the woods a lot over the years. The pictures speak for themselves. The Bushnell Banner 3-9x has a duplex reticle and is a champion. The bore is bright and the rifling is very good. Two clips and comfortable leather sling included. Rifle does not have a rear sight.

One flaw I want you to know about is that the rubber ring is missing from the rear of the scope; see the picture that shows the scope. In the 35 years +/- that I've owned it, I've put 150 rounds through it. I haven't had this rifle in the woods since I acquired my 7mm-08 some years ago, and I've got my eye on a rifle I'd like to own. So I'm giving this one up to a new home. A nice affordable starter deer rifle and hell on varmints.

I am an attorney in Huntsville that serves clients throughout the state with firearms trust planning services for those with large collections, NFA items, or concerns about handing down their collections to their family.



What is a Gun Trust?

Firearms Trusts were developed to make the purchase, ownership, and inheritance of firearms covered by the National Firearms Act (“NFA”) easier. The NFA regulates “Title II” weapons and include machine guns, short-barreled rifles and shotguns, suppressors, destructive devices, and Any Other Weapons (AOWs).

Title II weapons can be acquired individually or through an entity such as trust. Individuals must submit fingerprints, a photograph, pay for the $200 tax stamp, and obtain permission from the Chief Law Enforcement Officer (CLEO) in the jurisdiction in which they reside. In some jurisdictions the sheriff will refuse to sign off on any such purchases as a matter of policy. Such blanket policies prevent law-abding citizens from being able to obtain these weapons at all. Once approved, only the approved individual may hold or use the weapons. Violations can result in 10-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.

By creating a firearms trust, some of these barriers to ownership can be surmounted. Trusts may legally own such firearms, and bypass requirements for a photograph, fingerprints, and the requirement that a CLEO approve the purchase of the regulated firearm or device. It also allows for multiple individuals to utilize the firearm.

Beyond acquisition, a Firearms Trust may have additional benefits- it is designed for the sole purpose of acquiring, holding, and eventually distributing regulated and regulated weapons, ammunition, and accessories. Firearms trusts also help owners of weapons and devices regulated under the NFA from subjecting their family to “accidental felonies” upon their death. Although the owner may be registered to own such weapons, their family members or executors are not, and in most instances possession of these kinds of weapons without appropriate registration is a felony. a properly drafted Firearms trust will allow the beneficiaries o the trust to receive the weapons and other items without unintentionally committing a felony. Because items contained within a trust avoid probate, the contents of the trust and how and to whom they are distributed will remain totally private.

Not Just for NFA Weapons

All firearms owners should consider establishing a Firearms Trust to hold their weapons collection, even if they don’t own any regulated weapons. Recently, Congress has taken up legislation to ban a wide variety of semi-automatic firearms. Some legislators and pundits have made no secret of their wish to confiscate all firearms and accessories, and barring that, to prohibit the transfer of any “grandfathered” weapons and to require any such weapons to be surrender to the state at the current owner’s death.

Although the law of Firearms Trusts is still developing, it may be advisable to transfer non-regulated weapons into a trust prior to the enactment of any such legislation. This may avoid a scenario in which your family is forced to surrender your prized collection after you are gone. Proper planning can allow you to establish a legacy of responsible firearm ownership and use for generations to come.

An Important Part of a More Comprehensive Estate Plan

We offer three levels of Firearms Trust planning. The Bronze Edition is relatively inexpensive and is designed to hold only NFA regulated weapons. To keep cost to a minimum, it is provided without detailed consultation. The Silver Edition is the most popular option, and is designed for the firearms collector who understands the value of proper planning when dealing with NFA items (suppressors, etc.) as well as non-NFA items (regular rifles pistols and shotguns), and it will protect everyone that may come in contact with the collection and to avoid the likelihood of an “accidental felony”. The Gold Edition is crafted to assist clients with extensive collections, specific firearms issues, or advanced planning needs.

Often times, clients know they need to put proper planning in place but procrastinate in doing so. We want all of our clients to have comprehensive planning in place, which is why we offer a free Silver Edition Firearms Trust to our clients who engage us in other comprehensive trust-based planning. Contact us for more details about this offer!"

I bought this to do a build myself but don't have the money to complete it. The lower is stamped 5.56mm but you could use it to build almost any platform you want to. They manufacture these lowers to Mil-Spec and it is really nice. This is made of Mil-Spec 8625 Type III Anodized aluminum
 alloy, NOT sub-standard polymer. I'm not thrilled about parting with it due to pending legislature, but I could use the money. The light source washed out the picture a bit. The pad the rifle is on is dark blue. The rifle itself is the standard military black. The hand grip included is of standard military configuration. I also have a new black Magpul MOE grip I could substitute if you like. The serial number I blocked out on the computer, there is no white line on the rifle in real life. I will ship this to an FFL dealer of your choice for $30 or if you are close to the North West Suburbs I will be happy to meet up with you."

They make centering your front post much faster and easier since there are dots to line up vs. factory sights showing no points of reference. They are great as stand alone sights at night, but even better when using a mounted flashlight at night. You get the target illuminated by the light and the dots are still glowing bright since they are behind the source of light. Very well made. Fit and finish match perfectly. already has the same brand night sights already on it. Try them out, you wont be dissappointed"

The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.

The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot.

This piston-driven system is unlike any other AR-10 on the market. The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action.

The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action.

The weapon easily disassembles like the standard AR for quick and easy cleaning and reassembly. The piston system drastically reduces fouling, and no venting means no holes for dirt and other contaminants to enter the system.

The full-length Picatinny rail on the receiver will allow you to mount scopes, lights, lasers, bipods, bayonets, etc. The adjustable cheek rest stock option is an added upgrade free bonus.

The innovative Noreen Bad News .338 Lapua provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. The Noreen 338 Lapua weighs only 13 pounds, and it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. This rifle comes with a custom muzzle-break and semi-auto action that significantly suppresses recoil. In the AR tradition, the Bad News 338 Lapua disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reasembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle seamless. This Noreen includes an ultra-heavy duty Plano case, which is far superior to a pelican style case. 100% Made in the USA.

It also has mounted the original scope from the same time period, this is really rare and hard to find and is what makes this gun special.  From the research that I have done it has a Sako Action and it was made in 1964 based on serial number.  It has a 22"" barrel.   The bolt is highly polished steel not blued, another sign of a high quality firearm.  It is in great shape with only minor scuffs on the stock from hunting in the 80's...I am the second owner, my grandfather was the original purchaser in NY.  I can email pictures for a better look if desired.  This is a true collectors item.  Similar to Sako Forester of the same time period.  This not a ""salt"" cured stock, it is earlier.  No corrosion.

I have other guns to practice with, so, this firearm been sitting for about 3 months in the case, I bought it about 6 months ago, fired no more than 500-700 rds, very accurate from 50 yards w/o scope, HKs are known for its reliability and accuracy. Much better than GSG522 which is very hard to disassemble and to clean. 

Nowadays, it's very expensive to shoot with 223 or 7.62, where you pay almost $1 per round, so, enjoy 4-5 cents a round on a range :) I have another 22lr rifle, where I put 200-300 rounds each visit w/o hurting my wallet. 

What you will get: 
H&K MP5A5 semiauto - $550+tax 
1 10 rd magazine 
HK MP5 22lr Tri-rail Tactical Forearm - $120+tax value (http://www.hkparts.net/shop/pc/HK-MP5-22-Tri-Rail-Tactical-Forend-Umarex-312p2208.htm) - will include original Forearm as I won't need it anyway 
UTG Bipod, SWAT/Combat Profile $30 value 
Deluxe Ergonomic Foregrip - $20 value 
AR15 scope with red laser - $200 value 
MFI HK Low Profile Scope Mount - $99 value (http://www.hkparts.net/shop/pc/HK-MP5-22-Scope-Mount-Walther-Umarex-312p2389.htm) 

All together I spent over $1,100 for this rifle. I want a portion of what I spent - $800 or best reasonable offer. 
How I came up with the price, I just did a little research on what people are asking for the similar rifle which is nowadays almost impossible to find because of its tactical look: 
http://www.armslist.com/posts/973202/florida-rifles-for-sale--hk-mp5-a5 - $750

and all these guns don't have modifications I have (over $600 value)
