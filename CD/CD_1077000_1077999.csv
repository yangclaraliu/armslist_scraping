The cartridges are brass case, boxer primed, re-loadable, and non-corrosive. This is top quality military munition and I have shot this same type last year from a can dated to 1982. These are 55 grain bullets that streak hot red through the dusk/dawn/night and even show during the day.  They will shoot exceptionally stable in any chamber set to 1/12 twist or less.

The ammo can is factory vacuum sealed from the DOD (Department of Defense) and never opened except once for this photo and then resealed. It contains 41 boxes of 20 rounds for a total of 820. Top reasons to buy tracers:

1. Load the first few shots of your high capacity mag to dial in.
2. Light up a gas tank.
3. Load the last shot of your high capacity mag to give you a heads up on when to swap mags.
4. Watch and learn from your trajectory.
5. Night fire.
6. More scariest warning shot.
7. Learn from deflections.

PRICE ERROR-VERY SORRY, I WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE I WAS GOING TO LIST.

LOOK AT THE PICTURES AND YOU'LL SEE SAW MARKS-ALL OVER.  THE PREVIOUS OWNER LOST HIS BROTHER TO A FIREARM AND WANTED TO DESTROY THIS.
THE BOLT AND SPRING WORK, PROBABLY WILL CHAMBER?
BARREL IS BADLY  """"BENT"""" A LOT TO THE RIGHT, BUT WHAT'S WORSE IS IT TOO HAS SAW MARKS WHERE THE BULLET EXPLODES RENDERING IT DANGEROUS ""JUNK"".
Bbl FITTINGS ARE PRESENT EXCEPT FOR THE FRONT SIGHT WHICH I NEED INCLUDING BAYONET LUG-ALL USABLE.
THE TRIGGER ASSEMBLY IS SCARED WITH SAW MARKS AND IT DON'T GO ""CLICK"" FOR SOME REASON.  I'VE OWNED SKS RIFLES BUT NEVER FIRED THEM B?C I LIKE THE AK.
WERE IT PERFECT, IT'S WORTH $100.00 ALONE FROM GUNPARTS.
THE RECEIVER, WHICH MAKES IT A FIREARM, CAN NOT BE SHIPPED TO AN INDIVIDUAL, SO PLEASE DON'T ASK ME THAT, IT'S ILLEGAL.

THIS IS EXTREMELY BACK BURNER TO ME.  I COULDN'T CARE LESS IF IT SELLS OR NOT, BUT I'M ONLY OFFERING IT FOR PARTS AND A PROBABLY WORKING RECEIVER, BUT IT'S A SCARED UP RECEIVER.
$60.00 TO ME, IS A 1/2 TANK OF GAS OR 10 GOOD CIGARS, SO I'M NOT GOING OUT OF MY WAY TO LET SOMEONE HAVE IT, MILEAGE WISE. NOT WITH THE CURRENT PRICE OF GAS.
ALSO, I'M GOING TO LET IT RUN AND I ALMOST NEVER CHECK MY EMAIL.
I HAVE NO OTHER PICTURES BECAUSE WHEN I SAY A Bbl IS JUNK, IT'S UNUSABLE.
I HAVE AN OLD GUNPARTS.COM BOOK, DON'T THINK YOU CAN GET THEM ANY MORE AND ACCORDING TO THE BOOK, DECADES OLD, THE PARTS ARE EXPENSIVE IF BOUGHT SEPARATELY AND THEIR MINIMUM SHIPPING CHARGE FOR A SPRING IS $7.95.
I'LL CHECK IN NOW AND THEN TO SEE IF ANYONE WANTS IT.  I'LL REPLY IN THE ORDER RECEIVED.  
I REMEMBER BUYING 50 SKS RIFLES AT $59.00 EACH STILL IN COSMO, BUT THEY WENT UP A LOT SINCE THEN. 

ANYWAY........................


IF YOU WANT TO BUY THIS, AND DO NOT ASK ME TO SELL PARTS BECAUSE I WON'T REPLY, CONTACT ME.  BUY PARTS FROM WWW.GUNPARTS.COM BECAUSE THIS ENTIRE THING GOES MINUS THE FRONT SIGHT I NEED ON A CUSTOM AK-74U
THE BUY PRICE IS A FLAT OUT, CARVED IN STONE $60.00 AND YOU WILL HAVE TO MEET ME TO GET THIS AT THE BOIS D'ARC SHOOTING RANGE.  IF.......I'M IN TOWN, IT'S POSSIBLE TO MEET ELSEWHERE IF IT'S NOT OUT OF MY WAY DUE TO GAS PRICES, LIKE AROUND THAT GUNSMOKE PLACE BY  N.  GLENSTONE.  $60.00 WON'T MAKE OR BREAK ME, JUST OFFING THIS IN CASE SOMEONE OUT THERE WANTS IT AT THAT PRICE, I WILL NOT DICKER A CENT.
THAT ABOUT COVERS IT.
I DOUBT IT WILL SELL BUT I DON'T CARE AT ALL.

TRADE..........I WOULD TRADE IT FOR A NEW SINGLE SIG P-226 MAGAZINE i(NOT 10 ROUNDS) PREFERABLY IN 40 S&W BUT WOULD ONLY ACCEPT A OM, ORIGINAL MANUFACTURER MAGAZINE MARKED SIG OR THE ONE MADE FOR SIG.  FORGOT THE NAME...

PLEASE LOOK CLOSELY AT THE PICTURES BEFORE YOU CONTACT ME! AS YOU SEE IT'S BROKE, IT HOWEVER STILL WORKS JUST FINE. The ONLY reason I took it off was because I replaced it with an EOTech and a Matech. I ran it as is for months of use without issue. Still holds true zero and retains all function (folds, adjusts, deploys with the push of a button)

Not to mention you could warranty it out for a new one."

Thanks to some jack asses on here that flagged my earlier post as spam... I guess you are the ones who continue to try and inflate prices but I want everyone to know what is coming. Ask your wal mart sporting goods manager about the memo posted this week to wal mart managers and you will see the low prices are coming back and supply will be more than adequate. Don't buy an AR on armslist at stupid high prices when you can wait a month and get a nice SIG AR for 797.00, DPMS AR for only 597.00. Just check with your wal mart store to see this is true information. You need to get ammo, reloading items, and magazines if you are smart because the rilfes will be widely available but the other, not so readily attainable for another 6 months to a year."

Firearms Return Policy: 
VERY IMPORTANT - Please take your time to inspect all firearms thoroughly before proceeding with the firearms transfer process. Once a new firearm is transferred to you it is considered used, even if unfired. Consequently, we cannot provide a full refund for new firearms once they have been transferred into your possession. Also, we DO NOT reimburse FFL transfer fees on cancelled or refused firearms. We do understand that some manufacturer defects may not be identifiable upon initial inspection. However, upon discovering a defect after the transfer, the firearm must be returned directly to the manufacturer for replacement or repair (in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty policy). By sending a defective firearm directly to the manufacturer, you can avoid the unnecessary transfer fees of returning the firearm to us through your local FFL dealer. Manufacturer repaired firearms can be returned directly to the customer without additional FFL transfer or associated fees. However, if the manufacturer chooses to replace the firearm, the replacement firearm must transfer through your local FFL dealer to document the replacement firearm serial number. Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. will provide your choice of a replacement item (pending availability) or a full refund and pay the return shipping cost on all firearms that are found to be defective upon receipt. Please be aware that a 15% restocking fee may apply on all refused or cancelled orders and on any order that is shipped and later found to conflict with local laws. All returns and/or exchanges must have prior approval. All returns must be in original condition as to when they left Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. All return shipping charges involved in the return of refused or cancelled orders are the sole responsibility of the customer.

Firearms Return Policy: 
VERY IMPORTANT - Please take your time to inspect all firearms thoroughly before proceeding with the firearms transfer process. Once a new firearm is transferred to you it is considered used, even if unfired. Consequently, we cannot provide a full refund for new firearms once they have been transferred into your possession. Also, we DO NOT reimburse FFL transfer fees on cancelled or refused firearms. We do understand that some manufacturer defects may not be identifiable upon initial inspection. However, upon discovering a defect after the transfer, the firearm must be returned directly to the manufacturer for replacement or repair (in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty policy). By sending a defective firearm directly to the manufacturer, you can avoid the unnecessary transfer fees of returning the firearm to us through your local FFL dealer. Manufacturer repaired firearms can be returned directly to the customer without additional FFL transfer or associated fees. However, if the manufacturer chooses to replace the firearm, the replacement firearm must transfer through your local FFL dealer to document the replacement firearm serial number. Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. will provide your choice of a replacement item (pending availability) or a full refund and pay the return shipping cost on all firearms that are found to be defective upon receipt. Please be aware that a 15% restocking fee may apply on all refused or cancelled orders and on any order that is shipped and later found to conflict with local laws. All returns and/or exchanges must have prior approval. All returns must be in original condition as to when they left Shooting Sports Outlet, Inc. All return shipping charges involved in the return of refused or cancelled orders are the sole responsibility of the customer.

521,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1077521,For Trade:  CZ 75-P01/lots of 9mm ammo for AK or AR,"Tigard, Portland, Oregon",Offer,"Listed On: Friday, February 15, 2013",Handguns,CZ USA                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I have a CZ 75-P01 and a boat load of 9mm ammo. Look for semi-auto 7.62, or .223. What do you have/want? Willing to add cash for trades. The CZ 75-P01 is the only NATO spec pistol available to the general public. 

The P-01 9mm (designated the P-06 in .40 S&W) was designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame made it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry.

The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ's Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.

Reliability:  The U.S. Army ""Mean Rounds Between Failure"" (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!"

Here is a description of the rifle from Daniel Defense's website. 
Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform. The 300 Blackout can still utilize standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, v5-300 is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

The Nagant M1895 was chambered for a proprietary cartridge, 7.62x38R, and featured an unusual ""gas-seal"" system, in which the cylinder moved forward when the gun was cocked, to close the gap between the cylinder and the barrel, providing a boost to the muzzle velocity of the fired projectile and allowing the weapon to be suppressed (an unusual ability for a revolver).[2] Other Nagant revolver designs were also adopted by police and military services of Sweden, Norway, Poland, and Greece. These revolvers were largely similar to the Russian Nagant M1895, but lacked the gas seal mechanism.

Great condition (Tula model best quality made).  Excellent shape, action, and barrel.  Interested in trades for ammo or other firearms- can add cash for the right deal.

The design that has stood the test of time and has only improved during the Era of AR innovation, the M-15A2 is ArmaLite's semi-automatic civilian version of the famed M16A2 Service Rifle.

Originated by the desire for a rifle that was durable, reliable, weather resistant, long-lasting and dead on accurate: the A2 design is an outstanding tactical rifle design, excellent for Law Enforcement, entry level Service Rifle training, hunting or collecting. The double-lapped and chrome lined barrel is the basis of ArmaLite's rifles' superb accuracy
