This is the very rare limited edition magpul or moe smith and Wesson  15/22. I purchased the gun brand new 2 months ago. I have spent a fortune on this gun but its the best 22 on the market! I have over a thousand dollars in this gun with all the add ons and extras I have. 
It has 4 25 round smith and Wesson mags which are very hard to get and if you can find one it will cost you around 100 dollars.
I put a Vortex Strike Fire red dot on it with night vision. I bought it new when I got the gun. It's a 180 dollar red dot.
It has magpul flip up front and rear sights. Magpul stock, Magpul pistol grip and all the parts on the on the barrel for-end or hand guard. I have the boxes and receipts for everything. This gun does not have a single flaw! I have shot it very little because I shoot my ruger or my ar which I just sold.

REVIEW:
Fantastic Rifle! I bought TWO!! 
September 24, 2012
Reviewer: Sgt Lumberjack from Fort Lauderdale, FL United States 
I bought two black Sierra 316/MOE rifles from cheaperthandirt.  I was hoping to build a rifle kit with some MOE flare, but DTI has been crazy busy since the Aurora, CO shooting.  When I saw this rifle that is almost how I wanted it anyway, I snatched two of them up!  All I had to do was throw a Magpul MBUS gen 2 rear sight on each one and I had them functional! I will be adding a Grip-Pod and a holosight... maybe a light, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!  They each came with a DTI hard case and one 30rd PMag (which is the only AR mag I buy anymore).  Fit and finish is top-notch and operation is smooth as can be.  The receivers fit EXACTLY as they should... I'm talking perfectly matched.  Also, The internals were excellent and I was actually surprised by how smooth the trigger was right out of the box.  I really can't say enough about these rifles... but I'll stop there.
I served as a United States Marine Corps Designated Marksman Instructor and I approve this rifle.

If you are involved in the NRA, email them. What we need to do is let them know we want this debate done so we can get back to normal! 

The reason this is continuing is because they can't agree on one single issue. I don't want to post all my opinions on ""gun control"" and I don't think there is a single answer to the problem. What I do know is we can't control what crazy/evil people are going to do. If they can't get a modern sporting rifle (assault rifle) then they'll get what they can to accomplish their ""mission"".

Tell them to make a decision now so we can get back to small game hunting. It's funny...there are still shootings occurring everyday in the USA, people are buying more guns and ammo then ever before in history, but I can't find ammunition for my .22LR so I can go squirrel or rabbit hunting...........

Do the gun activists know that every time they touch this issue they are indirectly fueling record profits for firearm and ammo companies around the world?? More Americans own more guns now than ever before. One positive aspect to this is the next time some whack job decides to try and shoot up a public place, there should be plenty of well-armed (with a sufficient amount of ammo) law-abiding citizens ready to take him out.

So guys and gals out there in this fine state of Wisconsin. Email and write all of the dumbasses who are responsible for deciding all of the important issues of this country. Then, email and write them again til they get the idea and make a decision.

The only way this issue will be resolved is if we all get together and let them know we are not happy. If we do nothing then nothing will happen.

+++THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE PREMIER 6.8 HUNTING ROUND+++

If you hunt with 6.8 and aren't familiar with the PTS bullet, please Google it and read the specs and reviews. Description directly from back of the box ""Special bullet consisting of metallic jacket, lead core and plastic tip. When hitting the target, it gets deformed into a mushroom like shape, which enhances the lethal effect. It is used for most types of rifle cartridges, and depending on caliber weight, it is used for clawed game hunting in particular.""

The PTS bullet is the result of efforts of hunting cartridge designers to develop bullet with high wounding effects preserving concurrently excellent ballistic values. The bullet with lead core is covered with strengthening casing and furnished with polymer tip. Optimum shape enables the bullet to achieve higher speed and trajectory stability. These characteristics ensure excellent accuracy and wounding capability of the bullet that remains compact even at the moment of the strike,it does not shatter and it does not impair game. Together with Sierra and Barnes bullets, PTS bullets extend the range of rifle cartridges used for hunting and they extend possibilities of optimum choice for various kinds of use."

Manufacturer History
Llama Firearms officially known as Llama-Gabilondo y Cia SA was a Spanish arms company founded in 1904 under the name Gabilondo and Urresti. Its headquarters were in Eibar in the Basque Country, Spain, but they also had workshops during different times in Elgoibar and Vitoria. Llama manufactured moderate-priced revolvers and self-loading pistols in a bewildering variety of models. These were popular mainly in the European and Latin American export market, as well as domestically in Spain.

The Llama IX-C was manufactured from 1994 to 1997. It was similar to the Llama IX-A except for the 12-round double column magazine. This large-framed pistol had a 5 1⁄8-inch barrel and was 8 1⁄2 inches long overall with a height of 5 9⁄16 inches."

- when screwed onto the AK barrel and the grenade sight is flipped up, the gas shutoff prevents gas cycling and forces all gasses out of the barrel, propelling your grenade up to 400+ yards. Fun vid of someone firing their stock Yugo grenade launcher: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpTcDgpLoOk

Hornady® Lock-N-Load® Powder Measure — efficiency and accuracy
The Lock-N-Load® powder measure offers the most flexible operation and the widest range of any powder measure. It ranges from .5 - 265 grains of powder (special metering inserts and rotor required). Metering inserts can be changed with the push of a button. Comes with standard rotor and metering insert.

Features
Largest Charge Range in the Industry
Go from .5 grain to 265 grains by simply changing rotor and inserts. Use one Lock-N-Load® Powder Measure for reloading everything from small pistol cartridges to large magnum rifle cartridges.

Push Button Release Function
To change metering inserts, just push the Lock-N-Load® insert release button and insert another metering insert. Simply verify the new charge and you're reloading again right away. Inserts can be swapped in seconds. Go from reloading 30-06 to 45 Auto in no time. Keep the preset inserts with your die sets.

Precision Tolerance
With only .002"" clearance between the drum and rotor, it's the tightest in the industry for a standard measure. This tight tolerance helps eliminate powder binding between the frame and drum, delivering smooth function with all types of propellant–extruded or ball.

Multiple Mounting Methods
Mount to your bench using a standard mounting bracket and lock ring, or use our Lock-N-Load® bushings to mount this versatile measure on the Fast Load Powder Measure Stand or on the Lock-N-Load® AP™ with case activated powder drop for automatic powder measuring during reloading.

Adjustable Tension
The O-ring on the metering insert adjustment lets you put a slight amount of tension on the metering unit to make fine, incremental adjustments. Once you've set your charge, tighten the lock ring to secure the setting.

Small & Larger Drop Tubes
These tubes speed up powder flow. Two drop tubes are provided standard for .204 to 45 caliber loads. Use the largest drop tube that fits the case mouth. An optional extended drop tube is also available."

Most dealers were selling cases for $600 to $800 and believe it or not some were asking even more.  I did see several cases sell for the $600 and $700 prices.

$749. Gun shops in the area are selling these for $650 + tax (that's what I paid for just the Glock. Not mentioning holster, ammo, Pearce Group extension), not to mention there are NONE available in any single of the local shops. Call and ask. Won't be available for weeks to months either. I just happen to need to money now, didn't plan on reselling it as it is quite frankly awesome. But times are tough and I have to pay the mortgage.

Ultra 47 Pellet Pins will pass only one pin at a time through flash holes but not significantly increase tumbling times.

Ultra 47 Pellet pins are .255"" in length and should not get stuck in any cartridge, pistol or rifle.  

Unlike conventional corn cob or walnut media, stainless media does not create dust and also cleans the inside of the cases, primer pockets and flash holes. Stainless media will not damage brass and does not require replacement after multiple uses. This media is designed to be used in a water tight rotary tumbler along with water and cleaning solution.

Hey you, Patriot... Shh but I'm throwing in the NEWEST CCI mini mag DST ammo! Yes, DST. CCI is sold out everywhere because Skynet suspects drones could be vulnerable to CCI DST, and I don't know how long this listing will be available so buy quickly. 

Unless you're shooting skeet level to the ground, why worry about firing  ""two blasts from the balcony when there's trouble"" as a wise vice president has suggested. Don't go with 2 useless blasts and fumble to reload high on adrenaline while the drone hovers overhead taking pictures of you naked while you wish you had these 100 DST (Drone Seeking Tip) rounds!

The lucky buyer will receive the actual CCI mini mag DST box, inscribed with the second amendment and signed by senator Dianne Feinstein and everyone's favorite jolly fact providing freedom loving Piers Morgan! I had to disguise this picture as regular CCI CP HP mini mags to avoid spam bots buying this rare ammo too quickly and reselling for much higher, but rest assured these are the true CCI DST everyone's frothing at the mouth for!"

Heavier barrels than most Ak's too. All hard chrome internals, much easier to clean and much more durable than traditional steel components. Numbers matching. Low round count since I've owned it, purchased it from a friend who had put less than 500 rounds through it. Asking $1200. There are WASR's and other cheap Ak's going for more, this is a very high quality AK, the fit and finish is excellent. Will throw in a sight rail too. Questions text two54 four4nine 1eight1two."

He is selling ONLY to the government RIGHT NOW, per DHS & WH orders. My son works for ATK, who owns just about all the rest of the ammunition companies. He tells me that ATK has been ordered by the federal government to curtail sales of ammunition, primers, and powder to the retail market. What you see currently on the shelves is old stock and whats left in the wharehouses and new stock WILL NOT be appearing anytime soon. Like Soros' companies, ATK is a huge defense contractor and they have been told to ONLY sell to the DOD,TSA,FBI,DHS and local/federal law enforcement agencies. My son has seen the proposed pricing schedule for Federal,CCI, Hornady,Remington,Winchester and several other ammunition manufacturers lines of ammunition, components, reloading equipment and they exceed 300-400%. Management at ATK firmly believes this will shut down the civillian market while leaving the govt as the only purchaser of their products. As an aside, here ,I deal a LOT with Midsouth Shooters Supply for my reloading components. Two weeks ago I ordered 500 cases each of .45 Casull, .44 Magnum, .357 Magnum and 9mm Parabellum. I was told everything I ordered was out of stock and no in stock delivery date was forecast. They would not even accept a back order."" The text within the quotes was handed to me in confidence from a friend I trust. I share it because I care about my fellow man. Ladies and gentleman, it has begun...

Spyderco Military Brown Sprint

Spyderco regularly offers short-term, limited number releases called Sprint Runs. Sprint Runs allow knife enthusiasts to experience their favorite knife model with a different or unique blade steel, handle material or color. The Spyderco Military Model lends itself to variation making it an ideal candidate for a Sprint Run.

Carpenter Technolgy Corporation is known for their performance automotive, aerospace, defense, and consumer-products steels.  Carpenter recently began manufacturing high-performance steels for knife making.  Their CTS XHP is air hardened, high carbon and high chromium steel with corrosion resistance similar to 440C-type steels and with hardness qualities found in tool steel.  Its edge retention ability, ease in machining to a fine edge, and consistent heat-treatability make it perfect for a Spyderco Sprint Run."

Keeping with our philosophy of tailoring a rifle to the needs of the sportsman, like the 6.8, the 300AAC Blackout is lightweight, modular, utilizes a Picatinny Rail system and adjustable butt-stock. Never before seen with the AR platform, the Ambush 300AAC Blackout fires 7.62 x 35 rounds while remaining compatible with the standard M4 Bolt Carrier Group and existing magazines.


Details


Other features include the Cold Hammer Forged, 1:8 twist, 16” S2W Profile barrel and shotgun-inspired hand grip, and is available in REALTREE AP™, MOSSY OAK® BREAK UP® INFINITY™, or MOSSY OAK® BLAZE® PINK. Whether chasing after a wild boar or anticipating a 10 point mule deer, the Ambush 300AAC Blackout supplies ample knock-down power while reducing recoil.

The Ambush Firearms 300 BlackOut is designed to be shot suppressed and un-surpressed utilizing various type of super sonic and sub sonic ammunitions. The testing of the Ambush Firearms 300 Blackout firearms indicates that un-surpressed firing with sub-sonic ammo can lead to failures to feed, failures, to eject, and failures to fire and is not recommend. Although, through our extensive testing we did ascertain that the utilization of a ""H"" weight buffer or lighter when shooting un-surpressed sub-sonic ammo produces much more reliable operation.

This is not being imported to the U.S. anymore. This is a terrific build. It's better than a Zastava because the barrel is chrome-lined and more solidly built than the Zastava; The Draco has a well built receiver with straight sights. I added a $30 Draco sling mount under the pistol grip for YOU to add your sling to it. The Draco comes with a 10 round tapco mag and bullet button. The receiver has No mag wobble; very tight (good) fit for your normal Ak-47 high-cap rebuild mag kits. FTF transfer only. This shoots the CHEAPEST rifle round in a pistol (i,e. 7.62x39mm) corrosive or non-corrosive - okay!!!!

The 16 round mags are brand new in package. I bought them for my gun, before I could find the 13 rounds mags I really wanted. The 13 round mags fit flush with the bottom of the mag well, and the 16 extend below the bottom.

The 16 round mags will function fine as is, but benefit cosmetically with the use of a USP Jet Funnel Kit as they extend below the well of the USP 40.  I paid $129 each and have my receipt to prove. I understand that they are expensive, but that's what I paid, so that is what I am looking to get back for them. Not looking to ship, prefer local sale.

The 10 round mags are standard black, and are $45 each. All three are like new.
