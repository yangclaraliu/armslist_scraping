This conversion kit (model #CONV-2289-22) works on Sig Sauer P228 / P229 models that do not have the accessory rail.  I have shot 200 rounds through this and never had a misfire.  Great way to practice with your Sig without spending a lot of money.  The slide has LPA target sights on it and shoots great.  Includes 2 Sig magazines (original +1).  I changed out the followers and plugs (made by Black Dog Machine) in the magazines so the slide will stay open after the last shot.  This prevents dry firing which according to Sig could possibly ruin the conversion kit.  The Black Dog plugs also increase the magazine capacity from 10 to 13.  I have the original followers and plugs if you live somewhere like California and I can switch them out in 2 minutes.  Extra magazine cost me $45.  Will sell all for $195 including shipping, and this can be mailed directly to you - no FFL involvement required.  I am selling my Sig and won't be able to use this anymore.

I have no paperwork to support this however, so you be the judge. It's a June 1943 Springfield receiver by the serial number , although the receiver has been highly polished and black chromed at some point and only the serial number is legible. This was common practice among service team rifles. The barrel is an LMR 10-1953 , which gauges at TE 2 and ME 2, and has a great bore and tight chamber. The trigger group is 1943 vintage Springfield which has had a trigger job, very smooth trigger pull. The bolt is an H&R. The rear sight group is a complete National Match, standard front sight. The operating rod is an RA National Match. The stock is very good, glass bedded in the type II national match style, and the only markings are ""LK"" (Lackland AFB), and ""AFPG"" (Air Force Premium Grade). No import marks. Very few service team rifles remain, most were cut up during the Bill Clinton era. Located in Carbon Hill, Alabama. Additional pictures available. $1600.00 or make offer. Might trade for a quality 308 battle rifle (M1A,M14,FAL), GI M1 Carbine, another Garand,or high end AR15."

This is a Kahr PM40 .40 caliber pistol perfect for concealed carry. Kahr makes an exceptional pistol, but the PM series is their best quality concealed carry line. This gun has a low round count and runs rounds like a champ. I am including a number of accessories that will make the overall cost a huge value. The gun will come with the original case, two 5 round magazines, 2 7 round magazines, a Galco ankle holster, and a Don Hume IWB holster which has had a slight modification to it, and a kydex trigger-guard holster. Everything works great. The mags have ammo in them in the picture, but no ammo is included.

This purchase must be done at an FFL from my local gunshop, and all North Carolina laws will be followed. 

$625 with all the accessories. 
thanks,

The T.H.O.R. Raider represents a state-of-the-art design in a durable, compact, ultra quiet silencer for 5.56mm caliber series.  T.H.O.R. Raider is so effective that it can be used safely and comfortably without hearing protection in confined areas such as underground structures, aircraft hangers and small seagoing vessels.

The T.H.O.R. Raider is designed to be utilized on bolt rifles and semi auto AR platforms. The T.H.O.R. Raider should not be used for full auto fire or on barrels shorter than 14.5 inches. The T.H.O.R. Raider is an extremely strong and lightweight unit, constructed of 100% titanium with each component solidly 360 degree welded.

The Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 tactical scope gives the shooter a broad magnification range, four inches of eye relief and 100 MOA of elevation travel. This NXS retains a slim profile and is easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems. 

Nightforce uses outstanding glass and coatings in all their scopes, and the 5.5-22x50 tactical gives you superb resolution at high magnifications. It is the ultimate long range scope. The 50mm objective lens gives you maximum clarity and resolution across the entire magnification range. This Nightforce scope gives the shooter precision accuracy at the longest ranges, yet at 5.5 power remains highly effective for shots at close ranges. 

The MOAR reticle is an improved, more versatile version of the NP-R1 reticle. The MOAR has subtensions that are thicker than those of NF’s traditional reticles, which makes the reticle easier to see against dark backgrounds. The MOAR has 1 MOA spacing on the horizontal and vertical axis’, and this is a great tool for precise range-finding and hold offs. The first hash marks on the reticle are 2 MOA from center, and the crosshair is 1 MOA in length.

The T.H.O.R. Raider represents a state-of-the-art design in a durable, compact, ultra quiet silencer for 5.56mm caliber series.  T.H.O.R. Raider is so effective that it can be used safely and comfortably without hearing protection in confined areas such as underground structures, aircraft hangers and small seagoing vessels.

The T.H.O.R. Raider is designed to be utilized on bolt rifles and semi auto AR platforms. The T.H.O.R. Raider should not be used for full auto fire or on barrels shorter than 14.5 inches. The T.H.O.R. Raider is an extremely strong and lightweight unit, constructed of 100% titanium with each component solidly 360 degree welded.

The Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 tactical scope gives the shooter a broad magnification range, four inches of eye relief and 100 MOA of elevation travel. This NXS retains a slim profile and is easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems.

Nightforce uses outstanding glass and coatings in all their scopes, and the 5.5-22x50 tactical gives you superb resolution at high magnifications. It is the ultimate long range scope. The 50mm objective lens gives you maximum clarity and resolution across the entire magnification range. This Nightforce scope gives the shooter precision accuracy at the longest ranges, yet at 5.5 power remains highly effective for shots at close ranges.

The MOAR reticle is an improved, more versatile version of the NP-R1 reticle. The MOAR has subtensions that are thicker than those of NF’s traditional reticles, which makes the reticle easier to see against dark backgrounds. The MOAR has 1 MOA spacing on the horizontal and vertical axis’, and this is a great tool for precise range-finding and hold offs. The first hash marks on the reticle are 2 MOA from center, and the crosshair is 1 MOA in length.

 This comes with box and 3 - 11 Round Mags. Looking for a gun that shoot, this is it! I used on of these a few years ago in my shooting match! People couldn't understand how or why I did so good. 

This also has the Mag disconnect! This is where the gun will not fire with the mag out! This is also a perfect reason why this is a good conceal carry item. In the event the gun is going to be taken away, press the mag release and the gun will not fire even if there is around in the chamber. This is a Steel frame and steel slide! Police use to carry these!

The .22lr “Kalashnikov” manufactured by GSG represents much more than a small caliber “knock-off” of a famous rifle. The GSG-AK47 is not only a well-made rifle, common of the German engineering we have come to appreciate, but it actually bears the name “Kalashnikov.” GSG is currently the only company in the entire world licensed by Mr. Kalashnikov to manufacture real, functioning firearms, and they have not taken this opportunity lightly. The low cost of shooting .22lr ammo is attractive, but not really at the expense of an unfamiliar rifle with awkward controls and an uncertain reliability aspect. Fortunately for those who of us who like military rifles, all these issues were not a factor with the GSG-AK47. The look, feel and controls are almost identical to the most heavily proliferated rifle system in the world. From the first time it is handled and shouldered, the heavy wood and comfortable stock length give the shooter the real feel of a familiar rifle. The magazine works and looks great and the accuracy potential was surprisingly well. Whether it is for los-cost training on the real system, a departure from the usual noise to give your neighbors a break, to help a youngster learn to handle this style rifle without the recoil and intimidation of the muzzle blast or just plain for fun, we think the GSG-AK47 will make a nice addition to any military firearms collection - See more at: http://www.americantactical.us/589/detail.html#sthash.ze1W6oZM.dpuf"

I just picked it up from the cabinet fabricator yesterday. This machine is very cool. I should start the description of this machine by telling you that this safe is NOT for a large collection of long guns. You may decide to use it in addition to another gun safe you may have. It hold 6 long guns comfortably. plenty of storage for tons of ammo and personal documents. The long gun area has a rack on the back wall for carbine length weapons (3). You can fit 3 longer barreled guns on the side rack, as well. It has no computer, can rack, compressor, coin mechanism or dollar bill changer. However, it does accept coins that drop straight into the coin box, which is now makes it a giant piggy bank.
The inside storage compartment is a wooden frame covered with black felt. A very nice cedar pull out drawer was added (see images) with finger hole pull. It also has a 'Lockout' brand pull out drawer that utilizes the dead space under the shelf top. It comes with one battery powered LED light for the long gun compartment. It also comes with 4 rubber covered wire handgun racks that suspend from the bottom of the shelf. Nice clean factory painted storage area where the compressor used to sit. Don't know what the weight on this is but it weighs a hell of a lot more than my Liberty 18 long gun safe. The Dr. Pepper curved front plexi glass panel in front DOES light up as seen in the images provided. The inner door has a spacious area that allows for an aftermarket wire rack for handguns or document pouches for easy access.

once again, it has these features:

- 6 long gun capacity
- 4 wire gun racks for under shelf storage
- 1 Lockout brand pull drawer for under shelf storage
- Cedar pull out drawer for extra storage
- Coin drop 'Piggy bank' feature
- 3 storage shelves
- Spacious under cabinet storage (clean and factory painted)

I have had exactly 100 rounds through it.  Nice gun, but selling to get a new .17 WSM.  

This Savage comes with the original manual as well as the accu trigger tool.  I will also throw in 50 rounds of 22lr birdshot/rodent shot.

Gun has 1 magazine that holds either 7 or 10 rounds (cant remember off hand).  Also includes a set of medium scope rings.  I will also include the Tasco scope, but you are probably going to want to replace that.  It is fine but it is too small for the rings and i temporarily fixed it by enlarging the scope by wrapping duct tape.....yeah, I know.
I had a spare Limbsaver laying around which I put on it.  It is a little different size, but the size difference just causes it to hang over the top of the stock a bit, actually looks kind of good like this and gives it a bit of 'tactical' look.  I dont believe I kept the original butt plate.

I am asking $200 I will throw in a hard case for it as well.

LWRC
M6-IC
Individual Carbine
16"" Black

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!
The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.

All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight.

The new Individual Carbine family from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward.

I have a brand new gsg ak47 .22 black with tactical quad rail, trijcon green red dot, folding stock comes with it plus all original parts, 3 30 round mags, 1 20 round and one 10 round. 

Can toss in 600 rounds in need be.

And I have a Springfield xd. 45 in perfect shape, in original hard case and hi cap mag. I have a red laser/ flashlight combo on it but the flashlight bulb burnt out, but is in working order.

I have about 60 rounds mostly hollow points I can toss in.

I'm not looking to sell but trade for a mechanic.

 I have a 1987 4runner I had a chevy hei 350 in.

I blew up the 350 I had and I installed a new rebuilt one. 

I am rebuilding the carb this week.

I can't seem to get my truck to hold an idol now so I hope the Carb will work better after the rebuild, its a holley.

I just have a few loose ends I need fixed. And I have no time to do it so I will trade one or the other to have someone come by my house and work on it.

I drove it around the block and it seems like I could have a vaccum leak also my grand shifted funny, was perfect before the swap (turbo 350 also).

If you can weld that is a plus, I sawed out the exhaust pipes I had when I had the motor out toinstall headers but they are to close of a fit to run , so I will put my original headers on and need my old pipes welded or at least tacked back into place.

All in all could just be a few house work, all the parts are there and just need a tweaking.

Great deal for the right person, I can only trade once the jobs completed. If for some reason you can't get it working properly I can give you cash for your time."

This rifle is in its original form, Its date of manufacture is 1992. trigger is fully adjustable. These rifles were chosen because they were the best of the best by the armorers at colt and shoot un believable groups. Im Mostly interested in trades, would rather have another Ar. I would prefer a nice flat top, No cheap stuff pleae, These colts bring a premium but im not one of these jackass gougers either. Just let me know what you have and we can go from there.
