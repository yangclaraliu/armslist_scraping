These are rarely encountered like new in box which is understandable as cardboard boxes aren’t known to hold upvery well over 94 years. 1924 was the last year that the plastic grips were used and in 1925 hey switched to Coltwood wooden grips. They also changed completely over to gas fired ovens for their bluing from Wood so this is also the last year you will find the deep blue polish to these pistols.

This is a Tikka T3 Stainless Lite, chambered in .308 Win. I bought the gun new several years back at Barrows in Butler,Ga., and it's still in minty nice condition.I've had it out on a freinds home range about 3 times, having run a max of 3 boxes through it, and it lives up to the maufacturers promise of shooting at least MOA. I mean, this thing is a hair splitter!Tikka is a subsidiary of Sako, who's rifles are universally considered among the finest you can buy. The Tikkas are made in Finland, in the same factory, by the same staff, and have the same barrels as the Sakos, they just skipped on the expensive woods and finishes, making them more of a economical workhorse rifle, than a glossy safe-queen heirloom. But the quality and perfomance are identical.The scope is a Bushnell Elite 3200 4-12x40 AO (adjustable objective), with lens covers.For those not familiar, the Elites are not the inexpensive Wal-mart Bushnells (which still generally run fine), the Elite series is their premium line, like Lexus is to Toyota. Years ago, Bushnell bought out the very respected Bausch & Lomb of Japan, but continued production under the Elite name, and all the Elite series has been widely known as top quality optics, and have a lifetime manufacturer's guarantee. Unlike most rifle sales here, there is ZERO need to upgrade this scope.The scope rings are a set of steel Warnes, a top quality scope ring (and I still have the factory ring set).Also included is the sling, case, and 4 boxes (80 rounds) of Federal Gold Medal Match Grade Sierra BTHP (boat-tailed hollow points), which are as high quality a round as you can buy,anywhere.(this is an easy $100 worth of premium ammo).Buyer must be legal to own firearms, and be a legal Ga resident, with valid ID. As always, I'll show my ga DL and carry permit.Any messages that sound like the typcial scammer questions will just be ignored, so please try to sound like a legitimate local buyer.No interested in trades, unless it's something irresistable, and in my favor, and especially if it includes cash on top (but still mostly looking for a straight cash sale).No shipping or checks, must meet down here in the Columbus/Harris co area.I think that covers it, thanks for looking.......M.( YES, if the ad is still up, then I still have the rifle !!!!!!!! May consider trade for a clean, high quality hard-tail mountain bike).)"

It has been thoughly cleaned and oiled after each range trip.Comes in original box with 4 magazines. These are made in Germany and have the corresponding proof-marks.The is considered a DAO action, but it's really more of a SAO as there is no double-action. There is a pre-cocked hammer with a very light and crisp pull. The slide is easier to manipulate than any 9mm slide I have seen. I have a couple older relatives who could not shoot a 9mm semi-auto because the slide was too hard to manipulate but this one was not a problem.Magazines are high quality, reliable blued Mec-Gar mags.It has about 400 rds through it. It shoots both steel and brass reliably. It has a polished feedramp for smooth and reliable feeding. It has a bobbed internal hammer and an excellent trigger. It is accurate and very soft shooting. The grip is awkward looking but extremely comfortable. Soft shooting, good trigger, comfortable grip, classic Walther.This will make a perfect first firearm for anyone. It is affordable, good quality, comfortable, good trigger and has a very simple design. There are no external safeties, decockers or DA/SA action to confuse a new shooter. It was a great first pistol for me."

This larger K-frame, six-shot revolver with the snub-nose barrel configuration is a little harder to find and is less common than some of the other models. It's an older Smith and Wesson model - the 'C' series prefix with the serial number 107XXX indicates that it was manufactured between 1948 and 1952.I am asking $500 for this - may be open to trades as well.....primarily WW1 and WW2 firearms, along with any other antique and unique firearms. Please, no trades offers on junk or on run-of-the mill, easy to find stuff that I could purchase at Academy Sports.

It has the duplex reticle. This is a perfect low power variable for an AR. It has exposed, zero resettable turrets. The elevation turret is calibrated for 55 grain .223 an has quick reference hold over markings out to 650 yards if zeroed at 100 yards. Very simple and effective. Turrets have nice positive clicks. This is a great optic for your rifle that will get you some extra magnification for those longer shots. This would also work great for a lightweight .223 bolt action rifle for hunting coyote or hogs. Great clear glass. Some people will tell you that you can't shoot the 1.5 mag with both eyes open. I disagree, at short ranges up to about 50 yards it is no probem, then dial up the mag and close an eye for the longer shots. It isn't the same as a true 1 power yes... but much cheaper, and definitely works once you get used to it. This is a great scope, I'm almost sad to let it go. No it does not come with a mount or rings. This is $299 brand new on optics planet."

Lightweight, quality manufacturing (LWRC does something like 90% of everything in house), very accurate and reliable from online reviews, and it comes packed with all the high end features you could think of. $1100 cash. Only trade I am looking for currently is a FN SCAR 16 FDE + cash on my side. Let me know if you have any questions. Hopefully this awesome AR will find a great home.

It's 100% factory bushmaster, I have never taken it apart or modified it in any way. I bought a Bushmaster so that I wouldn't have to do any of that. The only thing i did was pin it on my DPMS lower, mount a scope on it and shoot it. I am NOT including the scope or the lower in this sale, I have already built a lighter upper for use on this lower. Cash in person, i prefer not to ship and not to deal with any BS. This is a great upper at a great price for the accuracy it has to offer. You can't buy these VMatch uppers anymore like this one so I am firm on my price at $500. It was more than that new and i have barely shot it and now it's hard to find one so you better snatch this one up.ThanksAdam"
