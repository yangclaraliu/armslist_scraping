Or they put up every AR part that's in the catalog. At least those can be filtered out by eliminating vendor listings (which means you also can't see the dealers that aren't abusing Armslist and only post a few ads a day), but for those individuals that are putting multiple posts up for the same item, please read the FAQS. For those that can't find this information, this is what Armslist says about multiple postings (copied directly from the FAQS, not my words):Q: Can I post my listing in multiple locations?No. You should create the listing in the location where you and your item are physically located.Q: But what if I can ship my item?No, one location, and one location only. If someone finds it in their home location, they assume they can go to your location and make a deal. If they find it in a faraway location, they assume it must be shipped. Your listing will still be found through searches. There is also the option to select ""Willing to Ship"" when creating your listing. Browsers are then able to filter by ""Dealers that Ship"" when searching for an item.Q: Can I post in nearby states?No, this confuses people. If they want to look at an item in your location, they will browse your location, or find it through searching.Q: What about nearby cities?No, this also confuses people. Users look at listings in the cities where they live and shop.Q: Can I re-post my items for sale once per day until they sell?No, duplicate listings are not permitted. You can use the built in bump feature keep your listing new.Q: Ok so tell me clear and simple, how does this work?One item for sale = one listing, in one location.But what if I...NoBut I saw a guy that...NoOne item, one listing, one location, period.

This is very clean,(nice bluing and pristine bore) not a thrashed surplus rifle, and not one that was cobbled together for export, as it has the military issue 3 Chinese character ( ""type 56"") stamps, and arsenal stamp (triangle 636).  (edit) Almost forgot, all numbers do match (receiver,bolt,carrier,top cover,trigger assembly, and magazine),and it's a pinned barrel. The importer was CSI in Ontario Ca.,serial number is 22,024,***. The barrel is chrome lined, 16+ inches long, the sights are dialed in, and it runs like a sewing machine.The stock is a nearly bulletproof,vintage fiberglass Chinese ""jungle stock"" (that have gotten to be expensive collector pieces, and difficult to find). It has a rubber buttstock pad/spacer installed, and Romanian AK sling. Also included is a 180-rd range pack of standard Russian steel cased 7.62x39 ammo.Buyer must be legal to own firearms, and be a legal Ga resident, with valid ID. As always, I'll show my Ga DL and carry permit. No scammer questions please (which means if the ad is still up, then I still have it, so don't ask. And, don't ask me to call or text a distant area code........or any area code. I don't mind talking on the phone, but only after I'm sure I'm dealing with a legitimate local buyer.)No trade interests unless it's something really cool, and in my favor, but primarilly just needing the cash. Local FTF cash only, no shipping/checks/travel. Thanks for looking."

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Very similar to the P-01, the PCR uses the same alloy frame minus the light rail, making it even more concealable. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger pull is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing.

Was eyeing new G43s yesterday and thought I'd post this up here before buying another new one at retail. It's cool if you have done a little aftermarket work, but as close to factory as possible is what I'm looking to do. Ideally, I am looking for a G43 OR FNS-9C, but the budget-friendly M&P's are appealing, and I like how they shoot. Own a full-size FNX-45 and would love to get its little brother counterpart in FDE.If you have a nice AIWB rig to include, I'll also take it, but what I'm really looking for is any of one of these models, in good operable condition (don't care about any wear and tear marks - gives it character). I have cash and ready to move ASAP on the right deal. Flexible weekend plans so can meet up ASAP. Located in Burlington. Whether or not you want to do a bill of sale, as a seller, is up to you. As the buyer, I would like one just for my records and as a general cover-your-ass item. You can also check my ID to ensure I am a valid VT resident. And while not necessary, if you'd like, I'd even be happy to go as far as meeting at a local FFL so we can do the background check, if it's someting that would make you more comfortable.Hit me up with some offers. Worst I can say is no. Looking to spend ~$500 or less- just bear in mind I can buy most of this stuff new for this price or less, so if you are pricing your used G43 at $25 under retail and offering it to me - just to be realistic - I'd need to politely decline as at that point, I can buy new w/ warranty for just a little extra."

Vermont Federation of Sportsmen's ClubsUrgent Action Needed Despite approximately 1,200 sportspeople who took time out of their lives to come to the statehouse on January 30th, everything has changed since the horrific event at Parkland Florida and the events in Vermont that followed.   At a Press Conference this morning, Attorney General Donovan, Speaker Johnson, Senate Pro Tempore Ashe and Lt Governor Zuckerman all announced that S.221, H.422 and even S.6 would be voted on by the Senate as early as next week.  Other bills that aren't even active are also being openly discussed, such as an Assault Weapons Ban and a High Capacity Magazine Ban.  Vermont could, quite literally, become worse than New York in one fell swoop. Our first line of attack to stop this avalanche is to have each of us contact our respective senators.  Please do the following IMMEDIATELY: 1.     Using the list that follows locate your county, and then make note of your senator(s) names if you are not already familiar with them.2.     Call the Sergeant-At-Arms at (802) 828-2228a.     Politely ask to leave a message for your senator(s)b.     Give your name and town of residencec.      Indicate your message is urgent, and ask that the Senator(s) call you concerning the planned attack on your gun rights, and then give your phone number.3.      If you don't hear back or are seeing this on the weekend, please consider calling your Senator at home using the list that follows.  Please note that the numbers provided are published on the Legislative website so these are public, if there is no number than they have an un-listed number.4.     Again using the list which follows, email your Senator(s) and tell them that you strongly oppose S.6, and ask them for a more deliberative process for H.422. This is Extremely Urgent!!!!     CountyNamePartyHome PhoneWork EmailAddisonClaire AyerD759-2748cayer@leg.state.vt.usAddisonChristopher BrayD453-4424cbray@leg.state.vt.usBenningtonBrian CampionD  bcampion@leg.state.vt.usBenningtonDick SearsD  rsears@leg.state.vt.usCaledoniaJoe BenningR  jbenning@leg.state.vt.usCaledoniaJane KitchelD684-3482jkitchel@leg.state.vt.usChittendenTim AsheD/P318-0903tashe@leg.state.vt.usChittendenPhillip BaruthD/P503-5266pbaruth@leg.state.vt.usChittendenDebbie IngrahmD 879-0054dingram@leg.state.vt.usChittendenVirginia LyonsD863-6129vlyons@leg.state.vt.usChittendenChristopher PearsonP/D860-3933cpearson@leg.state.vt.usChittendenMichael SirotkinD999-4360msirotkin@leg.state.vt.usEssex-OrleansJohn RodgersD525-4182jrodgers@leg.state.vt.usEssex-OrleansRobert StarrD988-2877rstarr@leg.state.vt.usFranklinCarolyn BranaganR  cbranagan@leg.state.vt.usFranklinRandy BrockR868-2300rbrock@leg.state.vt.usGrand IsleDick MazzaD863-1067  LamoilleRichard WestmanR644-2297  OrangeMark MacDonaldD433-5867mmacdonald@leg.state.vt.usRutlandBrian CollamoreR773-1365bcollamore@leg-state.vt.usRutlandPeg FloryR779-1870pflory@leg.state.vt.usRutlandDavid SoucyR236-3555dsoucy@leg.state.vt.usWashingtonFrancis BrooksD223-3170fbrooks@leg.state.vt.usWashingtonAnn CummingsD223-6043acummings@leg.state.vt.usWashingtonAnthony PollinaP/D229-5809apollina@leg.state.vt.usWindhamBecca BalintD  bbalint@leg.state.vt.usWindhamJeanette WhiteD387-4379jwhite@leg.state.vt.usWindsorAlison ClarksonD457-4627aclarkson@leg.state.vt.usWindsorDick McCormackD793-6417rmccormack@leg.state.vt.usWindsorAlice NitkaD228-8432anitka@state.leg.vt.us"
