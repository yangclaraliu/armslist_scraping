All you will find in the P229C are the .357 and .40 caliber versions because only 3000 9mm versions were made. I think I'd rather have something a bit special but not so rare I'd feel bad about using it. This one has the G10 grips and 15 round capacity with a 3.5"" barrel to make it a little better than your standard P229 for conceal carry. As an added benifit, all you need to convert to .357 or .40 caliber is a barrel and magazine which are readily available. I'm mostly interested in higher end pistols but I have some specific rifles listed I would like to add to my collection. Retail on this one was $1,142. I'll trade retail to retail for NIB and give or take cash as needed. LNIB trades will be negotiable. I'm looking mostly for 9mm, DA/SA, in a metal frame but I'm open other nice firearms.
