A simplification of the CZ 75’s hammer ignition method, the Omega’s trigger parts are interlocking in nature, allowing full disassembly and reassembly without the need for gunsmithing experience or tools.The best part of this system is its convertible decocker/safety system. Whether the user wants to carry the pistol cocked and locked like a 1911 or decocked for a double-action first pull of the trigger, a few minutes time allows the swapping of the safety for a decocking lever or vice versa.The P-07 received a facelift in 2014, removing any sharp edges and adding forward cocking serrations and interchangeable backstraps. Metal sights, new trigger and hammer designs and a fiber-reinforced polymer rounded out the updates, resulting in a pistol that’s even more comfortable for all-day carry, increasingly adaptable to user preferences and hardier than ever before."

It’s a beautiful  Polytech M14s rifle chambered in 308/7.62 NATO.  These haven’t been imported into the country since 94. Has a chrome lined barrel with very strong sharp rifling. These are rare to come by nowadays and in this condition even harder, appears to have been shot very little. Has a padded carrying case, leather sling, USGI bayonet and sheath, three 20 round magazines, one 5 round magazine and 180 rounds of ammo. The stock has recently been redone and It also has a USGI flash hider attached. Recently took it out and was ringing man-size steel targets at 300 yards with open sights with ease. Definitely not in any rush to get rid of this beast but just curious to see what’s out there and what offers I might get. Priced at $1500 and price is firm. Open to trades but only really interested in very desirable military surplus rifles like the M1 Garand but willing to entertain all offers. If interested make me an offer, worst i can do is say no thank you. Shipping available but only through a legitimate FFL. Buyer pays all transfer and shipping fees. Not willing to deal with persons under the age of 21 or convicted felons. All federal and state laws apply. If you’re a Florida resident a valid Florida drivers license and bill of sale will be required, non-negotiable. CCW/CWP preferred. Located in Melbourne FL."

The only sign of wear is a light scratch on the rear of the slide that was there when I bought it. Comes with everything as new- box, literature, and 2 mags. Also have a set of Vickers Tactical Tango Down mag plates and a box of Hornday Critical Defense ammo. Looking to trade for a Glock 26 in similar condition, primarily a gen4 but would consider a gen3 for the right deal. Just looking for a stock gun, please no solder iron stipple jobs or other 'custom' projects. Active CCL holder and will require a valid ID for my records if you do not have a CCL. FTF in the Winfield/Wellington area preferred but can travel a little for the right deal and if schedule allows.

Our B-14 rifles were inspired by the desire to bring the quality that Bergara was known for in the custom rifle world to production rifles made for all hunters. In the B-14 rifle, you will find a level of craftsmanship that surpasses all of the other production hunting rifles on the market.
The B-14 HMR rifle features our integrated mini-chassis molded into the stock to give the rifle repeatable bedding and accuracy. It also supports a fully free-floated barrel to achieve optimal precision. The Bergara Hunting and Match rifles are built to offer a rifle for both hunters and competition shooters that can perform incredibly in either situation. The stock features an adjustable cheekpiece and length of pull spacers. Built in Spain at our highly automated and efficient barrel factory, this rifle delivers a level of quality and performance that is unmatched in its price range.
The world-renowned Bergara barrel on this long range precision rifle is complemented by our own super-smooth B-14 Action, which is a two-lug system with a sliding plate extractor and a coned bolt nose and breech to ensure a smooth feeding and extraction of the cartridge. It’s also outfitted with a Bergara curved trigger we designed to guarantee a crisp, clean pull every time you fire the rifle. The trigger comes set at about three pounds. It has been factory drilled and tapped to fit Remington 700 style rings and bases.
