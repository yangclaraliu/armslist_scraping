Rifle shoots great, It originally had a cycling issue when I got it and I replaced all of the gas parts with new US made pieces which fixed the problem. It sometimes does not like to completely cycle sometimes with cheap steal cased ammo however I only shoot brass cased, quality rounds through it and haven't had any more issues since. I had it looked at and the Barrel's gas port has some wear that my gunsmith suspects is the issue with cheaper (less powerful) ammunition. I have found replacement new old stock barrels for about $75 online so it can be perfect, but I never shoot the rifle anymore.

The only think better than an HK is a souped up HK. These highly sought after pistols have been a mainstay of the Special Operations community for years for the simple reason that HK works, and works well. This one is the prefered variant #1, meaning that the slide lever acts as a de-cocker and a safety. You can carry this ""cocked & locked"" in 1911 fashion, or uncocked as a double action. This gun is outfitted with a 6"" stainless steel National Match Grade, Compensated barrel (cuts in the exposed end of barrel that allows excess gas to vent upwards during fire), that mitigates muzzle rise down to next to nothing. It has a HK competition recoil spring, making the racking of the slide feel like hot butter on teflon. It is easier to rack than EVERY 9mm I own. One of the most significant features of the USP is the mechanical recoil reduction system. This system is incorporated into the recoil spring assembly, and consists of a captive coil spring around the guide rod. This feature, combined with the compensated barrel, make this gun feel more like a 40 S&W, even with 45 +P loads. It has the HK short reset combat trigger, that allows for a higher cyclic rate, without being dangerously light like a competition trigger. Included with the gun are 3) 12 round factory, and 1) 22 round aftermarket magazines, a black leather pancake style belt holster. She has HK installed night sights, that are dimming, but still work like a charm. The frame rails, exterior of the chamber and feed ramps have all been polished to a mirror shine. This was my personal sidearm on a security detail in N. Africa, and she served me well, not once giving me a click when I asked for a bang (regardless of ammo), always supremely accurate and manageable. She has some minor scratches on the proprietary ""Hostile Environment"" nitride finish, but nothing down to the bare metal. There is also some minor scuffing at the heel of the grip. Overall, I'd put the finish in the 80-85% category. The bore is bright and shiney, with great rifling, and the gun functions flawlessly. This isn't a civilian toy, but rather a professional's tool. I am willing to negotiate....but I'm not giving it away."

James Christopher Gable from Greenville, NC is simply a liar and crook.  I share this with you as his character can be bought for $25 – exactly what he is attempting to cheat me out of.  The details are below but I wanted to share this with others so you know not to deal with this person.

The transaction was for a set of reloading dies - $20 + $5 for flat rate shipping to Charlottte…  If you know him or his mother you may want to share that they are being called out publically for their fraud.  I do not know if his mother is involved but since she received the funds in her account (was verified that it was correct prior to sending) thus she is now implicated.

...........................................
 The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
 Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
 Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
 The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
 To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
 The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
 The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
 Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

Price and weight were the most important factors when developing the SL. With the M6-SL, LWRCI has brought to the market the lightest factory piston driven rifle to date.

The SL comes standard with Magpul furniture. A MOE mid-length handguard, MOE Stock, and MOE pistol grip provide excellent handling characteristics, while minimizing added weight. The SL utilizes the 'stretch' or mid-length piston system, providing a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The most distinct feature of the SL is the barrel. The barrel still utilizes LWRCI's NiCorr surface conversion technology on a cold-hammer-forged barrel, but the barrel is of a smaller diameter to reduce weight.

The SL comes standard with the EXO (nickel-boron) plated one piece bolt carrier and the EXO coated enhanced fire control group. The SL also comes standard with a Daniel Defense A1.5 fixed rear sight and a fixed A2 front sight post.

The SL is a great addition to the LWRCI family of rifles. It provides users with an extremely lightweight rifle that incorporates our patented short-stroke piston operating system, has all of the advanced coatings that make our rifles the best in the world, and does so at an entry level price.

Note about this particular rifle: Chambered in 5.56. Most of the MagPul furniture has been replaced with Foliage Green MOE furniture in place of the black except for the foreguard. The Daniel Defense rear sight has been replaced with a MagPul (FG) flip up rear sight. 16in barrel with AAC Blackout (non-ratcheting) flash hider in place of the A2 Birdcage. Will also throw in the black 30rd PMAG which came with the rifle. Only 200 rounds through the barrel, all of it M855 surplus from Federal in Lake City. Reason for low ammo count is that I won another LWRC rifle in a drawing literally a week after purchasing this rifle and it has pretty much stayed in storage as a back up or bug out gun so very little if any wear and tear."

I only mention it because whomever sporterized it did a nice job, even turned down the bolt and I thought maybe he went a little further. The bore is clean with good rifleing. When it was sporterized the rear sight was removed and was replaced with a top of the line 'Williams Peep Sight"" Rifle comes with sling. Will consider a trade for12 ga  trap load shiotgun shells or a reloader.. I'm sorry but I do not ship."

$275 for the barrel with scope and mount

I have blued Super 14 Hunter barrel chambered in 44 Magnum barrel with a factory muzzle brake. It measures 14"" including the muzzle brake. The brake works really well for taming the recoil. The barrel does have a factory front sight. This barrel is one of the nicest barrels I have ever seen. The bore is mirror like as is the outside. This barrel will fit the older Contender, and not the newer Encore, frames.



The barrel also comes with a factory scope mount and in the scope mount is a Thompson Center 4x scope. The scope has some minor freckling on the inside but it still very useable. 


Also included are two Lee brand bullet molds to cast your own bullets using wheel weights. One is a single cavity 214 grain HP mold. The second is a dual cavity 240 grain flat point mold. The single cavity is used but still very nice. The two cavity mold is brand new and has never been used. 


I will also include a used set of Lee carbide dies. These are a 3 die set that have been used very little and mostly sat on a shelf. Any brass sized using these dies were lubed even though carbide dies do.



Also included is 126 pieces of 44 special and 20 pieces of 44 magnum brass. All brass is Starline which makes the best handgun brass in the world. All brass is once fired. The 44 Special brass is sized, belled and ready to prime and load.


Price includes shipping to anywhere in the US. No international shipping.

When reloading using your own bullets that you cast the cost of each loaded round is easily less than 10 cents. A quick crunch of the numbers shows you can load these for under 7 cents per loaded round using bullets you cast compared to over 50 cents each for factory ammunition. Hand loaded ammunition tends to be a lot more accurate than factory ammo too. Casting your own bullets also makes you less reliant on finding ammunition or components which right now is nearly impossible. Imagine no more trying to find loaded ammunition or bullets to reload with. Reloading in general reduces the cost of shooting as well as increases the accuracy of the firearm. I cast using common wheel weights and have had amazing results. Cast bullets perform just as well as most jacketed bullets.

Time to let her go - I spent over $1000 for the TC alone and the Scope was the most expensive piece after the muzzle loader ( $250.00) -  @ night the cross hairs glow -piece. The case was a had to purchase of $40 bucks to carry out of store and the Sling about the same amount.

I have a (imported by Century) Romanian SAR-1 AK-47, 3 steel mags (1-10 round, 2-30 round) and a lot of WPA ammo: 397 rounds of HP and 225 rounds of FMJ..  I've cleaned it thoroughly.  It also has the side mount for an optic or rail.

I've put about 100 rounds through it, flawlessly. The previous owner had it and it was a closet queen. Comes with a harsh sell, foam interior case. This AK is a beast, and while I wish I could have both an AK and an AR, I don't have the $$. So I'd like to get into an AR platform and I can switch back to AK if I want.
