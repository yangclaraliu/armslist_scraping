Round doesn't go up the ramp but if you pull slide back and release it then chambers the round and gun fires normally. Every other round or so. I assume it's a minor issue according to research I've done. Ejector tuning maybe. Ramp appears shiny and polished. I don't have expertise and have lost confidence in the gun.

This is about the first rifle that had a Nylon stock.The ammo is fed through the end of the stock and when I pulled the tube out of the stock it held 13 rounds of .22 LR.The previous owner said it shot like a dream and he had bought it new. I think he said he got it in Michigan at a Sears store.I would like to see a driver's license and will meet within a reasonable distance of Anderson-Summitville.And I will answer all inquiries.I want $275 but feel free to make offers.Thanks.Jim

This isn't ""50 rounds but just kidding 500"", my original VP9 had a factory issue and this was replaced brand new by H&K. That is the reason I have six mags, I was told to keep my original three for the trouble of the ordeal. VP9 has been great, I love the gun, but I don't have endless funds and I want a more concealable Glock 19. Grip on the VP9 is more duty-like, and I have a silly sentimental attachment to my first gun so unfortunately it's the VP9 on the block. Will probably re-buy a VP9 when I save more money. I have two IWB kydex and one OWB kydex holster if you're interested. Seeking $550 for everything or a similarly good condition and fairly new GLOCK 19. FN 509 is a dark horse interest but that has a long grip as well. I do have a CCW license and willing to drive within the state of Florida."

If you are reading this it is STILL AVAILABLE!!!! This is not a cheap wasr or century arms build so please don’t treat it like one. Be my guest and stay at the low end of the ak realm. If you want quality this rifle might just be up your alley.Egyptian Maadi Pars RML ak-47 akm in great shape. This is one of the closest ak’s to a kalishnikov you can get. These are getting harder and harder to find. They were imported in the U.S. between 1993-1995. Some came in with a 16” barrel and some with 20” bbl. this one has the 20” bbl. This rifle is NOT a parts kit. All numbers are matching. I believe the sling is from the factory. Email me and I will send more pics as armslist will only let me post one. Have a great day! Little more info on the rifle.Egyptian Maadi AK47’s One of the only semi-automatic Kalashnikov imported into the United States, in almost every regard, an exact duplicate of the Russian AKM. During the 1950’s the Soviet Union, as part of its military aid program, established the production of Soviet-pattern small arms in the Arab Republic of Egypt. AKM rifles were manufactured at the “Factory 54,” the Maadi Company for Engineering Industries in Cairo. Key Egyptian personnel were trained in the Soviet Union, and the plant was supervised by Russians prior to their abrupt expulsion from Egypt at the hands of Anwar Sadat in 1972. Designated as the “ARM” (Automatic Rifle Misr), a semiautomatic-only version of the Egyptian AKM was introduced to the American public in 1982 by the U.S. division of Steyr-Daimler-Punch in Steyr, Austria. For all intents and purposes this is as close as most of us will ever come to a Russian AKM. The laminated wood handguards and buttstock are correct in every detail. The lower handguard has the proper hand swells, and the buttstock has been reinforced with steel pins in all the right places. All the wood furniture was imported from Finland but finished in Egypt. The plastic pistol grip was injection-molded to correct Soviet configuration. The metal components are exactly those of the Russian AKM. Small recesses on each side of the receiver , directly over the magazine-well, serve as magazine guides and instantly distinguish this as an AKM. The four gas escapes holes found on each side of the Ak-47’s gas cylinder have been omitted, and there are two gas relief holes on each side of the gas block where it mates with the gas tube.Rear sights are graduated to 1000 meters (with a 300-meter battle sight marked “p”) instead of the AK-47’s 800meter maximum. The sheet-metal receiver cover has transverse ribs and a rolled edge over the ejection port. Chambers and bores are hard chromed. All the exterior metal surfaces have been finished with a baked on black enamel over phosphate. Only the green web sling was of Egyptian design."

The Trigger Kit directly replaces the factory hinged trigger with a solid aluminum trigger body which reduces pre-travel and over-travel by approximately 20%. It features a smooth face with a center mounted pivoting safety that maintains factory safety values.The Apex Duty/Carry Kit was designed to provide the M&P Shield pistol owner a smooth, consistent trigger pull that is approximately 2 lbs lighter (based on variations in factory tolerances) with the advantages of shorter over-travel and more detectable trigger reset. However, armorer or gunsmith installation of the Ultimate Striker Block (USB) into the Shield slide is strongly recommended**.Expected Results – Reduces trigger pull by approximately 2 lbs. – Smooth uptake and reset – Reduces pre-travel – Reduces over-travel – Reduced reset – Center mounted pivoting safety maintains factory safety valuesApplicable To What Gun(s) Works with all Smith & Wesson M&P Shield Pistols in 9mm and .40 calibers.

The bore is shiny with strong lands and grooves. The muzzle erosion gauge places this barrel at 1.0 which is like new, so not only is this a fantastic collector's piece but will also be a great shooter.The serial number places this rifle at December of 1943 manufacture, the barrel is dated 10-43. Most USGI rifles from WW2 in original condition had barrels approximately 2 months older than the receiver, this is correct according to multiple sources including Joe Poyer. All parts are Remington marked where appropriate, the stock features left wrist ordinance wheel, FJA and RA which are the appropriate proofs for its date of manufacture. The underside of the wrist features a small sized circle P proof, ahead of the magazine are a number of stock manufacturer's proofs. The front sight is C height. The butt plate is the small grid variant. The receiver and barrel are parkerized while the remaining parts are blued. There is no evidence of any rebuild on this rifle and according to numerous sources it is original and correct as it left the factory. Price is firm at $1100, you'd be hard pressed to find a correct example in this shape for less. Not interested in trades. Available to meet in either Grand Rapids or Novi area.High resolution photos here: https://imgur.com/a/ATwij"
