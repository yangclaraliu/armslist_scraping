I have shot a hundred rounds through it since then shooting Rabbits, Rats, Squirrels, Coyotes, Fixes, Grouse and Crows. Can’t shoot anymore, so hoping to find a home for this with someone who appreciates it’s history. These are selling for between $450.00 for shooters and $1200.00 for collectibles. I believe this gun is both shootable and collectible, I'm asking $650.00 OBO for quick sale. Large pics available via email........."

It has a black synthetic stock with a stainless steel bolt and barrel. Super light at about 7lbs. empty, making it a snap to carry on a hunt. Very crisp action with a single stage ""Acutrigger"" type trigger. Outfitted with Warne scope rings on a aftermarket Marlin one-piece scope base. It has a Beartooth side saddle and Winchester sling that I'll throw in with it. Has a Leupold VX-II 3-9x40 scope, I'd rather not part with it but I will for another $225. It does have some scuffing upfront on the body. Nothing major though, optics themselves are still super clear. At any rate the rifle has seen less than 150 rounds, but I'd like to trade it out for a Tika T3, so this one's gotta go. I've never done any ""real"" shooting with it; outside bottles and cans at about 100yds and it does that very well. It seems to like Winchester Bonded and Hornady ammo best. It does fire your cheaper Remington and Federals as well. As a heads up the only rounds I've ever had trouble with is the Seller & Bellot FMJs, the cases expanded too much when fired and don't eject very well."

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This listing will be deleted if the gun is sold.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18"

black in color.
Galco‘s many decades of experience designing and building the world‘s best gunleather has resulted in a line of paddle holsters that perfectly combine secure carry with easy and convenient removal and replacement on the belt.

Now, the new Paddle Lite holster fuses some of the best features of the tremendously successful Carry Lite series of holsters with Galco's renowned paddle design.

By using their time-proven paddle design and joining it to a holster made from their Premium Center Cut Steerhide, Galco has once again created a concealment holster that is reasonably priced yet extremely comfortable and efficient. Featuring Galco‘s patented belt-lock copolymer injection molded paddle, the Paddle Lite is very secure, yet easy to remove and replace without removing the belt.

Riding high and close to the body with a butt-forward cant, it offers both good concealment and a fast, easy draw. The thumb break retention strap combines security with a simple and quick release.

The Paddle Lite fits belts up to 1 3/4"".

I paid $65.00 for it 2 months ago and forgot about it in my gun safe and bought a different holster.

For maximun close quarters maneuverability, and ensure reliability I chose a numbers matching action Norinco SKS Paratrooper (16 inch barrel) from 1964 since they were machined at the russian setup factory 26. I then added a folding collapsible stock (comfortable for all from 5'2' to 6'4""), so that it could fit in my nightstand (these stocks are sold out and going for $150 on auction sites. I added M-16/AR-15 style tech-sights, which resulted in 3-3.5 inch groups at 100 yards, which is unheard of for an SKS. I added a compact LED light/laser combo that can be individually operated using your thumb while on the vertical grip, and the laser is adjustable for windage and elevation. I added a vertical grip/bipod which is great for shooting at the range, or close quarters using the laser and flashlight.

Original stock and handguard are included (not pictured), and is setup to accept a paratrooper spike bayonet.
The numbers on the fixed magazine do not match but has been replaced with one from the same factory and time period, and works flawlessly.

This rifle comes with ammo (either impossible to find or overpriced at the moment) for both practice and defense. 50 rds full metal jacket and 90 rds jacketed hollow point on 14 stripper clips.

I am actually selling because my little ones are walking around and getting into stuff, so even with a child lock, we are no longer comfortable keeping a battle rifle in my nightstand. I'll actually look to replace it with a Glock 21 or 22 in an electric lockbox.
I will also include a soft padded bag that has 5 outside pockets for easy access to ammo
This rifle has everything you need for defense and accuracy at an affordable price. Get your SKS before, like AK's and ARs, they become hugely inflated. Everything you need in one affordable package"

New - ATI's Omni lower reciever is as strong as aluminum and will accept any .223 caliber upper and magazine. The Omni is a multi-caliber AR15 lower made of reinforced polymer. It is designed after a mil-spec lower and is compatible with most current AR15 lower parts kits, grips and stocks. Made with a high-grade durable polymer material, the Omni can withstand harsh environments as well as everyday wear and tear. 

This is the same material used for Glock pistols. Those pistols are famous for being run over by trucks, thrown off of buildings, submerged under water, and then being picked up and fired with out issue. I am amazed at how light this lower is. It would be perfect to make a light carry gun.

Great youtube video reviewing and testing ATI's reinforced polymer Omni lower reciever:
