Barrel date of 9-32, bright and shiny. All patina on metal is consistent and looks good for its age. Correct N.S. Bolt for year of rifle, and front sight hood. C stock and handguard still have present drawing numbers, and a faint Arsenal cartouche for Augusta Arsenal. While some indicators aren’t there to say this is a NM rifle, it has the possibility of being an original M1903A1....But, we may never know. Due to the condition, and being in a very good condition pre war C stock, which is correct for this year of rifle, it is priced at $1100.more photos upon request."

Our back handed, out of touch, slime ball Governor, John Kasich, is supporting a bill that would ban (without any grandfather clause) the transfer, sale or possession of all semi-automatic firearms, and create a firearms and ammunition sales database of all other legally owned firearms in our great state of Ohio. This must not stand. Please call Governor Kasich at 614-466-3555 and politely tell him where he can shove his draconian legislation. Please seek out the contact information for your representatives, and let them know that Ohio will not sit idly by while our god given rights are taken from us. Make their phones ring off the hook until this bill is off the table. PLEASE SHOW YOUR SUPPORT IN PERSON SATURDAY 3/10/18 at 1:00 PM at THE OHIO STATE HOUSE IN COLUMBUS. We must stand together now and say “enough is enough.” We will no longer sit silently while we are punished for the acts of a few crazed mad men that we have no association with. We will not entrust our protection and give our firearms to the same organizations that drop the ball on these murderers time after time (no offense to all of the good men and women an uniform out there intended- we all know 99% if you are the real deal), only to blame us for their negligence. So this is it, brothers and sisters. You must come out of the shadows, and make the world see that we are not a bunch of blood thirsty lunatics. We are the same co-workers, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers that they have known for years. We are the same folks that you get a friendly “hello” from at the grocery store. You trust us to watch your kids and your house when your out of town- but you can’t trust us with firearms? The time for inaction is over, my friends. STAND UP AND DO SOMETHING, AND STOP LEAVING THE DEFENSE OF YOUR LIBERTY TO SOMEONE ELSE."

No blemish minus missing one screw in a grip, easy fix but if it’s a problem I can go pick one up for a few bucks prior to trade or sell. Looking for an RMR for my Glock 19 MOS, if it’s new in the box I’ll throw some money in with the deal. The Llama is going around $450 on broker, this one is in good shape. I’m happy to meet on a range, and do some shooting with it. I may also consider a Delta or other quality optic. Pretty sold on on an RMR for trade, cash, would consider a Ruger American or other bolt gun in .300 WIN, or .308. If it’s a nice system or if it’s got a quality piece of glass some cash in my end as well, I have no problem just taking he rifle and getting my own glass."

It is in exceptional shape considering its age and showing very little use, great blueing, and only a few minor dings on the stock and a bore that looks like it has rarely been shot. The trigger is like breaking a glass rod and set at 2 lbs.It is topped with a new Bushnell Elite 10x40 scope and I will throw in a set of reloading dies and brass.Asking $950 and will consider possible trades +- cash for an Anschutz 22 or a CZ 455.Prefer FTF NW Houston but will ship for actual cost."

I owned a few 22LR rifles in my younger days but not a lever-action: love it.But, as much as I love the gun, my eyesight is such I cannot even see the sights at the end of the barrel well, not to speak of the target downrange.I feel silly putting the target a 5, 10 and 15 yards, so it's time to let it go. I took it to the range one last time yesterday. I've got so many other guns I've bought to shoot that I took it to the range only 3 times, putting only about a box of shells through twice and yesterday I put 2 boxes through, for old time's sake.Shot everything from 15' to 60' and the gun shoots better than I can see. Whoever owned this gun before I bought it really took care of it b/c it is a gem: that's why I bought it.Looking for a new owner who will appreciate it."
