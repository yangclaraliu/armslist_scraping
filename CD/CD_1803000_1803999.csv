KelTec p11, in good shape, belt clip installed, one 10 round mec gar magazine

Ruger mark 2 bolt action rifle.  This includes one 10  round magazine ( These magazines are widely available and cheap if you want more)  The iron sights are dead on to any distance you can hold an effective sight picture, but a small rimfire scope will be included anyway.

Rossi ""princess"" pocket sized stainless 7 shot 22lr revolver.  Beautiful bore, as accurate as a small pocket sized revolver could ever be.  A nice purse gun , varmint gun, or backup for any situation that requires small calibre
. 
Very nice all stainless taurus pt-100.  This is a very very nice pistol  as far as .40 calibres are concerned.  Many people do not know or understand that these pistols are made on the exact same machinery in the exact same plant in Brazil where baretta manufactured the 92 and 96, but taurus improved the design of the safety, added a rail, and priced it right.  Anybody who calls these a ""nockoff"" is completely uneducated about the history of these guns.  You cannot jam these things, magazines are widely available (even 20 round extended mags), and I love this gun,  Just putting out there to see whats available.  This gun also comes with 9mm threaded barrel which functions perfectly, and frame saver recoil spring system.  The extras alone retailed for $400

Taurus model 845 - This .45 has been well kept, and is modeled after Taurus' OSS tactical model still in use by central american special forces. This version is hammer fired and very accurate. 12+1 capacity makes it a full sized tool of self preservation.

Taurus pt 145 Millennium pro 45 A.C.P.

The Millennium PRO"" features the same revolutionary Single Action/Double Action trigger and matching serial numbers on the frame, slide and barrel as the 24/7 PRO, Heinie ""Straight Eight"" sights, an ergonomic grip design, enhanced finger indexing Ambidextrous Index Memory Pads"" and posi-traction slide serrations. Light, powerful and technically advanced, the Millennium PRO is the choice for concealment and back-up carry. This gun is in good condition with one small finish wear spot.  two magazines."

This is a real Marlin made by Marlin, not the current subsidiary of Remington/Cerberus and it's horrific lack of quality control. The fit and finish of a true Marlin is much superior to the new rifles. Many current manufacture Marlin 45-70's have been found with reciever cracks new in the box where the barrel mates to the reciever, among many other defects. These pre Remington Marlins are now a piece of history, and much higher quality. You will never see a new Marlin with this quality.

Ruger 10/22 rifle.  I purchased this gun new a couple years ago and it remains in new condition.  I removed the original wood stock and replaced it with an after market tactical stock that adjust for size.  I then added the bi-pod, adjustable camo sling, barska 4x32 scope, and extended mag release.  The original stock was put away and never used.  It takes less than a minute to switch the stocks back to original.

Included with the gun are the following:
*   three 10rnd magazines
*   three 25rnd BX-25 magazines

The Ruger 10/22, the 25rnd magazines, and the ammo itself have all become very difficult to find in the stores lately.  Everything is like new.  All the mags are manufactured by Ruger, no cheap junk.  About 400 rounds have been fired through this gun without one single FTF.

Here is what I paid for everything:
gun +1 mag $330
tactical stock $80
3x 25rnd mags $150
2x 10rnd mags $40
strap $20
scope $35
flip open scope lense covers $20 ($10 each)
extended mag release $20
bi-pod $30

1988 suzuki katana 1100. First year made. 32k miles. I bought this to restore/redo. First off this is not a perfect bike. It runs and looks decent. I bought it and started to redo everything and a family member offered me a sweet deal on a bike I previously owned, so here it is up for sale. It needs the carbs cleaned (pilot jets). In the last month or so here's what I've done to it.
New seat cover ( not a slip on)
New rear turn signals
New choke cable
Used idle adjust knob/cable
New brake lever
New front master cylinder
Rebuilt clutch master cylinder
Rebuilt clutch slave cylinder
Used and restored windscreen( hard to find)
New grips/bar ends
New spark plugs
New fuel lines and vacuum hoses
Replaced oil pan and gasket
Changed oil and filter
New brake pads and flushed lines
Replaced brake fitting
Used factory air box
New battery
Used taillight
I've got it to run pretty good, it looks decent. Not too many of these around. It has a full Vance and Hines exhaust. I have brand new individual breathers for the carbs and new rear brake pads that are not on the bike. Also have a few extra parts for too. Everything goes. This can be ridden. But it still needs work.Clear Indiana Title in hand. $1500 Firm!!!. May consider good handgun as partial trade. I don't need any more vehicles or help selling this one. Thanks for looking.

The Sig Sauer P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military and law enforcement professionals around the world. The innovative design of the removable steel frame housed in a polymer grip module allows agencies and units to change caliber, pistol size (subcompact, compact and full), trigger length and grip size without changing the issued serial number. The steel frame controls the rearward motion of the slide- not the polymer grip, as in other pistols. The result is both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality even with laser/light accessories mounted to the polymer grip's accessory rail.

Exactly 1320 grains of this container have been loaded (50 shells worth), so 97.6% remains (7.8lb)

""748 is the powder of choice for 223 Remington ammunition. The low flame temperature extends barrel life compared to other similar speed powder. It is ideal for a wide variety of centerfire rifle loads, including 222 Remington, 30-30 Winchester, 30 Winchester, and up to 485 Winchester Magnum.""

This gun was purchased new in March 2013.  Since then I have put somewhere around 1000 flawless rounds through it (did not keep an exact count).  It has been cleaned and oiled after every trip to the range.  It does have an idot scratch (my first 1911) and faint stain in the checkering on the housing.

Offering at $2400 which is a $500 savings over retail/pricing for a new gun in this model either directly from Ed Brown or from other online sellers (possibly more if you include potential costs for shipping, FFL, taxes).

Also included are an extra set of Timber Smith Grips (does come with original grips), 1 Ed Brown 7 round mag, 2 Chip McCormick 10 round power mags and the Ed Brown soft case.  
The extra grips and extra 2 mags are worth around $100, adding even more savings over the cost of purchasing new.

Please no lowballs or offers to trade.  I am only listing to put some money into another project, if there are no reasonable offers to purchase the other project will wait.
Local FTF sales only at this time, must be willing to show Ohio ID and sign Bill of Sale.  If there is no local interest I may list on auction at a later date."

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

Diamondback Riflescopes

Diamondback riflescopes completely change the rules when it comes to “you get what you pay for.” First, the solid one-piece aircraft-grade aluminum alloy construction makes them virtually indestructible and highly resistant to magnum recoil. Argon purging puts waterproof and fog proof performance on the checklist and the advanced, fully multi-coated optics raise an eyebrow when crystal clear, tack-sharp images appear in the crosshairs. All this and then some in a riflescope that seems like it should cost so much more—but doesn’t.

Shows signs of use, shoots and groups great, great modern 9mm, very rare..
Accepts Beretta and Taurus mags..

The Polish MAG 98 9mm /9x19 NATO caliber pistol is an improved variation of the original Polish MAG95. 
It was produced for the Polish Special Forces, Border Guard and Prison Guard in the 1990's. 
Made in the Z.M. Lucznik factory 11 at Radom Poland. 

These fine pistols feature a ambidextrous decocker safety, steel slide, alloy frame, and serrated trigger guard front strap.
In 1996 the Mag 98 was evaluated for adoption purposes by the Polish Army. It had advantages over its competition such as 
better reliability, durability and safety (better protection against accidental discharge, when dropped). 

Although the quality was deemed superior, the MAG 98 was rejected by the Army because the frame was slightly larger
than the contract qualifications called for. That was a shame because most service members prefered it and in fact 
the pistol has a good reputation among users: It is considered a precise, well balanced and durable weapon 
and its mass leads to good stability during firing. 

This double/single action pistol comes with ONE 15rd magazine."

I thought long and hard about purchasing precious metals and finally came upon the realization that the only metal worth the investment in these turbulent times is brass.

*indicates ammunition available immediately, others can be ordered and will arrive in a week or so.

All ammo is cheap stuff, either steel casings or mil-surplus, most is non-corrosive (I think the 30-06 and 7.62x54R is the only corrosive ammo, oh maybe the 8mm's too). If you have any requests for another caliber I don't have or would like 'more premium' ammunition feel free to make a request, I have access to all sorts of stuff, though I don't have much of a discount.

I'm aware pricing is not ideal, however it is in stock, and I can get much, much more (unlike most retailers these days). I'm only trying to make a few extra bucks so I can continue to invest in brass, and continue to supply our citizens with ammo. I'm using the profits to start up an alternative news website for my own personal investigative journalistic activities for the upstate NY region. So the slightly inflated pricing is funding a local movement for truth... if you're into that kinda thing..... or gave the slightest bit of a f'ck to read my long winded message."

This rifle comes with the superb 40X adjustable trigger, 1/12 twist, stainless 20 inch barrel with LTR fluting, it is coated with Remingtons ION Bonded factory coating that is impervious to adverse weather conditions.  This rifle is a .50moa shooter with Hornady match 168 grain ammunition at 100 yards.  I have not had time to handload for this rifle, but I believe it could easily get below .50moa with handloaded Berger bullets.  It has been fired exactly 120 rounds and has had a light break in (Email or call for details).  If I didn't fall on hard times, I would not be selling this rifle and I will not take less than my asking price because it is more than fair.  I will ship free of charge to the lower 48.  I will only ship to a valid FFL, so if your interested in this MINT condition shooter please call, text or email John REDACTED  I can only upload two pics because I can't seem to reduce the picture size?  If you want or need more photos just contact me.  Also, I'm sorry but the bipod is not included. Thank you and God Bless our troops!"

The original nickel finish comes in at about 50% with a nice even patina. The pictures look like rust but there is no rust on this pistol. According to the serial number it is a .38 double action 2nd model. These were made between 1880 and 1884 with 115000 manufactured it has a 5 digit SN which puts it around 1882 or 3. It sports what I believe is probably original S&W walnut target stocks, they are a sound tight fit and obviously have been on the gun for a long time. The gun however does not have the adjustable sights which are very rare and didn’t come out until the third model. However the grips were available for the 2nd model. It is a very comfortable balanced revolver. The bore is immaculate as are the chambers with no corrosion or pitting present(how often do you see that!) The timing and lock up are right and tight and rock solid. The recoil plate shows very little signs of use as  does the front of the cylinder. I don’t believe this revolver has been shot much if at all in it’s 130 years of life. The mechanics on this little guy are better than many modern revolvers."
