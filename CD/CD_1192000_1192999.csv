-No trades unless you have 1,150 rounds of .40 S&W FMJ new brass (all identical brand, no preference). That's equivalent to $24.61 per box of .40 cal FMJ which is what it's going for right now after tax. That's highly unlikely you have that, but that's what I'll be using the $575 for.

I bought this new less than a month ago and it's in pristine same as new condition. I did fire a box of shells to test function and it ran perfectly with zero malfunctions. Great little gun just kinda small for me and I really need a rifle more than another handgun. As you know these aren't cheap or easy to find so I'm not gonna trade for anything worth less than I have in this package. It comes with the original box, all paperwork, 1 6 round flush mag, and all contents in the box. I bought an additional 7 round extended mag and a Desantis Nemesis pocket holster that comes with it. It has siglite night sights on the rear and a Truglo TFO night sight on the front. It came with these sights. Like I said it's all in perfect condition. Total I have in this is about $850 so that's the trade value. I'll try to post pics tonight. Looking to trade for an Ar 15, Ak 47, or Keltec sub 2000 in 9mm Glock configuration. Not gonna trade for a Wasr 10 or Keltec without some extras though. I'm not getting into this whole everything is worth twice as much now as it was 3 months ago thing!! Lol.. Here's a link to Sig's website till I get some pics up. May consider some full size 9mm's or 45's in handguns but really needing a rifle.

Each knife features precision made parts with a stiff spring and Cold Steel's Tri-Ad lock mechanism which is arguably the strongest, most reliable, low maintenance lock in the world! 
The thick, extra wide blades are made from Japanese AUS 8A steel and meticulously ground to a thin edge for maximum shearing potential. This thin edge also allows us to hone each blade to astounding sharpness. And, because of the high carbon content of the steel, and their near perfect heat treatment, you'll find this sharpness last a surprisingly long time. 
The Voyager Series also offers all the other latest refinements in lock-back construction including lightning quick, one-handed opening, state of the art mechanical fasteners, massively oversized pivot pins that are fully adjustable and properly hardened, and dual stainless steel pocket clips for ambidextrous carry and deployment. 
The Grivory handles feature 6061 heat treated aluminum liners for the utmost in strength and stiffness and are ergonomically designed to afford a wide array of grip options including the palm reinforced forward grip for which they are particularly well suited. 
Grivory is unparalleled as a handle material as it is considerably stronger than Zytel and, when deeply textured, offers a terrific non-slip grip. As an added bonus, it's impervious to moisture and won't crack, warp or shrink and remains remarkably resistant to abrasion or discoloration. 
As tools these lightweight, super sharp knives are appropriate in almost any environment from hunting and camping to hiking and general utility chores. They can also readily fill specialty functions such as a boat or river knife, chute knife or police/military and survival/rescue applications.

It's ideal for hunting, fishing or camping trips, and makes an efficient utility knife as well!
The German 4116 Stainless blade is hollow ground and given an Rc hardness of 56-57, so it will hold a good edge and is easy to re-sharpen. Its blade shape is centuries old and practical because of its good sturdy point for piercing and long belly for skinning, cutting and carving. It's big and strong enough to skin a Moose, yet thin and delicate enough to slice a tomato or cut up an apple.
The Finn Bear has a straight handle with a slightly ribbed texture for traction. Its modified diamond cross section will fit your hand like a glove and accommodate a wide variety of gripping methods. It's made of tough Polypropylene, so it's impervious to the elements and won't swell, shrink, rot or crack.
For safety and convenience, the Finn Bear comes with a deep pouch style Cor-Ex sheath and generously sized belt loop so it can be worn on the waist, slung around the neck or tossed into a duffle bag or tackle box.

Awesome home defense weapon holing 30 rounds with fiber optic sights.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

740,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1192740,For Sale:  Spyderco Caly 3.5 ZDP Folding Knife,"Oshkosh, Wisconsin, United States",$ 170,"Listed On: Monday, March 4, 2013",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Spyderco has several knife designs that remain steadfast year after year. What keeps people buying them over decades is their basic function but also that they’re upgraded or refreshed with new technology and materials when they become available. A prolific design in Spyderco’s line is the Calypso.
Its arrival over a decade ago as a mid-sized folder has spurned numerous variations and converted legions of knife buyers to the benefits of flat-ground, thick leaf-shaped blades. This is a workingman’s or woman’s folder founded on the premise that a comfortable, usable pocket knife is one that feels like a natural extension of your hand.
A larger, newer Bionic version of the original Calypso Jr. is the Caly3.5. The latest Calypso progeny has a three and a half inch VG-10 leaf-shaped blade that is thick at the tang, then tapering to a tip. The cutting edge is flat-ground and thin for precision and receptive cutting. Ergonomics and control were taken into the designs’ consideration and where handle and blade meet is a substantial finger choil. This is the spot where the index finger settles ergonomically leading the thumb to naturally position itself directly above on the blade’s spine. Also the spine is textured with slip resistant jimping making the knife feels like part of the hand with no sliding forward or backward while cutting. The handle has a mid-positioned back lock and a low profile wire clip, holding the folder deeply in a pocket facing tip-up.

The new Sprint Run “R” variant instead, has a solid blade and handle.
The blade is full-flat ground VG-10 steel with jimping perched behind the round hole on the spine, and again on the bottom finger choil, to enhance both grip and control. The back lock handle is built with skeletonized steel liners and feature Japanese Nishijin glass fiber scales. The name Nishijin references a specific weave pattern, used in the production of silk Kimono cloth. It is manufactured by weaving glass fibers (thinner than a human hair), together in a geometric pattern and then impregnating the fibers into polymer base. The outcome is a lightweight, ultra-strong handle material that has an attractive three dimension appearance.

During the Korean War-era National Armory level rebuild program, SA-52 rebuild, this WWII sniper rifle , serial #359xxxx, was rebuilt,  and returned to regular M1 configuration, though the holes on the left side of the receiver for the screws and pins that hold the bracket are clearly visible. Finish is original. Chamber is in the white. The Muzzle Wear, or MW of this rifle is near new, just over 2, indicating this was not fired much. Barrel is dated 1-53, correct for the SA-52 rebuild timeframe which ran from approximately from July '51 to June '53. Barrel is marked correctly, SA D6535448, with date of 1 53. Wood is nice USGI walnut. Has serifed firing proof 'P' and 1/2"" DAS cartouche strongly present. Operating Rod is marked D35382. Bolt is 2828712-SA, with heat lot code of W10B.

This PTR Classic Wood model comes with an original HK wood stock and forearm just like the early G3 versions. These Classic Wood models are really unique!

This model also features a match grade HK profile target barrel but more importantly a HK spec chamber......this means you can feed this rifle everything from clean American made ammo to dirty foreign made military surplus ammo with primer and bullet crimp sealers. Long story short, this rifle will be more reliable!

This rifle also has an original HK pre-ban flash hider, drum style fully adjustable rear sight, Navy type polymer trigger group, and 18"" match grade barrel. Comes with a nice hard case, all factory paperwork including manual, and gun lock.
