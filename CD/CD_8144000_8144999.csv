This is a rare WWI colt 1911 from 1918 including original leather holster and magazine holder and web belt and nice reproduction kraft box and manual dated April 1, 1912.  The screwdriver tool is real for the period as well and rare.  Also includes a really nice original plastic pouch which they came on and 2 original half dipped magazines.This is a beautiful example of a mid 1918 production. The serial number dated to the first two weeks of production in June 1918 and the combination of finish along with a mix of new and old style parts gives the glimpse into production a colt during a very brief window in time. Many production shortcuts were implemented in 1918 and this pistol show some of them. It was built in the transitional period. It has the hurried black finish and retains more finish the many from that timeframe. The slide with rampant colt logo moved  from the rear to the center and was fully implemented only a month before. It’s still correctly wears the earlier thumb safety. They were changed some months later. This does not have the heart shaped grip frame cut outs. They came a bit late also. The left grip is the late war style with 13 rows of checkering between the large diamonds in the right grip is the earlier style with 15 rows.

I don't absolutely need to get rid of them so if they are still around in a few weeks I'll just keep them. That being said, I know that there are people out there that would like to get their hands on these so here they are. I don't have great pictures so if you're interested just shoot me a text and I'll take some better ones when I get a chance. From top to bottom:Norinco SKS Model M Sporter. These are pretty rare and take AK-47 magazines from the factory. I thought about keeping this gun and running it with a folding stock and Ak magazine. This would give it the practicallity and lightness of an AK with the accuracy of an SKS. The SKS also has a milled receiver which a lot of AK's don't have. If I don't sell it soon I might still follow through with this plan. This gun appears to be new in box. I've never shot it and it comes with the sling and the 10 round detachable magazine. Asking $700 or best offer/tradeRemington 1100 in 20 Gauge. This gun is a bit older and is in great shape. I believe it to be a 1973 production date and I also think it is the Heavy Frame that is so wildy loved by skeet shooters. I checked the serial number and it has the X at the end which signifies a heavy frame. Has a few little wear marks here and there as it was used occasionally, but no signs of abuse or hard use. I can't remember the length of barrel but I do know that it is the full choke model. This was made back when the Remington brand stood for high quality. This is not always the case nowadays. I'm going to continue to research this one to see what it's worth. If you have a value in mind throw it at me or offer me something to trade.Norinco SKSThis thing is brand new and still in the cosmoline. I don't think it's ever been shot. Has no real wear marks that I can find and is in excellent shape for a gun that was shipped here 25 years ago in crates. This is actually one of the very nicest SKS's i've ever seen, and I have had a few others. I don't think you could find a nicer SKS online for under $500. I'm asking $450 or would consider some trades.Last gun that I'm considering trading or selling is a CVA Missouri .50 Caliber Black Powder Rifle. Works great. No issues. Functions Flawlessly. It's a cool mess around gun to take to the range every now and then. I've even considered deer hunting with it, just never took the time to actually take it out and hunt with it. Price is $160. It won't let me fit this many pictures so if you're interested in this one, let me know and I'll send you some.Text is best way to reach me as I work most days. Willing to group things together in trades and trade up or down depending on what you have. Cash works as well. My phone number is REDACTED. I like oddball guns and also practical stuff so just let me know what you have. I have been looking for an M&P Shield lately in 9mm. If you have one we can maybe work something out.Thanks for looking."
