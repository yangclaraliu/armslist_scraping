Colt LE6900 is a semi-automatic light carbine that is chambered for the 5.56x45mm NATO and .223 Remington cartridges. As expected, it utilizes a direct impingement operation system alongside a rotating bolt – just like the famed Colt M4 carbine on which it is based. In addition to the typical six-position telescoping stock, a feature characteristic of the M4, the LE6900 adds a forged aluminum hand guard that has been factory drilled and tapped to allow the attachment of rails. Additionally, the LE6900 features a receiver-length MIL-STD 1913 rail. Each LE6900 includes a single 30-round Magpul PMAG® magazine.

Whether you are buying your first AR rifle, or need an affordable yet accurate plinking gun, the Panther Oracle is for you. Built to bridge the gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets, this introductory level carbine features a 16' light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with Picatinny Rail, heat dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible, six-position Pardus buttstock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs. The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice on the Picatinny Rail. The 16"" barrel, although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. The Pardus stock makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter.

It's a standard black, 5+1 capacity, in good condition with some standard wear on the magazine from the slide, and two isolated scratches on the top part of the receiver, as seen in the photo. The gun has always been kept oiled and lubed, inside and out, and only dry fired with snap caps.

The gun will come with two barrels: 18.5 inch ""home defense"" style barrel, and a 28 inch modified choke with vented ribs. The 28 inch barrel has the aftermarket lug that is required for a sling (and I'll give you the parts so you can switch it back with the original lug, which is also included).
The barrels are a cinch to change, taking no more than a minute to switch one out for the other.

You'll also get a black sling, 2 A-zoom aluminum snap caps, and the ammo that I have on hand, which amounts to 15 Winchester milspec 00 buckshot, and 20 rifled slugs.

Dropped my asking price to $325 for the package, but reasonable offers will be entertained. 

Though I am mainly trying to sell this for bills, I may be interested in trading for a .22lr rifle of some sort, with cash added or subtracted on either side for a good trade.

Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.

The 1911 in .22 caliber connects original design with an innovating concept. On one hand Sig stuck to existing design and measurements, this means a development with “Mil-Spec” specifications in inches. On the other hand Sig added additionally the magazine safety, drop safety and firing pin safety to meet present safety standard. 

Gun is super clean and has everything that came in box when bought. 

Should only use high velocity ammo and has no FTF FTE. Many of this guns have gone over 10k rounds with no issues. Youtube has video of one sot 30k rounds, so this gun is a quality gun build to last. 

Great gun to train with since 22lr is much much cheaper the 45acp. I will also include 3 dummy rounds for dry fires and practice."

294,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1589294,For Sale:  Serbu Super Shorty Remington 12ga.,"Oklahoma City, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma","$ 1,000","Listed On: Tuesday, May 21, 2013",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"$1000 for the whole package.

As much as I rather not have to sell this my wife had surgery and I'm stuck with a $3k deductible, so I figured this would help ease the hit since I don't have it actually in my hands (being held at my Class III dealer in OKC until stamp arrives).

It's about a $1200 package I am selling for the price of just a new Serbu Shorty in Remington $1000. It is a Serbu Super Shorty built on the Remington platform and holds 2+1 (brand new in box). I paid to have it transferred from Washington State to Sooner State Pawn Class III Dealer in January then started the class 3 process (would have the stamp in about Sept.). Meanwhile I bought a pelican type case with pick and pluck foam, a SBE Machined follower, and ATI recoil absorbing pistol grip and foregrip. I also will include a bore snake, and other unused 12ga. cleaning tools I bought specifically for this setup. Unfortunately Serbu raised their prices in December on the Rem to $975 +$25 shipping (bought this in January). I am an individual so no tax. 

This is a Class 3 weapon, but is an AOW, so it only has a $5 tax stamp. Same wait time and process, just cheaper stamp. Plus no tax and probably $200 in accessories (hard case, machined follower, ATI Grip, fore grip, and all the 12ga. cleaning tools seen (everything unused). I have called the ATF to verify transfer. All that needs to be done is to have the Class 3 holding dealer cancel the my application and start a new one for the new owner.

$1000 cash NO trades considered due to situation.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SERBU SUPER SHORTY REMINGTON 870 6.5"", 12GA. SHOTGUN. REGISTERED AS AN ANY OTHER WEAPON, AOW $5 tax 

The SHORTEST 12-gauge pump shotgun available. The baddest entry/breeching gun on earth. 

The SUPER-SHORTY its a miniuture Remington 870 on steroids 12-gauge shotgun which came from the factory with a pistol grip. 

Because of this, the SUPER-SHORTY is considered an AOW (Any Other Weapon) and can be transferred with a $5 stamp! The gun holds two 2-3/4"" or 3"" shells in the magazine, plus one in the chamber. The 16.5"" overall length, 6.5"" barrel and spring-locked foregrip, which pivots out of the way when not in use, make for a very compact package. As far as we know, this is the shortest 12-gauge pump shotgun available. 

All parts for the SUPER-SHORTY are made in-house on Serbu's own CNC machinery using materials ideally suited to the task. All welds are done by the TIG process, and the manganese phosphate finish is MIL-spec. The SUPER-SHORTY is currently being used by various law enforcement agencies and military units worldwide. 

If you like the idea of concealed carry with a 12-gauge, or like a lot of ""bang"" in a small package, or just want the most compact breaching weapon available, then this is the gun for you. You won't find a better made AOW pump shotgun than the SUPER-SHORTY!

This is a great shooting and great looking gun that I hate to let go of, but I am a sheriff's deputy and I am not allowed to carry a 1911 at work. I need to trade it for a gun in 9mm, or 40cal that has a MINIMUM of 3 magazines. If it has a hammer it needs to have a safety decocker for me to be able to carry it.

This scope kit is designed to specifically fit the following Henry rimfire lever and pump action rifles models:  H001, H001L, H001Y, H001M, H001V, H001T, H001TM, H001TV, H003T and H003TM. 

This scope kit DOES NOT FIT the Henry Golden Boy series which require a special barrel mount available from Henry Repeating Arms Company.

The RANGE FINDER reticle on this scope can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your rifle in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

We test a variety of scope and mount combinations on RIFLES until we find a scope package that works best for a particular rifle and application - and this is an excellent fixed 4X power lightweight mini-scope and mounting system for your Henry rimfire rifle.

The barrel is Milled to make it lighter they call it a pencil barrel. The pistol grip had some rub wear on it. 
The Springfield is the v-10 ported harder to find. And it's bnib never fired (except at the factory) it comes with all the xd gear.  And I can add a Stevens model 320 shotgun there's something wrong with the tube some piece of medal is sticking out preventing the shells to go in but I'm no gunsmith so might be an easy fix its never been shot. 
Really looking to sell but may trade just let me know what you have. 
I'm a little flexible on the price but not much and may add some ammo if you give me asking price. It wouldn't be much though..can send more pictures upon request.
