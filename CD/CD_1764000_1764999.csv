Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

 Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

 The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
 The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

I purchased it new so I am the original owner and it has been well taken care of (only used it to mow my yard). I have followed the scheduled maintenance since I bought it new. I have only used Cub Cadet filters and FULL Synthetic Quaker State since the first oil change. Everything works very well and the engine still runs strong (it has never used any oil which is rare on a small engine). It has been a good solid mower for me I just decided to step up to a newer mower with a larger 60"" deck. It is a used mower so it has the normal wear and tear. However it is good condition and I have taken care of it. The hydrostats work well but I guess it is a tad slower than it was when new (to be expected). Still a speedy mower for sure. Here is the basic specs for the mower:

Cub Cadet Zero Turn (RZT) Mower 
22 HP Briggs & Stratton V-Twin Intek
50 inch mowing deck
331 hours (it has the digital read hour display)
Blades are 1 year old (Cub Cadet Blades)
Good Tires

You are obviously more than welcome to test drive it first, you can mow my entire yard if you want . Will take cash or trade for firearms. I'm pretty open for now on gun trades as long as they are quality firearms. I may consider a bow but would prefer guns or cash. 
$1000 value cash/trade (Firm). I think this is a very fair price and is much lower than anything I have seen.  I have my CCH for any trades etc.  Thank you for looking!"

They don't make them like this anymore. This gun was made in December 1995 - not strictly speaking a pre-ban but made before they stopped using USGI parts. Originally it did not have a USGI flash hider with bayonet lug - but it does now.

Also, it was a special model (forget the exact model number) but it was refered to as the GI Collector edition. Aside from USGI parts it came with a collector quality USGI walnut stock. The pictures don't do justice as the stock has a beautiful grain to it - and perfect Defense Acceptance Stamp and P cartouches.

It was imported by FIME in Las Vegas, NV, which is the exclusive U.S. importer for Izhmash.  In other words, it's no fake or knockoff version.  It is fully legal for ownership in the USA and I have all the original paperwork that came with the shotgun which is proof of this.  I am the original and only owner.  The gun has just 75-80 light-load rounds through it, which is just what it took to dial in the variable setting gas valve (see video link below).  All Saiga 12 shotguns come from the factory only able to cycle high brass, heavy-load shotgun cartridges.  This weapon has been upgraded to cycle all shotgun cartridge loads, making it dirt cheap to shoot and super reliable.

This shotgun's configuration:

•Carolina Shooter's Supply Saiga 12 Reliability Kit installed (lightweight recoil spring and performance grade gas puck)

•TAC-47 Autoplug, automatically regulates gas into the piston tube based on the cartridge load with no operator intervention required)

•Hogue pistol grip

•Picatinny 1913 mil-spec top rail attachment (quick detach) for optics

•Extended, ambidextrous magazine release

•Threaded barrel protector cap

FAILZERO tactical weapon upgrade parts are treated with UCT Coatings' patented, military-proven EXO Technology. This unique, breakthrough technology creates a permanently lubricious surface, harder than the substrate itself, which eliminates the need for grease, oil, or any wet lubrication for the life of the weapon. Unlike films, conventional coatings and applied lubricants, it will never rub off, never flake off, never build up crud. EXO Technology eliminates wet-lubrication failures of critical components, giving you an ""active weapon advantage"" under all conditions.

Proven by DoD tests, SWAT teams, tactical experts.

The patented EXOTM Technology used in FAILZERO upgrades has been thoroughly tested and proven effective by UCT Coatings - developer of EXO Technology - and by the U.S. Department of Defense. Test results include:

50,000 lube-free rounds on AR-15s.
15,000 lube-free rounds on M9 pistols.

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our 

opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the 

successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds 

an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. 

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" 

capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series 

senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by 

resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do 

anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better 

chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will 

automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, 

simply manually recharge and keep going.

Every gunsmith knows that proper use of a headspace gage is the most reliable way to test the length of a rifle chamber. ""Headspace"" is the distance between the face of the breech and the base of the cartridge when the action is closed, and excessive headspace can be dangerous as well as impair accuracy. For instance, unsupported brass fired in a rifle action with excessive headspace can rupture, allowing gas to blow rearward like a rocket exhaust. Because your safety is on the line, Forster Headspace Gages are made with painstaking care and exacting manufacturing standards to ensure accurate testing of your rifle's chamber. If a rifle closes on a GO gage, the rifle chamber will accept any ammunition that is made within S.A.A.M.I. (industry standard) specifications. If a rifle closes on a NO GO gage, the rifle chamber might have excessive headspace. Most gunsmiths chamber a rifle's headspace between the GO and NO GO dimensions. If a rifle closes on a FIELD gage, the rifle chamber is dangerously close to or already over the S.A.A.M.I. specified maximum chamber size.

The blueing is worn but when I went to have it reblued the gunsmith advised against due to it would reduce the value of the revolver.

Pistol Two 15 Round Mags With Lifetime Warranty





Factory New


This is a brand new Taurus PT840 Semi Auto 40ACP 

Double Action Handgun.

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our 

opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the 

successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds 

an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. 

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" 

capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series 

senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by 

resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do 

anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better 

chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will 

automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, 

simply manually recharge and keep going.

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges. Based on the full size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in
trigger reach and grip circumference increases conceal ability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semi-automatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot  two finger grip frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full hand grip frame.  Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate and highly concealable pistol. Variant 1 Double action/single action with ""SAFE  position. Control lever (manual safety/decoking lever) on left side of frame.

Great little shooter designed to carry well. 95% finish, 200-300 round count. Selling this to fund another purchase, so no trades. $1300 firm. FTF transaction near Charlotte, permit and bill of sale. 

This is what the CZ site says about the pistol
Concealed Carry Officer. This model is built as a classic CCO, with a Commander slide on top of an Officer frame. This combination provides the control and reliability of the Commander with the easy concealment of the Officer frame. With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP in the two provided 7 round flush base magazines, you won’t feel under-gunned.

To make it more comfortable and make it disappear even easier while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce the overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. To help control recoil, we included an undercut trigger guard and our new “Chain Link” pattern on the front strap and mainspring housing. The slide and small parts are coated in the same “Duty” finish that we use on the Valor. Like all of our night-sight models, you will find dual colored Tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration. The CCO wears a medium length trigger shoe to facilitate faster draws and a better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled Shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional."

This pistol is a licensed reproduction of the Beretta 92, and comes in a variety of finishes with a variety of grip styles.
Like the Beretta, the Taurus PT92 utilizes the open-slide design where the upper portion of the slide is cut away exposing much of the barrel itself. The original PT92 was exactly like the original Beretta 92, though it was also unusual for the time in that it featured a squared trigger guard for supporting the index finger of the opposite hand while firing, a feature which was subsequently introduced to the Beretta 92 with the 92SB-F (92F) model in 1985. The Taurus PT92 is less expensive than the Beretta 92 in most cases."

CCI/SPEER GOLD DOT HANDGUN CENTERFIRE AMMUNTIONSpeer 45 ACP 230 Grain Gold Dot Hollow Point Short BarrelThis ammo is recommended for short barrel guns.A patented process forms the hollow point cavity in two stages. The core is pre-fluted to define the ""fault"" lines of expansion, controlling final diameter and retained weight. The second process finishes the cavity and controls the rate of expansion. Select, clean burning propellants deliver optimum velocity while ensuring consistent chamber pressures. Non corrosive CCI primers are used for highly sensitive and reliable performance, as well as nickel plated brass cases for smooth feeding and durability. These technical features allow Speer's engineers to fine tune each specific caliber and bullet weight for maximum field performance.SPECIFICATIONS:Mfg Item Num: 23975 Category: AMMO CENTERFIRE Caliber :45 Automatic Colt Pistol (ACP)Bullet Type :Gold Dot Hollow PointBullet Weight :230 GRMuzzle Energy :343 ft lbsMuzzle Velocity :820 fpsRounds/box :20 Rounds Per Box"

The Silva 15T is the benchmark that compasses are compared against and is one of the best you can buy. It has a red lanyard with a screwdriver to adjust declination, a cover with a sighting mirror (for shooting an azimuth or for signalling) and a base with three rubber feet and two measuring scales for use with a map.

This one is an older model with all aluminum construction and the longer plastic plate....no scratches....like new! The users manual is dated 4-70 so this classic is about 43 years old now and is in perfect shape.
With new all-plastic Silva's going for 50 bucks without the leather case, this one is a real bargain. When these are available they usually fetch prices up to a hundred bucks WITHOUT the leather case!

The leather cases are over 12 bucks new alone....but as I said, this compass has a longer base so this case doesn't snap shut....but still protects it's contents.

Complete with original instructions, this beautiful compass can be yours for 50 bucks cash.

Both are used, but not abused. I carry and shoot my guns but clean and maintain them.

First off is my P229 Scorpion. This gun has closer to 700 rounds through it and it is a smooth shooting pistol. You name it, Sig included it in this gun. Short re-set trigger, night sights, rail, etc.

The Sig will come with three mags, the two standard and one extended I used at the range. I had a custom made carry holster done by Raven Concealment. It holds the gun tight to the body and distributes the weight well, all in all an excellent holster. I will throw in one box of .40 Hornady Critical Duty ammo. 

The price is $725.00 (I deal in cash and need to see ID from the purchaser. The price is firm and it's fair...so please don't try to bring it lower)

Second up is the FNX-9. I had a FNX-40 and love it, but realized I don't need them both. This gun has only had about 200 rounds through it and runs like a sewing machine. If you like 9mm, this is like a budget Sig. It is reliable and easy to shoot. It come with three mags, a Desantis IWB holster and a box of 9mm Hornady Critical Duty. 

It's priced at $475 (like the Sig, the price is fair and firm and I deal in cash and need to see  an ID from the purchaser)

Thanks for looking. I will be headed to the Bob and Rocco show in Waukesha with the guns today and tomorrow...but I'll be checking my email from my phone."

DHS is buying up 1.6 billion rounds (750 million .40 S&W) using our tax dollars borrowed from China, enough for a 100 year war in Afghanistan. Which is causing this shortage, along with insane gun restrictions. So ... before we even talk or shake hands you have to say:

Functions good but has the wrong firing pin. 
These parts are available on ebay but a firing pin is not currently listed
The firing pin that is in the gun is a 25cal center fire pin turns out that is the problem
it will need a new firing pin spring too. I bought 2 at the pineville gun smith for a dollar or two  when I got the gun clipped the first one too short then the second one was just right but I did not at the time know about the center fire pin installed.
Anyway all the parts are clean and it will make a good gun once it has a spring and pin.
I paid 65 and I'll take 65 for it, no less.
These are supposed to be great guns and online collectors value is between 100 to 400 according to the experts, on 1 to 10 I would rate this a 8. no rust but wear is evident."

Functions good but has the wrong firing pin. 
These parts are available on ebay but a firing pin is not currently listed
The firing pin that is in the gun is a 25cal center fire pin turns out that is the problem
it will need a new firing pin spring too. I bought 2 at the pineville gun smith for a dollar or two  when I got the gun clipped the first one too short then the second one was just right but I did not at the time know about the center fire pin installed.
Anyway all the parts are clean and it will make a good gun once it has a spring and pin.
