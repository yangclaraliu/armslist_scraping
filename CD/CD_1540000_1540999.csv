Kestrel 4500NV w/ HORUS ATRAG Ballistics 

P/N: 0845HOLV (Olive Drab) & 0845HTAN (Desert Tan)

The Kestrel 4500 NV with Horus ATrag Ballistics combines Kestrel's flagship meter, the Kestrel 4500 with Night Vision, with Horus ATrag Ballistics software to bring you the first lightweight, hand-held tool to give you both comprehensive environmental data plus integrated aiming solutions. Kestrel Pocket Weather Meters and Horus Vision partnered to provide a powerful shooting tool that combines the critical environmental data and targeting software solutions required for precision shooting. The Kestrel 4500 NV with Horus ATrag Ballistics allows you to load, customize and store multiple guns, rounds and targets. Target parameters include distance, angle, longitude, speed, direction and wind. Kestrel's highly accurate measuring and averaging of wind together with built-in digital compass for target bearing and wind direction assists in defining the target winds. 

Pre-programmed Guns: This unit can be used with any combination of scope and reticle, here are several pre-programmed guns that come in each unit The Kestrel can measure in TMOA (true minute of angle), SMOA (shooter minute of angle), and MILs (milliradians). The unit displays ballistic tables with data of the shot extending out to various distances (see Range Card on page 17 and 18 in the manual). 

This Horus meter can provide ballistics solutions out to 4000 yards (or about 3700 meters). Once you’ve built the gun that you’ll be using (and you’re at the range of course), you need to enter the target range into the Kestrel, as well as the latitude (if you’re concerned about the coriolis effect), then either manually enter the wind or use the auto capture feature to capture the wind speed. Horus software that comes with the 4500 Atrag Ballistics is the civilian version. 

The military version of the Horus ATrag Ballistics software is only available via special GSA contract to officials with the correct security clearance. The software that ships with the Kestrel 4500 Horus ATrag is version 3.0. It is possible to upgrade the firmware as new versions become available, however it will need to be returned for firmware updates.

This carbine is in very good shape and retains all of the original early features including the very scarce ""High Wood"" folding stock, 2-position ""Flip Sight"", narrow barrel band, checkered safety, dog-leg hammer, etc. There are NO import markings and this IS NOT A RESTORATION. There are no punch marks in the rear sight dovetail, nor any wide band marks on the stock or barrel. The barrel date is 1-43 which is correct for the serial number (181178) and also correct for the high wood stock. The original finish shows some thinning, a few small pits to the left edge of the receiver along the wood line, and some light corrosion to the front and rear sights...but the overall appearance is very good. The stock is in very good shape with normal wear, dents, dings and scrapes. The mechanics are in perfect working order and the bore is excellent...bright with strong rifling and a muzzle erosion reading of about 1.4 (quite good). There is old grease and dried oil in this gun and I'm leaving it there for the enjoyment of the new owner. This gun had been sitting so long that the safety was actually frozen with dried oil when I got it, but has been freed up to work fine. Comes with a 15-round Type II magazine, original khaki sling (the sling is soiled and buckle is some sort of undersized replacement), and a ""US"" marked oiler.

FIREARM INFORMATION

The item up for sale is a Smith & Wesson 910 model .9mm semi-automatic handgun in very good condition. This version has the aluminum alloy slide and frame, making it one-of-a-kind on this site. The sale includes one (1) S&W factory 15-round magazine and gun sleeve. This firearm was originally purchased without a case or documentation, therefore they are not included in this sale. Visible blemishes include minor wear on the frame, slide, and barrel with minor-to-moderate wear on all sides of the grip. There is also a small chip on the frame portion of the grip below the trigger guard. Internally, this firearm is very clean and shows little-to-no wear. I would rate it at 90%. This item is being sold as-is with no manufacturer's warranty stated or otherwise implied. The sale of this firearm is final and returns WILL NOT be accepted under any circumstances so ask questions BEFORE committing to purchase.

The buyer will be responsible for paying his/her own transfer fee ONLY. Both parties must be in mutual agreement when planning to meet and transfer the firearm. Generally, weekends are better for me, but I can also make arrangements for weekdays after 5:00 PM. If either party MUST cancel the transfer, please notify each other at least 24 hours in advance.

The Smith & Wesson Model 910 is a full-sized, 9×19mm Parabellum (9mm Luger), short recoil operated, semi-automatic pistol that was introduced by Smith & Wesson in 1995. The Model 910 pistol features a double action/single action trigger and has a four-inch barrel, an aluminum alloy frame, and a slide-mounted de-cocking safety (similar to the one on the MIL-SPEC M9 Beretta pistol). The sighting system of the Model 910 consists of high visibility three-dot fixed sights. Both the 910 and its predecessor, the very similar S&W 915, are essentially budget-priced versions of Smith and Wesson's highly successful 59 series, full-sized double-action 9mm's with staggered-stack magazines.

I’m an IT professional with over thirty years experience that can fix just about any problem you might have with your PC. Sorry, PC only as I don’t subscribe to Apple. 
I’m hoping to trade for any 22LR ammo but here is a suggestion:
I can re-install your Windows (upgrade you from Vista to Windows 7 for example) and include Microsoft Office 2007 Pro as well as create an archive of your data. Have you backed up those pictures and videos you’ve been collecting for the last 4 years? Hard drives do fail. I’m willing to do this for 2 bricks of 22 lr. I do this sort of service on the side from time to time and usually get around $100. Everything is negotiable. If you only have a brick or two and need more than just a few hours work, or parts, we could negotiate a little cash as well. 
Many people here at work have brought me there home pc’s because their antivirus ran out last year and there are strange things going on, popping up and who knows what???
Anyway, I work in Lansing and live in Howell so I’m willing to meet anywhere in mid Michigan.
I know the ammo situation sucks right now, and I just can see paying 5 X the shelf price, but I’m willing to put in a little sweat equity just to be able to enjoy plinking in the backyard with the kids.

When I inspected the gun today, I found marks on both stock and barrel.  When I put the bore light into the barrel, it had obviously been fired before.  Scott did not have the warranty card, and you cannot get the 10-year warranty without that card.  (He claimed his son had the card, but again why not bring that along for a potential buyer.)"

I have a D-Technik VZ-58, beautiful assault rifle. many compare this weapon as a ak-47 ""look alike."" As I found out this is far than just a look alike, matter a fact some people believe it is better than an ak-47. It is smaller, milled, leighter, and a lil more accurate. This deal is also including 6 30rd mags and 120 rounds of ammo. the round is 7.62 x 39.. However the weapon is missing the rear sight assembly. this rear assembly is $40 online and i will deduct it from the price. there are also man mods for this weapon. so a rear sight isnt needed if you wanted to purchase a handrail with a red dot.

FIREARM INFORMATION

The item up for sale is a Smith & Wesson 910 model .9mm semi-automatic handgun in very good condition. This version has the aluminum alloy slide and frame, making it one-of-a-kind on this site. The sale includes one (1) S&W factory 15-round magazine and gun sleeve. This firearm was originally purchased without a case or documentation, therefore they are not included in this sale. Visible blemishes include minor wear on the frame, slide, and barrel with minor-to-moderate wear on all sides of the grip. There is also a small chip on the frame portion of the grip below the trigger guard. Internally, this firearm is very clean and shows little-to-no wear. I would rate it at 90%. This item is being sold as-is with no manufacturer's warranty stated or otherwise implied. The sale of this firearm is final and returns WILL NOT be accepted under any circumstances so ask questions BEFORE committing to purchase. I check my email often throughout the day and will usually respond within 12 hours. This is NOT my first time selling an item so you can buy with confidence. More details about this firearm are listed below.

Item will be shipped or transferred ONLY when payment has been deposited and cleared.

SHIPPING (IF NECESSARY)

The winning buyer assumes the cost of shipping for this item. Shipping cost is a flat rate of $25 sent via USPS priority mail + $5 optional insurance and will be sent by my FFL dealer in order to comply with applicable laws. Shipping cost will be added to the total price at the end of the auction. THIS ITEM CAN NOT AND WILL NOT BE SHIPPED TO A STATE WHERE IT IS ILLEGAL TO SHIP FIREARMS.

A copy of the your FFL dealer's license will need to be emailed or faxed to me or my FFL dealer prior to shipment. Item will be shipped when payment and FFL dealer requirements have been met.

TRANSFER
If the buyer is local and would like to meet in-person to transfer the firearm, the buyer and seller must mutually agree on the meeting place. Although transfer fees vary depending on the FFL dealer, one should be selected which is reasonably priced and situated in a centrally accessible location. The buyer will be responsible for paying his/her own transfer fee ONLY. Both parties must be in mutual agreement when planning to meet and transfer the firearm. Generally, weekends are better for me, but I can also make arrangements for weekdays after 5:00 PM. If either party MUST cancel the transfer, please notify each other at least 24 hours in advance.

The Smith & Wesson Model 910 is a full-sized, 9×19mm Parabellum (9mm Luger), short recoil operated, semi-automatic pistol that was introduced by Smith & Wesson in 1995. The Model 910 pistol features a double action/single action trigger and has a four-inch barrel, an aluminum alloy frame, and a slide-mounted de-cocking safety (similar to the one on the MIL-SPEC M9 Beretta pistol). The sighting system of the Model 910 consists of high visibility three-dot fixed sights. Both the 910 and its predecessor, the very similar S&W 915, are essentially budget-priced versions of Smith and Wesson's highly successful 59 series, full-sized double-action 9mm's with staggered-stack magazines.

This build was focused on functionality while still maintaining good looks. I did not want to add a ton of weight so in my opinion all the mods are well worth their weight to make the cut.

I also made a point to make this Draco as controllable as possible. I feel I have done well.

The recoil reduction and taming of the muzzle rise with the Muzzle break and Recoil buffer was the first step.

Next, I wanted to create a stable shooting platform. I combined the Magpul MS3 Sling along with the Magpul XTM Hand Stop to be able to apply enough forward pressure to really make the difference. While a buttstock will always be better, this setup is as good as you can get without one. It is Rock Steady.

Would be great if you did want to SBR it.

It is not an exaggeration that when I fire this off, everyone in the range comes to take a look."

Hi Point 340078 Rhino Chiappa Revolver Rhino 357 RemMag 2"" 6rd Black Grip Black

The Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design
that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The
Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the
key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel
lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in
line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability""
while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both
recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target
faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of
ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing
any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the
typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2""
to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose
handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking
game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single
action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed
hammer to prepare to fire.

ISSC M111006 M22 *CA Approved* 22LR 4"" 10+1 Desert Tan Poly Frame Black Slide

Designed for inexpensive, high velocity 22LR ammunition, the accurate
rapid-fire performance of the M22 offers the shooter an economical shortcut
for modern defensive pistol practice at the range. The M22 gives shooters
the opportunity to shoot with extreme accuracy due to the combination of a
match barrel, an extremely crisp, 4-lb. single-action trigger and a
windage-adjustable sight. The M22 pistol from ISSC has five safety
features: hammer drop-down, loaded chamber indicator, trigger safety tab,
magazine disconnect, and an external key-lock. It uses easy to load
10-round magazines in a lightweight polymer frame with an integral rail for
training with lights and lasers. These models are CA approved.
