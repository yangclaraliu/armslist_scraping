The Ideal AK47
	Arsenal Inc. one of the most renowned importers and manufactures of AK47's brings another excellent AK to the market. The SAM7R-61 is considered the top of the line AK47. It was Bulgarian made meaning that it is an exceptional AK47. The SAM7R-61 utilizes the hard hitting 7.62x39 round which can still be found in these tough times. The SAM7R-61 comes with a 4 port removable muzzle break to help mitigate the recoil of the large 7.62x39 round. This allows for greater accuracy on follow through shots. The muzzle break twists on a 14x1 left handed thread making it easy to add your own personal muzzle break. The SAM7R-61 is built on a milled receiver unlike most AK's being built on stamped receivers. Milled receivers add greater durability and heft to enhance accuracy for longer range shots. This will also significantly add longer life to your rifle. The rifle comes “optic ready.” Add a mount and run a variation of optics. The barrel is chrome lined and cold hammer forged making it durable and providing it with a greater life span. The AK47 is world renown for being durable, reliable, and easy to use. The AK47 is Piston Driven adding to the reliability of the weapon. It's easy to field strip and clean meaning it's a great firearm for any new shooting enthusiast. This rifle is easily accurate out to 400 to 500 meters. When you purchase this rifle from Live Fire Armory you are also provided with a Davidson’s Guaranteed Lifetime Replacement Policy. (Visit Link to website for more details on the policy)

Info from the manufacturer

From the combined effort of Legion Ltd, the custom shop of the legendary Izhmash Factory in Russia, and Arsenal,
Inc. of Las Vegas, Nevada comes a new SGL21 (Saiga) rifle in 7.62x39 caliber. Initially manufactured by Legion Ltd
in Russia and remanufactured by Arsenal, Inc. in the United States, the new SGL21 rifle has everything that
collectors and shooter have been looking for. Hand-select premium components, custom-shop-like attention to
details by Legion Ltd, and Arsenal, Inc.’s highest standards of workmanship, give this rifle its superior quality.
Arsenal, Inc. remanufactures the SGL21 rifles in the United States with 922r compliant parts and fills them with
features not seen on any other factory Saiga rifles. Performing the most difficult modifications to achieve, Arsenal,
Inc. has done a substantial work for the customer. The end result is the highest quality SGL21 rifle with the most
desired features which have not been available before. Every unit is laser sighted and test fired.
To make this rifle the perfect Russian AK available in the market, Arsenal, Inc. has taken all the necessary steps to
ensure all the components and features are true to its original configuration.
The receiver of SGL21 rifle has the proper markings on both sides without any extra commercial markings,
including the legendary Izhmash Factory logo, the upward pointing arrow in triangle. The markings on both sides of
the receiver are done with the correct font type and size and placed in their proper locations. The receiver of
SGL21 features proper magazine dimples on both sides and original “X” and “Y” shaped reinforcement stampings.
On the right side, it has correctly positioned notches for the safety lever, marked with letters “S” and “F” and no
additional openings at the bottom forward portion of the receiver.
The components and features on the new SGL21 rifle resemble true Russian AK rifle, including the safety lever with
correct shape and properly positioned dimple, the correct trigger guard with magazine catch and the correct bullet
guide enabling SGL21 to accept any standard AK magazine, the 1000 meter rear sight leaf, the highest quality
Arsenal, Inc. double stage fire control group (hammer, trigger and disconnector), original Arsenal, Inc. mil-spec
polymer furniture, including the handguards, pistol grip, and the original Warsaw pact length buttstock, the retainer
for lower handguard, the correct gas tube, original gas block with the correct vent holes, a guide hole for the cleaning
rod and accessory lug, correct AK-74 type front sight block with 24x1.5mm right-hand threads and bayonet lug.

The quality comes from the true custom RUSSIAN STYLE Kalashnikov! and almost 100 years of workmanship and experience. All of this together creates a mil-spec rifle that is strong, accurate and will last multiple lifetimes.

Description

These Amazing CHF barrels are extremely durable with a 20,000+ round service life. These CHF barrels are turned to ST's New Optimum barrel Profile. This New profile is lighter than government profile but beefier than a lightweight profile, it's an ""Optimum"" profile. It weighs 26.4oz with M4 Barrel extension and no FSB on the 16"" Barrel. The barrels have a .750"" gas block seat with a properly sized gas port and the muzzle is threaded perfectly concentric to the Bore with 1/2x28 threads. These CHF barrels are made to the Mil-Spec for the M249 SAW. The Cold Hammer Forging process Work Hardens the steel around a rifled mandrel, which creates the lands and grooves. These barrels are chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 Twist Rate. The barrel blanks are the correct Certified CMV material and they are also Hard Chrome lined to the M249 SAW Mil-Spec, which is almost twice as thick as the Hard Chrome on a Mil-Spec M4. The End Result is a Rifle that can be Run Hard Day after Day! Each barrel is HPT and MPI. They have Mil-Spec M4 barrel extensions, Mil-Spec Phosphate finish on the outside (under the front sight base as well).

Dude I got it from said he did not shoot it but it might stick a little on eject (this is documented as a common issue). I found an online pdf of the manual that I printed and will give too. For the right deal I could add a little ammo too.

Take a look do your research and if you're interested then I've got one for sale. They do look cool I have to admit. I offered too much for it in a trade to get the rest of the items in the trade, so I'm going to take a bath on this. So my ignorance is your gain and at least I can free up some floor space in the gun safe and put the ammo in there (since it's worth more than the guns now!).

My name is Brad, see actual photos, you can text me first at REDACTED. I live in Arnold and work in Creve Coeur. Cash is king, possible trades considered, let me know what interests you.

I'm listing this gun at a sell fast price (with the two clips and case) and is over a hundred less than I foolishly paid for it (but the guy I bought it from on Armslist was a nice dude - so it was fun).

Senate just defeated background checks, magazine capacity bans, etc, with those all failing, no ban will be voted in.

I have seen ARs as cheap as $750 sold on gunbroker.com, SKS going for $375, AK-47 for $799. Sellers on gunbroker have realized their high asking price days are at an end. Even after shipping, transfer fees, etc. you will pay HUNDREDS less than people here are asking. If you buy from gougers, you are part of the problem. Offer them a fair price, if they refuse, flag them for over-priced items. Happy Shopping!

Important factors one should consider when shopping for a class/instructor:

- Low cost does not mean high quality training.

- Do not go with the shortest class for your patience and availability.

- Distance is a small factor when it comes to taking an educational course.

- Call the instructor of the class you are considering and ask questions regarding what he/she offers in order to determine whether they will provide the information and necessities you are looking for in the class.
