$378 seems like a fairly high price for this gun being a few years old, and without ammo, so I think $310 cash or trade value would be better.

For both, I'm hoping for a cash or trade value of $1,075, which can be negotiable, to some extent.

I'm always on the lookout for good deals on ammo and accessories, so I may be adding more to what I have.

I have no need to sell, so trade is preffered.

All items were signed in person for my personal collection. My house is full of Alabama memorabilia. Only a few items I've purchased from COA venders in Tuscaloosa that come with COA. Most items I have do not come with COA. I didn't need them since I watched the players sign for my collection. Tell me what your looking for because I have a ton. Can send pics via text"

They are brand new, never installed. I'm open to offers, but please no low-ball offers. I know what the availability on these is, and I know what they go for elsewhere, so keep that in mind as you make your offer. I am open to shipping, if you pay in advance via PayPal. Shipping will cost you $10. I will not drive outside of the Lansing area to deliver. These are mil-spec threaded, so they may not work if you want to install on a commercial-threaded lower. I will not ship these outside of Michigan.

From the manufacturer:

Are you looking to upgrade your AR stock to the next level?  If so, look no further than our new Mil-Spec AR T6™ Stock.  The 6 position adjustable stock allows you to fit the rifle to your needs and has been built to meet all military specifications.  Our extension tube is second to none and just like the stock body, meets all military requirements.  What does this mean for you?  First and foremost, you get the best possible fit between the stock body and the tube, cancelling any rattle that might occur with cheaper stocks.  Secondly, the tube is crafted from the same aluminum that most AR receivers are made from, ensuring a much stronger part.  Each tube also has its threads rolled on as opposed to having them “cut” into the metal like most other extension tubes today.  Lastly, the inside of the tube has been coated with a Mil-Spec dry film lubricant that not only keeps the action quieter, but reduces metal-on-metal contact, extending the service life of your buffer.  Throw in a grit blasted finish which enables our tube to have a non-reflective surface, and you have the best Mil-Spec extension tube on the market.  Oh, and did we mention the tube is 100% made in the USA?  We have pulled out all the stops to create and craft the best Mil-Spec AR stock on the market.  You know it’s time to upgrade your AR and the only place to start is with the INTRAFUSE® Mil-Spec T6 Stock."

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

Shipping is via Priority - I am offering a discounted flat rate of $5 for up to 4 magazines, and $10 for 5 or more.

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."

They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

The stock, buttplate, and sling hardware have been refinished or replaced as necessary.  Forearm is now properly glass-bedded (and rock solid).  Bluing has been restored.  New scope-mount.  Scope that's on it is nothing special but IS included in the deal.  Magazine was feeding badly so there's a new aftermarket magazine included (and you get the old one in case you prefer that softer spring).  You get the gun-case too (also nothing special but still...)  It's one of the 2-groove barrels you've heard about and it does seem a little finicky about what you feed it.  150 grain sp at 2500 fps work great...look at the target.  That's 5 rounds at 100 yds and I'm telling you I pulled that outlier...my fault, not the gun's.  100 brass comes with the deal.  Half of it's loaded right now with a ""spread"" of loads as I was trying to figure out what it liked.  Either way, once they've been shot the lot will be fire-formed for this rifle."

I will not part any of this package out so please do not ask for magazines separately, etc.  Thank you. 

I have a Smith and Wesson M&P 9mm pistol full size that I purchased new in the fall of 2011 from a local firearms dealer.  This gun does not have the safety that is included on some M&P's and it does have the magazine disconnect.  Both of these features are no problem for me (I wanted it this way) but I just wanted to be sure to describe it the best I could.  I of course still have the receipt for it.  I have put less than 100 rounds flawlessly through it. It came with two 17 round magazines and I have 2 additional 17 round S&W magazines I purchased for it that are still new in the box.  I have also purchased a Black Hawk Serpa retention holster for it but never have carried the gun in it yet.  I'm looking for a possible trade for a 9mm compact or subcompact of equal value and quality.  I am not interested in Hi Point, SCCY, etc., etc.  I'm not really needing to trade this gun, I'm just interested in something smaller for concealed carry and to see if anybody is interested in a trade.  I will only be interested in trading for an equal value pistol that comes with a sales receipt or bill of sale and you are the original owner.  My gun is not a headache and I'm not interested in acquiring a headache.  My gun has no marks or scuffs on it and I am looking for the same in trade.  I'm not looking to exchange money either way."

This handgun can be converted to .40 and .45 when you replace the upper so essentially becomes multiple weapons and the versatility is attractive in tactical situations.

From HK website:

Derived from the HK UMP, the USC is a civilian utility carbine that uses the classic hard-hitting .45 ACP cartridge. Matched with the simple and ultra-reliable blowback operating system, the HK USC is a radical departure from traditional firearms designs. Extensive use of the same durable, reinforced polymers used on HK’s line of military and police arms ensures lightweight and durability. And the highest grade of weapons steel is used where it matters—in the cold hammer forged target barrel and the solidly constructed bolt mechanism. User ergonomics are not sacrificed. The skeletonized buttstock is topped with a comfortable rubber cheek rest and recoil pad. The web of the pistol grip is open for a comfortable shooting handhold. Hard points located on the top and front of the receiver make attachment of optional Picatinny rails easy, allowing almost any kind of sighting system or accessory to be mounted.

Features:
•Tough, light weight, corrosion proof polymer construction
•Molded-in hard points for mounting accessories
•Optional accessory Picatinny rails available for easy mounting of optical sights, lights, and aiming devices
•Rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation
•Easy disassembly for simple cleaning and maintenance
•Ambidextrous safety/selector lever
•Open, skeletonized buttstock for better grip
•Oversized trigger guard for easy operation while wearing gloves
•Sixteen inch cold-hammer forged target barrel
•Rubber cheek rest and buttstock recoil pad

I'm selling my Remington 870 Express 12ga Police-style shotgun.  It's in like-new condition and includes the original box and instruction manual.  This model has the extended 6-shot magazine tube + 1 in the chamber, giving a total of 7 rounds.  I've fired maybe 25 rounds through it with no problems at all.  It's just been sitting in the corner of my closet and I've decided to sell it because I have my eye on something else.  It's cleaned, lubed, and ready for use.  This is an excellent home-defense shotgun.  My price is $400 cash, and I'll include (2) 5rd boxes of Winchester Military-Grade 00 Buckshot.

There is only one magazine (as shipped when new), however they are still available. The box has some wear from storage, and the pistol has been handled some (admired from time to time).

Chambered in the wildly popular .380ACP, this pistol is ideal for concealed carry where the person prefers milder recoil.  Makes for a great pistol for the night stand as well.  

The Browning BDA 380 uses a double stack magazine, and the grip is more hand-filling than the current crop of micro-pistols that are also difficult to come by these days. However when fired, this pistol is easier to control allowing for more precision and longer ranges if necessary.

Comes with a new box of 50 rounds of ammo

Conditions of sale:  Prefer face to face sale in the Oregon City/Portland area - However, I will ship to any FFL the law allows.  There will be additional fees to ship this pistol by the FFL on both ends of this transaction (unless your FFL holder allows for me to ship directly to them - so do).  Buyer to pay actual shipping and FFL fees if any.

Cash in the amount of $700.  (To state the obvious, this is a Browning, not a Kel-Tec, Taurus nor a Smith & Wesson).

Trades considered, however the only things I'm currently interested in are large frame revolvers chambered in .454 Casull (Maybe .460)."

I'm not falling for the recent 'panic buy' prices, but I am entirely willing to negotiate paying a fair market value for what you've got to offer.
