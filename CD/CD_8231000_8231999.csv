This is a great shooter in the 454 Casull caliber and 45LC.  Has both 1"" and 30mm Factory rings; currently setup with 30mm rings with a 2-7 scope (non name brand) but has held up well and is bright and clear.  The .454 is a powerful round, one of the original hand cannons out there - aprox twice the power of a 44 mag!  This a great hunting or long rang handgun with incredible stopping power capable of hunting any game in minnesota!  I am the original owner, has been well maintained, no rust or major issues.  Couple of nicks and slight discoloration on cylinder near front.  Comes with original factory hard  box and paperwork along with an extra larger hard case to accomodate pistol with scope.
Not interested in shipping this will be face to face only cash sale.  Buyer MUST have permit to purchase, carry permit and MN DL; no exceptions.  Will complete bill of sale at time of transaction.
Not much interest in  trades except for something in a .454 casull lever gun, T/C rifle in 460 sw mag, entry level OU 12ga trap gun, coonan 357; i have no need for more ARs or low end semi autos.  I dont forsee any trades being something I would be interested in but if it were can add cash on either end to amke it work.

The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber has a 3.0 barrel and an overall length of 5.42 with a height of 4.0. The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds

I just built this beautiful Glock 19 and had it milled my the best in the business, ATEi. I wanted the slide to be as light weight as possible, without any window cuts for debris to work it's way into the gun. With this cut I got front and sear serrations. They improved and extended the rear serrations and added front serrations, that has been long overdue from glock! I then had them add their kick ass top serrations that assist in manipulation of the slide. The Trijicon RMR 07 gen 2 is specifically married to the side. One of the biggest draws to this particular build was the exact mounting of the rmr and milling the suppressor height sights in from of the rmr. I've had them mounted both ways and love them in front of the rmr. It's  much less distracting than having to look through the rear sight. I want my sights out of the way, unless I have an optic failure, which is incredibly unlikely. This is all done on a Glock 19 gen 5. If you haven't shot one you are missing out! The only way to describe the trigger is incredible. Not to mention the front of the gun is also sexier. I'm not going to keep telling you things you must already know, if you are reading this you already know what a great blaster this is!I'll throw in the Taran Tactical +6 mag extension, as well as spare batteries, mounting hardware and ATEi swag....as long as asking price is met. This setup has less than 200 rounds through it and just received after waiting for 10 weeks. Im already on to my next project so my loss is your gain.I do have a Streamlight TLR 7 that's never been used that I'll include for an extra 75. I have a ton more pictures available!"
