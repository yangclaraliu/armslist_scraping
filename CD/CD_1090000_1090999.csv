The barrels are easily interchangable so you can shoot the gun for less (with the .40) and yet have the power of the .357Sig.  

The .357Sig barrel has had around 50 rounds through it and I put 25 rounds down the .40 barrel just to test it out.  I'm also including 250 rounds of .357Sig ammo.  200 rounds are from Ammo Kan (mass reloaders from Northern CO) and the other 50 is a factory box.  The 50 rounds of .357 Sig I put down it were Ammo Kan...shot great.

Get it before you have to have a background check :( and while you can still get 15 round mags.  Asking $800 for everything included:

M&P .357Sig with Night sights
Extra .40S&W barrel
3 (total) 15-round magazines
250 rounds of .357 Sig ammo

I purchased this rail system and test fitted it on one of my uppers, but changed barrels and ended up with a completely different barrel/free-float setup. The Lite Rail has never had a round fired through it, only been mounted on an upper once and was removed and repackaged in its original box. In perfect shape, not dinged up or scratched. The finish is just as nice as when I first unpacked it from the DD box. Comes with all original DD packaging, install pamphlet, hardware (barrel nut, threaded barrel ring, bolts and allen key), and 3 rail ladder protectors. This Lite Rail was purchased before Daniel Defense started including the barrel nut wrench so you would either have to use your own or purchase one for $10.

This rifle is a tac driver.  I shoot half or less MOA at a 100yrds.  I have shot various small game with this rifle and it performs well above par.  The polygonal rifling allows better performance and long barrel life that surpasses other manufactures.  I have shot less than 300rds through this rifle.  I got it sighted in and from then out have just delivered precision shots at small game.  Currently it is sighted in at 100yrds and I stand behind the price for this rifle.  It has a camouflage job with professional gun coat.

Really who have we become when we buy a 750 AR and try to sell it at 2000? we a suppose to be sportsman not scavengers and we are suppose to look out for are own but clearly this is not the case and buy doing so you can not even go into a store and buy one for its normal price any more they even started to inflate the  prices thanks to everyones greed. There is no weapon ban and there will not be one. Okay i get if there was a ban then you go into ban prices but 1200 dollars more than what it sells for is fucking nuts. I wish i had a AR to sell to everyone for what they were 3 months ago because i would gladly do so and i am sorry for the ones that can not buy one now because of the crazy ass prices people want to charge and for those people charging those prices i hope they lose there asses on the ones they purchased and those are the people that should be banned from owning a firearm..it is people like you who give Americans a bad reputation. Please lets stop the madness and start acting like true sportsman once again. And sorry if i got your hopes up on buying one at a normal price i wish i had enough to sell to everyone wanting one Thanks for reading this and God bless"

What does make this gun exceptional are the near-perfect, original plastic grips. Most you'll find offered are chipped & cracked. It comes w/one magazine that appears to be in perfect order, the spring quite sturdy.

Found in a box of gun parts we obtained from an estate along with WWII items. Everything appears to be intact, but it obviously has seen use. We know little about pistols, especially those of vintage so a trip to your gunsmith would be in order, that is, if you intend to fire it.

The bolt is plated with electroless nickel for reduced friction and added corrosion resistance.

The Active Valvesystem reliably cycles factory ammunition from 1 1/8 oz., 2 3/4"" field loads to heavy 3 1/2"" magnums.

The magazine holds up to four, 2 3/4"" shells depending on shell length. Some slugs shells are a little longer than standard 2 3/4"" shot shells.

2011 is a great year to be a lover of Winchester Repeating Arms and especially the Super X3 family of shotguns. If you haven't already heard a couple of Super X3 20 gauges were used to break the world record for one day dove shooting in Argentina. Some of that footage is in the video below. And under that is the video of an interview done at the 2011 SHOT Show of Scott Breeze -- the ""Dovenator"" -- talking about his achievement and some of the ins and outs of dove shooting in Argentina.

There is no weapon ban and there will not be one. Okay i get if there was a ban then you go into ban prices but 1200 dollars more than what it sells for is fucking nuts. I wish i had a AR to sell to everyone for what they were 3 months ago because i would gladly do so and i am sorry for the ones that can not buy one now because of the crazy ass prices people want to charge and for those people charging those prices i hope they lose there asses on the ones they purchased and those are the people that should be banned from owning a firearm..it is people like you who give Americans a bad reputation.

I know the ones that this hits close to home with will flag it but thats ok i will post it again. Are we really going to take advantage of our own to try to make a buck? Really who have we become when we buy a 750 AR and try to sell it at 2000? we a suppose to be sportsman not scavengers and we are suppose to look out for are own but clearly this is not the case and buy doing so you can not even go into a store and buy one for its normal price any more they even started to inflate the prices thanks to everyones greed. There is no weapon ban and there will not be one. Okay i get if there was a ban then you go into ban prices but 1200 dollars more than what it sells for is fucking nuts. I wish i had a AR to sell to everyone for what they were 3 months ago because i would gladly do so and i am sorry for the ones that can not buy one now because of the crazy ass prices people want to charge and for those people charging those prices i hope they lose there asses on the ones they purchased and those are the people that should be banned from owning a firearm..it is people like you who give Americans a bad reputation. Please lets stop the madness and start acting like true sportsman once again. And sorry if i got your hopes up on buying one at a normal price i wish i had enough to sell to everyone wanting one Thanks for reading this and God bless"

I know the ones that this hits close to home with will flag it but thats ok i will post it again. Are we really going to take advantage of our own to try to make a buck? Really who have we become when we buy a 750 AR and try to sell it at 2000? we a suppose to be sportsman not scavengers and we are suppose to look out for are own but clearly this is not the case and buy doing so you can not even go into a store and buy one for its normal price any more they even started to inflate the prices thanks to everyones greed. There is no weapon ban and there will not be one. Okay i get if there was a ban then you go into ban prices but 1200 dollars more than what it sells for is fucking nuts. I wish i had a AR to sell to everyone for what they were 3 months ago because i would gladly do so and i am sorry for the ones that can not buy one now because of the crazy ass prices people want to charge and for those people charging those prices i hope they lose there asses on the ones they purchased and those are the people that should be banned from owning a firearm..it is people like you who give Americans a bad reputation. Please lets stop the madness and start acting like true sportsman once again. And sorry if i got your hopes up on buying one at a normal price i wish i had enough to sell to everyone wanting one Thanks for reading this and God bless"

I know the ones that this hits close to home with will flag it but thats ok i will post it again. Are we really going to take advantage of our own to try to make a buck? Really who have we become when we buy a 750 AR and try to sell it at 2000? we a suppose to be sportsman not scavengers and we are suppose to look out for are own but clearly this is not the case and buy doing so you can not even go into a store and buy one for its normal price any more they even started to inflate the prices thanks to everyones greed. There is no weapon ban and there will not be one. Okay i get if there was a ban then you go into ban prices but 1200 dollars more than what it sells for is fucking nuts. I wish i had a AR to sell to everyone for what they were 3 months ago because i would gladly do so and i am sorry for the ones that can not buy one now because of the crazy ass prices people want to charge and for those people charging those prices i hope they lose there asses on the ones they purchased and those are the people that should be banned from owning a firearm..it is people like you who give Americans a bad reputation. Please lets stop the madness and start acting like true sportsman once again. And sorry if i got your hopes up on buying one at a normal price i wish i had enough to sell to everyone wanting one Thanks for reading this and God bless"

I know the ones that this hits close to home with will flag it but thats ok i will post it again. Are we really going to take advantage of our own to try to make a buck? Really who have we become when we buy a 750 AR and try to sell it at 2000? we a suppose to be sportsman not scavengers and we are suppose to look out for are own but clearly this is not the case and buy doing so you can not even go into a store and buy one for its normal price any more they even started to inflate the prices thanks to everyones greed. There is no weapon ban and there will not be one. Okay i get if there was a ban then you go into ban prices but 1200 dollars more than what it sells for is fucking nuts. I wish i had a AR to sell to everyone for what they were 3 months ago because i would gladly do so and i am sorry for the ones that can not buy one now because of the crazy ass prices people want to charge and for those people charging those prices i hope they lose there asses on the ones they purchased and those are the people that should be banned from owning a firearm..it is people like you who give Americans a bad reputation. Please lets stop the madness and start acting like true sportsman once again.
