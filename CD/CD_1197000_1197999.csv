I was just informed by a person that this ammo is Yugo M67 surplus.  It is corrosive berdan primed ammo according to this source.  I'm not sure, so posting this to give everyone as much info as possible.
Doing a quick internet search seems to mean the berdan primer makes it harder to reload the brass.  It can also be corrosive which means it might damage a gun if not cleaned after being used.  If you clean your gun after each use, then the ""corrosive"" part of this is fine to fire and won't do anything negative - IF you clean after each use.

I have lots of these 15 round boxes!  These rounds are in BRASS cases!  If you are reading this listing, then I have at least 1 box of these bullets left.

When contacting, please be clear of how much and what type of ammo you want and an idea of when you are free to meet.  I live in Geneva between Elgin (I-90) and Aurora (I-88).   If you prefer calling or texting please send your phone number and I'll answer that way.

I'm selling off some of my stored ammo so I can buy a shotgun. Please look at my other listings to see if you want to bundle anything together.

I live in the far west suburbs of Chicago, but am willing to meet up with buyers. Will not ship ammo and buyer will need a FOID card to buy ammo. Cash at time of transaction or PayPal before with 3% added to cover fees.

This is a great way to get lots of ammo all at once and not have to worry about sales tax, shipping, availiblity or limits on the amount you buy!"

The A-Max may be the most technologically advanced bullet ever designed. The aerodynamic secant ogive profile, sharp, pointed tip and unmatched concentricity give it an extremely high ballistic coefficient for near perfection in flight. After closely studying the performance of bullets for more than half a century, Hornady has incorporated every aspect of what makes a bullet accurate into the A-Max. 

Hornady has taken the technology of the A-Max bullet and turned it into a 50 caliber Match cartridge. With a muzzle energy of over 13,000 ft. lbs., this loaded round creates destructive potential but keeps it accurate and consistent at the same time."

I searched high and low for this ""match grade"" ammo and had it on back order for around 6 months before I was actually able to get it delivered (this was long before the school shootings and shortage of 22 ammo). I shot about 1000 rounds of it and found it to be without a doubt the best 22lr ammo I have ever used. It made more of a difference in my shot placement than trigger work or even adding a bull barrel on my Ruger 10/22. Yes, it is pricey but when you shoot it you will know why. I will only sell it in blocks of 500 rounds ($75 each). Again, this is NOT the normal junk you get at Walmart. This is very hard to find standard velocity, clean burning, match grade ammo.

I've got an Olympic Arms OA98 pistol. If you haven't heard about it please google it, as there is more background on this than I should include here.

But, it is a 5.56, 6.5"" barreled AR15 style pistol that is under 50 oz. It is in good condition and has handling marks from normal use. Round count is unknown but I have no reason to suspect it is overly high. This pistol does not have a buffer tube, so it would be a great upper to use on your SBR lower as a folder, or just as an easily concealed AR pistol. I will include 2 SS 10 round mags and 2 new C-Products aluminum 30 rnd mags still in the wrapper w/magpul followers. A soft case will also be included.

These sold for $900-$1200 before the panic buying but were and are a fairly rare. I would like to see $1295 shipped to your FFL. I just wanted to provide full disclosure on the price history I am familiar with on these. Price and Trades are negotiable. 

I will try and get photos up in the next day or two.

Thanks and God bless you,

The bore is chambered for either a 5.56 Nato round or the standard .223 round and comes standard with a 30 round clip.
I found this weapon shoots very accurate and long ranges and is enjoyable to shoot over all. The only downside is cleaning it correctly can take up to an hour if you take your time and do it right.

The recoil is very minimal and the accuracy of the weapon is outstanding. You could shoot his gun all day long and not get tired of it.

It was designed for use with the AK-74, but will work great on any AK with a side rail. The sights that were imported here didn't have the tritium source in them for night illumination. I ordered some tritium vials and put another light source in the sight and it works great. I have the original case for it as well as the manual in Russian and a sight adjuster tool and spare caps for the windage and elevation turrets.

 The light collimator window on the front of the sight is intact, but is starting to crack where the bottom screws go into it. The sight still works perfectly and the crack in the window is the only flaw. I bought the sight for $300 after shipping so I'd like to sell it for $130 shipped. You can still find these out there but not for the price I'm selling it and they don't come with a tritium source. It's not often that you find a sight thats ALWAYS on without batteries for $130. I have over $350 into the optic including the tritium so I think the price is fair. If the window ever cracks all the way, take it off and superglue a piece of plastic in place. It will serve the same purpose and work the same. I know there's someone out there who will buy it just for the collector value but I'm hoping someone will see it for the good value it is and get a lot of years of good use out of it."

For those looking for an optic-ready platform, the SIGM400 SRP removes the front sight tower and
replaces it with an M1913 railed front gas block. This sight-ready platform allows the operator to mount

on the Mil-Spec Picatinny rail.

Provides unparalleled accuracy, with a 16"" chrome-lined and phosphate coated barrel that provides maximum durability and corrosion resistance. A 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum forged lower receiver adds to the durability and reliability.

- Direct impingement gas operating system with rotating locking bolt
- 5.56 x 45 mm NATO Chrome-lined barrels with phosphate finish

These rounds are brass cased, boxer primed, reloadable, and non-corrosive. The head stamp on the rounds reads ""ADI 10"" meaning 2010 production.

This M855 steel core penetrator ammo is manfactured by Australian Defence Industries (ADI), the premier contractor for the Australian Defence Forces. ADI also has defense contracts with the US and other countries around the world. They are a military contractor similar to the US Lake City Ammunition Plant, except they are a much much larger defense corporation.

This ADI 5.56 is arguably superior to Lake City ammo due to the fact that these cartridges not only come sealed in an ammo can with a rubber gasket, but every 5 rounds are sealed in a plastic film pouch making them ideal for long term storage and protection against moisture, unlike Lake City.

The A-15 is the DPMS AR carbine version with a 16"" medium weight barrel, the fixed AR front sight with the flattop receiver with picatinny rail and no rear sight, and the collapsing buttstock.  This rifle is virtually brand new, and has has a total of less than 100 rds down the barrel, probably closer to 50...I'm not so anal retentive I count every round, but I do know I didn't go thru more than a couple boxes of both Wolf .223 and Lake City 5.56.  I looked the entire rifle over while taking pictures and couldn't find any damage to either the plastic bits or the metal finish---I might have missed something but if I did it's pretty darn small!  I currently have a EOTech 512 holographic sight on the rifle and sighted in at 100m; there are a couple of scratches on the protective housing (that's what it's there for) but the glass is perfect and the image is clear.  My brother did a trigger job on this using Brownell parts and while it's still an AR, it's noticeably better than most for creep AND let off; the original springs will be included if I can find them and you want them. 

The rifle will come in the factory black plastic case with the serial number sticker; I can't seem to find any paperwork (it's an AR, we all know how they work and break down, right?).  It will come with 2 brand new mags, neither of which came with the rifle---one is a DAH Industries 30rd marked ""Law Enforcement/Military Use Only"" and the other is a Colt 30rd; I don't know what happened to the original and I have too many AR mags to waste time looking for the exact one.  I will also throw in one 20rd box of PMC brass 55gr FMJ rounds so you can shoot this thing after buying it!

My price is firm, so only reply with a genuine question about the rifle or to discuss meeting---I want $1400 with the EOTech or $1000 without it.  Case, mags and the box of ammo are included either way.  Thanks for looking!"
