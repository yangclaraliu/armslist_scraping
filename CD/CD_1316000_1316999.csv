Obviously the original and the classic American ""assault rifle.""  H&R Arms Mfg.  Receiver, Barrel, Muzzle crown, Front and Rear Sights, etc all metal appears to be in very good condition.  The trigger is very smooth.  Obviously it's a historic rifle so shows some wear, but no major dings.  The wood is new and looks very cleanly finished.  No marks on it.    Serial number of the receiver is 5592xxx in case you want to look it up.  I'm a gun guy but not a Garand guy -- I am disposing of this for a friend who apparently had this rifle in the family for a while -- so I haven't fired this rifle, but am glad to answer any questions I can about it.
The ammo is 250 rounds of FMJ per can, two cans.  One can is quite rusty on the outside, but the the ammo is packed in plastic and is not touched.
The price is pretty firm.  I've done enough reading to know what they're worth in this condition.  If you are a Garand guy, and you want to check it with gauges and such, you are welcome to do so -- but I'm not interested in being talked down.
Thanks."

Having test fired this rifle, it functions flawlessly.  It is very powerful, accurate and a lot of fun to shoot.

In the late 90's Century Arms International (CAI) began offering semiautomatic only civilian versions known as the CETME Sporter, which are manufactured from assembled military surplus and US made parts. Although largely built from Model ""C"" parts, there have been reports of model ""B"" parts in the Model ""C"" Century built rifles.
Due to the restrictions against importing receivers of select fire weapons, all receivers for these civilian versions are made in the US. Earlier receivers were cast steel, while later receivers were made from stamped and welded steel. Earlier rifles retained the wood furniture of the originals while later examples were available with Heckler & Koch style composite stocks. Due to state and local laws restricting weapons with assault rifle features, the CETME Sporter is also available with a permanently pinned muzzle brake rather than the original flash hider. Both civilian .308 Winchester and NATO 7.62x51mm ammunition may safely be used in the CETME sporter.
Reviews of the reliability and accuracy of these civilian versions have been mixed, with earlier versions generally being considered more reliable and accurate than later examples."

FN Herstal Description:
The FNX-45 is the result of years of innovative product development and advanced engineering techniques. Modeled after the FNP-45 service pistol introduced in 2007 under the U.S. Joint Combat Pistol Program, the FNX-45 is a double-action/single-action hammer-driven pistol with highly enhanced ergonomics. Its manual safety/decocking levers, slide stop lever and magazine release are all fully ambidextrous for ease of operation with either hand and from any firing position. Both the slide and barrel are stainless steel. The FNX-45’s checkered polymer frame has multiple interchangeable backstraps with lanyard eyelets. A MIL-STD 1913 mounting rail on the underside accepts tactical lights and lasers."

Info for Colibri

Aguila Colibri Armmunition has no powder, relying on only the primer to propel the bullet down the bore. The result is an extremely quiet rimfire round, perfect for close-range pest control or quiet plinking. 

WARNING: These rounds are powered by the rimfire primer only. They must only be fired in handguns. If fired in rifles, the bullet may remain lodged in the barrel.

Will not cycle the slide of semi-automatic handguns

Aguila packages these as Long Rifle ammunition, but they are in fact slightly shorter than a 22 Long cartridge

This rifle is a bring-back from WWII that has recently been passed on to me.  The gun is in good  condition overall, but lacks a  functioning bolt.

The original bolt was thought to be lost, but recently resurfaced when accidentally dug up from the property where it had inadvertently fallen out of the rifle years before.  As would be expected, the original bolt resembles a dug relic from the Civil War, and likely cannot be salvaged despite repeated attempts to do so with PB  Blaster and any and all other home remedies.

In light of the above, I'm seeking a replacement bolt if anyone has an extra one from a parts gun.  While I would prefer a bolt made for this particular rifle, I would also consider any other bolt that would work if one exists for a similar rifle that would fit and function in this  rifle and that wouldn't look too out of place on this gun.  

I've put a price here simply because ArmsList appears to require a number in order to post a listing, but I also realize that any price would be negotiable depending upon what is available and the nature of any solution that might work. 

I would prefer a local sale and face-to-face transaction so I can ensure that any replacement or substitute bolt will work, in order to minimize the hassle facto for all concerned, and to save both parties any shipping or related costs.  

I've posted photos of the rifle here in case anyone reading this with more expertise and knowledge on this than I have (which is likely anyone reading this) can provide any information or guidance.

I realize I may be searching for a needle in a haystack, but any guidance or assistance would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance."

It is a 80's Westernfield 850 which is a copy of a mossberg 350 (takes the same magazines, same parts, etc) It is missing the little riser to adjust the elevation on the rear site, but I never shot it at distances where I needed that part. I also replaced the rear site adjustment screw. The wood stock is in very good condition and it shoots very accurately. The top of the receiver has been tapped with grooves for scope mounts. I don't have a scope for it. I don't really want to get rid of it but like I said I'm running out of room in the safe. The 7 round mag that comes with it is capable of taking 22s, 22l, and 22lr which is nice if you cant find 22lr ammo in times such as these...
The rifle has had 0 issues since I've had it with no ftf, fte, jams, ect. It is extremely reliable. Please don't try to lowball me. These rifles are pretty rare, especially the magazines. Just the magazine alone for one of these is going on gunbroker for over $50 with two days left as of the posting of this auction.

The bluing is not in the best shape.  There was a moderate amount of light rust on the barrel from sitting in a soft case (learned about that the hard way!).  Also some scattered light rust on the cylinder and frame.  I removed it with oil and fine steel wool but the light pitting is still there.  It looks better than my description sounds, but it should be stored with a light wipe of oil to prevent any return of rust.

It's a nice shooter, though.  Quite accurate, with a nice crisp trigger when shot in single action.  Just a good little accurate plinker at a great price."

Top notch 12 ga. Comes with Mod choke. Paid $369, sell for $300.

Next, a Mossberg 500 with wood stock.  Decent shape and a great shooter, but not new.  Great gun and can be made tactical with a $60 kit off ebay quite easily, and in 10 mins you can change it back to a full and go hunting!  Excellent all purpose shotgun. Haven't seen one anywhere in decent shape for under $325. Will sell mine for $250.

Last, if you are looking for a cheap home defender, I have a 1960's model Nobel Model 40.  Shoots good. Everything works.  The rear stock broke, and was epoxied back together. Not a beautiful repair, but gets the job done.  Has a really cool brass trigger assembly. really neat looking gun.  Parts from the more common Westernfield 40N will interchange on this one.  $100.

Prices are pretty firm. They are fair prices well under what you will pay for a comparable shotgun at the sporting goods stores."

The first gun is a smith and Wesson bodyguard in .380 with the built in laser. I have two holsters with it and the extended clip. It has been shot twice. It is one of my favorite guns. It is just like it came out of the box. I have 500.00 tied up in it and that is what it will take to make it yours. 

The second is a Taurus 709 slim new in the box fired one clip through it. It will be yours for 350.

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world. This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning. For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

These are amazingly rare and impossible to obtain right now (other than from the very few lucky people like me who spent hours and hours hitting refresh on the day they went on sale (and were immediately sold out)). These are some of the best forged lowers ever made. Plus, honestly, they're just really cool. Here's the description from Umbrella themselves: 

While our forged lower receivers exhibit a very high level of fit and finish, it's simply not just the quality of the machining that separates Umbrella lowers from the rest. We are meticulous with our inspection protocol to insure every receiver shipped represents premium manufacturing synonymous with the brand. We've added a simple chamfer to the grip interface for easy installation of even the most stubborn designs. And unlike many forged lowers, our magwell bevel is extreme for faster reloads. The deep laser engraved umbrella consumes thirty minutes of machine time alone but it's the only way to get such a crisp and well defined logo. The excellence is in the details. Umbrella Corporation AR-15 forged lower receivers are made to the finest standards.
