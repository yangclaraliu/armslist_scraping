Those 240 rounds need a clip or two and thats what youll get with all the rounds already in clips ready to have a fun day at the range.  Don't worry if you buy more ammo before you go because there's more brand new clips in the bag ready to load up.  It would be a lot of work to carry all those loaded clips so the 3 loaded reproduction ammo belts will come in handly for hauling most of it around.  Finally you get a reproduction bayonet to finishe off the pacakge.

408,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8310408,For Sale:  Timney... Nuff Said.,"Northside San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas",FREE,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 2, 2018",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Letting go of a very lightly used Timney trigger. One of their top models. When you get down to nuts and bolts, Timney really is pretty much the best out there. They’ve been around WAY LONGER than Geiselle, Elftman, or CNC. I’ve had about 30 different aftermarket triggers. I’ve made it my business to try all of the “best” triggers on the market. And this is definitely one of The Best triggers I’ve EVER used. The only reason I’m selling it is because someone bought the rifle it was in and didn’t want to pay for the aftermarket trigger. All of my other rifles have high end triggers installed already so there’s no place for this to go and I don’t need another rifle. The exact model is Timney 661-S (Skeletonized) 3lb Trigger. These go for $242 at their CHEAPEST. The places that offer them for $232 charge $15 for shipping and then tax if they’re in Texas. Trust me i went in and added them to my cart and calculated cheapest shipping method. Or they’re just plain out of stock. Make an offer... but just to set some boundaries, if you offer $150, your shots are hitting below your marl. This isn’t a charity. I’ll get it to you cheaper than anywhere else but I’m not giving you something for nothing. That has become a HUGE problem on this site. People’s god awful lowballing. Your balls don’t hang that low my friend.You want nice things in life? Then sack up and work hard for it and stop asking for handouts. Guess what? You make $25,000 a year, you can’t afford a Ford Raptor. Simple as that. I get it. You want nice things for cheap so you can pretend that you’re a “baller” in front of your friends. Fall in line and work for what you have.Absolutely look for a good deal but there’s a difference between and good dealand getting something for nothing.I don’t expect to get “brand new” price for this but make a reasonable offer.WILL TRADE FOR 1,000 OF BRASS CASED 9mmif you’re Interested in the Trigger and NOT debating semantics, please message me with a MANLY “I work hard for my sh*t and I play hard as well” kind of offer."

Has a magazine well and comes with one nine round magazine that fires both rounds. Mecgar 10 round 9mm 1911mags will reliably fire 9mm, and .38 Super 1911magazines will fire .22tcm. I replaced the plastic checkered mainspring housing with a custom steel one. I also added poor man's checkering to the front strap (grip tape).The gun fires like a dream. No recoil with either caliber. .22tcm throws fireballs and is loud as hell. Look it up on YouTube. Neat little round. I'll include about a box and a half. Also comes with a custom kydex OWB-RH holster, made by a local maker. Only has probably 200 flawless rounds through it in both calibers."

My technical small print....purchaser must be the actual intended owner of the rifle.   Purchaser is a legal WI resident and will present an unexpired drivers license at time of sale.   A bill of sale showing a receipt of the item transferred will be made for each of us.   I will not ship this anywhere.   When I am first listing this, I am only willing to meet around Madison and the closest suburbs.  $325 is the cash price, and won't be lower unless it is changed on this listing.  If you see the listing, it is still for sale."

Excellent operation and firing, with no mechanical defects. He has had a few shells ran through him but still runs like a goat in a tiger pin. Always kept clean and oiled and inside case. Some minor visual wear from sling carry and leaning against things like 2x4s and small trees in a duck blind, or falling off the gun rack when you roll your 4 wheeler over trying to evade a flock of trained attack geese. You know, just your average wear and tear from a few Arkansas hunting seasons. Will come shipped in original case with all paperwork, owners manual and so on, all originally included chokes are included and in good shape. Like I said, it's a used firearm. I've wasted more game animals with this boom stick than I can count (all legally shot and harvested, of course). This shotgun is a real treat to shoot and hunt with and has always been extremely reliable in the 3-4 years I've had it. I would keep it for many more years but my son is set to make his Earth debut in a few short months and priorities have changed. I know it will make a happy hunter wherever it ends up at. I am open to offers and willing to work out a deal if it means it gets sold quicker, but I'm not going to give it away. Right now on Remingtons website they are listed at $1,765. The little guy is already trying to kick his way out of his mother so the sooner the better!! Send me a message and lets make a deal. Thanks for looking and making it to the end, may the freedom of 17 bald eagles rain down upon you and your family.God Bless"
