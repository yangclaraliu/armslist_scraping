This is NOT a parts kit build up! This was manufactured from %100 factory new parts at the CUGIR factory in Romania in 2017 and importantly, it has the chrome lined cold hammer forged barrel as well as a forged bolt carrier group and trunnions. It's a genuine Eastern BLOC AK-47 built right by workers who have been doing this for decades. The original stock, trigger, safety lever and muzzle compensator will be included with the rifle. This rifle has had less than 200 rds through it and was cleaned meticulously afterward. 1 magazine is included. It has many upgrades. The upgrades are as follows:StormWerkz AK Stock Adapter – Type 1 $75.00, ACE M4 SOCOM Gen 4 Stock 5-Position stock: $200, Manticore Arms .30Cal/7.62 NightBrake 14X1L Muzzle Device: $50, ALG Defense AKT-EL Enhanced Trigger AK-47: $75, Krebs Custom enhanced Safety: $45, Tapco trigger group retainer: $10If you do the math, that's $455 in smart upgrades that bring this WASR 10 up to snuff with the best AK-47s out there. WASR 10s cost $700 and up so my price is a a bargain with these upgrades and it is firm. I am not interested in any trades and if the rifle is still listed, it IS available for sale.If somebody just wants the WASR 10 without the upgrades (I will leave the ALG trigger and Tapco trigger group retainer in though), I'll sell it for $600 firm. The ALG trigger is absolutely light years better than the stock trigger and I have already done the work of properly fitting the ALG trigger. No way I am putting the inferior original trigger back in."

That's 138 rounds total, 20 rounds per box (one box has 18), 7 boxes. Moly coated bullets tend to reduce copper build-up in barrels, and the coating reduces friction and pressure as the bullet travels down the barrel, thus slowing down heat build-up, and allowing you to shoot for longer periods of time before groups start to wander from hot-barrel effects. These have been said to shoot remarkably well (consistently 1/2 moa or less) I've switched to 175 gr, so I have no use for these anymore, but the ammo is excellent, and no longer easily found. It may have been too expensive for Black Hills to continue producing these bullets, and I think they stopped making them . So here's a chance to pick-up some stock."

I am finally parting with my long time favortie AK patern gun for something better suited to my needs rather than something I just have for the fun factor.
I do not have photos to post here but if you are interested in working something out I would be happy to email or text you directly. I have had this for around 2 years, but with being a college student this draco has sat neglected in my father's safe and has only seen maybe 500rds since I purchased it. AK's are meant to be shot and I hope someone here will show her the love she deserves. In it's current configuration it has a quad rail front end, an internal recoil buffer pad, a USMG folding brace adapter, a KAK industries pistol brace AR-style buffertube, and an SB-15 arm brace. Given that I have put over $400 in to the accessories alone, I will likely return the Draco to its factory configuration unless your cash or trade offer bridges the gap in value sufficiently. 
That said, on a straight sale I will include the draco in its original configuration and your choice of a 20rd or 30rd magazine asking: $500w/ SB15 arm brace, buffer tube, and folding mechanism asking: $750w/ quad rail asking: $580Complete package w/ all accessories and TWO mags: $800Please note that I will also sell the parts individually, and that the brace and buffer tube are meant to fit AR pattern Rifles; the USMG adapter is meant to allow AR braces to be used on AK patterned pistols. Of course, this is a pistol and thus I will need to see a CCW permit or I will need to retain a purchase permit alongside a bill of sale in both cases. I love armslist and it is our job to keep things professional and legal so that we can all continue making use of this amazing service. 
Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you!"

It’s a very smooth bolt action and very smooth double hook trigger with chrome lined barrel and matching low “five”digit serial #s. It was pulled from original box a couple years ago and has been a safe queen ever since. Has two five rnd mags or two thirty’s, you choose and a cleaning rod. This gun is basically perfect for the collectors other than not having the original cardboard box. Only trades are semi auto rifles, two rifles or something really cool, will not trade even for an AR, don’t ask! Unless it’s a 9mm.     It is a slant receiver.. I carefully backed out the two stock screws to make sure since I knew it would be asked. For the right trade or asking price.. I do have a whole set of furniture including a real wood pistol grip that has not been finished/stained. You would have to modify it yourself or have a professional fit it for you if you wanted to get rid of thumb hole stock. This thing is beautiful! If it’s still listed it’s still available. If interested leave a contact # and info, if no response then I’m sorry I’m just not interested. If you’re really interested you will answer a blocked caller ID phone call , if not then pass it up..

This one is the 22/45 ""Tactical"" model, 4.4"" barrel with Picatinny top and bottom rails, 1911 style grip, and threaded barrel. I bought this brand new less than 2 months ago. I'm selling it because I'm not crazy about the grip style, doesn't fit my hand well. Maybe 200 rounds thru it with no issues at all. It's a great shooter. And the take down of the new Mark 4's is so easy - push the button, done - breaks down like a double barrel side x side shotgun. Very easy to clean. No tools needed.Comes with everything it came with from Ruger - Box, Manual, 2 Mags, the little ring to disconnect the right side safety, Lock etc. I took off the bottom picatinny rail and replaced the long screws with a pair of shorter ones Ruger sent me. The original longer screws are there if you want to put the picatinny back on (for a flash lite).This gun is in Brand New Perfect condition - Not one issue with it. I just bought a S & W Victory and it fits my hand better.If I don't get $525 - I'll just keep it. Feel free to message or text me REDACTEDI'm on the Cape and can do an efa10 transfer.
