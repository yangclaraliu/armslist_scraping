I am selling many of my unused guns as I approach retirement and relocation, this rifle is from my collection of 1950s and 1960s era .22 rifles, the kind I used to wish I had when I was a kid in those days and saw them advertised in the outdoors magazines and catalogs, and when I saw them in hardware stores and the sporting goods section at Montgomery Wards and Sears and Roebuck. When I started collecting this type of rifle, I only bought the best examples I could find. This particular Winchester is the highly desirable variant with tube magazine and bolt hold open button; very very few examples of this variant to be found. This rifle is in Excellent condition and all functions are correct. I've only shot it 50 times when I got it for a function assurance check, it shot fine; then I cleaned it and put it in a gunsock and into my climatically controlled vault where it has sat untouched for years. Heck of a nice rifle and a real treasure from a bygone era. I will meet buyer half way between us for a FTF cash and carry deal at a public place during daylight hours. Buyer must be legal Maryland resident or active duty military stationed in Maryland, I will not ship this rifle. I am not interested in trades or counter offers. thanks for looking, pls email with any questions, pls check out my other listings on Armslist."

Top of the Line Weaver scope, great optics for long distances and original leather strap. This gun was not mass produced like they are today. It has the older style trigger and much better overall quality with a bolt action assembly not found in newer one's.

In absolutely PERFECT MINT condition.

Feel free to add on your gas used driving around to scrounge up everything you find, and I bet your listing time is worth $20/hour.  There is no reason to get evil when someone disagrees with you.  If your .22 - .500S&W is worth the price...then keep listing it and buying more to list that too.  At some point, you will either get tired of what you are doing or be a millionaire.  Good Luck

Buyers:  Fact - If you know what something is worth, and you see it listed too high...flag it, or just move on.  If you choose to buy something overpriced, that is your choice.  Don't bitch about it.  Do not be surprised when ammo manufactures decide to shelf price ammo at double or triple todays price to match what it is on armslist.com, gunbroker.com and other sites.  When this happens, your $60 brick of .22 ammo will be closer to $250+ on here.  Good luck with that."

The back seat needs a crack fixed from sun burning up leather seats. This car is super cool and super clean it does need a couple things. New motor mounts as the ones on it are dry rotted but still holding strong. A new starter which I have just haven't put it in yet. And a carb tune up as its running lean and isn't running at full power as a result. I have changed plugs wires distributor cap rotor and ignition tune up. It runs great doesn't smoke or do anything crazy. I did new brake shoes about 40 miles ago and other than that this car is a 6 window which isn't super rare but is becoming more rare as they only made about 10,000 of these and there are less than 2000 on the road today. It does need a new dash pad but that's easily purchased online. I'm selling it as I'm into offroad and don't have the money or time to invest in this great American classic car!

Higgins .22 semi auto rifle in Excellent Condition. I am selling many of my unused guns as I approach retirement and relocation, this rifle is from my collection of 1950s and 1960s era .22 rifles, the kind I used to wish I had when I was a kid in those days and saw them advertised in the outdoors magazines and catalogs, and when I saw them in hardware stores and the sporting goods section at Montgomery Wards and Sears and Roebuck. When I started collecting this type of rifle, I only bought the best examples I could find. This rifle was made my High Standard for sale by Sears and Roebuck under their house name of J.C. Higgin; this was the era prior to Sears branding their firearms with the Ted Williams name. This rifle has a highly unusual feature of having a spring loaded retractable sling built into the stock that pulls out to connect to a lug under the front of the barrel and then retracts back into the stock for a flush fit; it is very unusual to find one of these rifles with the original sling intact and working, collectors take note; I have never seen another J.C. Higgins Model 30 with the sling present and functional like this rifle has. This rifle is in Excellent condition with beautiful 2 piece Walnut stock and very nice original blue finish with no rust and all functions are correct. I've only shot it 50 times when I got it for a function assurance check, it shot fine; then I cleaned it and put it in a gunsock and into my climatically controlled vault where it has sat untouched for years. Heck of a nice rifle and a real treasure from a bygone era. I will meet buyer half way between us for a FTF cash and carry deal at a public place during daylight hours. I am not interested in trades or counter offers, buyer must be legal Maryland resident or active duty military stationed in Maryland, I will not ship this rifle. thanks for looking, pls email with any questions.
