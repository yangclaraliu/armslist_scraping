No import marks. No capture or rebuild marks. The magazine is not stamped or serialed. Shoots great with hotter 9mm like all Lugers do.

We put guns in the store around September 2017 and are continuing to grow our inventory and selection. The last few months the store has really taken off and we are seeing more and more potential. We have a new online gun website and a Facebook page, both are growing rapidly. My partner is looking to move out of the area and is entertaining the idea of selling his half of the buisness. I am looking for a potential partner that would have the capital/vision to buy his half and continue to help grow the buisness. The buisness is still relatively new and will only continue to grow with more exposure both online and physical store location.

Glock 23 Gen 4 Semi-automatic Double Action Only Compact 40 S&W 4.02"" Polymer Matte 13Rd 3 Mags Fired Case Right Hand Fixed Sights PG2350203The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.. GEN 4 Features: The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested ""Safe Action"" system, Durable exterior finish, Cold hammer forged barrel, Durability, Reliability, Light weight, ....that make GLOCK firearms famous! The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size. The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin. The grip angle of the GLOCK ""Safe Action"" Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol. The smallest back strap is integrated in the G17 MBS reducing the trigger distance of the standard size G17/G22 frame by 2mm. The medium back strap is a 2mm back strap offering equal size of a standard G17/G22 frame. The large back strap is a 4mm back strap. The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts. Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps. Compact dimensions for open and concealed carry, minimum weight despite large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. This and the reliability of the GLOCK pistol known throughout the world, which was demonstrated through tests and widespread use by US law enforcement agencies, were decisive arguments for the F.B.I. and countless police authorities for introducing the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol. THE PEARCE FRAME CAVITY INSERT FITS BOTH ADJUSTABLE BACKSTRAPS. Features: Gen4 G23, (2) 13rd Magazines, Reversible magazine catch, Rough Textured Frame, 2 Back Straps, Revolutionary ""Safe Action"" Design."

The 66 is the Stainless Steel version of the venerable Model 19'K' Framed .357 Magnum developed by lawman Bill Jordan back in the late 1950s.These No Dash (or -0) guns are Pre-Lock and feature the coveted Pinned Barrels and Recessed Chambers. They were manufactured between 1971 and 1976, making this 1976 example a late model early gun...if that makes sense.  This one has been used, but was never abused. It's all original, down to it's nicely grained pair of Target Grips, and has the red insert in the Baughman 'Quickdraw' front sight. This particular revolver onced served along the Rio Grande (New Mexico) as a Law Enforcement firearm- but managed to gracefully slip into semi-retirement with no finish blemishes save for a light patina of character to prove it was there because the stainless guns don't wear out, they wear IN- and this one prob'ly has at least several more generations of shooters left in it.  It's got a super tight lock-up, and a silky smooth action, and is darned accurate to boot.  The 4"" barreled 'K' Frame Smith .357 Magnums- particulary those in Stainless Steel- are perhaps the Perfect Revlovers. They are small enough to carry, have enough barrel length to get some mileage out the .357 Magnum round, and are very accurate with .38 Special ammo as well. BUT if you want to fire heavy duty .357 ammo all day long, however; this is NOT your gun. Buy a Ruger Tank. Maybe one in bigger caliber. Or get an S and W Fiddy.... The Model 19/66 series were designed to be fed a diet of 'mostly .38 Spl.' rounds, along with a few hearty supplemental cylinders of .357s...just because they can. Basically just feed them any Over the Counter type fare, preferably loaded with heavier grain bullets and the gun will know you love it too.But, hey: if you're still reading this, you prob'ly know all this stuff already  ;-) I'm asking $675 for this little Sweety, and am tossing in the original accessories that came with her. You'll get the 'whole shootin' match'; including a vintage leather HKS speedloader pouch, (2) speed loaders, and a very nicely broken in leather Bucheimer Model C-53 holster that fits the gun like a glove...all in a nice carrying case.  If you're looking for a great old shooter that will retain it's value- (and far outclasses the modern versions with their cast parts and safety locks)...then this is it.They truly 'don't make 'em like this anymore.' Why? Because they CAN'T....(for a variety of reasons). Don't get me started.I hate to sell it, but if I must- I prefer it goes to a deserving Home (on the Range)....dammit ;-] If your seriously interested, call me. (I'll even give you the number if you Email me)                                                                                                                                                      -Peace, Love, an' Hollow Points"

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.  HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.  The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.  The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.  Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.  A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.  The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.   The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.  HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.  The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.  Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis."

The Tokyo First Arsenal produced this sword. This sword has a cast aluminium tsuka (hilt) with a 9mm thick ornate brass tsuba (guard) with pebble finish. The fuchi is copper and the sword is secured in the scabbard by a top latch, all of which identifies it as being a third pattern sword dating to around 1938 – mid 1941. After mid-1941, the tsuba and fuchi were made of unadorned iron. The latch mechanism for securing the sword in the scabbard is re-positioned to the side of the tsuka in later models.  The steel scabbard is in excellent condition, free from dents and with only minor pitting and rust that appears to be inactive. The sword draws well and is held firmly in the scabbard. The serial number on the throat of the scabbard does match that of the blade. No chips in the blade. Most or these are missing the leather tassel which never survived in the jungles so I bought a reproduction in leather NCO Tassel as from the original.Looking to sell for $800 or maybe part trade for a Beretta 92FS in 9mm or S&W .44 magnum in a short barrel or and I'm also looking for 30 round stick magazines and 50 round drums for my 1927 A1 Thompson or part cash will only sell or trade in the state of Oregon"

Do you shoot all year long and love the sound of lead hitting steel at over a thousand yards away? Do you put in hours behind the trigger, practicing the fundamentals of marksmanship and learning to read the wind? Do you like the option to choose between established and proven cartridges as well the newest non-belted magnums that offer superior ballistic coefficients and velocities in a standard length action? This is the rifle for you.   Built on the most popular X-Bolt rifle ever, the Hell's Canyon Speed, the Hell's Canyon Long Range takes the same winning features and adds a heavy sporter contour barrel for increased long range accuracy. You still get all the features that made the X-Bolt Hell's Canyon Speed a best-selling and game-changing rifle:  Exclusive A-TACS AU camouflage - an advanced camouflage comprised of micro and macro patterns to add concealment in depth from varying distances of perception. DuraTouch Armor Coating - a superior stock coating and camouflage medium, DuraTouch also provides a superior grip and feel in hot and cool temperatures, whether it's wet or dry. Burnt Bronze Cerakote - originally developed as an automotive component finish to provide enhanced cooling, Cerakote is a superior non-reflective and corrosion-resistant coating in high demand for custom grade firearms. The receiver, barrel, and exposed surface are of the bolt are all coated for an extremely appealing look that enhances function and durability. Fluted barrel - not a new concept, yet far from being a standard feature on hunting rifles, barrel fluting reduces the weight of the barrel, increases the exposed surface area of the barrel (reducing barrel heating), and increasing the rigidity of the barrel. Threaded muzzle brake/Suppressor ready - a time-tested feature to tame the recoil of magnum calibers and all but eliminate the kick of more mild calibers, allowing shooters to observe downrange impacts. Included with the rifle is a thread protector so you can remove the muzzle brake without risking damage to the threads. The threaded barrel makes it that much easier to attach a sound suppressor, an increasingly popular safety trend in big game hunting.  Add to this all the custom grade features that come standard on the Browning X-Bolt:  Adjustable Feather Trigger Free floated barrel, hand chambered with a target crown A short-throw bolt with 60° bolt lift Inflex Recoil Pad Bolt unlock button Detachable rotary magazine with inline cartridge feed   Check out this Firearm at Gun Commanders 5290 Highway 129 South, Cleveland, Ga. 30528 or on our website for all available inventory Guncommanders.com"

Key features of this patented configuration include a low bore axis, 1911-style straight pull trigger, and lowered recoil spring placement for a pistol that does not require an off-axis firing technique and achieves a flatter shooting platform. The low bore axis is achieved with the striker-fired system and placing the barrel camming surfaces forward of the trigger guard. Along with the recoil spring placement in front of the trigger guard, it reduces torque on the wrist for better control. The linear 1911-style trigger minimizes disruptive trigger finger movement during the firing sequence to maintain greater control and more consistent follow-up shots. The lack of a hammer spring allows a more slimline and higher grip on the pistol giving the shooter more control while diminishing felt recoil. Note: Due to the low bore axis, the H9 is not compatible with other magazine designs. The H9 has an all-steel frame with an accessory rail, integral trigger safety, ambidextrous slide release, and a reversible magazine release. The H9 also features a G10 Hogue lower backstrap, G10 VZ interchangeable grip panels, Trijicon HD front sight with a black serrated rear sight, and a stealthy black finish. This model includes three 15-round 9mm magazines."

Does not have a bolt carrier group or charging handle. If you have a 223/556 AR-15, this upper is everything you need to make a 300 Blackout with your rifle. All you need to do is take the bolt carrier group and charging handle (and optic) out of your 223/556 and insert them into this upper and snap it on your lower. The pistol length gas system is for usage with subsonic loads. 300 blackout is very sensative to the ammo it uses. I am selling this like new upper because I did not use 200 grain subsonic loads and couldn't use the ammo that I wanted to use out of this rifle. It has fired 30 rounds from it or so. Worked great with 5 in the magazine but anymore then that would cause a failure to feed because there was not enough energy to strip off the rounds because of the magazine spring pressure and other factors. I have been told that if I use 200 grain ammo in the upper it would work great as I was using 147 grain. But I do not want to use 200 grain so I am selling this upper. I will take 160 for it firm.Barrel info AAC Melonite Nitride Hbar Pistol Gas W/ 10"" Pentagon Super Slim Lite Keymod Handguard"

My serial number (99122) research tells me this revolver was made in 1916. It carries a British proof mark (crossed pennants) on the top left side of the frame. The barrel carries patent markings dated 1926. My best guess is this firearm was leased to Great Britain during WWI and came back afterwards. It was then converted to 38 SPL (barrel and cylinder) and went on the civilian market. Overall it is in very good condition. I have fired it several times and it functions perfectly. The timing is on and the lockup is tight. It does show signs of age in terms of patina, bluing wear near muzzle and some minor surface flecking on right side. The rampant colt is clean and clear on the left side above the grip. It comes with a vintage Heiser (Denver, CO) holster, Colt wooden grips and custom elk antler grips that I made to ""jazz"" it up a bit. Elk grips are made a bit thicker to accommodate my meat-hook hands. You will probably not see another old-school combination like this come along any time soon, if ever, unless you buy the pieces.

The new Walther SOFTCOIL ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. How Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology Makes This Pistol A Must-Have The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case. Benefits of Walther SOFTCOIL ™ Technology 1. It allows the slide to be easily manipulated to chamber a round. 2. Barrel rise is reduced up to one third less than similar pistols. 3. Decrease barrel rise helps you remain focused to accurately hit your target shot after shot. Size & Features With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster. The CCP comes in stylish stainless or Cerakote® black and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation. This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface. Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide."

This is a scenario that plays itself out more than ever with financial times as tough as they have been in decades. Like countless military, law enforcement, and concealed carry aficionados I carry a GLOCK for just such an occasion. GLOCK is used by law enforcement and security personal world wide as well as here in the USA because of their rugged dependability and combat reliability. In fact when it comes to iconic firearms GLOCK is at the top of any list because of their innovation and quality components that GLOCK is world famous for. No other firearm is relied on more than a GLOCK for defense and duty use. Pick up a GLOCK 17, 21, 22, 31 for duty use; GLOCK 19, 23, 32, 30 for duty and carry, or GLOCK 26, 27, 33, 36 for deep concealment. Superior versatility is available with this high-performance, 10mm Auto pistol. With reduced dimensions compared to the standard size GLOCK 20, the subcompact GLOCK 29 is also suitable for concealed carry.

The buyer is required to be 18 years of age,otherwise legally able to purchase this rifle,and be a Nevada resident that can show a NV driver's license or CCW.I sent in my USGI carbine to Tim LeGendre of Fenton, Michigan in about 1995 to have the conversion performed.Since then, I've shot it about 200 times, and it has been very reliable.It is mechanically good, ready to shoot.Cosmetically, the receiver was not re-parkerized during the conversion, so it contrasts with the new barrel.Thanks,Darron R.
