They made this gun in 32 Cal and in 380 Cal. I own a 1912 32 Cal but it now belongs to my son. Savage made same design gun in 45 cal to compete against the Colt 1911 for Military Test to become offical side arm for the Army. I have read that Colt furnished the rounds and hot loaded Savages ammo that caused gun to fail. I will add link to Allow you to do more research. This Gun is in Good Shape for  it's age and it has rare  Original Holster with total of 3 extra magazines. I see Magazines selling on internet for $75-125 each and yes people are buying them up. I want to sell this all together for some ones collection. The finish is Parkerized and looks good. Original Grips are Good without Cracks, Rare Spur Hammer, Holster is Original fits gun perfect with 2 extra magazine holders original 1909 Patina Remember this is 104 Years Old. I took it all apart and cleaned with CLR and it seems to be in Great Mechanical Shape. Please see attached link for more details or Google Savage Model 1907. I think 32 cal is 10 shot aand this is 8 shot or 9 with one in pipe. Really cool machining marks from when guns where still made by hand not turned on CNC Machine. Great Addition to your collection or Fathers day is coming soon. I have several Guns Listed will Group together for right trade. Link has Various Sections click on top tool bar to navigate.
I hate to part gun out but might consider. I have seen grips alone sell for $175-200, magazines $75-125 each, Action, $100-150, I figure it will part for close to $500-600 but I would rather sell it as whole and someone collect it and keep it all together. I am lowering price to $375 for this vey neat rare piece of history. Will consider all offers to buy for just parts. Thank You

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches."

Lower: MAG Tactical Systems FDE. Magpul Internals, MOE Grip, BAD Lever, CTR Stock, & 1 30-rnd Gen 2 Mag New In Wrapper.

Optics: Magpul Gen 2 MBUS Front & Rear. (Red Dot not Included, Airsoft Version Anyway)

Only 60 rounds have been fired to season the barrel & to check function/safety. The barrel was scrubbed after every 3rd shot for the first 30, then every 5th shot for the last 30. 

The piston system is sweet! You can remove the moving parts by turning the detent on the gas block and pulling them out the front. No need to remove quad rails to access your gas tube! There is also little to no carbon buildup inside the upper receiver. Personally, I enjoy shooting and maintaining the Piston System over a conventional Gas Tube System. I tried to keep this rifle clean looking, no crazy attachments to drive cost up, but I have chosen some of the top manufacturers during the build which makes for a higher cost tactical rifle. I have 4 more Gen 2 mags and up to 1000 rounds of Federal to leave with this rifle to get you going, but they will not be sold separately. 

I am also not interested in firearms as trade, my armory is well stocked, diverse, and suits my tastes. I am looking for a jeep wrangler YJ, specific years 1992-1995, and of course I’d be chipping in cash to you along with the rifle.

We’ve got a Holiday Weekend coming up, we could easily arrange a meeting at Swann Creek for a function test as a final trial before exchanging money and equipment.
I am available for texting and phone calls, however, thanks to all the spam I’d prefer to get an e-mail from you first. Cash will be the accepted form of payment, I will require a valid AL driver’s license as well as a valid conceal-carry permit from your sheriff’s department as to proof that you are allowed by Alabama State law to own firearms. I will provide a bill of sale documenting the above information for myself, copy your information, and we will both sign it. We will each have a copy for our records, but it will not be filed with any agency on my end. 

If you happen to be out of state, I have shipped rifles before through my FFL. Shipping costs are roughly $50-$75 and are charged at the time of packaging. The ONLY form of payment I will accept is Paypal. This will cover me against a no-pay and it will also cover you if I never ship the rifle. There is only a 3% charge so it's so much cheaper than a moneygram from walmart or western union. I'll be happy to do a Skype video call with you and we can go over the firearm and show you anything about it you want.

Thanks for looking, -Matt"

It comes with 3 ten round mags one is a COLT mag and the other two are older made in the USA mags and they all work flawlessly. Also it comes in the original box with papers showing the gun model and telling about it. these guns are super rare and irreplaceable.

Are you having issues getting your consignment items back from Steve and Michael at Mid Oregon Armory in Roseburg Oregon?

I've been trying for over six weeks now with no luck. I have admittance of selling one of my guns  and yet to see any money, plus those things that may or may not of sold. 

Not one mention of ""hey we're closing down our business, come get you stuff"". But instead I find out the hard way like everyone else that has personal items there... A sign on the front door that reads ""closed for a family emergency"". Look at their Facebook page, no mention of anything closing down until someone posts on their wall ""where are you, I want my guns back"". 

Maybe you are in the same boat as I am in? Steve and Michael are just stringing you along telling you that your stuff will be shipped to you, and weeks later still nothing. Contact me if you want to join me in taking action against these individuals that show no intent in following through with getting what rightfully belongs to us. 

I have email after email, text after text with either no response back to those communication attempts or empty promises of ""things will ship, I'll get you a check, things are in storage, things got mixed up during the move, I'll replace your things"", ect... 

MOA... Maybe you have come across this listing and have had the chance to read this... Stop delaying in getting your consignment clients taken care of. Return to us our items we entrusted you to sell for us, and return to us the money you have received for those items that were sold.

Most likely what has taken place here is that items have sold, money has been spent, and bankruptcy will be filed. Why else the delay to hand over what you have that belongs to others? Because you probably do not have it any longer and you're buying your time to file for bankruptcy to protect yourself from the many lawsuits that are coming down the pike for you. 

The following names are public record and can be found when the company LLC is looked up. These individuals are responsible for Mid Oregon Armory.

P2000 SK
Like the slightly larger P2000 model, the P2000 SK (subcompact) combines elements of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with recent technological innovations from HK engineers — only in a smaller, more concealable design.

The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 - 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 - 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.

Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact.

The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter's hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters.

A set of abbreviated ""industry standard"" mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines. Available in 9 mm, .40 S&W."

Info:

Pistols created since 1912, in the house of STEYR MANNLICHER, are famous all over the world for their futuristic design, superb ergonomics, absolute safety, and extraordinary precision.

The new M-A1 pistol line continues this tradition, while featuring many detailed innovations. The integrated Picatinny rail, in the front of the frame, is a modern and internationally applicable solution to mount quickly and easily a variety of laser-aiming, or illumination devices.

 With a total weight of only 27oz (w/o Mag) the new M-A1 pistol is extraordinarily light.
The unique trapezoidal sight offers a new dimension in rapid target acquisition. The sight's shape guides the eye onto the target, and thus the target is captured exactly and quickly. The new innovative grip offers unsurpassed ergonomics, which results in a natural pointability. 

It optimally supports the natural posture of the wrist during shooting. Improved adhesion is provided by the special surface design."

It is a ""RRA Mid-length A4 LAR-15"" to be exact. It is in awesome condition, only about 100 rounds through it, and cleaned after every range trip. These are very, very hard to find right now due to the gun craze, and most places that sell these are back-ordered for 3-12 months or more!
 It has a 16"" barrel with a mid-length gas system, which gives better accuracy and lower recoil than the short-length gas systems. The barrel is chrome-moly and has a 1:9 twist. As you can see I am including a Red (or Green) Dot Sight that has 8 different reticle options. I am also including a flip-up MBUS (back up site) which is co-witnessed with the red-dot (meaning either or both could be used, they both point to my zero at 50 yards), its a really great setup for some closer-range tactical shooting. If you wanted to put a scope on it its pretty easy to do as well (Note: There is no scope included in this package). It has a 6 position adjustable stock. The accuracy is up to 1 MOA (meaning with a shooting rest, high quality ammo, and a good shooter, you can put 5 rounds within a 1"" circle at 100 yards).
 I am also including the tactical sling (partially seen to the left of the stock) as well as 5 - 30 round polymer magazines, 4 of which have a handy window to see how much ammo is remaining. I will include these LOADED at 29 each (can fit 30 but its not very good for the mags and can cause problems) for 145 rounds! [NOTE: NOT SELLING ACCESSORIES/AMMO SEPARATE for this package] The ammo is 55 grain brass cased, not aluminum or steel cased garbage you see nowadays in the current craze. I am able to sell some additional ammunition for additional $.

This has everything you need to start tactical target shooting or even survive the zombie apocalypse!

List of everything included: Firearm, tactical sling, 5 LOADED magazines (29 x 5 = 145 rounds in magazines), red/green dot sight (Truglo, will include a back up battery too), back up sight, original RRA case.

I am NOT looking to trade, looking to sell only. Must be able to meet in Eau Claire, face to face, and have CASH. Will not ship. I can have additional pics and/or information on request. CCW a plus, Wisconsin ID a must."

.
The Ruger Police Carbine is a pistol caliber carbine designed as a companion to the Ruger P Series pistols. As of 2007, Ruger has discontinued production citing low demand. It is a semi-automatic carbine using a blowback action. The Carbine uses the same ammunition and magazines as the Ruger P Series 9mm and .40 S&W caliber pistols.

Both the PC9 (the 9mm version) and the PC4 (.40 S&W) are patterned after the highly successful Ruger 10/22 carbine. The Carbine is intended as a shoulder weapon for police use, although it is available for sale to civilians as well. The intent is that an officer will carry a Ruger P Series pistol as a sidearm, and keep a Carbine available (for example, in his/her patrol vehicle) as a shoulder weapon if needed. Since the carbine has a 16-inch (410 mm) barrel, it provides more power with the same ammunition used by the 4-inch (100 mm) barreled pistol (see internal ballistics). The carbine also provides additional accuracy and range over the pistol.

The Carbine has some unique design features. The action is a simple blowback design, which requires a fairly massive bolt to handle the pressure of 9mm and .40 S&W. To prevent the gun from being too unbalanced by the large bolt, the bolt consists of two parts; the main body of the bolt is fairly light and located in the receiver, while the other part is just a weight located under the forend of the carbine. These two parts are held together by strong, rigid steel bars. The combined mass serves to hold the breech safely closed during firing, while keeping the center of gravity forward, so the gun handles well. Another unique feature is the bolt lock. Since blowback guns of these calibers require heavy bolts, the inertia of dropping the gun can cause the bolt to come partially open, rendering the gun unfirable until the bolt is manually closed all the way. To prevent this, the Carbine uses a lock that locks the bolt securely closed so that a fall will not dislodge it. A slight pressure on the trigger or on the bolt handle, however, will disengage the bolt so that it can move for firing or clearing the action.

In addition to caliber, the Carbine also comes with a choice in sights. The standard model uses notch and post sights, while the GR models are equipped with ghost ring sights. The ghost ring sights cost more, but they are generally considered better for defensive purposes, as they allow faster sighting under poor lighting conditions plus a longer sight radius for greater potential accuracy. The Carbine also has Ruger style scope bases built into the receiver, allowing optical sights to be easily and securely mounted."

I've done very little to this rifle aside from adding a shoulder sling as well as a sleeve which holds 10 rounds. This rifle also comes with just over 100 rounds, 59 of which are Hornady 325 gr FTC LeverEvolution rounds."
