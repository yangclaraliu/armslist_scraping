I have the title in hand clean and clear. I will accept cash or cashiers check, for cashiers checks I will have to go with you to your bank. The only possible trades would be a partial trade for a flatbed car trailer just big enough for a jeep, motorcycle (street legal only) metric cruisers prefered(v-star etc..), firearms, gift certificates to scheels, cabela's, sportsmans warehouse, must be able to verify, I'f you own or work at a well known shop, I would be willing to trade parts and labor for a 75 cj5 build, needs ring and pinion's, lockers and sm420 installed(I have the tranny) this was all quoted at just under 3000 from WFO. let me know what you have, worst I can say is no. 

Well maintained and in excellent condition. Have owners manuals and receipts for everything since new. This model is a 4 season with lots of windows, all of which have mini blinds. I am selling this stocked with dishes, silverware, cooking utensils, toaster, coffee pot, etc. . . I won't be owning another trailer for a while and do not want to store extras of things.

The EBRv2 gives the operator the advantageous ability to reload quicker, clear jams in a more efficient way and eliminate unnecessary hand movements during various operations. This allows the operator to get back into the fight faster and make the weapon system more effective. It is constructed to be lightweight and super strong. The EBRv2 family of components goes through a stringent 9 stage manufacturing process to ensure dependability.

DNA (Digitally eNhanced Accuracy)

Leupold has has achieved a remarkable advancement in digital laser rangefinding. Our next generation rangefinder engine pushes the envelope forward to reach greater precision at larger distances and with increased speed. Leupold rangefinders with DNA (Digitally eNhanced Accuracy) are able to deliver faster and more precise results, accurate to within 1/10 of a yard – against all background colors and textures.
High Performance Optics
Quick Set Menu

Get the settings you want fast with the Quick Set Menu®. The one-handed controls make RX® rangefinders easy to use in the field, even when your hands are sweaty or the weather is at its worst.
Advanced OLED Technology

The OLED advantage: A major advancement for the RX platform is the significant improvement in light transmission and resolution. Leupold developed a platform to support an Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) display. Instead of looking through a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) as with traditional rangefinders, where the LCD film reduces image quality by stripping out light and reducing the resolution, the OLED display is reflected into the light path of the RX optical system leaving a crystal clear image. When in early morning or late evening low-light conditions, the 3x greater light transmission over competitive LCD rangefinders will give you that extra advantage.

ALL OTHER CALIBERS IN STOCK. ALL AUCTIONS SUBJECT TO IN STORE SALES. ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE CALL 1-480-585-5966. THE WORLDS LARGEST BLASER DEALER. Focused repeating In-line repeating in the correct shooting position allows for a relaxed posture in situations that require a quick succession of shots. The bolt handle is mounted in an ergonomically perfect position just above the trigger guard. Rifle and eye remain focused on the target, the hunter gains time to aim exactly and ensure a perfect shot. ""Blind"" magazine exchange The magazine buttons are positioned above the trigger guard and can be operated „blindly“. When pushing both buttons at the same time, the magazine releases directly into the shooter‘s hand. If required, a second loaded magazine can be inserted within a split second. The magazine is loaded by pushing in cartridges from above, so that pushing the cartridges under the magazine lips is not necessary. Thus, the magazine can be loaded easily, even when it is inserted into the rifle which is a huge advantage for active hunters. Magazine capacity: caliber group Mini: 5?+?1 Standard: 4?+?1 Magnum: 3+1 Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot. The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs. Superior barrel bedding Cold hammer forged barrels and chambers provide superior quality and utmost accuracy. The barrel is embedded in the massive R8 action. Distortion of the wooden stock caused by dry or wet conditions does not affect the point of impact. Even when exchanging the barrel, the R8 barrel bedding provides optimum repeating accuracy Blaser Radial Locking System Extremely strong consentric locking directly to the barrel without rotary motion. Besides barrel bedding and quality, the Blaser radial locking system contributes decisively to unsurpassed accuracy. Success Factor: The stock Different from some traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. Due to the increased muzzle stability the felt recoil is substantially reduced. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Manual Cocking System The R8 offers the capability of safely stalking with a round in the chamber without any chance of discharge due to the innovative manual cocking system. Without the need to move your hand from the pistol grip you can silently push the cocking lever forward allowing the firing pin and spring to be cocked, ensuring a shot at a moments notice. To de-cock the system simply push the cocking lever forward with slight downward pressure and the lever will return to the neutral position removing all tension to the firing pin spring. For the past half century the Blaser manual cocking system has been recognized as one of the safest systems in hunting rifles.No conventional safety system can surpass the uncocked firing pin spring. To safely open the bolt, simply move the cocking lever forward until you meet the first resistance (about 3 mm?/?1/8“) to unlock the bolt handle. This slight movement will not cock the rifle and you can load and unload the rifle safely. Protected against unauthorized access The unique design of the intergrated trigger/magazine assembly allows the trigger/magazine unit to be removed and stored separately. This important safety feature protects against misuse by unauthorized persons. Automatic Decocking By removing the trigger/magazine unit the R8 can no longer be cocked. Additionally removing the system from a cocked rifle, the cocking lever will return to the de-cocked position. Short and huntable The unique design of the R8 magazine above the trigger allows the overall lenght of the rifle to be 9 cm (3?½“) shorter than conventional bolt action rifles. This innovative feature proves to be a distinct advantage in all terrain. Perfectly balanced The combination of overall length, total weight and balance sets a new standard for bolt action rifles. The balanced weight distribution allows for fast handling and quick target acquisition. Safely stored, ready in a split second In situations when hunters have to walk long distances, it is more comfortable to carry the rifle stripped down in a backpack. If required, the rifle can be reassembled in a split second, without influencing the point of impact. When traveling, the R8 can be transported stripped down in a rifle case. In contrast to very long conventional rifle cases, passers-by do not recognize the R8’s inconspicuous rifle case. Locked Magazine The double release buttons protect the magazine against unintentional drop out. Our innovation does not stop there. We also incorporated a locking device for the hunter who prefers a non-detachable magazine. When the magazine is locked in place, and with an open bolt, the rifle can be loaded from the top. Protected All metal parts of the R8 are either made of rustproof material or otherwise protected against corrosion. The closed construction of the R8 action prevents contaminants from entering the rifle. Every magazine comes with a protective cover (1) preventing dirt from entering the rifle when the magazine is stored outside of it. When taking out the magazine, the magazine chamber can be closed with a magazine chamber cover (2) which is included in the scope of delivery. Desmodromic Trigger Mechanism The critical link between shooter and rifle is the trigger. The R8 offers the next leap in technology. Upon cycling the action, the trigger is reset mechanically. This innovative design does not rely on a spring to reset the trigger after firing. This important design feature offers unsurpassed reliability in extreme conditions such as freezing rain and blowing dust. Hunting around the world There is no better advantage to a hunter than the ability to use one rifle anywhere in the world. With calibers ranging from .222 Rem to .416 Rem. Mag. there are no limitations for your Blaser. and more to come. Several rifle scopes on one barrel Every barrel is prepared for the Original Blaser Saddle Mount. This allows for several rifle scopes to be used with one barrel."

DNA (Digitally eNhanced Accuracy)

Leupold has has achieved a remarkable advancement in digital laser rangefinding. Our next generation rangefinder engine pushes the envelope forward to reach greater precision at larger distances and with increased speed. Leupold rangefinders with DNA (Digitally eNhanced Accuracy) are able to deliver faster and more precise results, accurate to within 1/10 of a yard – against all background colors and textures.
High Performance Optics
Quick Set Menu

Get the settings you want fast with the Quick Set Menu®. The one-handed controls make RX® rangefinders easy to use in the field, even when your hands are sweaty or the weather is at its worst.
Advanced OLED Technology

The OLED advantage: A major advancement for the RX platform is the significant improvement in light transmission and resolution. Leupold developed a platform to support an Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) display. Instead of looking through a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) as with traditional rangefinders, where the LCD film reduces image quality by stripping out light and reducing the resolution, the OLED display is reflected into the light path of the RX optical system leaving a crystal clear image. When in early morning or late evening low-light conditions, the 3x greater light transmission over competitive LCD rangefinders will give you that extra advantage.

Due to the price and scarcity of ammo for this particular rifle I have not had the opportunity to test fire it, though everything seems functional at least.  As with most Arisaka's the mum has been ground down.  The previous owner added a rubber butt pad.

I'm asking $200 or best offer, and am more than willing to make a trade.  Ideally I would like to find some sks parts, specifically a receiver and barrel assembly (with as many other parts as possible, i.e. trigger assembly, bolt and carrier, gas tube, etc.), but am not looking to trade for an entire rifle as I know this gun is not worth that much.  Alternately I wouldn't mind trading for a decent bolt action .22 or a .30-30.  Let me know what you have and maybe we can make a deal."

The bad -
Impeller will needs to be replaced. Boat will start to over heat if left in idle for extended periods. example, pulling crab pots, a 200 ft line, by the time you have recorded your catch you can see the temps rise. I just kill the motor when we start pulling.

Vacuum plunger gets stuck sometimes and needs to be pressed to get it working right. It doesn't happen often but when the motor is warmed up and it doesn't start on the first crank. This is the issue."

I have done some slight customizing to make the frame and slide more comfortable for long range sessions by rounding off the beavertail area of the grip slightly, taking off the two outside columns of checkering for less tearing on my hands, and rounding the corners of the slide release so that it doesn't dig into your thumb when operating it. All of this is only slight and can be seen in the pics. The gun is a great, accurate little powerhouse."
