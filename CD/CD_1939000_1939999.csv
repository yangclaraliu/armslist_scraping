PS- The flip up rear sight on this in these pictures has been WAY upgraded, that is NOT the sight you will get with the rifle. I also forgot to mention I added a Hogue Oversized rubber grip sleeve, and it REALLY makes a difference. The rifle is actually in its box, with the paperwork and instructions, and was test fired by "" Charlie"" the tech at Beemiller, who fired 3 10 rd. mags of Hornady Critical from it, and it says that it was close to zero'd right out of the box. I fired 1 10 rd mag to zero the iron sights and used a quality bore sighter to zero the laser and reticle."

The real world implications for those who choose GGG ammunition is smaller, tighter, more precise and more accurate groups that are typically more than twice as good as baseline NATO ball ammunition specifications. For those shooters who expect the best, GGG is the ammunition of choice.

For those shooters who expect the best GGG is the brand of choice.

Here are some quotes of what others have had to say about GGG ammunition:

“The Lithuanian NATO (GGG) is not just good but great brass. I would swear it was made by Lapua or Lapua at least set up their plant. Necks annealed, very uniform in weight, slightly smaller internal capacity than Lake City, and capable of extraordinary accuracy once you take the crimp out of the primer pocket. In fact, the NATO load itself is the most accurate military ball I have seen” - Sniper Hide Forum

“I've used the Lithuanian ammo and found it to be the highest quality of any M80 type ammo I've used. Accuracy was superior to WCC and LC M80 ammo that I've used. The brass is good quality also” - Sniper Hide Forum

“It's awesome ammo!! - I've got several cases & wish i had more... it's accurate, clean shooting & boxer primed” - M14forum.com

“The GGG brass is fantastic! Its loads great and is a high quality grade of brass too, nice primer pockets to[…] the brass alone is worth it” - M14forum.com

“[GGG] seems to be abnormally accurate, and the brass abnormally good for reloading” - M4carbine.net

GGG and ADINT offer only 100% authentic brand new manufacture and FULLY qualified NATO ammunition. If you want the real thing and some of the best performing ammunition available, GGG is the only choice. GGG GP11 ammunition produces smaller, tighter, more precise and accurate groups that are typically more than twice as good as baseline military ammunition specifications. Expect the best.

First off, his ad was for Eugen, but he live in Readsport.
   Kurt quoted me a price that I found to be fair. He told me he wanted to do a bill of sale & wanted a copy of my D.L.! I said no problem. We talked two days before our meet, he tells me he wants the cash in all Twenty Dollar bills. I say OK, as I'm thinking to my self ""this guy seems a bit anal"". Today, Kurt calls me 25 hours before our meet. He tells me he ""misquoted me""! He says he did some research & the rifle is worth more than twice the price we agreed on (It is not worth that much). Then he tells me he will ""MAKE IT RIGHT WITH ME"", & gives me a new price, 40% higher than the original price!!!! I told him the gun is not worth what he thinks it is. I then proceeded to tell him the new quote he gave me was at the high end of the guns value. I may have agreed to purchase the rifle at that price from the beginning, but not now!

Not interested in military rifles or rusty hulks or too much in shotguns.  A piece that will interest me likely came to Oklahoma in a duffle bag as a WWII souvenir and has a look just a bit different than most American arms.  It may not have ever been shot in America because nobody could ever figure out what ammo fit and where to get it.  Chances are, nobody has been able to find any info on the maker or identify the piece in a price guide.  Metal work may be engraved; the stock may be ornamentally carved, and the piece will be in pretty good shape.  I might have interest in a similar piece made between 1900 and 1940 or so in another European country.  

If the above describes a firearm gathering dust in your closet that you would like to sell or trade for a more useful modern American rifle, e-mail me a description of what you have, pictures if you have them, and a phone number and time for me to call you to discuss.  If you have an idea of what you want for the piece, that is good to know.  If nothing else, I may be able to tell you something about the gun that you did not know.

Made in the USA.  

The jacket was produced in the late 1980s as an exact replica of a U.S. Army Air Force issue flight jacket by USAAF specs.   All patches are hand crafted and painted by hand by a professional here in the U.S. not silk screen or any other mass produced method. 

The patches were all added back in the 1980s.  The AVG Flying Tiger patches on the shoulder and chest were hand painted on leather in the 1980s by a famous WW2 patch maker.  They are suppose to be faithful to the original design.   

The blood chit on the back is a bit of a mystery.  It was purchased from a military surplus store in the mid 1980s and may possibly be original to WW2.  Its painted on genuine leather as well.  But I can’t confirm if this part of the jacket is in fact original or not, so I’ll selling everything as a very high quality reproduction.  

I purchased this jacket new and wore it only occasionally when I first got it and almost never the last 20 years.  It’s been well protected in my closet and has seen no rain or weather.   Size 42.

I've been asked about the patch that was removed from the front of the jacket and appears to be missing.   That was an unrelated WW2 patch that was originally sewn on when I first got the jacket and was removed when the Flying Tiger patches were added since it would not have been historically accurate. 

I've come down substantially on the price and it pains me to have to sell it this low.   If you're interested, please buy it before I change my mind and just keep it in my collection.

I would consider a trade but trade value would have to be no less then $450 value. Open to offers of guns, toys and services just make it reasonable but cash is always king and I got it priced to sell so please no low ball offers. 
Below is all the techincal jargon for the helmet I took from their web site. 

The Delta 4 Tactical Helmet by Protech combines an ergonomically contoured style with an upgraded four-point adjustable suspension system, shock-absorbing foam padding and a floating mesh crown for maximum air circulation.

The Delta 4 Tactical Helmet is made with multiple layers of high-performing, lightweight, high-tenacity ballistic aramid composites which allows the helmet to meet and exceeds NIJ 0106.01 standards defeating Level IIIA rounds and velocities.

Delta 4 Tactical Helmet by Protech Features:
• Quick-release buckle
• Adjustable moisture-wicking nape pad
• Includes black drawstring duster bag

Level IIIA:
This is usually the highest threat level in soft body armour. It is usually worn as overt style armour because of the weight and thickness of the ballistic panels. However, with the decrease in weight of newer fabrics, it has become viable for covert use.

I recently put a good bit of time into polishing the barrel and the guide rod. Gives the gun a very sharp/clean/intimidating look. I did NOT do mirror finish because I think the brushed aluminum look is very sharp and a bit easier to keep looking clean. The feed ramp has been well polished to a mirror like finish and ammo slides into position VERY easily. Ejects ammo beautifully as well. Has been well cleaned (ask me for pictures of my other weapons and you will see the OCD I have. I am also INCLUDING x2 magazines of ammo which is 26 rounds. This is 230 grain 45 FMJ ammo. I have not experienced any jams, FTFs, FTEs, or any other complications while shooting this gun. Shoots very well and the trigger pull seems even lighter than the 5.5lbs it claims. 

The XDm features: grip safety (1911 style; I prefer this to the Glock angled grip), loaded chamber indicator, striker status indicator (This feature is NOT on a Glock), MATCH GRADE barrel, Major Grasp serrations (front and back of slide), minimal reset trigger (one of the smoothest I’ve felt on a 45) and fixed dovetail white 3-dot sights. 

Pistol package includes: (2) 13-round magazines, 26 rounds of 230 grain 45 ammo, molded holster and mag pouch, mag loading tool, cable lock, heavy-duty plastic case, and owner's manual.

Pricing: This package sells for right around 689.99. Fairly hard to find in the 4.5"". The polishing of the barrel and guide rod is a bit expensive addition @ $50+ from someone and the extra 26 rounds (approx. $10) make this deal very fair."

From Comp-Tac's Site

The CTAC is one of the most concealable solutions to inside the waistband (IWB) carry. The holster body is made of a hard thermoplastic called Kydex. The Kydex retains its shape even with the pistol unholstered. This allows for smooth draws and easy one-handed re-holstering of the firearm. This model is most popular in hot/humid climates due to the material being impervious to sweat or solvents."

Self Locking System (SLS™) Tactical Holster 

The Safariland Model 6004 Tactical holster is built for comfort as well as functionality. This Tactical holster features the Self Locking System (SLS™) rotating hood system which is so well suited for the tactical situations encountered today. The hood on the Model 6004 holster can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. The STX Tactical finish of the holster is rugged, protecting the gun in scrape, scratch and dent incidents. Molded sight track and soft SafariSuede™ protect the gun's sights and finish. A special feature of the Model 6004 is the double leg strap and the leg shroud. These two features combined equal comfort and stability in the holster position on the leg. 
Features the SLS (Self Locking System) rotating hood system 
SLS allows for a smoother, single-motion draw and greater protection against attempted weapon takeaways 
Thermal-molded SAFARILAMINATE™ construction protects handgun and sights

Sterling SMG 9mm Semi-Auto Submachine Gun (MK4 L2/A3) by WISE LITE Arms Texas including two 34-round magazines.

FEATURES -Collapsible/folding Stock, heat guard, adjustable front and rear sight-posts, two 34-round magazines and user manual.
Weapon fires 9mm Parabellum.

If you have never fired a Sterling you are in for one hell of a good time. The original Sterling was designed as a Commando weapon for British and Canadian forces. The MK4 L2A3 was redesigned for civilian use within the United States and features a closed bolt design which jams infrequently and protects the bolt from dirt and grime. This is an optimal semi-auto weapon for both sport and home defense. The weapon qualifies as along-rifle and meets all Indiana and Federal weapons reqs. I will also add two boxes of 9mm ammo (50 rnds each).

This weapon is from my personal collection and is clean and in working condition. 

Feel free to ask questions but no haters please, I will not bother to respond.

Buyer must have valid proof of identity including two forms of photo I.D. and be willing to undergo a standard criminal background check at buyer's expense.

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs."

This rifle, pink in color, is a kids model with a 4x32mm scope attached. For being what it is (a simple rifle to learn on) my daughter and I have had a lot of fun with it. It has worked exceptionally well while shooting at the range since day one. I am listing this rifle at this time as my daughter has moved on to a repeater.

This rifle did an excellent job at teaching my youngster the basics of firearm safety, handling, shooting, sight picture, breathing technique, stabilization and basic marksmanship. It would make an excellent starter rifle for any youngster looking to learn the art, science and pure fun that a day of shooting can provide. The multi step process of a single load, bolt action rifle helps to teach new shooters how their rifle works as well as enhancing the safety of follow up shots.

At this time, the rifle is, clean, in excellent condition and ready to go. Price is pretty firm as I do not have to sell it but wouldn't mind letting it go to a good home.

Accessories included:
-Scope Mounting base
-Scope Rings
-4x32mm Scope
-Swivel strap hardware & mounting stud
-Elastic adjustable strap
-Bipod with hardware
-NCSTAR 2 rifle, heavy padded, zippered soft case with 5 ext. pockets
-1 Box (50 rounds) of ammo to get you started

At a gun shop you wont get out the door with this rifle fully setup, scope installed, sighted in, in a case, ready to go with ammo in hand for less than $300 after the taxes/fees. Spend less and get more for your money by buying lightly used!

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

BERETTA USA CORP Nano Beretta JMN9S15 BU9 Nano 9mm 3.07"" 6+1 Black Grip Black The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano's extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano's magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced techno-polymer. The Nano's sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hex wrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A. Comes in multiple colors.

The gun does have minor wear marks (on the slide - visible in picture) from the kydex holster, but nothing major. It functions great and fires smooth; it is a tad picky in particular with Federal bulk ammo that I've noticed, so it might require more breaking in before it will eat that particular ammo. Other than that, it's a great little shooter; I have no complaints.

I would really like to sell this for $375.00 cash, but would settle for a partial trade of cash and ammo. The ammo I'd accept: 22LR and 9mm priced fair. I will respond to all offers, and if I feel your asking value for the ammo is too high, I will let you know.

The MR Eagle Series from Magnum Research is a joint American/German effort featuring a black polymer frame with integral steel rails imported from Walther in Germany, a 416 stainless steel slide and a 4140 CrMo steel barrel machined in the USA and assembled and shipped from our Pillager, MN factory. The MR Eagle is a striker fire design and is available in two popular calibers, 9mm and the .40 S&W. Additional features include a fully adjustable rear sight for windage, three replaceable palm swells for various hand sizes and shooting styles, interchangeable front sight blades of different heights, hammer forged barrel, full Picatinny rail and internal safety devices."
