The brass i got from someone, most is new.  he primed a few but i never loaded them so i do not know what primers are in the brass.  the brass is from starline so it is small rifle primers.  Magnum primers need to be used with all casull brass.  the leather holster comes with the cartridge belt and then i also have a Bianchi holster for it.  the scope mount is a weigand combat scope mount that is matched stainlss like the revolver with a set of weaver grand slam 1"" medium scope rings..  in total i have 100 pieces of brass.

Diamondback Firearms DB9 Stainless Steel, a micro-compact 9mm automatic pistol made entirely in the USA.

The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

It was made in the famous Soviet factory of Izhevsk. The very early HEX receiver rifles are getting quite hard to find and are stronger and more reliable than the round receiver rifles. It has the original early 2 screw metal sling slots and early original stock for this rifle. This is a fabulous rifle with a barrel that has strong rifling and grooves. The rifle has all matching serial numbers with the mag floor plate electro pencil matched and is in excellent shape! This rifle will make a great shooter. I will ship the rifle anywhere in the country (to an FFL or C&R) but I prefer a face to face sale in Arkansas. I will do a bill of sale requiring DLN and date of birth of Arkansas residents. I will also accept a Concealed Weapons License number on the bill of sale which would eliminate a DLN and Date of Birth. Thank you!

It's a later model, the serial number puts it being made between Dec. 1943 - May 1944.  It also has the bayonet lug so that's another way you can tell it was made later.  The sling I have on it is just a cheapo reproduction one I got on eBay for $13, so not much value in that.

New In Boxes of Dynamic Research Technologies (DRT) .45 ACP 150 grain JHP Penetrating Frangible handgun cartridges. This is live, heavy-hitting ammo. Dynamic Research Technologies lead-free projectile is a revolutionary round. The bullet breaks apart on contact with a solid surface. The DRT handgun ammunition is made to be an all-purpose round, disintegrating into a cloud of dust on steel but yet is effective on an organic target. It is a target and a carry round which can be fired by law enforcement officers without any fear of ricochet or pass through, or fear of injury or death to innocent bystanders from ricochet or pass through. The bullet consists of a powdered core encased in a copper jacket that peels open upon penetration, exposing and dispersing the powdered core. This ammo is brass cased, boxer primed, non-magnetic, and non-corrosive. Comes packed in 20 round boxes. 

We are required to receive a copy of your Driver License for proof of age PLUS any required state licenses for buying ammo.

 This certificate which has been signed by the original purchaser, will entitle you to 1, 4-day class in; Defensive Handgun, Tactical Shotgun or Practical Rifle. If you prefer, you can take a friend and split the training with them by using the certificate for 2, 2-day classes as long as you both take the same class. 

 There is a $50 background investigation fee payable at the time of registration which is not included in this certificate. That is the only money you will be asked for at Front Sight unless you rent equipment from them which I would recommend. They will rent you the necessary equipment for the classes for $100 for the 4-day class. Ammunition is of course extra.

 Check out the Front Sight website and think about making a trip with some friends. Splitting expenses like fuel and rooms will make the trip very affordable. 

 Just remember, you can only use one of these certificates once. After that you either pay the full $2000 or join the resort. The 2-day classes are great but the 4-day class is much more than twice as much. The days are around 12 hours long, but they fly by. The instructors are the most informed, practical and intelligent trainers I have ever encountered. The facilities are first rate and everyone involved is professional in every way.

 Front Sight offers different certificates and promotions from time to time for other classes and things. Sometimes I have those available. If there is something Front Sight related that you desire or need, just ask. I might have something available that will fill your need.

 I have several different types of firearms training opportunities available in my other auctions. Please take a look at my other auctions."

Serial number SH20028

This pistol was made late in 1981, .the barrel is off an ISU Olympic model, and that's were i'm assuming they got the grips.....the ISU's had aluminum slides and were often prone to wear, so it wasn't uncommon for people to swap out the match barrels to more sturdy models since the barrel assembly comes off with either a push button on more expensive models, or in this pistols case, the allen screw on the front of the trigger guard. even pieced together the barrel and grips are worth $400 on there own, so I think 650  is fair if u know these guns u would agree if u want to run the serial number it's SH20028 
you have to be careful when pricing High Standard pistols, with literly hundreds of different models  to choose from only way to get a accurate price is running the serial number which I did
these pistols were built strictly for Bullseye and Olympic style target shooting, and were the standard before all the free pistols started to trickle in. MANY Olympic shooters still use them to this day it has 1 scratch that's noticeable ( see pic) blueing is in good shape and it shoots amazing its insanly accurate $$$650 text or email only REDACTED

I own several firearms of all sorts. This was just project gun to make look nice and to learn the AK weapons system. I am more a extreme range shooter so this was more of a fun side project to me. But completely discounted many claims of AK inaccuracy. I tested it a lot on a lead sled to get rid of any user error and was 1inch groups easily from 100 yards with the tru glo . With irons I was still able to pound a 3 inch steel from 60 ft  until the rounds ate it away."

3X Magnifier Description(not eotech): The 3X magnifying module is specially designed for compatibility with holographic sights and for maximum flexibility and increased performance in the field. This magnifier is a revolutionary tool for military personnel, law enforcement, sport shooters and hunters. When combined with the included twist to side mount, the magnifier gives the user something never before possible – the ability to switch in a split second from CQB (Close Quarters Battle) to semi-sniping and vice-versa. Hunters can rapidly switch from non-magnifying to magnifying while still being able to keep their sight on their platform. This versatile magnifier also can be used as a handheld magnifying monocular for discrete observation and identification.
The included mount for the magnifier is the twist to side mount, which allows for quick attachment and detachment. The mount fits any MIL-Std Picatinny Rail.

G2
The G2® is a high-output flashlight featuring a tough, corrosion-proof Nitrolon® body and bezel. It uses a precision micro-textured reflector and a SureFire incandescent lamp to produce a smooth, brilliant beam with enough power to temporarily blind and disorient an aggressor by impairing his night-adapted vision. Output is either 65 or 120 lumens, depending on which easy-to-install lamp you use—high-output or ultra high-output. The tactically-correct pushbutton tailcap switch provides secure, ergonomic activation control: press for momentary-on, twist for constant-on.

Using every trick Dana has up his sleeve, the Kodiak is truly a beast of a pack with the ability to carry 7000 cubic inches of gear weighing up to 120 pounds. The Overkill Guide Frame combines the added stability of the Overkill Yoke and the comfort and weight transferring ability of the Five Segmented Lumbar Wrap with the absolute best internal framing. A classic top loading design with dual draw cord shroud increases weather resistance and allows for upward expansion. The Daypack Lid separates top load into two compartments for better organization and load control. Built-in shoulder straps convert the lid into a day pack complete with ports for a hydration reservoir. The SpeedZip sleeping bag compartment can handle the largest winter bags while remaining easy to close. Plus it can be sucked flat to reduce the size of the packs volume for smaller loads. Side zippers provide great access into the pack. From backpack hunting in Alaska to extended missions and expeditions all over the world, one word describes the Kodiak- overkill.
