TACTICAL PRECISION, For 2012, SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our new SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable
operation and function.

**Please note that this is the updated Gen 2 model with side folding stock giving it superior feeding and reliability over the Gen 1 model**

Here are the package details: 
- Walther P22 Platinum Pink edition
- Kydex adjustable under-the-steering column holster
- 2 extra magazines
- 100 rounds of CII Stinger 22 LR ammo

The gun does have minor wear marks from the kydex holster, but nothing major. It functions great and fires smooth; it is a tad picky in particular with Federal bulk ammo that I've noticed, so it might require more breaking in before it will eat that particular ammo. 

Other than that, it's a great little shooter - I have no complaints. I'm asking $425.00 OBO for everything."

Someone had shot Ringo and left him for dead. Found by Tangee Sullivan, Ringo is nursed back to health only to find that he is now in a middle of a Water Rights land deal. Ringo does what he does best. Following Ringo as he meets, George Armstrong Custer, Wild Bill Hickok and tries to stay alive. 

From the Book:

Ringo flexed his right hand and slowly moved it toward the Navy Colt. His eyes narrowed and he focused on the men. He figured that Hayes would make the first move. 

“This not a fair fight and you sons of bitches are not going to get away with it!”

The men tensed when they heard the voice behind them. Ringo smiled, knowing who had spoken those words. “This is no concern of yours friend,” stated Hayes. 

“I’m not your damn friend,” was the reply. The five men slowly looked over their shoulders and saw Wild Bill Hickok standing by the Livery Station. Hickok had a gun in his hand and his other hand on the butt of his support pistol.

Purchased this in June and decided that I want to build my own so I am selling this one to help fund my new project.

Rifle is in pretty good condition.  The front sights are not in the greatest condition but that is due to the age and the coating technique, it isn't anodized.  See picture.

Lower is a PWA and from what have found it is a Pre-Ban lower so it was made before 1994.  Not so much of an issue here in Colorado but could help if you move to another state where there are higher restrictions. 

Case is included and is in good condition.  It is an AMS Inc Made here in Longmont.

No Magazines included.  As much as I think the new law is STUPID I will still follow it.  Sorry.

I do not have a round count through the rifle.  I personally have about 60 rounds through it and it operated flawlessly.  

I would like to meet here in Longmont at Shadow Ops Weaponry to perform the transfer.  The $10 transfer fee will be paid by the buyer.  If buyer passes I will take the $10 out of the final price of the rifle.

If you have any questions please let me know."

Includes extra string and leapers crossbow red dot scope. 

TOP SELLER - POPULAR CHOICE The Koda-Express hunting crossbow in 185 lb draw weight is an exceptional choice with an attractive combination of speed, weight and ease of use. Easier to cock than heavier weight bows but still delivering plenty of energy down range. This is the bow we most often choose for the whitetail woods. Includes an illuminated 3x32 scope with aiming points at 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 yards. Includes rope cocking aid and destringing aid. Available in Mossy Oak Break Up, Black Night Weave, or Desert Digital Limbs, as well as either Black or Tan stock and pistol grip. Some hunters quickly narrow down their choices to the Koda-Express or Bravo Zulu. The ballistic differences are not huge --- we will recommend the Koda-Express more often to shooters in their late 40's to 80's who are average build and will be cocking their crossbow for years to come. Larger body hunters, younger hunters, or even older hunters who stay fit and have upper body strength choose the Bravo Zulu. There are no hard and fast rules. A 76 year old man visited Kodabow one day and asked for a Bravo Zulu. We suggested he start by looking at a Koda-Express. We knew we were in trouble when he said, ""Sonny, I work out every day and the Bravo Zulu will be no problem for me."" The bottom line is that you will shoot a crossbow you can cock easily far more accurately. Most of the folks who work at Kodabow shoot the Koda-Express. When an outdoor writer talks to us about evaluating and shooting a Kodabow, most of the time the choice is the 185 lb Koda-Express and it is one our MOST POPULAR crossbows. (Please specify limb decoration and stock and pistol grip color in the ""COMMENT"" section when placing your order.)"

The FEG is a aluminum-framed Hungarian Walther PPK clone. Mine is in great shape, except for a worn magazine. I'm only selling it to get something smaller for daily carry. Make me an offer.

Long version: It is the same size as a PPK or maybe even a little smaller, but lighter because of the frame. It was made in Hungary, imported by K.B.I. The design is a faithful PPK copy; the machining is smooth; the bluing is nice and deep. The gun itself is very reliable and accurate. There's nothing fussy about it. I've only put between 300 or 400 rounds through it (yay ammo shortage) and used it as my CCW for 5 months. I added tiny orange dots on the tiny sights, which does help the sight picture, but you can take those off if you want.

I love this gun. I just need something smaller. The only beef I could think of with the body of it is that the mag release doesn't spit it out with energy, just lets go so you can pull it out.

The magazine is worn. The metal is too soft and the top edges that feed the bullet get splayed apart with daily unloading and reloading, which could then feeding/ejection issues. A quick squeeze with some pliers fixes it temporarily, but it's going to keep happening with enough use. You should probably replace the mag if you're going to use it daily.

The guy that had before me had a Gunsmith check it and he said no cracks or any reason to worry. Two very small scrapes on barrel but no rust and Bluing is very good. Overall the gun is very impressive. An accurate rifle and plenty of punch. I have two boxes of magnum ammo also.
