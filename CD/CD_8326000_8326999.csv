It ran flawlessly and it has around the same recoil as a 9mm because it's an all steel gun. The holster took 6 weeks to arrive due to lead times and has only been carried for a week. I'm selling these because I found myself still preferring da/sa firearms for concealed carry and am looking to get a sub-compact 9mm.

Take a little of this as hypothesis, commonly grounded in watching the market carefully for the beyond few years. You have to have some records and context to apprehend how we came.Rewind a year or to a few very enormous products in Nvidia's product lineNVIDIA - GeForce GTX 970.These cards were not reasonably-priced. Oh, they had been wonderful, to an quantity, however the NVIDIA - GeForce GTX 970 become $ 379.ninety nine! And the Titan Black becomes $999. And the largest problem with that became that the overall performance you acquire out of them didn't exhibit excessive value. You got higher overall performance out of NVIDIA-GEFORCE GTX 970 on the market in SLI than you got out of a Titan Z in most applications... the price / performance curve became highly set against these very costly products.Nvidia turned into pushing for greater steeply-priced and greater special merchandise. They were the excellent and they knew it. In order that they charged a top class for that. But easily, those ""premium"" cards were not there to get humans to shop for expensive cards. They were there to assist Nvidia promote GTX 780s. In the end, a GTX 780 for $650 looks cheap while you put it next to a GTX Titan! By using developing an overpriced product, they got the marketplace to peer a higher fee proposition within the product they genuinely desired to promote.More information please visits our website:-https://www.crypto-coin-x.com/cryptocurrency-mining-equipment/nvidia-geforce-gtx-970/605"

Also have 2 of the original stripper clips for this gun (very hard to find!). I have fired about 100 rounds through it, works as it should.  It's a take down rifle, can be stored in a small case for transport.  No cracks in the wood, only minor dings, as expected for a 103 year old hunting rifle.  The price includes 5 boxes of original commercial and antique ammo, the Peters ammo (3 boxes) was specially made for Remington model 8, the later model 81, and model 14 and 141 rifles. I have about 35 rounds of reloads (I reloaded the ammo made by PCI and Reeds, never shot the vintage ammo) plus another few boxes of ammo made recently by PCI and Reeds ammunition of OKc.  So, there's plenty of brass here for reloading as the 30 Remington is no longer commercially produced (although PCI and Reeds still produces the round, we are fortunate to have Reeds ammunition so close in OKC).  A version of this rifle was used by Frank Hamer to end Bonnie and Clyde's run, so besides being a John Browning design it has historical significance for other reasons.  Easily reloaded using 30-30 data, I use a Lee Classic Loader (can be obtained for $35 or so on eBay) and have enjoyed this rifle, but I want to move on to other firearm endeavors, otherwise I would keep this little rifle as it has been a unique piece in my collection and a conversation starter at the range.  These have been listed on other sites for this price just for the gun, but with this you would get ammo and brass without having to do anything but provide the other common components.  Serious inquiries only."

The echo mode is a pull-release funtion, firing when pulled and once released. You may disable the echo mode by switching back to semi or safe with your finger to depressing the trigger to not fire the second round. The echo functions similarly to the Franklin Armory binary trigger but is more reliable and the bolt can not be outran. This is more consistent and more reliable than a bump stock and has a faster possible rate of fire. You will need a M16 bolt carrier group to use this but otherwise it will work with almost any AR.
