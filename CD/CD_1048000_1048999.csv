The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

I will sell this as a lot only. Part it yourself if you wish. I paid $113 (Gunstop) for the brass and $438 for the bullets. The Golden Saber bullets last sold for $31/100, you can only get them in loaded ammo, and you will see this price is less than current retail. No 40, so it must go. Please reply. Any offers for trade must be a fairly liquid price. Thank you."

I just bought a 2013 Chevy Silverado and had a lift kit and new wheels & tires installed.  The stock wheels & tires are now sitting in my garage collecting dust, so this is your oppertunity to get a great deal and not pay retail price!!!   The wheels & tires are stock Chevy 18"" 5 Spoke Machined Silver w/ Goodyear Wrangler P265/65R18 112T.  This package is brand new with only 18 miles on them!!!!  If you bought these from the dealership they would cost you approx. $2,100 without installation.  You might be able to find them online for around $1,700.  Will fit any 2007 - Present: Avalanche, Tahoe, Silverado, Sierra, Suburban.    I have all center caps and lugnuts as well.

What many people do not know is that these pistols were built on a competition frame.  The weight and balance help to manage recoil very well and it is very accurate.

This is the pre cross bolt safety. The rifle has been parkerized a few years ago due to some surface rust on the gun. The finish is now matte and looks good. The wood has no checkering and is of slimmer proportions than the new Marlins. The rear sight blade was removed for the installation of a scope and has since been lost. The rifle comes with scope base and rings in the photos. This is a great handling and shooting rifle and is of better quality than the ones that Marlin/Remington is producing today. This is a hunter and not a safe queen. The wood has not cracks and only one very small chip but has several scratches in the finish. $400.00  Call or text REDACTED
