*********************************************************************
ELIMINATE ALL DOUBT.
Compact, accurate and completely trustworthy, the REC7 is designed specifically for situations in which thereâs no room for error. Styled in the familiar AR configuration, itâs a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anythingâincluding your life.

This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine.

The REC7 rifleâs dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance.

The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face.

******
The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The boltâs gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance.

At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance.

The REC7 rifleâs forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 hardcoat anodized. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle.

In 5.56 NATO and 6.8 SPC, the REC7 is everything youâd expect from a Barrett rifle, and then some.
******

I also have much, much .223 and 5.56 green tip ammo, some in bulk, some in unopened ammo cans (for xm855) and unopened boxes (for Federal .223).  Will negotiate ammo if interested."

 from the nice people that have messaged me ive figured out some of what im into, no hunting rifles, nothing single shot, not an AR (I don't subscribe to thinking there will be a ban, so I don't think AR's are worth more than their msrp), no revolvers longer than six inches, absolutely no limited editions (I want something I can shoot), not interested in polymer lowers.

 not one of these are for sale, not in a week not in a month, so dont ask.

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50Â° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

The EPIC Airâ¢ Combat Helmet Liner System takes protection to a whole new level. EPIC Airâ¢ features the unsurpassed level of impact protection you expect from a Team Wendy ZorbiumÂ® helmet liner, with new features that greatly improve comfort, fit and stability. The design incorporates three main pads (front, rear and crown) for impact protection, an assortment of new ergonomically designed comfort pads and patent-pending Air Channelingâ¢ technology to keep you cooler. EPIC Airâ¢ also comes in a variety of cuts and sizes to fit any style of ground combat helmet and is compatible with all styles of communications headsets. The Replacement System includes hook disks and alcohol wipes to upgrade a helmet from a sling suspension system. The sizing for EPIC Airâ¢ depends on your helmet cut.

The  Holographic  Weapon  Sight  (HWS)  is  the first electro-optic sighting system to apply holographic technology to small and medium-sized weapon platforms. When used in close quarter battle environments, this revolutionary weapon optic delivers amazing speed and accuracy gains, an uncompromising use of peripheral vision, leaves no muzzle side operator signature and is packaged in a compact, durable unit. Now deployed with elite Special Forces and SWAT teams the world over, the HWS delivers a vastly improved shooting performance for all levels of operators. In holography, all the information required to reconstruct the reticule image is recorded everywhere in the Heads-Up Display window. If the window is obstructed by mud, snow, rain etc., the HWS remains fully operational, with the point of aim/impact being maintained.  Even in such extreme cases where the laminated window is sheltered, the HWS is fully functional!"
