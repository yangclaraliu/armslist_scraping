I'm open to about anythingText REDACTED   Tenpoint product number C09047-7342 Oem detailsDescriptionAll TenPoint Series crossbows are made with a group of Core Performance Features that ensure accuracy, dependability, and durability regardless of the model you purchase. While our top-of-the-line models include additional premium features and benefits that make them undeniably the best in the industry, our Core Performance Features are the foundation upon which the entire series is built. - Patented VIBRA-CUSH- Patented DFI- Quiet MIM ambidextrous automatic safety- OTT limb-pocket and Zytel- ACUdraw-Ready FST Stock (Requires hand crank)- ACRA-ANGLE Barrel- Power Limb-Tip Caps- PBT Performance Cable Saver- Advanced Quad-Limb Technology- Ambidextrous Automatic Safety- Tunable Synthetic Cable Yokes- Heavy-Duty Riser Rod and Trigger-Housing Clamp-Plate Titan HLX Specifications:Dollar for dollar, the best crossbow value in the industry, the NEW Titan HLX is a faster, enhanced version of TenPoint’s longstanding workhorse Titan. The Titan HLX’s new bow assembly features powerful 175-pound HL limbs equipped with Fast Flight™ string and cables and machined aluminum wheels, upgrading the Titan’s speed to a blistering 300 fps. To improve accuracy and handling, its Verton molded combination FST IV stock and barrel design now houses TenPoint’s premium 3.5-pound patented Power Touch-10 trigger, commonly accepted as the best trigger in the industry. Double-dip fluid imaged in Mossy Oak Treestand, the Titan HLX, now more than ever, defies its classification as an entry-level model by outclassing and outperforming other brand’s top-of-the-line models. The Pro-40: A zero-power 40 mm multi-dot scope with an integrated, adjustable 7/8-inch mounting system that requires no rings. Its three illuminated dots, calibrated for 20, 30, and 40-yards for crossbows that shoot in the 300 fps range, can be rendered in red or green to suit individual hunting and light conditions. The light intensity of both color views is regulated by a five-position rheostat"

Open reflex optic with a super crisp 2 MOA dot and/Or 65 MOA ring. I like this optic more than the Eotechs I’ve had in the past and the battery life is incredibly long at 50,000 hours (5-years) AND it has a solar panel so anytime there is enough ambient light, the battery won’t be getting used at all. Better clarity and battery life than most expensive optics on the market. Holds zero better than my Aimpoint and Eotechs: literally it I took them off and put them back on in the exact same spot and my shots were about 3-4 inches off. Never had to re-zero ANY of my Holosun optics that have the QD mount. I’ve also torture-tested my own Holosun optics and they hold up... PERIOD. Obviously I’m not trying to sell a beat up optic haha! But this one is a spare, so... MAKING SPACE! This particular optic is 1 month old. They go for $300 at their cheapest and my price is $250 FIRM. No trades, no lowball offers... wait no.
