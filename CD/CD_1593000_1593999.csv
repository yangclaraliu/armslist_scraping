Comes with 4 factory P245 magazines.
Has factory SigLite night sights that work fine. Not brand-new bright but far from useless.
Couple of small nicks, one on the front of the grip and a couple on the slide that don't penetrate the finish (see pics).
Very minor holster wear. Probably not visible in the pictures.

251,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1593251,For Sale:  Solar Powered Generators,"Front Range Pueblo to Loveland, Colorado Springs, Colorado","$ 1,697","Listed On: Thursday, May 9, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"To view video go to www.wepreppers.com

1) Back up power when you need it most - It’s called a “solar backup” because it’s designed to come to your rescue when power trouble starts and your lights go out. Run a small refrigerator (high efficient ones are best) to keep your food from going bad or even run a sump pump in the basement if you have to get rid of excess water.       

2) Portable Power - If the going ever gets too tough where you are and you decide to “get the heck out of dodge,” you simply throw it in the car and take off to a safer destination, knowing you have power wherever you go.       

3) Replaces gas generators - No noise, no fumes, no maintenance and most importantly… no fuel required.  Simply roll it to whatever location needs the power and start plugging in appliances.  It has a massive maintenance-free battery as well as an indestructible outer case.  (It weighs about 65 pounds.) It’s a solid piece of equipment that will last a lifetime       

4) Generates permanent power - The unit provides 1800 watts of electricity at peak power.  That’s enough to run many appliances in your house.  The unit stores power and makes it available when you need it.  The generator is recharged constantly by the sun allowing you to use the system and charging it at the same time.  Many users choose to keep appliances plugged in permanently to reduce electrical costs and help pay for the unit       

5) Multiple uses - You can use your solar backup to run essential appliances when emergencies arise. You can recharge phones; run shortwave radios, televisions, lights, fire place or furnace fans, as well as computers and printers. Plus, if you need to work in the woods at the cabin or in a boat, you can use the solar backup to run power tools, trimmers, blowers and coffee makers.         

6) Plug and play means instant power - The emergency backup system comes ready to go. Just start plugging in your favorite household essentials...         

7) Life-Saving Power When you need it most - Great for powering aquariums, CPAP machines, small refrigerators/freezers, alarm clocks, security systems, whatever you need to live comfortably when the power goes out.       

8) Emergency Backup Power for Communications - Access the latest weather changes even when the rest of the neighborhood looses power. Powers AM/FM radios, televisions, shortwave radios, cell phones, computers, and other telecommunication devices.     

Would consider, 2 credit card payments.

This is a semi-automatic shotgun with a Pro Mag 20 round Drum and a 5 Round Factory magazine. I did not convert this gun (meaning move the trigger group forward) I bought the more expensive parts and left the gun unmolested. These guns are great but notorious for a few common issues mainly with the gas system. Almost every part in the weapon has been upgraded and replaced with the best parts available. Most of the parts count towards the 922R compliance standard. This gun will come with all the factory parts that were replaced as well. All of the parts were purchased from either Carolina Shooters Supply or Mississippi Auto Arms. 

The following parts were changed:
*JTE performance power main spring - Dramatically smooth’s and improves trigger pull while maintaining the same factory full power striking force
*DPH 6 Position adjustable Gas Knob.
*CSS Peformance Recoil Spring designed for all 2 3/4"" shells
*CSS Performance G2 Puc is engineered to keep your gas system working in optimum performance
---The combination of these 3 parts will help your gas system run ALL 2 3/4"" shells
*Tromix extended bolt on charging handle
*Tromix full power factory recoil spring
*Axis retaining plate - Secures the trigger pins in place
*Shepards Crook axis retaining spring
*New Tromix axis pins
*Tromix Muzzle brake with breacher and lock nut – Greatly reduces muzzle rise and sounds great.
*Tromix heavy hitter firing pin and spring
* Chaos Extended quad rail – Simply amazing
*Recoil Buffer – Black Jack buffer to protect your Saiga internals. Good for 1000 rounds (est.)
*Collapsible ATI talon Stock with Pistol Grip and receiver block – Very high quality not plastic junk. Nice and sturdy with a cheek plate and ¾ inch Buffer. 

In addition to all the parts the following internal work has been completed also. 

Full polish job on the bolt made to look like glass by Pauly Steelin’ Customs. Looks great and makes the pull incredibly easy. Check out his shop site at http://forum.saiga-12.com/index.php?/topic/61900-paulys-glassbolt-reliability-resistance-reduction-system/

4 Gas port gun re-drilled to the correct angle and size

Any questions please ask. I am only interested in the trades that I have listed. I am open for offers but not desperate. This gun has a lot of time put into it. If you know anything about Saiga’s or have atleast done your homework than you know that all of this work does not come cheap or easy. I’ve had my fun with the gun now I’m on to the next build. I will ship to an FFL only and prefer FTF transfer with a bill or sale. I only accept cash. No scams, checks, money orders, or western unions."

Owned for about 2 or 3 months. Shoots great and is cleaned regularly. Only reason we're getting rid of it is b/c we just purchased a Glock26 that both my husband and I like and feel comfortable using. Comes with two magazines (one holds 13 rounds the other holds 19), two different holsters (OWB), two additional back straps, a magazine loader, gun lock & two other items (not sure what they're for but looks like they attach to the bottom of the magazines). Please keep in mind that this gun IS NOT LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA and I'm pretty sure New York. We're also selling a custom leather IWB holster that my husband purchased for the gun as well. It's very thin/flexible (comfy basically). My husband likes to wear it at the 4 o'clock position. $550 for both gun and holster. Please feel free to call, text or e-mail. Thanks. REDACTED"

This is the sought-after and extremely rare LWRC IC Limited Edition (#47 of first 500 made) Cerakoted in Flat Dark Earth with fluted barrel! Comes with letter of authenticity.


The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.

All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.


The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight.

The new Individual Carbine family from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward.

The Aimpoint PRO (Patrol Rifle Optic) was designed with the input of current and former professionals to create the most dynamic Red Dot sight available. Featuring band-pass lens coating, the PRO is compatible with every generation of night vision devices and provides a crystal clear 1x image for quick target acquisition in close quarter situations. The modular QRP2 mount securely attaches to standard picatinny rails and includes a removable spacer that provides optimal height for co-witness with iron sights on carbine style weapons. Additionally, the QRP2 incorporates a torque limiting knob to completely eliminate over tightening. You won't need to worry about turning the battery on and off with the PRO. The 3-year battery life allows you to turn the unit on out of the box and leave it on for an always ready sight. Other features include a see through ocular lens cap and standard objective flip-up lens cap that are both recessed to prevent impact damage, a rugged 30mm tube, threaded objective bell for use of ARD (Anti-Reflective Device), 4 Night vision settings and 6 daylight settings, battery and adjustment cap retainers to prevent them from being lost in the field, and a ten year pesronal use warranty.

I have several Kahr pistols and, in today's economic times, I can use the same one in my nightstand as in my car.  This pistol actually isn't officially broken in yet.  Kahr says it takes 200 rounds to break on in.  I've fired 100 rounds through this pistol.  Just look down the barrel with the borescope pic.  There is zero wear or deposits in the rifling.  Face to face locally.  I'd prefer you have a LTCH, but insist you have proper ID.  This is a CHEAP price for a high end Kahr.  Again, it's not a economy ""KW"" series Kahr.
