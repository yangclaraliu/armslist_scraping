When the U.S. Marine Corps went shopping for a shotgun, they bought the M4 — the 12-gauge shotgun that functions the first time, every time. Its unique Auto Regulating Gas Operated (A.R.G.O.) system developed by Benelli engineers has dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons located just ahead of the chamber that operate directly against the bolt assembly.

The M4 Tactical comes standard with a Picatinny rail for optics, a fully adjustable ghost-ring rear sight and fixed-blade front sight and a black synthetic pistol-grip style stock. An optional standard stock is offered. With features and reliability that do it for the U.S. military, the Benelli M4 is an excellent choice for your own home defense plan.

It will come with original case, paperwork, lock, the two extra back straps and three 15rd glock factory mags. Also trigger guard has been professionally undercut to allow you to get a higher grip purchase. I am only looking to trade for a few things that I will list below all other offers will be ignored and I'm not interested in cash. The only reason I want to trade is that I carry this regularly and now that it is summer the gen4 grip is rubbing me the wrong way literally. The gen 4 is about $100 to $150 more that the gen 3 and its worth it for the reduced recoil due to the double recoil spring so I think anyone who trades with me will be getting a good deal.

I have the gun itself with the factory 7 round magazine, an additional 8 round mag for it that extends the grip as well, the 'pinky' baseplate for the 7 round magazine, and the factory case.  I'll also be throwing in the pocket holster I have for it - its just a plain neoprene DeSantis holster.

This gun is the commercial version, and the 6th variant (there were six model variants?). The Ortgies pocket pistols were made (officially) from 1919 to 1924. This particular gun (according to the serial number) was made around 1922-23. The Orgies semi-automatic pistols were excellent, well made guns. The design was ahead of its time. This gun has the factory original 7rd magazine. Overall, this gun is in very good condition. Has all matching numbers (barrel, frame, slide). Bluing is in really good condition for its age (this gun is at least 90 years old). All original finish, not re-blued, or anything like that. Has factory wood grips. The grips has no cracks, splits, or damages. Has a few minor dents and dings. Barrel is in very good condition - has a few minor surface rust. Bore is in very good condition. Has a a few minor rust (the Germans or people back in the old days used highly corrosive ammo). In addition, there's an old Ortgies owner's manual. It's really worn out, tattered, but all the pages are there (but not intact - it looks like as old as the gun itself). You must be at least 21 years old or older and have a valid Kentucky driver's license (KY CCDW okay) to buy/trade this gun. Local (Kentucky) sale/trade only. No shipping out of state. Just email me with any questions. Serious inquiries only please. Thanks for looking.

 -- Below is an excerpt from one of the Ortgies websites. It is not my own. I am just giving a credit to the author/creator of that particular website. You can do a google (or yahoo) search on this particular pistol on the internet. There are several Ortgies websites on line --

 "" The Ortgies pistol has a number of unusual design features. The most obvious is its grip safety which, once squeezed, stays in the “fire” position without further pressure of the hand on the grip. A button on the left side of the gun allows the grip safety to pop back out. Since the grip safety is powered by the striker spring, the safety can only be popped out, i.e., placed in the “safe” position, when the striker is cocked. Hence, if the safety is enabled, the gun is cocked. When the grip safety is enabled, the sear is prevented from moving downward and the tension on the striker spring is reduced. Pressing the safety- enabling button also allows the slide to be lifted off the frame rail for disassembly. The striker serves as the ejector. ""

Gun comes with the following:

- 70 rounds of non-corrosive ammo (50rds of American Eagle FMJ and 20rds of Speer Gold Dot hollow points)
- 2-7rd aftermarket mags (brand new, cost $40 each, not pictured)
- 1-brand new reproduction firing pin (not pictured)
- owner's manual (original)

 -- $400 obo, or trade --

The condition seems really good for how old it is. The wood could use a little refinishing on it but there is no major damage anywhere on the gun. It has a weaver G6 Scope on it. It's been bought and stored for most of its life. This one was made before the serial numbers were put on the rifles. The code on the barrel dates this to 1948 which is the first year of making these guns. Call (541) Two Seven Zero-9364. I am asking 200 on it which is my final price and pick up is a must unless you want to pay for shipping to your ffl dealer and your ffl dealer will accept a shipment from a non ffl holder.

314,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1861314,For Sale:  SILENCERS FOR SALE!!! Reduced waiting times using Eforms!!! MILITARY WELCOME!!! MANY BRANDS TO CHOOSE FROM,"SW, Lawton, Oklahoma",$ 1,"Listed On: Monday, June 16, 2014",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"We have silencers for .22LR that start at $149.00, silencers for AR-15's/5.56 calibers that start at $425.00, and 7.62mm silencers that start at $499.00. We are now using ATF's new Eform system and it has reduced the wait time from 10 months to 3-5 months. Hurry and get yours before the wait time gets bumped back up.Our prices are typically below MSRP and we have silencers that can fit anyone's budget. Military is welcome to purchase suppressors as long as you are PCS in Oklahoma. If you chain of command allows it you can take these on deployments since we know that only the ""cool guys"" get them issued. You never know this could be the piece of equipment that helps save your life or someone else. It helps reduce recoil, keeps your situational awareness, and reduces your muzzle signature when you fire. These are just a few reasons that they could benefit a combat soldier. I sale all major brands of silencers so if you have a special request just ask. It is now legal to hunt with silencers in Oklahoma so get one before the wait gets longer. Anyone who can buy a handgun should be able to qualify for a silencer. I will complete all paperwork for you and make the transfer a smooth and easy process. If you decide to put your suppressor in a trust which I recommend, I can assist you with the process and you won't have to get the CLEO sign off or fingerprints. ATF has proposed to start making trusts also get the CLEO sign off and fingerprints but it is not in effect yet so hurry before the process gets more difficult. Transferable MAC 10 Machine guns typically start at $4500.00 and go up from there. The process for transferable machine guns is the same for silencers, and YES civilians in Oklahoma can own machine guns and you only have to pay the one time $200.00 for the ATF tax stamp when you purchase it. I am an experienced class 3 dealer and if you have any other class 3 or NFA needs or questions please contact me at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED. Leave a message in reference to what you are calling about if I don't answer and I will call you back ASAP. Thanks.

I just purchased this Para 1911 Expert Commander yesterday. It is brand new, unfired and I bought it from a firearms shop in Vancouver, Wa. I like it, but wish I had purchased a Sig, Kimber or Colt. I can show you the sales receipt if you'd like to see it. I paid $730.00 for it, but I would really like to trade straight across (or maybe throw in little cash) to get a Sig, Kimber or Colt 1911. I'm willing to trade for a nice used one, but it must be in good condition. I'm not interested in anything else so please don't offer to trade for something I haven't listed above.

I will sell this pistol for $730.00 cash. No, I will not take less, I will just keep it if I cannot sell it or trade. If you have any questions about this model, you can do a Google search. It comes with two 8 round magazines, case, paperwork, take down tool and lock. Everything it had yesterday when it was brand new.

I am off work the rest of the week so give me a call, text or email if you are interested in this pistol. The simple truth is I should have spent a little more and bought the pistol I wanted instead of this model and then adding new grips, sights, etc.... By the time I do that, I will be spending the same amount.

I am located in Washougal, WA.

Thanks,

Maybe other trades, but I must warn you, I'm kind of a gun snob. So only high end stuff will be considered. Please send me your number and I'll contact you if you have further questions or offers. Thank you.

Glock 26 Gen4 9mm Pistol - 10rd 
GEN 4 Features
The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested
•	""Safe Action"" system
•	Durable exterior finish
•	Cold hammer forged barrel
•	Durability
•	Reliability
•	Light weight
....that make GLOCK firearms famous!
The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back straps) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size.
The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin.
The grip angle of the GLOCK ""Safe Action"" Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol.
The smallest back strap is integrated in the G17 MBS reducing the trigger distance of the standard size G17/G22 frame by 2mm. The medium back strap is a 2mm back strap offering equal size of a standard G17/G22 frame. The large back strap is a 4mm back strap.
The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine catch allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts.
Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps.
Features
•	Gen4 G26
•	(3) 10rd Magazines
•	Reversible magazine catch
•	Rough Textured Frame
•	2 Back Straps
•	Revolutionary ""Safe Action"" Design
•	""Baby"" GLOCK, the smallest GLOCK pistol

I have never fired steel ammo from this rifle either. I am in no hurry to sell. Please do not low ball. If you are not prepared to make a reasonable offer, please do not take time to respond to this posting. Gun/Accessories all included. Will not ship, will not travel far to meet. Must be an AL resident over 21 and be willing to sign a BOS.

This gun is in 99% condition. I bought it new locally and put under 100 FLAWLESS rounds through it, installed Hogue grips, its a sweet shooter! Has the rounded triggerguard, dovetailed front and rear sights, accessory rail underneath, and captured recoil spring and guide rod assy.


No marks or damage.  I have installed a metal SRT (short-reach trigger) that I bought on the Berettaforum.net Classifieds, it replaces the poly coated stocker (included) with a metal trigger with a slightly shorter reach.


This gun shoots great and has fantastic fit and finish. I just find it a tad too large for my hands, my Cougar 9mm just fits my hands so much better. Comes with all factory kit including box, case and 3x 17rd mags, factory plastic grip panels and Hogue rubber finger groove grips. (TLR-1 light in some pics is NOT included)


Will trade for: XDM pistol (9mm preferred) or XDS (9mm or .45, no matter). Low rd count and comparable condition to my Beretta. I would still entertain a higher-rd count or worn-finish gun, if you would toss in some $$ towards the deal."

Selling with one magazine and single-point tactical sling

The optics on this rifle are top-notch and if you know anything about AR accessories you know Aimpoint are some of the best. This rifle has an Aimpoint CompM4 Reticle and an Aimpoint 3x Magnifier on a swing mount for close and long range accuracy.

These optics ALONE retail for over $1300 and are in pristine condition
The only reason I'm selling it is because I need the money for a trip and this is the only thing I can bear to part with.

Thanks! Will entertain trades, but I won't take any lowball offers. Looking for trades/cash upwards of $1500, the rifle and optics are EASILY worth $2000

I expect this to sell within a week at this price
Thanks for looking!

If you're only interested in the optics I'll sell them as a pair with the mounts for $950"
