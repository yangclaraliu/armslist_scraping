It has NEVER HAD ANY ACCESSORY MOUNTED OR USED AS A DEMO.  This is a PERFECT CONDITION, BRAND NEW IN BOX Remington XP-100R.  I bought two of these and always intended to stash one and sell later, so here it is.  I have never handled it other than take it out of the box once to initially inspect it and again, to photograph it for this auction.  It has remained in a climate controlled bank vault for the duration of its existence. 

It truly is in PERFECT condition.  No optic, sights or bipod have ever been attached to it.  The gun is in the same brand new condition as when I purchased it new over 13 years ago.  This is a heavy-hitting caliber and would be suitable for hunting large game, as a covert tactical sniper handgun or for the sport of simple target shooting.  This was the one and only year the XP-100R was made in this configuration and because of that, I am certain they will be very desirable collector firearms in the future.  Finding one in UNFIRED AND FACTORY NEW IN BOX version like this is even more rare.

Barrel length is 14.5"".  Internal magazine holds 4 rounds.  Comes with factory box and all documentation as received from the factory.  Will ship in a second protective box.  I don't know the production numbers for the different calibers but I have seen mostly the smaller calibers for sale in these models.  I HAVE NOT SEEN MANY 1998 MODELS IN .35 Remington as this one is."

It has a new oil pump and seals. It is a 1992. The 305 has always ran so good that I have not been in a hurry to finish it. It has a polished intake. It is now on an engine stand. I would need at least  $600. If purchased with Elcamino I will drop the price some.

This is one of the coolest scopes on the market. It has a built in range finder and a drop compensator. It can be operated with controls on the scope or by a remote (included). Very easy to program- just put in your zero and pick your bullets drop from the burris ballistics table (included) and the compensator tells your how far you need to raise up for the range you measured by putting a red dot on the bottom crosshair. I have been able to get 3 inch groups @ 600 yards with a remington 700 .308 using this scope. 
Comes with everything in the picture. Factory sunshade, flip up open caps & factory caps, burris balistics table, burris scope cleaning cloth, mounting hardware and tool, and original packaging.
Scope works perfect and comes with lifetime warranty from Burris. I am open to trades. Text or email me what you have.
***contrary to popular belief this is a legal scope to hunt with. I have verified with Sheriffs and state police. The misconception is because its illegal to hunt with a scope that projects light which this does not***"

Built on the SE122 frame, the SE12 Tactical shares important characteristics: a strong but sensitive gas system that cycles reliably with a wide range of loads; an action bar milled from solid steel; a convenient magazine release that allows you to extract unfired shells from the magazine without cycling the action, an added safety feature.
Fiber optic front sight, fully adjustable rear sight; stock adjusts from 11"" to 14.75"" length of pull; sling attachment points; extra shell storage in the stock. Super strong flash suppressor unscrews, allowing barrel to accept included modified and full extended choke tubes (ideal for Turkey hunting). 2-year manufacturer's warranty.
Super strong action bar is milled from solid steel stock and joins the power bushing in an interlocking fit. Extra-wide O-ring is secured in a channel forward of the gas ports, reducing slippage, wear and loss.
Ingenious reversible piston assures perfect cycling with the full range of factory ammo: light target to 3"" magnum loads.

Would put trade value at the cash price for the following LNIB handguns:
Glock 19/23/26/27/30 3rd or 4th gen
Walther PPS/PPQ 9mm
Ruger LCP with CT Laser plus a few bucks
XDm 3.8 compact any caliber or XD subcompact
Beretta Nano plus cash, PX4 Subcompact
And others.  I'm flexible and have plenty so nothing is out of the ordinary.  I have CCW, so if you have a pistol you don't want anymore, just ask!

No Taurus, Keltec, Hipoint, lower end stuff."

For sale is a like new Sig 1911-22. I bought this gun for plinking 6 months ago and love to shoot it; however, I just ordered a new ar-15 and have to clear up funds. It shoots awesome and has the same ergonomics as a true 1911 but at a fraction of the cost.

The condition is like new with about 500 rounds through it. It comes with all the Sig factory gear and one mag (only came from the factory with one mag).

In the picture the frame looks green, but it is not, it's more gun-metal in color.
In Edmond.

Very firm on the price. Please do not contact me with lower offers. It's a fair price on a Sig that comes with a lifetime warranty from the Sig factory.

Calling or Texting works best.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

BECAUSE BEAUTY AND FUNCTIONALITY AREN’T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
SIG SAUER® pistols have long provided their owners with peace of mind. Now the SIG Sauer Custom Shop Equinox series adds pride of ownership to that feeling. The distinctive polished slide flats and nickel controls contrast with the dark-coated surfaces for a visually arresting two-tone appearance. When combined with its practical features, the Equinox series is pretty to look at and beautiful to shoot.

The P238 Equinox®, it’s just a fraction of the size of our ful-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® rear Night Sight and Tru-Glo Tritium Fiber Optic Front Sight. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine"

I'm looking for something to simply carry in the tool box while I work I'm not looking for something fancy or anything that come's with a high price tag as it will be kept in a tool box. Preferably something cheap ( Hi Point, Kel Tec, Jimenez or similar )
I'd prefer 2 magazine's to accompany the handgun Not applicable to revolvers.
I can provide 2 forms of ID and will sign a BOS if needed.
I would prefer a local deal if possible but willing to travel some depending on the deal.

If you have something along this line let me know as well as your asking price.
I'm not looking to spend more than your handgun was worth new when you bought it If I can buy it new for less than your willing to sell it Don't waste your time in responding to this as you won't get reply. Naturally doesn't apply to offer's where accessories are included but I won't pay new price's for used accessories either.

The reason I'm looking for something cheap is it's going to be kept in my toolbox and more than likely show that it has after awhile and if it break's or something get's messed up I'd rather it be done to an inexpensive handgun rather than a 500+ handgun.
Sorry for being so long with this I just want to be as straight to the point as I can."

I would judge the overall finish to be in the 90% range.

I belive my price is fair.  I dont care what you bought one for 10 years ago.  I honestly dont.  Have you priced them lately?  Much less 30-06 ammo?  the ammo alone is going for a dollar a round.

I am not really looking for trades, but if it is something interesting then shoot me an email.  There is a little wiggle room on price, but if someone offers me my asking price, I'm taking it.  Not gonna hold the rifle for 2 weeks after you have haggled the price.  I'm also not driving halfway across the state to meet you.  Shipping can be arranged.  Unless you want to pay my gas, then I will not drive more than an hour and a half.

If you have neither, I will have to run a background check using BeenVerified. If you have any felony convictions, you need not apply as it will waste both of our time.

The subject of this review is my own Bushmaster XM-15-E2S that was made in Windham, (I got mine!). It is an A3 model with an A2 style fixed buttstock, handle sight, inch heavy barrel with 1 turn in 9 inch twist rifling, bayonet lug, birdcage flash suppressor  16 inch and it came with a 30 round magazine.
This Bushmaster rifle is chambered for .223 Remington and 5.56mm NATO rounds and is marked as such, so both may be safely used. I don't recommend that these rounds be used interchangeably in any firearm that is not specifically marked for both. There are many that believe that the .223 Remington and the 5.56mm NATO round are the same but in fact they are not. According to Small Arms Manufacturers Institute, Inc, (SAAMI), it is unsafe to fire 5.56mm NATO rounds in firearms chambered for .223 Remington. If you do a little Google searching around the Internet you can find the technical information related to that subject if it interests you. Be careful and only use the ammunition your firearm is designed to fire safely. new in box trade value 1600 352.634.2084  16inch"

Internal magazine holds 4 rounds. Comes with factory box and all documentation as received from the factory.  RARE IN .35 Remington.  Drilled and tapped from factory to accept open sights or scope rings.  A bolt action handgun legendary for its accuracy.

Purchased brand new, this is an UNFIRED Remington XP-100R high power REPEATING bolt action handgun in .35 Remington. This is a PERFECT CONDITION, BRAND NEW IN BOX Remington XP-100R. I bought two of these and always intended to stash one and sell later, so here it is. I have never handled it other than take it out of the box once to initially inspect it and again, to photograph it. It has remained in a climate controlled bank vault for the duration of its existence.

This is a heavy-hitting caliber and would be suitable for hunting large game, as a covert tactical sniper handgun or for the sport of simple target shooting. This was the one and only year the XP-100R was made in this configuration and because of that, I am certain they will be very desirable collector firearms in the future. Finding one in UNFIRED AND FACTORY NEW IN BOX version like this is even more rare."

This is a like-new, Yugolsavian M76 8mm sniper rifle. It is an AK 47 design and will most likely be banned due to its ""assault"" nature, with hand grip and flexibility of magazines. It comes with the ZRAK ON-M76B scope and scope cover, hard case, 10 round magazine and manual. I am the second owner of the gun and have only shot about 20 rounds through it. I have another one that I am keeping and it is an amazing gun. Ammo is cheap and if you don't know the balistics of the 8mm, look it up. 800 yards is reasonable for an average user. Here is one review on it.

The Hi-Point .45. I had originally bought this gun as a home defense weapon. I was living in an apartment in a shady part of town and I was on a budget. Naturally, Hi-Point was my only choice. Now, for the good, the bad, and the ugly. I will rate each on a 1-10 scale for each point. 
First the bad...the gun is a mild nuisance to take apart. You have to take a pin out of the middle to take down. There will be no taking it down at the range without a small hammer and punch. Not the big of deal to me, I just thought I would mention it. Rating (5). 
Second the good...if you are on a budget and want .45 stopping power, this is the gun for you!! (10). I have shot this gun out to 50 yards hitting 4 inch plate steel no problem!! Accuracy rating (10)!! 
And finally, the ugly. Well...that's just it....the gun is ugly. There is no denying it. It is heavy, clunky, and ugly. But the good thing is that if you run out of ammo you can bludgeon someone to death with 2 or 3 blows tops. Let's be honest, you're on a budget, you want something with a better reputation than a Jennings, and you want .45 stopping power. I have loved this gun for its stopping power and accuracy. And you know what....every time I have taken it to the range, everyone asks about, everyone wants to shoot it and everyone is amazed at how accurate it is! So remember, if you are on a budget, if you want the most reliable handgun in that price range, and you want accuracy and stopping power, this is the gun for you. Text me at REDACTED. Or email me at REDACTED

P.S. Comes with everything in picture. Gun, one mag, trigger lock and tool, half box of ammo
 Check budsgunshop.com to confirm new price. Also I have less than 100 rounds through the gun. Gun brand new is $171. Leg holster was $25. So the price for everything new was just under $200. I am letting it all go for $125. The picture of the paper target is me shooting the .45 at 30 yards!!! All rounds through the head! Pretty impressive if you ask me.

As a side note I also have a Hi-Point C-9. A great, compact gun chambered in 9mm. That package comes with gun, one mag, trigger lock and locking tool, hip holster. Brand new gun $175. Hip holster $20. Total package brand new is just under $200. I will let this package go for $125 also. 

You can have both for $225."

The subject of this review is my own Bushmaster XM-15-E2S that was made in Windham, (I got mine!). It is an A3 model with an A2 style fixed buttstock, handle sight, inch heavy barrel with 1 turn in 9 inch twist rifling, bayonet lug, birdcage flash suppressor 16 inch and it came with a 30 round magazine.
This Bushmaster rifle is chambered for .223 Remington and 5.56mm NATO rounds and is marked as such, so both may be safely used. I don't recommend that these rounds be used interchangeably in any firearm that is not specifically marked for both. There are many that believe that the .223 Remington and the 5.56mm NATO round are the same but in fact they are not. According to Small Arms Manufacturers Institute, Inc, (SAAMI), it is unsafe to fire 5.56mm NATO rounds in firearms chambered for .223 Remington. If you do a little Google searching around the Internet you can find the technical information related to that subject if it interests you. Be careful and only use the ammunition your firearm is designed to fire safely. new in box trade value 1600  16inch"
