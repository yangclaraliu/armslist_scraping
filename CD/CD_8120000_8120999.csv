This is a cool historic pistol. The gun was made in Spain for Germany during World War 2, and about 60,000 pistols were made, although only the first 10,500 were delivered before the liberation of France cut off the supply lines between Spain and Germany. The remaining pistols were primarily sold after the war to West Germany for police use, with a smaller number being purchased by the Portugese Navy. This pistol is however missing some safety components (safety catch detent, detent spring, safety catch, mag safety spring, and mag safety). Parts numbers 16,17,38,40,41 on Numrich.

The barrel has been shortened and all metal has been refinished. The wood may or may not have the original finish but has no splits or cracks. There are some small dings and scratches and chips and someone has carved a small “W” on the left side near the receiver. The bore has some light pitting but is bright and has plenty of rifling remaining to make a good shooting rifle. The action is tight and really feels good when you work the lever with no play or sloppiness. To sum up here you are looking at a good tight Winchester model 1886 with a decent bore that should make a good shooting rifle.

This rifle is absolutely a master piece and beautifully balanced with the fluted bull barrel that is nitride coated. The trigger is unbelievable and the Sako name speaks for itself. Comes with original box and tool.  This rifle is a safe queen and in perfect condition. Sako® A7 Roughtech Big Game Bolt-Action Rifle is designed for hardcore big game hunting. The unique Roughtech synthetic stock is made from an aluminum-reinforced frame covered with a high tech polymer that ensures precise, rigid bedding for the action, while reducing weight. The design makes a very light and exceptionally strong stock that enhances the rifle's accuracy potential by providing a solid platform for the action and minimizing flex. The Roughtech stock comes with a HI-Viz recoil pad, and spacers to adjust the length of pull. The Sako A7 features a solid steel receiver with a 3-lug bolt that only needs a 70Á rotation, allowing for rapid cycling of the action and keeping the shooter's fingers and gloves from between the bolt handle and scope. The bolt has a plunger ejector and a reliable Sako extractor. The receiver is drilled and tapped for the included 2-piece Weaver®-style rail. The single-stage, adjustable trigger has nearly zero perceptible creep, and breaks clean and crisp at the shooter's desired weight of pull. The A7 comes with a 2-position safety that locks the bolt when engaged, and a dedicated safe unload button forward of the safety switch that unlocks the bolt while the safety remains engaged for safe unloading. The A7 utilizes a single-stacked, detachable magazine, made of polymer with integral steel feeding lips that allow top loading without removing the magazine from the rifle. A medium contour, fluted, stainless steel barrel with a hand-cut target crown produces precision accuracy. The A7 Roughtech Big Game Bolt-Action Rifle combines years of Sako's experience of manufacturing fine firearms with new innovations and modern materials to produce an incredibly rugged, and superbly accurate hunting rifle.615 934 zero 347"

I have plenty of rifles already. Up for grabs is a deer rifle that I put a big scope on and never sighted it in.
 
About 20 years ago it seems, my father bought this rifle new for me from Van’s.
 
Synthetic stock. Shorter barrel. I may have hunted with it 3 times open sights. Killed one deer.
 
In this for sell deal, is the slightly expensive big scope that I added, but didn’t sight in and all the ammo that I have for it.
 
No trades.
 
Take it or leave it.
 
In the 1960s, my dad won a Winchester 100 .284 rifle. The rifle will be up for sale soon. It is a collector’s item.  It was his favorite gun. He has taken many deer with it. All that to say, I had planned to just to sale the barrel off this rifle (or buy another 700) and put on a custom .284 barrel to keep the .284 caliber alive, but my kids aren’t interested in maintaining my dad’s love of the .284 and now I am playing with building ar-15 / ar-10, so I am going to list this gun.

Rifle, sling, 4) 5 round clips / mags 1) 30 round magazineThis is a comment that I found on the Internet: “This rifle will NEVER-EVER be imported to the U.S. in any variant EVER again. All of mine have a beautiful ""blond"" stock, checkered grip, rubber recoil pad (like you'll ever need it) and matching blond checkered fore-grip. The rifle is very well made and is extremely accurate and reliable. (I ran 200 rounds through my first one to see if heat would cause the cyclical bolt to fail, or misfeed and it ran through 2 drums and one magazine as fast as I could pull the trigger) What you have is a very rare AKvariant, that is not being made anymore and the price will continue to climb. Buy the rifle, run some mil sup or Tula, Wolf, Bear ammo through it, then some good, quality hunting grade rounds and there is little difference. It's a great investment as far as the return.”I had another one of these. I took it to a local gun show to see if anyone knew more about this rifle. A guy followed me around until I sold it to him. It is very unique and will get look great in your collection. You can see pictures of the same type of rifle on gunbroker. If I list it on gunbroker, then I have ammo that I will have to sell separately and it is a collector's item as well. I thought I'd offer it in the area 1st before I look to sell it online."

Yes you can slam fire this one!!! The other thing that this one has is it barrel this one has the vent rib barrel. Looking to trade but not for any shotguns. I’m not sure of a cash price because they are all over the board apparently the barrel can be sold for more than the gun. I originally got it because it could slam fire no other reason. I ended up taking it hunting a few times I like that it ejected out the bottom. I’m torn on getting ride of this one but time to thin things out so... I’m asking $650 but please feel free to make a cash offer but I prefer to trade. Wife said to down size Pistol trades are the best but always up for a good deal. Not scared of multiple gun deals and + or - cash as well.

I’ve had the gun for about 3 weeks and took it out shooting for the first time those past weekend to shoot it and it’s just not for me. It’s a blast to shoot. Very loud. I bought it as a truck gun on an impulse buy and it’s just a little overkill for that. I bought 100 rounds for it and put a full mag and half of another through it. So 40-50 rounds. I’ve had one before and I REALLY want to like them more than I do. Comes with a box and 1 30 round mag. This is the 2017 model so the wood is finished nicely.  I had zero issues with it (not that I’ve put enough through it to test) but it’s an AK it works. The brace is very comfortable. A lot better than the original brace that looked like a melted tire.this is considered a pistol so CCW/PPP is required. Must meet local in Cary.all laws apply. $700no trades
