Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

This is a good shooter in 22lr. It has the micro-groove barrel. The value in good condition is $175-$200. without the scope in normal market times.
This Marlin model 60W has a BSA R3-7x20 Scope and mounts attached.

Of course the gold Trigger and gold Medallion are not the precious metal gold, but they are gold in color. The rifle has scratches, mars, etc., but for its age and use and price, you should expect that. If you want it almost perfect, then refinish the stock.

I am only asking $140. for the Marlin Model 60W with the BSA Scope and Mounts.

This rifle can be for inexpensive fun shooting or can help provide food in rough times.

This early 1953 gun has a factory blue finish with polished flats and matte slide top and undercarriage. It has fixed sights and the desirable ring hammer. The magazine is Colt-marked on the bottom. The factory grips are brown plastic with the Rampant Colt emblem. These early Commanders, obviously, pre-dated the Series 70 and Series 80 guns. The pistol has some tiny service marks and faint holster wear, the grips are in great shape, and overall condition is close to 95%. The pistol has a shiny bore with strong rifling, and trigger pull is exceptionally smooth. This is a very collectible Colt Lightweight Commander, it will really enhance a good collection!

The revolver features a 4 inch barrel, checkered Herrett's Custom grips That feel awesome in your hand, six shot capacity, smooth wide face target trigger, case colored hammer, and Accro micro adjustable target rear sight for elevation and windage. I would rate the revolver in great condition for its age, but please see the pictures below to judge for yourself.Given on-line auctions can never match the hands on experience of examining and inspecting a particular firearm for purchase in person; The Trooper MK III was intended by Colt to be one step below their Python flagship revolver. While the MK III finishes were not as deep as a Python, this example is still mirror bright and the action is very smooth. The bore is also bright and shiny and the revolver is perfectly in time and locks up good and tight. The trigger pull is very clean and crisp breaking at just over 4.5 pounds.I tried to take detailed pictures to show this nice pistol as best as I could. Buyer pays 35.00 for shipping.

This is a pistol version (8.5"" barrel) of the HK 91/G3 made by PTR Industries out of Connecticut---they have a great reputation for making a spot-on semi-auto version of the German Army G3 rifle, and they came up with the idea of this pistol-length firearm with no buttstock.  I bought this with the expectation to turn it into a SBR or to install a full-auto sear and register it under NFA but my plans have changed.  This gun is brand new in the box, never fired except to proof at the factory, and comes in the factory hard case with all paperwork and accessories.  It came with 1 20rd magazine, but I'm including 2 more for a total of 3---all are brand new in the wrapping.  These are very hard to get right now, as they are great candidates for people going the SBR route, so they're going on Gunbroker for around $1500 or so---I'm not looking to skin anyone, so I'll set a firm cash price of $1350 as described---I have other magazines available if the buyer wants some more as well.

Overall, the finish is about 97% with some scratches due to handling and use on the range. It is in perfect working order but does have extraction issues with some factory and reloaded ammo (see below). I have fired about 20 rounds through the rifle and found that some ammo (notably Federal black box XM33) tends to get stuck in the chamber and requires a cleaning rod to remove. I also found that some reloads I purchased from TMI also would not extract without cleaning rod assistance. Other types of ammo, notably Summit, PMC, and Brazilian surplus, have no issues extracting.The recoil of the rifle is significant (comparable to a heavy 12 gauge load) Heavy AR-15 Hammer Spring (to reliably ignite the .50 BMG primers)Upper Receiver Details: -Bohica FAR-50 MK III upper with 36 inch fluted blued barrel, standard .50 BMG chamber, and factory Bohica muzzle break -Bohica factory steel adjustable bipod

Rare Springfield Armory M1A Super Match .308/7.62 sitting in a McMillan stock from the factory.

The Springfield Super Match M1A is a semi-automatic rifle chambered in 7.62 NATO or .308 Win. The M1A is a civilian version of the famous M14, which was once a standard issue US military rifle and known to be very accurate and reliable. Springfield offers eight different models of the M1A.

The Super Match is very similar to the National Match, but the difference is the Super has a Douglas air gauged heavy match barrel. Air gauged quality means designers pushed air through the barrel and measured the amount that escaped. The process determines the tolerance (or consistency of design) of the bore. It basically proves the barrel shoots accurately and keeps a tight seal on the propellant gases as they push the projectile out the bore. It also has a rear lugged receiver that increases

The Super Match is gas-operated, so propellant gases are captured by a tube near the muzzle, which directs the gas into a valve on the bolt, and the gas pushes the bolt back so it can eject a spent casing and chamber a fresh round.

Its features include a national match two-stage trigger that sets off the action with a 4.5- to 5-pound pull. A match hooded rear sight aperture that’s like looking through a pinhole. It’s also adjustable for windage and elevation. It has a fixed blade front sight. 


Springfield recommends the Super Match for precision and competitive shooting.

This rifle does use some AR parts like the pistol grip, stock and trigger allowing for them to be changed. The magazine on this rifle comes in a 5 or 10 round proprietary magazine.

The innovative Noreen Bad News .338 Lapua ULR provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. Weighing just 13 pounds, the Bad News .338 Lapua ULR is light enough and portable enough to serve as a patrol rifle, yet it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles.

The rifle’s custom muzzle brake and semi-automatic action significantly suppress recoil. With no bolt to manually work, the smooth action semi-automatic action allows the shooter to keep his head in the scope and his eye on the target for rapid, accurate follow-up shots. In the AR tradition, the Bad News .338 Lapua ULR disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reassembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle virtually seamless."
