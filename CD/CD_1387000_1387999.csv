Integrating patented 2011 technology with classic 1911 design, the STI International Executive is a high capacity pistol that carries John Browningâs design into the 21st Century.

Based on our legendary Edge model and built on the patented modular steel frame with polymer grip, the Executive delivers the traditional features of a 1911 and allows the added benefit of high capacity magazines. The innovative frame design preserves the 17Â° angle of the grip in relation to the slide, original to the 1911. The essential design element for high capacity, the polymer grip, allows for double stack magazines without over-sizing the circumference of the grip, which remains comparatively the same as the circumference of a 1911.

True to 1911 tradition, the Executive has a unique full length slide with front and rear cocking serrations, Dawson fiber optic (.100) front sight for quicker target acquisition, and an STI adjustable rear sight. The Executive comes standard with features such as a stainless steel STI knuckle relief hi-ride grip safety, stainless steel STI ambi-thumb safeties, and an STI stainless steel fully supported ramped bull barrel. The Executive comes hard chromed, so not only is it the most accurate and reliable handgun on the market, it is now one of the most beautiful. The Executive ships with one 126mm magazine."

SINCE I HAVE HAD NUMEROUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE âPRE-BANâ HERE IS A LITTLE INFORMATION I HOPE HELPS EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND BETTER

The TEC-9 and, eventually, TEC-DC9 variants were listed among the 19 firearms banned by name in the USA by the now expired 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB).[1] This ban caused the cessation of their manufacture, and forced Intratec to introduce a newer model called the AB-10, a TEC-9 Mini without a threaded muzzle/barrel shroud and limited to a 10 round magazine instead of a 20 or 32 round magazine. However, it accepted the high capacity magazines of the pre-ban models.
 The Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB), or Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, was a subtitle of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a federal law in the United States that included a prohibition on the manufacture for civilian use of certain semi-automatic firearms, so called ""assault weapons"".[1] The 10-year ban was passed by Congress on September 13, 1994, and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton the same day. The ban only applied to weapons manufactured after the date of the ban's enactment.
 In the former U.S. law, the legal term assault weapon included certain specific semi-automatic firearm models by name (e.g., Colt AR-15, TEC-9, non-select-fire AK-47s produced by three manufacturers, and Uzis) and other semi-automatic firearms because they possess a minimum set of cosmetic features from the following list of features below:
 â¢ Pistol Grip (Tec 9 has)
 â¢ For end Grip (Tec9 has)
 â¢ Flash Suppressor (Tec9 has)
 â¢ Grenade Launcher (does not have)
 â¢ Magazine that attached outside of the grip (Tec9 has)
 â¢ Folding stock (does not have)
 â¢ Bayonet Mount (does not have)
 During this ban, your weapon was legal with only 2(TWO) of the accessories. As you can see this PRE-BAN weapon has 4!!!!!

II. The Tec-9 Is A Semi-Automatic Version Of A Military Submachinegun

 The TEC-9 is a semi-automatic version of a military submachinegun. Although it has been marketed under various names -- the KG-9, the KG-99, the TEC-9, and the TEC-DC9 -- and by various companies owned and operated by the Garcia family, the basic design of the weapon has remained virtually unchanged. The company decided to manufacture the KG-9 because of the growing market for military style guns in the United States. The KG-9's manual described it as: 
Combining the high capacity and controlled firepower of the military submachinegun with the legal status and light weight of a handgun.The term ""assault pistol"" was coined by the firearms industry to describe the KG-9 was an illegal machine gun, due to the ease with which it could be converted to fully automatic fire.


A. The KG-9 Was Banned as a Machine Gun, and Renamed the KG-99

 In 1982, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms ruled that the KG-9 was an illegal machine gun, due to the ease with which it could be converted to fully automatic fire.

 The company redesigned the KG-9's bolt to make conversion more difficult, and renamed the weapon the KG-99. Otherwise, the design remained essentially unchanged. Intratec confirmed that like its predecessor, the KG-99 could be fairly described as ""combining the high capacity and controlled firepower of the military submachinegun with the legal status and light weight of a handgun.""

 Intratec U.S.A. (""Intratec"") manufactured a vertical foregrip for use with the KG-99, which it marketed as an ""Assault Grip."" Intratec used the term ""Assault Grip"" in marketing the foregrip, ""[b]ecause you basically hold the gun with two hands like you would as assault weapon, a military weapon.""

 In November 1982, and again in March 1985, the ATF notified Intratec that it was unlawful to possess a KG-99 and an attachable foregrip, even though the pistol and the foregrip were disassembled. Although Intratec understood that they should not be selling the assault grip, he continued to sell it as an accessory for the KG-99, stamping on the order form that ""ATF has ruled that the KG-250 assault grip may not be attached legally to the KG-99 or the old model KG-9.""

 B. Intratec Rename the KG-99 the TEC-9, and Continued to Sell the ""Assault Grip.""

 Intratec renamed the KG-99 the TEC in August 1985. The TEC-9 was substantially identical to the KG-99, with just a few cosmetic changes. The company resumed marketing the assault grip without any warning, advertising that it ""Attaches to All TEC-9"" Intratec advertised the TEC-9 as a ""High-spirited"" weapon that is ""as tough as your toughest customer."" The companyâs brochure emphasized the weaponâs ""paramilitary"" appeal, its ""Military blowback design,"" and its ""Combat-type"" sights. The brochure depicted a smoking target of a human being shot dozens of times through the head and the heart in what appears to be a fusillade of automatic weapons fire. In April 1987, Intratec was sued by the Estate of David Bengston in Connecticut state court. The complaint alleged that the decedent, a school custodian, was fatally shot in the head with a TEC-9M [""Mini""], and that Intratec ""knew or should have known that the TEC-9M gun was and is primarily suited for an/or used in criminal activity,"" and that it ""lacks legitimate use, such as sporting, law enforcement of self-protection."" In November 1987, Carlos Garcia formed Navegar in order to take the assets of the business back from his father and avoid Intratecâs liabilities. Navegar continued to manufacture and market the TEC-9, and continued to do business as Intratec. Intratec U.S.A. declared bankruptcy in 1989, with the Bengston and Alicki lawsuits as its only significant liabilities."

I have a excellent Sig P220 Combat. It is an excellent gun and shoots great.

 I have the box, manual, 6 mags and it comes with a lasermax guide rod with Wolf spring. Has very bright night sights and FDE color. Also includes 2 holsters, Galco leather holster and Carbon Fiber Black Hawk holster. Mags are 5 8 rounders and 1 10 rounder.

 This is an excellent set up and a gun that is not easy to find. Nothing will be split up and it all goes or nothing goes.

 Sig made this weapon for military testing:
Designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards, the P220Â® Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the militaryâs Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIGâs NitronÂ® finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in NitronÂ® which easily passes the militaryâs accuracy requirements â even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the militaryâs 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITEÂ® night sights.

For trades on handguns, only 9mm & .45 and full size only. No compacts or sub-compacts

 Trades are 1911's, Sig's, HK's, possible rifles include heavy barrels in 7mm, .300win.

 Rem 700 CDL SF in 30-06, or similar cal.
Ruger 5.56, Colt 6940. If you want double what they are worth don't bother. 

 Please don't LOWBAL AS YOU WILL BE IGNORED, Look up all that comes with my gun. THINK before you offer something.
 If you make an offer please tell me what it is. Just don't say I have a Smith

Information on laser:
Lasermax  internal with Wolf spring and have original. Laser is constant pulse and dead on at 25 yards.
For: SIG SAUER P220 .45 ACP - Not compatible with P220 Carry models
Completely internal! Keep your holster, keep your tact lights, keep your favorite grips.
Extremely rugged. LaserMax internal guide rods meet or exceed both Mil-Spec and Homeland Security durability test standards (drop tests, blowing sand, temperature and humidity extremes, salt water fog, deep water immersion, 20,000+ rounds live fire).
Installation takes minutes. If you can field-strip your gun, you can install your LaserMax sightâNo gunsmithing required.
*Hi-Vis Pulsating Beam. Pulsating gives effortless awareness of muzzle direction, transcends language barriers. Can be used outdoors from dusk till dawn, or indoors round-the-clock. IR versions optimized for NVG characteristics.
*Alignment. The Internal Guide Rod lasers come permanently aligned from the factory* for center-of-mass accuracy at 20 yards. It will never drift out of alignment. There is no need to re-zero after changing batteries.
*Accuracy. As close to the bore of the firearm as possible, positioning allows for the closest and most consistent relationship between your point of aim and point of impact (POA/POI) over all shooting distances. Especially useful for moving targets.


I am putting the whole package at $1550 which is considerably less if you went and bought it all. That is just a little over for just the price of the gun and laser. The mags are almost $50 each. The holster is $70. So it is more than fair.

This rifle does use some AR parts like the pistol grip, stock and trigger allowing for them to be changed. The magazine on this rifle comes in a 5 or 10 round proprietary magazine. The innovative Noreen Bad News .338 Lapua ULR provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. Weighing just 13 pounds, the Bad News .338 Lapua ULR is light enough and portable enough to serve as a patrol rifle, yet it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. The rifleâs custom muzzle brake and semi-automatic action significantly suppress recoil. With no bolt to manually work, the smooth action semi-automatic action allows the shooter to keep his head in the scope and his eye on the target for rapid, accurate follow-up shots. In the AR tradition, the Bad News .338 Lapua ULR disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reassembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle virtually seamless. The Noreen Bad News .338 Lapua Ultra Long Range Rifle includes a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship for 1 year.

I sold 3 boxes of .45 on here a few weeks ago for EXACTLY what I paid for them...no reason to screw over a fellow man. 

Same goes with AR's or any other ""Assault Weapon"" (I hate that term.) A gun that cost maybe a grand new and people are trying to screw everyone else out of $1500 or more. 

Please stop paying people's outrageous prices and maybe it will start getting better."
