We will cover multiple scenarios that could occur in your everyday life and how to appropriately respond (an intruder in your home, carjacking in a parking lot, purse snatching, assaults, targets advancing on you, moving targets, etc). These scenarios will be in a live fire environment where you will be improving your skills and techniques involved in drawing your concealed weapon and engaging a target. This is a vital aspect of carrying concealed that is rarely addressed, and without practice or knowing how to respond, the delay in decision making can mean the difference between success or failure. You will be enhancing your skills in drawing from concealment, point shooting, tactical positioning, firing while moving, firing from a vehicle, flash sight picture, shooting from cover, and moving after shooting. 
The purpose of this class is to build your skills as a Concealed Weapons permit holder and practicing the skills needed to use your gun in a defensive confrontation. Additionally, we will cover aspects of carrying concealed that are not discussed in the basic CWP class such as; identifying potentially dangerous persons/situations, awareness, how to react in adverse situations, and practical exercises related to everyday situations. Being prepared and ready for a confrontation is the first step to winning. Through practical experience on the range, skill building, and being prepared you will lessen the probability of becoming the target of criminals. 
A large portion of the course will be on the range. At least 200-300 rounds will be fired. You are encouraged to bring the firearm you carry to the class along with your concealed carry holster. This will allow you to make better decisions on how to carry your handgun based on your physical size and method of carry. If you desire to use one of our guns to get a feel for a different style we will have the appropriate ammunition for the gun (price varies per caliber).

33,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1661033,For Sale:  Advanced CWP Course,"Horry and surrounding counties, Florence, South Carolina",$ 100,"Listed On: Thursday, May 23, 2013",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Advanced Concealed Weapons course is an 8 hour class implementing a defensive gun handling course and the ability to develop skills necessary to be successful in a deadly encounter. We will cover multiple scenarios that could occur in your everyday life and how to appropriately respond (an intruder in your home, carjacking in a parking lot, purse snatching, assaults, targets advancing on you, moving targets, etc). These scenarios will be in a live fire environment where you will be improving your skills and techniques involved in drawing your concealed weapon and engaging a target. This is a vital aspect of carrying concealed that is rarely addressed, and without practice or knowing how to respond, the delay in decision making can mean the difference between success or failure. You will be enhancing your skills in drawing from concealment, point shooting, tactical positioning, firing while moving, firing from a vehicle, flash sight picture, shooting from cover, and moving after shooting. 
The purpose of this class is to build your skills as a Concealed Weapons permit holder and practicing the skills needed to use your gun in a defensive confrontation. Additionally, we will cover aspects of carrying concealed that are not discussed in the basic CWP class such as; identifying potentially dangerous persons/situations, awareness, how to react in adverse situations, and practical exercises related to everyday situations. Being prepared and ready for a confrontation is the first step to winning. Through practical experience on the range, skill building, and being prepared you will lessen the probability of becoming the target of criminals. 
A large portion of the course will be on the range. At least 200-300 rounds will be fired. You are encouraged to bring the firearm you carry to the class along with your concealed carry holster. This will allow you to make better decisions on how to carry your handgun based on your physical size and method of carry. If you desire to use one of our guns to get a feel for a different style we will have the appropriate ammunition for the gun (price varies per caliber).

Would be willing to sell just the gun, or just the optic. Email me to discuss. 
I bought this new less than 2 years ago, put a TON of work and money into it. 
It started life as a Rem 700 Sendero in 300 WM. 
I've got a Leupold MK4 6.5-20 Illum reticle mounted to it with a Nightforce 20MOA canted base and Nightforce lightweight rings. Nothing cheap, all high-end.
No expense was spared on this and it shoots .5MOA all day long out to over a thousand with 210 Berger VLD's, so long as the shooter holds his wind correctly.

It's got a JP enterprises custom muzzle brake blended into the barrel with a new match crown. Kicks a bit less than a .308 and you can spot your hits. 
The bolt itself and the large custom bolt handle have been fluted and painted to match by Twisted Barrel out of Wyoming. I spent a ton of money on these cosmetic features, they look awesome. Probably hard to tell from the iPhone pictures. It may look dirty or blurry, but that's just the camera. The gun is in excellent condition, no scratches or scrapes. Really. It's pristine.

The stock and Detachable Mag are H-S precision; it's their top of the line stock. Spent close to a thousand for these 2 items alone! 
Timney 2lb trigger along with the stock pro-mark trigger are included. 
The gun was $1600 new, and with all the accessories, custom machining and optic, I've got easily $5K into this. Not including dies, brass and ammo. 

I have just shy of 500 rounds through this and have a darn good load developed that shoots at long distance very well. 

Really, it's a shooter and doesn't need a thing! Only selling because I've got the long-range bug and bought a .338 Lapua. 

Any questions, shoot me an email or call REDACTED. Make me an offer!

The Pelican case, Bipod and Sling DO NOT come with it. But, everything is for sale, so money talks... 
Thanks for looking!"

...........FREE SHIPPING IN TEXAS..........PAY WITH PAYPAL..............
One of the finest AR-15 / M16 mags on the market today. Extremely reliable and durable and at a great price. By collecting input from military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters, TAPCO has designed a magazine that can be depended on from a trip to the firing range to deployment overseas. Molded of reinforced composite with aggressive horizontal ridges that provide increased gripping surface for insertion and extraction of the magazine in wet or muddy conditions. This also helps to eliminate feed lip separation. The anti tilt follower has been designed to allow more dirt and grime to pass than any other magazine on the market. This allows the magazine to keep feeding ammo, despite loose dirt or sand that may have entered the magazine. The spring is made using a 1770 Stainless steel wire, featuring a unique shape for smoother, quieter loading through all 30 rounds. It also reduces overall stress on the magazine body, preventing spine cracks. 30 Round capacity. Fits All AR15, M4, and M16 Variants. Made in the U.S.A. with a lifetime warranty from TAPCO"

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

Features:

Polymer Tip

The polymer tip increases the ballistic coefficient and also initiates dramatic expansion upon impact – even at velocities as low as 1600 fps.

Higher Ballistic Coefficient

Hornady® combines the sharp, pointed polymer tip with the most aerodynamic profile for a high ballistic coefficient. The V-MAX™ profile also provides the maximum bearing surface for added in-flight stability.

Swaged Lead Core

The swaging process allows for precise formation of the core up and around the tip, with a cavity under the tip's stem. This allows the tip to build up energy before smashing into the core, causing dramatic fragmentation of the core and jacket.

Precise Boattail & Flatbase Designs

Utilizing the proper base design provides incredible in-flight stability for long-range shooting."

Sig Sauer® SIG556R 7.62x39MM Quadrail Rifle BLK

TACTICAL PRECISION, For 2012, SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our new SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable
operation and function.

This is a private sale from a private collector wishing to thin his collection for spending money. Seller requests buyer to present proof of being an Indiana resident with valid Indiana Driver's License (INDL) and verification of background check by presenting a License to Carry a Handgun (LTCH). 

Asking price is derived from Blue Book of Guns values, GunBroker.com's completed listings, other various resources and not meant to be reflective of the recent gun-ban scare/post Sandy Hook/Colorado shootings. Please don't waste my time with low-ball offers as my guns are priced to sell. Serious offers will be considered as I understand condition is everything and very subjective.

This is the shotgun that every Saiga 12 WANTS to be but cannot. Only 1000 have been shipped into the country as of yet--but being an AK at heart, most aftermarket accessories are still interchangeable.

The Vepr 12 was designed with an auto gas regulator (unlike its little brother, the Saiga) meaning that you can reliably feed ANY 2 3/4 or 3 inch shells you can find without manual adjustment from birdshot to buckshot, low to high brass. Unlike the Saiga, the Vepr 12 was based on the RPK instead of the standard AK, which means that the receiver is thicker, has a hinged dust cover, and has a polymer rail on top. Also included in the design is an auto-bolt hold open and a magwell which allows for AR-15 style magazine changes instead of rock and lock.

Instead of explaining every new intricacy, watch this great video by the Military Arms Channel on youtube to get an idea of all of its features.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMfzN5LZc3o

I have added a Magpul rail to the lower handguard, as well as a vertical foregrip. Additionally, I have replaced the standard wooden stock with a sturdy clubfoot. The Vepr would come with two 10 round SGM magazines and 1 original Russian 5 round.

I've sent roughly 150 shells down the tube and I am QUITE fond of my deadly new toy. Please dont hesitate to send any questions that you may have--im sure that I didnt answer every question you might have in this ad. Im a gun enthusiast though and I am constantly buying/selling/trading so show me what you have in trade. Thanks for looking!"

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories."

You will not have that issue with this one. I upgraded the springs for a stronger hit, and replaced the plastic hammer with a metal one- works like a dream now. Since I had it apart, I also put in a metal trigger (doesn't feel as squishy now).  I put about 200 rounds downrange with it overall, and decided I liked the platform so much I spent way more on getting a different lower for myself, so I don't need this lower anymore.  

Don't have to sell it, but figured if someone wants it I'll let it go. Price is firm. You can get these new from Joe Bob for $155 today, so don't pay $300. Only reason I'm asking what I am is to cover the cost of the transfer when I got it and the parts kits that I used to upgrade it with.
