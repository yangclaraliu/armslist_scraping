About this Walther:


It is in absolutely 'like new' condition.
It has only had 50 rounds through it and has been cleaned and cared for properly.
It has 2 mags, one flush fit and the other extended as pictured in the gun.
It has the 2 original ""Quicksafe Backstraps""   to adjust to your grip.
It has all original paperwork, plastic case, and spent casing from the factory test shot.
Everything that it came from the factory with is included and I'll throw in a gun lock.


 THIS GUN IS PERFECT FOR EVERYDAY CARRY.  POWERFUL AND INSANELY THIN!!

A self-defense handgun does no good if it is miles away when you need it. The PPS is a concealed carry firearm that is slim, light and comfortable to wear all day long. Yet it is fast to bring into action, pleasant to fire and easy to shoot accurately. With Walther, performance comes in small packages. -Walther

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of sig's popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. The .40 S&W SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

And so that's how this second BCG came to be. Bravo Company Bolt Carrier Groups are amazingly well made, high pressure tested, and magnetic particle inspected as well. It's a full-auto, M16 style BCG - legal everywhere in the US. Some prefer it because it's heavier, causes the action to cycle a bit slower, and because they are often considered more robust than AR15 semi-auto carriers.

This item is NIB (New in Bag). I'm looking for $230 cash, which covers what I spent on the BCG and shipping for it. I will only deal locally. Thanks for looking!"

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Ammo scalping cannot be compared to a good investment.  Scalpers are creating a false sense of scarcity, then inflating prices.  (ammo producers still charge ""normal"" prices"". )  I believe the SEC calls this ""insider trading"" and it is also illegal.  While the ""scalpers"" aren't necessarily doing anything illegal, I'm sure that many will agree that it is despicable and immoral.  

I commend those who prepare for the future.  stockpiling, hoarding, or whatever it is called may lead to good preparedness. 

 The choice NOT to buy this incredibly marked up product will send a message to those who are telling us what they think things cost.

Gun new was $665.00.

Less than 100 rounds fired. Has ""Accutrigger"" for a light but safe touch. Comes with case, and Nikon BDC ranging scope.

So, this rifle has a history. This was a gift for a friend that they returned after a falling out. Upon the initial firing, we discovered the gun had a ""Rough Chamber"" and made extraction difficult. Accuracy was perfect however.

I do not know whether this has been fixed. We did scope the chamber and it looks clean. If it has not, it can be sent back to Savage for service under warranty and fixed (Turn around 3-4 weeks.) Or a local Gunsmith power hone it for $100 (Quote from Gunsmoke.)

So, here is the math:

If the chamber was fixed, you get a barely used rifle + scope + case for $265.00 off new.
If the chamber was not fixed, you get a barely used rifle + scope + case  for $165.00 off new.

Either way, it's a bargain."

More about the AR 18/AR 180: Stamped steel and welded construction. Reliable and very accurate at all ranges up to 460 meters. Simple construction and very few parts. Gas piston operation is much more resistant to carbon fouling: Gas and carbon does not vent into the receiver (sound familiar?), so shotguns and AR 15s are just now catching up. Powered by a short-stroke gas piston above the barrel and unlike the AR-15, the cocking handle fits directly into a recess in the bolt carrier and reciprocates with it during firing, allowing the you to force the breech closed or open if necessary. Since the recoil springs are housed in the receiver, this has a side-folding stock. 2-position flip aperture rear sight and post foresight. Dovetail on the receiver fits the proprietary ArmaLite quick-detachable scope mount. The 180 uses what looks like AR mags, but the mag catch window is a 1/2"" x 1/16"" slot instead of the square window of the AR mag. AR mags will fit the 180's mag well, but will not latch unless that 1/2""x1/16"" window is cut/milled/ground into them."

They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system.

Whether you are buying your first AR rifle, or need an affordable yet accurate plinking gun, the Panther Oracle is for you. Built to bridge the gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets, this introductory level carbine features a 16' light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with Picatinny Rail, heat dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible, six-position Pardus buttstock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs. The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice on the Picatinny Rail. The 16"" barrel, although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. The Pardus stock makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter.
