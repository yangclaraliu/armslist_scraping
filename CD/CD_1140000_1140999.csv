Only about 22,000 of the Remington New Model 1863 Navy Revolver were manufactured from 1863 to 1875. Serial numbers of the New Model Navy continued from the Model 1861 Navy. Reference sources estimate that the New Model Navy serial numbers started at about 23,000+/- and ranged to nearly 45,000 in 1888 with the change over from percussion to cartridge revolvers occurring in 1875. In the last two years of the Civil War, the Navy purchased 4,344 with 3,000 of them being ordered in 1863 alone. Additionally, the Army purchased just over 1,500. It is felt that federal, state and individual purchases for military usage accounted for nearly all of the 1863 Remington New Model Navies made during the Civil War years.

This relic was found in the remnants of a Gaston County, NC barn. The rammer assembly and the trigger guard are modern replacements. The action is functional. The frame is cracked, as found. The grip notches are also as found. Includes display case, not seen in pictures."

I also set up payment plans on expensive items like this one so just email me and let me know what down payment and monthly payment you can afford and maybe we can put it on lay-a-way for you. Hello and thank you for checking out our auction. Up for auction is a very nice Browning Model 71 lever action in .50 Alaskan, These rifles were orginally chambered in .348 Winchester. Gunsmiths wanted the Browning 71 due to its durability and strength when converting rifles to 50 Alaskan. This rifle has a half octagon half round barrel measuring at 34"", an all steal Schnabel forend, the sights have not been clipped and the engraving on the barrel and action are beautiful. the stock also has a hidden compartment for holding 4 rounds. The .50 Alaskan is a wildcat cartridge developed by Harold Johnson and Harold Fuller of the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska in the 1950s. Johnson based the cartridge on the .348 Winchester in order to create a rifle capable of handling the large bears in Alaska. Design: Harold Johnson necked out the .348 Winchester case to accept a .510"" diameter bullet, and Harold Fuller developed the barrel, marrying a .50 caliber barrel to an old Winchester Model 1886 rifle. Since the rifle was designed for use on Alaska’s great bears, Johnson cut 720-grain (47 g) boat-tail .50 BMG bullets in half, seating the 450-grain (29 g) rear half upside down in the fireformed .50-caliber case. It didn’t take Johnson long to find out that the 450-grain truncated shaped “solid” would shoot through a big brown bear from any direction, claiming in 1988, “I never recovered a slug from a bear or moose, no matter what angle the animal was shot at. Harold’s favorite load in the .50 Alaskan was 51.5 grains (3.34 g) of IMR-4198 with a Barnes 400-grain (26 g) flatnose ,jacketed bullet for about 2,100 ft/s (640 m/s) and just under 4,000 ft·lbf (5,400 J)of muzzle energy Shipping/handling is going to be $55 and insurance will be added at 1.75% of the item's value to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping. The price is for certified funds a credit card will add 5% to the price. The value of all merchandise traded will be treated like certified funds; therefore, this item will still be subject to shipping and insurance charges. Because of additional paperwork and time to process the shipment, California orders on firearms will be charged an additional $25 transfer fee"

Serial# 24550
Features:
3 3/16 inch barrel.
7-shot 22. short cylinder.
 Tip-up barrel.
 Varnished rosewood grips.

Cylinder has nice markings with the correct 3 patents dated:
 Apr. 3, 1855, July, 5, 1859, and Dec. 18, 1860...All clear and legible. 
Top of the barrel reads; ""SMITH & WESSON SPRINGFIELD. MASS."" 
Serial number visible on bottom of butt of gun.

**The Model One was S&W's first successful revolver design and one of the world's very first cartridge revolvers.
It was also the world's first gun to be chambered in .22 rimfire.
However, .22 rimfire back in 1860 was not the potent stuff you can buy down at your local gun shop today, therefore, though it is in perfect firing condition, this firearm is not meant for firing anymore, best as a showpiece or an antique display.
There is expected wear due to time, but very little considering the age.
The rosewood grips are in great condition Action works nicely.
Tip-up barrel latch is still tight and locks up to the frame tightly.
A must have for collectors."

  this pistol is in incredible shape. probably less than 500 rounds through it in its lifetime. 

when i bought this, i knew that officer's acp pistols had a few ""bugs"" from the factory. even though i had no problems with the pistol, i did have some modifications made. the pistol was sent to clark's custom guns in shreveport, and had the following mods.

clark officer's bushing installed to replace the weaker, failure prone factory part.

staked on front sight replaced with a clark dovetailed front sight.

original beavertail colt grip safety replaced with older extended style factory colt part

solid king's trigger installed

barrel throated and polished for reliable feeding of hollow-point ammo.

pistol comes with 2 magazines, nothing else. somehow, the box has gone missing.

i may have the reciepts from clarks, but not sure. i'll look.

also has a checkered msh, not a cheapo either. i believe its a wilson part

price is firm $1000 SHIPPING WILL BE $50 TO YOUR FFL DEALER

only trade i am interested in is an arsenal slr-107 



 not remade just improved. i don't remember any jams. i usually shoot hard-balll in it, but have shot hollow-points with no problems. pistol is very reliable.  only selling, to buy something else (Springfield emp). if you buy it, you will not be disapointed.  this is not a problem pistol i am dumping. i've owned it since the early 90s."

The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun created by Turkish company Akdal Arms. It is intended for use by civilian and security markets. 

The MKA 1919 highly resembles the M16 rifle and mimics the layout and placement of some of the controls. The Akdal MKA 1919 is unlike many other 12 gauge shotguns as it is very light and ergonomic, this is due to the use of modern and high strength composites. 

The Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be quickly removed from upper receiver. To charge the shotgun, the charging handle on the receiver needs to be pulled. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. 

Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun has 2 5 round detachable box magazine. The magazine catch is identical to the M16 magazine catch and is located on the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip. 

Standard sights include a front post installed on the M16-style removable base and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight. On the upper receiver, an integral Picatinny rail can be placed which will accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical sight attachments. 

Includes 2 extra choke tubes.

accepts both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells

I'm throwing in a BlackHawk! in-the-pants holster for the pistol as well. It's a classy little piece. My girlfriend kept it in her sock drawer for a while, and I carried it as a summer gun (with shorts and a tee).   

Gun has had less than 50 rounds through it in its lifetime, and I'm the original owner.  

This thing is tiny, but packs a wallop. It's hefty, so it just doesn't move much when you shoot it. And it's as small as a .38 derringer (see comparison). 

ALSO...I'm including 40 rounds of Winchester Ranger SXT .380. (Note: these are essentially Black Talons minus the black coating. The running joke is that ""SXT"" stands for ""Same eXact Thing"" as Black Talons. They still have the teeth and the punch...I only have 40 of the 50 rd. box because I shot 10 of them just to see what they would do...  

Parting with it to get some more gear...I will consider a trade (just let me know what you have), but preference will be given to cash. Purchased separately, you would pay well over 600 for all the items listed."

Trijicon TR222 Accupt 2.5-10x 56mm 37.6-10.1ft@100yds FOV 30mm Tube Blk Mil

The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. And, it's water resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.
