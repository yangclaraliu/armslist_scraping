Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).LOG:47539"

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).LOG:45507"

In USPSA Production Division, CZ pistols are now used by twice as many top-level competitors than any other maker. Given that popularity, it was high time to up the ante. Starting from scratch, CZUB engineers took the best features of the original Shadow and improved upon them. More than two years later, we’re seeing the fruits of their efforts. With a higher beavertail and undercut trigger guard, the shooter’s hand is able to be as close to the bore axis as possible. With a contoured slide, the majority of the reciprocating mass is also centered on the bore, equating to less muzzle flip. Increased weight at the dust cover/rail also helps keep the muzzle down. The Shadow 2’s swappable mag release has an adjustable, extended button with three settings to allow shooters to set it in the spot most comfortable for them. Best of all, new trigger components give smooth DA and crisp, clean SA while drastically reducing trigger reset. A hardy nitride finish coats the entire pistol, leaving it nearly impervious to corrosion, with an Urban Grey Polycoat on the frame. Thin black aluminum grips have healthy checkering to match the fine front and backstrap checkering of the pistol itself. Sitting atop the slide are a set of target sights — fiber optic on front and a serrated, black HAJO rear (click adjustable for elevation, drift adjustable for windage).LOG:51633"

Bought with my other CZ, never fired a single shot from it. Put gun in the truck safe in center counsel and it never moved. Still has fgactory grease in it. Bought for $620 new, still new and will let it go for $575 and include a brand new holster and magazine holster about a hundred dollars worth of gear. Great pistol used by many law enforcment agencies around the world. Just fits really nice in the hand. If I didnt need to sale it I wouldnt. 
The CZ P-01 is a compact, aluminum-framed 9mm designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame make it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. With a heavy first-round trigger pull, any additional shots are a light, crisp single action.
The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to the rest of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well.
These upgrades mean the components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangeable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting needed. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired.
With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use.
After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.
Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN."

This rifle comes in Good, Mostly Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It does have an average amount of normal wear/tear, which can be attributed both to the age of the firarm, as well as the fact that it was previously owned, and saw normal usage. This rifle is free of all major flaws/defects, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, staining, rusting, or discoloration. It comes with the original metal buttplate stamped with the Remington brand name, and features a safety switch set directly into the rear of the trigger assembly. This rifle also features a wood stock, which does have a very minor crack on either side of the receiver, right where the stock meets the receiver. The receiver itself is in good shape, with only minor rust spots on the outside, as well as some scratching and rusting on the inside of the chamber and barrel. This rifle also comes with its original iron sights, as well as a Weaver rifle scope, set on top of a williams mounting rail. This rifle DOES NOT feature a release for the ribbed forearm, which simply slides down to rack the firearm and ready it to be fired. This is a fantastic rifle that would make an excellent addition to anybody's collection. Please see our listing images, as well as images on our website here, to see the EXACT condition of this rifle, and feel free to contact us with any additional questions or concerns that you may have."

With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options.
A further evolution of our offerings with the Omega trigger system, the new P-01 Ω Convertible allows users to swap from decocker to safety operation in the same manner as the popular P-07/P-09 pistols. Using the same simplified, more robust variation of the 75’s trigger system as the previous Omega, trigger parts use an interlocking design that allows for easy disassembly and reassembly without the need for tools. Not only does this simplify maintenance, the trigger parts themselves are made of different materials to enhance durability, operation life and reliability.
The CZ P-01 is a compact, aluminum-framed 9mm designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame make it ideal for discrete carry as well. With an integral 1913 accessory rail on its dust cover, the P-01 easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist with low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may or may not carry an NSN.LOG:51829"

This upper was purchased directly from Daniel Defense a couple of months ago. It has a 14.5"" cold hammer forged barrel that has an exended flash suppressor pinned and welded to bring the barrel up to 16"". It has a 12.25"" MK18 Rail Interface System (RIS)II thta offers plenty or rail space for accessories. Also, I installed a Burris FastFire 3 inside a protective device called REX by Strike Industries, and then mounted that onto the receiver in an offset position. It makes transitioning from scope to mini red dot a breeze. The upper also comes with a brand new Steiner P4Xi 1-4 X24 scope that has 11 brightness settings and an off position between every brightness setting. The P3TR reticle is very easy to use with hold overs out to several hundred yards. I also like the illumination on this scope. It has just a simple red dot in the center of the cross hairs. It reminds me of an Aimpoint dot. The upper is pictured with a Magpul vertical grip, but it also comes with the Daniel Defense Enhanced Vertical Grip that is the same color as the rail. A Strike Industries extended charging handle is also included. If I've missed something or you have questions please let me know. I would consider a trade for certain 1911's. Springfield 1911 Loaded model or the TRP Operator model with the accessory rail. Or maybe a Kimber Warrior SOC or something along those lines. Thanks"
