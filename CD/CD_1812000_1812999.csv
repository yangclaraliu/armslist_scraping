I have for sale a 182 series Ruger Mini 14 that's a great all around package. The gun comes with 9 magazines (3:30 round, 4:20 round, 2:5 round) 3 stocks (ATI, Choate, Hogue), NCStar side optic mount, 5 position vertical grip, and a soft case if you're desperate for it. The mini will eat absolutely any kind of ammo from Nosler BTHP hunting rounds to Wolf steel case. Problem is: I've thrown far too much money at it trying to ""Tac it out"" so I want to move to the AR platform. It was a good start for me but I've got my mind on something else now. 

Will ship if needed but would prefer local. willing to meet Carson/Sparks area.
will trade for AR (no Core-15 or DPMS please)
Thanks for looking

The ""Hollow Base"" in the base of the bullet allows us to make a longer profile without adding weight.  For example if we were to hollow base a 230gr .45 ACP bullet, it now weighs 185gr..  The longer profile gives more ""Bearing Surface"" on the bullet, which helps a pistol barrel stabilize the bullet."

This custom shop seven started out as a 7mm-08, it was fired only a few times and sent back to Remington Custom Shop where I had them install a 20 inch 40X stainless .243 Win. barrel with a 1 in 10 twist, I also had Remington Custom shop apply the toughest firearm metal coating that is on the market to day, (Black TriNyte) on the barrel, action, and bolt and all floor plate, this coating is only found on the Remington Custom Shop Texas Wilderness rifles, which is an up charge of $250.00. This Remington Custom Shop Seven has the Brown Precision KS stock, there are only two places where the camo paint is missing and those places are on the underside and very small, I have taken pictures of them. I then sent the Remington custom Shop Seven to Brown Precison where they installed a Jewell Trigger which cost over $200.00 for the trigger, Brown Precision installed & adjusted trigger pull to 2 Lbs., this cost was $65.00, and installed a Speedlock spring $75.00, Brown Precision professionally bedded stock this cost was $225.00. Remington Custom Shop furnished a test target with the smallest group shooting two shots in the same hole and the 3 shot broke out which gave a three shot groupe of .79. This is a very light and compact and accurate rifle, weight 5 lbs 11 oz., length of pull is 13 1/4"". I have not shot the rifle the only time it was fired was at Remington Custom Shop. I have stored this rifle in a climate controlled gun vault. This Custom Shop rifle comes with Owners manual and the work invoice from Brown Precisoin, the test target showing the serial number matching the rifle, a note from Remington Custom Shop stating that this rifle was rebarreled to .243 Win. with 1 in 10 twist using a 40X stainless barrel, signed by the Remington Custom Shop, and also incluede is the Remington Custom Shop Hard case with a two scoped rifle soft case inside the hard case. The end box label with the serial number is wrong, the one I have pictured with the Remington Custom Shop Seven is not the correct box end label, and Remington Custom Shop can not print me the correct end box labels, this is the only reason I have posted the rifle used. I will need a signed copy of your FFL to ship to the lower 48 States and the lower 48 state.I will accept only USPS money order or a certified bank check. Good Luck with your bidding."

Allen pepperboxes were among the most popular and best selling handguns of their day. They were the first American double action revolving arms and out-sold Colt revolvers prior to the Civil War. Allen and Thurber guns were well made. The barrels were bored from a block of cast steel. The frame was also cast. Operating parts were machined from bar stock and hardened where necessary. Walnut was used for the grips in most cases and the frames were generally scroll engraved. The self-cocking lock mechanism was unique for its time. It is fairly simple and contains a minimum number of parts. Lack of shielding between the caps in some of the earlier pepperboxes resulted in occasional multiple discharges. Allen overcame this by putting a snug-fitting shield around the nipple area which kept the caps in place and also helped keep the sparks from igniting the other loaded barrels. The revolver, with its fixed rifled barrel and compact design, to say nothing of its reduced weight, soon overshadowed the pepperbox design. The invention of the metallic cartridge gave the pepperbox its final kiss of death, since it was impractical to try to convert a pepperbox to fire fixed ammunition. 

 In my opinion the gun is in fair condition and is well kept for it's age. Willing to negotiate price just let me know.

Asking $800 or OBO. email or call REDACTED REDACTED 



The SP223 Logo Billet lower features oversized winter trigger guard, quick access mag release, and a beveled mag well opening. The oversized built in trigger guard allows for the use of a thick winter glove. The magazine release area has been designed to allow quick and easy access to the release button from any position. Features an upper receiver tensioning screw under the grip, captive detent spring to retain the rear takedown pin. All roll pins have been replaced with screw in dowel pins.

If you're looking for the highest quality and most durable Lower Parts Kit on the market with all of the upgrades, look no further. The Spike’s Tactical Enhanced LPK was designed for the end user who demands the most longevity possible out of the parts in their rifles. The core of the Spike’s Enhanced LPK is the ST Battle Trigger which is a single stage Mil-Spec trigger, rounded hammer, and disconnector that’s plated with Nickel Boron to give the Battle Trigger a very smooth and crisp trigger pull that breaks at around 5 lbs and gets even smoother the more you shoot it. 

The Battle Trigger is held in place via KNS Gen II Mod II Anti-Rotation pins which keep the hammer and trigger pins from walking out (a problem in some 9mm ARs and full auto M4/M16s) and keeps the pin holes from enlarging and “egg-holing” after years and years of use. And we’ve also included an Ambidextrous Safety Selector, our ST Billet Trigger guard with set screw, and our Ergo grip featuring our Spike’s Spider logo. 

The Spike’s Enhanced LPK also features a Mil-Spec bolt catch, mag catch, and mag catch button. As well as utilizing Mil-Spec detents, plungers, pins, and springs. We also include quality spiral roll pins for the trigger guard and bolt catch as well as a ¼” allen screw and washer for the Ergo grip. This is the best Lower Parts Kit on the market that you can put in your lower. 

The EMOD is about one inch longer than the original Modstock and with the rubber butt plate installed, is about a quarter of an inch longer than the CRANE SCB. The increased length of the EMOD is a major benefit when used on scoped rifles (SPR/DMR), as it increases the available comb for any given length of pull. 

The buttplate of the EMOD is slightly wider and longer at the toe than the regular M4 stock with a noticeable negative pitch, making transitions from the ready feel much more natural. The EMOD was given enough weight to help balance out the normally muzzle heavy feel associated with negative pitch buttstocks.
The toe of the buttplate is rolled under; giving the EMOD a superior feel when the weapon is held in the ""out of pocket"" heads up hold. The buttplate is covered with a removable rubber buttpad that is molded over a metal strike plate. The shape of the buttplate and the rubber buttpad give a solid stock purchase in all situations. 
The EMOD features more storage in the removable, waterproof side compartments; the EMOD holds up to four CR123 or three AA batteries. There is also an additional weather proof compartment in the clubfoot area of the stock, this compartment can be accessed quickly and holds two AA batteries or other small parts. 

Constructed from the finest materials, the EMOD will stand up to the most rugged demands. The EMOD is available for either the standard ""MilSpec"" receiver extension tube, or for the aftermarket ""Commercial"" size tube. Available colors include Black, Foliage Green and Flat Dark Earth (tan). The EMOD is only available in the Clubfoot model."

""Boutique"" amps like this sell for a 1500 or more.  I value it at about 900.  If you're into guitar amps, then you know what all this is worth.  Looking for nice pistols.  Interested in .22s like the walther p22, Smith & Wesson M&P 22,  Ruger SR22, sig mosquito.  Also would consider polymer frames chambered in .45
No way I'm going to ship this.

I upgraded the grips and polished the barrel. The barrel is polished to solve the feeding issues of most Hi Point pistols. The grips were sanded, primed, then coated with grip paint, then baked at 375 degrees for 45 minutes. That solves the slippery grip issue that comes with all Hi Point pistols. The pistol also comes with a hard case and waistband holster. I have some ammo as well, but that will cost extra. I shot the pistol before all the modifications and after. The functional test after the polish and custom grip worked perfect. If you, the buyer, want to test the product out before buying, we can set something up at a local range. I am asking 180 obo."

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

This is a solid gun folks!  It is stamped not milled, but it is still not a cheap one.  Everything shoots flawlessly.  All gear fits nice and snug and looks badass!  None of it was cheap, if you know your guns look it up, add the prices for yourself.  This rifle also has the recoil buffer installed, between that and the anti-shock stock you would think your shooting an AR, but all the punch of the 7.62.  Never jammed never misfired never disappointed!  This is a superior customized weapon compared to the other AK's on this site.  Please know what you're talking about before you bother me with ignorance.  I have a lot of time and money into this rifle and do not plan to give it away nor need to sell.  Low ballers will be pointed and laughed at.  Open to all trades just run it by me, but it better be worth a couple grand, or be complimented with cash.

Shoots .22 Short, Long and Long Rifle, stamped on barrel near rear sight. Made back in the 20's to late 30's, or so I have read, so she has no serial number. She shoots good but she has some age on her so the action does not work like a modern bolt gun. She does not like 40 gr bullets, lift mechanism is a bit tired, but the 38 gr and lighter feed fine as long as you do not rush her. Such a small difference in bullet weight at the tip will cause a jam part of the time. Being as honest as I can here.
I have coated her in Duracoat Flat Black, lightly sanded the stock then finished with True Oil and replaced the original sights, will be sent with the gun, with Marbles fiber optic front and rear Full Buckhorn style sights.
The bore is of course worn but she still has life in her. I can hit the ends of pop cans at 100 yards with her using Federal American Eagle 38 gr H.P.'s and I even took a coyote at about 60 yards with her once.
Don't ever take her out so she needs someone who will treat her like a fine lady and give her a good home."

The very early HEX receiver rifles are getting quite hard to find and are stronger and more reliable than the round receiver rifles. This is a fabulous rifle with a barrel that has strong rifling and grooves. The rifle has all matching serial numbers with NO electro pencil matches. All numbers are original matching. The stock is an original Pre-War stock with the 2 screw metal sling well enclosures and is original to the 1926 rifle. This rifle will make a great shooter. I will ship the rifle anywhere in the country (to an FFL or C&R) but I prefer a face to face sale in Arkansas. I will do a bill of sale requiring DLN and date of birth of Arkansas residents.
