The run on assault rifles and AR style rifles has calmed down since Pesident Obama and the Senate finally realized that their push for a ban on assault rifles was going to far and not popular with the majority of the US population. As a result people are realizing that they are not going to get inflated $1500 + prices for their AR's as they have over the last few months. 

This AR 15 that I am selling is reasonably priced to sell and a great buy with the many extras that are included. I could have gone much further fitting this AR with sights and a scope or a red dot sight but I will leave that up to the buyer who can choose from the many styles of optics that are out there on the market.

A little information about the pistol:

Only 3,500 John Wayne Tribute .45 Pistols have been authorized for this  edition.  The John Wayne Tribute .45 Pistol is a working, semi-automatic pistol with the solid performing power counted on by all those who relied on this trusted sidearm during their service to our country. The Colt .45 was a favorite of John Wayne and was featured frequently in his military films. This pistol is polished and decorated by craftsmen commissioned specifically by America Remembers with artwork we have created specifically for this military Tribute.

The slide is polished and decorated in elegant 24-karat gold and nickel with a blued background. The artwork includes classic images of John Wayne, and inspirational words of encouragement from the Duke, featured along with patriotic American symbols, which meant so much to this legendary icon and continue to represent the proud and patriotic spirit of the American people.

The left slide features the central portrait of John Wayne in the role of a Marine Officer. To the left is his quote, “Courage is Being Scared to Death…But Saddling Up Anyway” scrolled beside our trusted national symbol of strength, the American bald eagle. 

To the right is his quote, “A Man’s Got to Do…What a Man’s Got to Do” and the eagle, globe and anchor logo of the Marines. At the muzzle end, “Duke,” John Wayne’s celebrated nickname, is featured.

The right side of the slide features the central portrait of John Wayne in the role of a Naval Officer. To the left, it reads “Talk Low… Talk Slow and Don’t Talk too Much!” scrolled proudly beside the familiar American symbols of the Liberty Bell and the US Navy Anchor symbol. To the right, it reads “The American Flag…The Best Flag God Gave to Any Country,” scrolled in front of a waving Stars and Stripes. At the muzzle end, John Wayne’s signature is faithfully displayed.





A little about the rifle:

Only 3,500 John Wayne Tribute Rifles have been authorized for this edition and demand is expected to be very strong for these commemorative firearms.  Every metal surface of this John Wayne commemorative rifle is finished in a mirror-polished, lustrous deep blue. Craftsmen commissioned by America Remembers decorate each of these commemorative firearms. The receiver features artwork in 24-karat gold and scrollwork in the  tradition of the finest presentation firearms. 

The left side of the barrel features John Wayne’s signature, and inset into the stock is a 24-karat gold-plated medallion with John Wayne’s portrait. The handsome walnut stocks are checkered on this John Wayne commemorative rifle and finished to a high gloss, and the hammer and trigger are polished and decorated in 24-karat gold.

The right side of this John Wayne rifle, the receiver features a scene familiar to every fan of Western classics. In it, John Wayne leads the U.S. Cavalry through the buttes and dry gullies of desolate Monument Valley. Above the scene flies a banner that reads “John Wayne.”

The left side of the receiver features John Wayne as a wagon train scout, leading settlers and a cavalry escort through Apache territory. If you look closely on this John Wayne commemorative rifle, you will see a rifle in John Wayne’s right hand! Handsome scrollwork in the tradition of the finest firearms frames the artwork, with all artwork being featured in stunning 24-karat gold on these commemorative firearms.

Unlike most out there, which are ""seconds"", these are BRAND NEW never loaded.
Therefore there are no scratch marks from them being pulled which affect accuracy and
integrity of the projectile.  

These have the steel tip and indeed do stick to a magnet. Suppliers are SOLD OUT of
these and will be for the rest of 2013.  Hence, the loaded ammo of these are in excess
of $1.00 per round currently.  With these projectiles you can make those rounds for a

I was almost scammed by them.  Luckily I recognized Julie and told her they were attempting a straw purchase of my rifle (using her producer's money along with a fake name and address).

They went by the names Chris and Cheryl when they met with me.  They tried to buy 30 round magazines just outside Denver claiming they were legal residents of Clear Creek County.  They broke SEVERAL laws while trying to make ME out to be the bad guy.

Just be aware that they are out there.  If anything smells funny walk away...or point out the illegality of their activities.

Edit: Thanks to those that have contacted me.  Many have asked about their vehicle.  They were in a black Cadillac crossover.  I'm fairly certain they were filming from a late model Jeep Grand Cherokee across the Home Depot parking lot.  I had a phone interview with 9news about this and I'm reporting them to BATFE.  Keep the faith.

BTW, their contact info is as follows:
REDACTED - Hidden camera reporter
REDACTED - President of KDVR (he actually responded to my email...totally worthless brush off)
REDACTED - Reporter
REDACTED - He's the producer. Josh tried to use Chris's name and mountain residency (and cash?) to purchase my gun after I told him I couldn't sell to a Denver resident.

Give em a piece of your mind.  If anybody is hooked up with RMGO or a decent lawyer I'd like to get this to them as well.  Let's get this out there."

This one was from 1986. It's the perfect size for carry but remains extremely accurate. It packs a powerful punch a 9 x 19 full size 9mm should. It has some great German features that put the battery release to use as a decocker. It ejects to left. The magazine release has been brought up on the grip in the P5 compact version, I like that better than it's predessors and other European pistols with the release on the heel. This is truly a rare gun. It has the coolness of a ppk, but it's a full 9mm. It comes with the hard to find custom holster, the original box and manual and 2-7 round clips.

I have owned this rifle a few years and only fired it a handful of times (never at a deer- figures).  I have a few boxes of sabots, a partial box of 50gr pyrodex pellets, a full pound of Pyrodex RS Select, a full package of the DISC inserts for the 209 primers (with primers), and all the necessary wrenches to remove the breech for cleaning. The trigger has about a 3 lb break and is fantastic for target shooting.  Best I ever did with the iron sights was a 2.5 inch 5 shot group at 100 yds, without cleaning between shots.  Price is firm.

It's been appraised up to $1200. I just don't shoot it. So looking for something I will shoot. Have around 400 rounds of ammo I can add for right trade. I'm valuing it at between $6-800. 

All matching Norinco Chinese sks. Sporter version. As can be seen in pic your typical sporter sks had a shortened barrel, bayonet lug removed, thumbhole stock and adapted to accept ak mags which redesigned the bolt carrier with no stripper clip slots. The sporter I am selling has a non thumbhole stock and does not accept ak mags.  Is full size barrel with bayonet and does use stripper clips for loading. It's 100% matching, original and real. Have green sling, cleaning kit that fits in stock, screwdriver type bayonet.  I have owned for over 22 years. Less than 500 rounds shot thru it. Well taken care of and pristine condition. Again all numbers match. Is stamped Tucson AZ. Is also a legit DB stamp. Here's the history:

In 1989 sks were stamped sporter or sks-m to be allowed for import after a 1989 ban. These rifles were fitted with Monte Carlo or thumbhole stocks. Also made and adapted to accept ak mags. Also had the bayo lug removed. The rifle I have has had none of the cosmetic changes yet is stamped sporter. Plus it has the DB stamp. That means deport Bangladesh. Some Chinese made sks were stamped this or DP(Pakistan) or DK(Kampuchea). DP typically adds 10% value. DK about 15-20%. And the most rare DB adding up to 50% based on condition. Many DP have been forged to appear DB. They are easy to tell due to the mis proportion of the humps of the B. so the sporter mis-stamp, DB stamp and #'s matching drives it to a collectors rifle. 
And when I mention the 1989 ban I don't mean the 1994 awb. 
Also another change was the bolt carrier was changed on sporters with no slots for striped clips since they used ak removable mags and no stripper clip was needed. 
Most sporters had barrels shortened too."
