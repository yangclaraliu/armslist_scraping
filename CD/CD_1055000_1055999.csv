***I prefer not to ship these out of state. I've had many requests from out of state buyers, but I do not wish to sell out of state and deal with the potential legal complications. I will ship anywhere in TN, at buyer's cost, or meet locally.***

Lighter - More Durable - More Reliable (also more expensive, but you get what you pay for)
These are arguably the best AK mags out there. If you're serious about your AK then you ought to have at least one. They are a light-weight polymer that is steel reinforced where it matters. WAY BETTER THAN THE TAPCO JUNK! There is a reason these are staying sold out everywhere. I have two available for $50 each or both for $90

**Think about the math...Steel AK mags went from being $10-15 all the way up to being $25-40 when everyone went gun crazy. The Bulgarian Circle 10 mags were already $36-40 before the madness, and now you just can't find them.


These Bulgarian-made AK-47 magazines from Arsenal, Inc. follow the original Bulgarian military pattern, featuring a ""waffle"" textured, polymer magazine body for increased rigidity, longevity, and the utmost in reliable function. Compatible with most AK-47/AKM-pattern rifles in 7.62x39mm.

I purchased this pistol new 20 years ago, in 1993. It has NEVER malfunctioned and has been totally reliable with a large variety of full metal jacket and hollow point ammunition. The Interarms version of the Walther PPK is highly desirable compared to the current S&W version (which I've owned as well and had nothing but problems with). These Interarms versions are going for a premium on Gunbroker right now, but I'd prefer a local sale if possible. I have quality holsters and ammo to sweeten the deal as well (and you know how hard it is to find ammo right now). With my entire package, you'll be completely set up and ready to go. The pistol is freshly cleaned, lubed, and ready for use. I have additional, more highly detailed photos of the pistol that I can email to you if needed. Here is everything I'm offering:

- Walther/Interarms PPK .380acp in original box with paperwork and factory test target
- (4) factory magazines with flat base installed
- (4) finger rest conversions for the magazines
- (1) set of extra factory grips
- A-Zoom snap caps for dry fire practice

Please refrain from sending me messages consisting of stories about your military hardships and why you feel you deserve the gun, followed by an offer of cell phones, body armor, etc. I feel bad turning them down but it has to be a trade consisting of something that interests me.

If you do that then your more than welcome to try it before you buy it, it works flawlessly I just don't feel safe letting people I don't know into my home. Thanks for reading and god bless!

I have this priced at a very good price, had a gentleman (trying to be nice) claiming he can get this at Peabodies in centerville for 250.00 so if you are not familiar with this model, please do research (and definately make sure you check the forementioned gun shop for the deal of the century on it).  In addition to the laughable claim from above, I've gotten some insane trade offers.  So I have this priced right from the get go, will entertain reasonable trade offers.  In addition, if we make a deal and someone comes behind you and offers more, I will still honor our deal.  I will answer all reasonable offers, and if you have any questions, or would like more pics, let me know.

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of Russian made 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)

This model is deeply embellished with delicate scroll work, with Oliver F. Winchester’s signature in gold on top of the bolt. The left side of the receiver bears an early Winchester Repeating Arms crest. On the right side are the words, ""Two Hundred Years, Oliver F. Winchester,"" and the dates, ""1810 — 2010."" The fancy Grade II/III walnut stock is enhanced with a high gloss finish and is delicately checkered, complementing the fine embellishments on the silver nitride receiver. This model is also chambered in the timeless 30-30 Win. caliber, with a deeply blued half-round, half octagon barrel. A buckhorn rear sight is fitted with a Marble’s® gold bead front sight..

TA31RCO-A4CP

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gun sight (ACOG) designed for the M16A4 Weapon system. It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self- luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.  The unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator."

Today, House Bill 1563 passed the Indiana House of Representatives by an overwhelming 95-2 vote. HB1563 will now be transferred to the Senate where it will be referred to the appropriate Senate committee for consideration.

HB 1563, sponsored by state Representative Sean Eberhart (R-57) and fully supported by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, would allow hunters in Indiana to use lawfully-possessed suppressors (also referred to as silencers) on firearms while hunting.

Noise complaints are being used more frequently as an excuse to close shooting ranges, informal shooting areas and hunting lands throughout the country. Increased use of suppressors will help to eliminate many of these complaints and protect hunting and shooting areas well into the future.

While suppressors do not eliminate the sound of a firearm, they do reduce the muzzle report in a manner similar to the way that a muffler reduces exhaust noise from a vehicle. The benefits associated with suppressor use include increased accuracy due to reduced recoil and muzzle blast, protection from hearing damage and reduced noise pollution.

The NRA would like to thank Representative Eberhart and Speaker Brian Bosma (R-88) for ensuring the passage of this pro-hunting reform. Please stay tuned to NRA-ILA | ILA Home for updates on the status of this legislation as it progresses through the Senate."

Turkey Season is comming! Pick up this shotgun at a great price so you still have some cash for the other gear you need! Compare with others on the site and you will see that this is agreat deal. If you have questions, send me a message.

I've hunted ducks with this gun for two seasons, and am getting rid of it because I just got a new gun and no longer need this one.  It has been a solid performer, and have not had any issues with it.  I grew up on remington 870s, and this gun has been just as reliable accept it dosn't rust!  The polymer coating isn't pretty, but is amazing for a basic and functional duck hunting gun, especially if you hunt salt or brackish water.

The gun is all black, but as you can see, I have spray painted it.  A good cleaning and some acetone will strip the paint if you want it back to black.  The only thing wrong with the gun is the fiber optic front sight broke on me at the end of the 2010-2011 season.  I tacked it back in place with a little epoxy, and it seems to be holding up, but will need to be replaced eventually.  Its a 10 dollar part from remington and snaps right on and off.  I just haven't gotten around to ordering it, and it has worked for me so far as is.

Fresh batteries within the last 4 years as memory serve me. This is a 36v cart converted to a 40v cart. This was done by the dealer. This means it has five{5} 8v batteries instead of six{6} 6v batteries. This makes the 36v motor run faster than a standard 36v cart. 40v instead of 36v equals more ""juice"" so a faster machine.

- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- Cleaning kit, sling, and 1 magazine are standard.
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness.

With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in in length and weighs only 6.95 lb - ideal for tactical use.

I'm considering parting with my 1911 A-1 in favor of something that fits me better. It's been a solid shooter and my primary defense weapon so reliability is not an issue and shoots both ball and Hornady hollow point fine. 

It's in good condition and does show some finish wear from being holstered previously and where someone obviously had trouble seating the slide lock after disassembies. The cosmetic flaws haven’t been a concern since I planned to refinish it. 

I don't need to sell it, just looking to see what might be out there. As you can tell from the parts list, I have spent a good amount of time and money on it so don’t waste my time with low ball offers.

[The everyday setup]
- 2 - Mecgar 14 round mags (1 is only a year old)
- Wilson Combat slide spring and Shok-Buf 
- All new trigger parts including hammer, sear, dis-connector, trigger, main spring
- All trigger parts polished to 4# with no creep or grit (plenty of material to go lighter if desired) 
- Barrel bushing compensator
- LPA fully adjustable 3 dot sights
- Modified Para 14 Hogue wrap around grip
- Upgraded hex grip screws
- Original parts included: slide spring, trigger, hammer, sear, dis-connector, main spring, barrel bushing, and grips

[Additional items for the serious buyer]
- 1 piece stainless compensated bull barrel (fitted but needs reverse spring plug /guide as well as barrel link/pin to install)
- Extended mag and slide releases
- 1 extra Shok-Buf
- About 225 rounds of Federal ball ammo
- Nearly 3 boxes of Hornady defensive rounds (2 full boxes of Zombies and almost a full box of Critical Defense) *If you want the ammo as part of a trade, I'd prefer an equivalent in your caliber because of the ammo whores out there. Ammo will not be sold separately!

Cash always talks or interesting trades considered. This is a high quality weapon with a lot of extra$ so let’s be realistic since they sell in the same relative condition for $750-$850 without any mods. I won’t even respond to low ball offers. If I’m interested in your offer, I’ll respond and we can go from there. I will not ship the gun. Only ftf and buyer to show ccp or pistol permit to prove you can legally own it. I have 2 permits on-hand if required for a trade."

Buyer fell through, so this is back up for sale.

You've been reading in the news, you know the assault weapons ban has already been introduced.  Better buy now, because if it goes into effect as written this version of the venerable SIG556 will no longer be available!

I have only fired around 100 rounds through this rifle since I bought it new. This rifle features a factory collapsible folding stock, a flip-up rear sight, and I have also installed the Sig Sauer Red-Dot sight, which co-witnesses perfectly with the fixed sights. I also installed a Grip-Pod fore-grip that converts to a bi-pod with the push of a button. 

Everything you see in the photos goes with the rifle, including the SIG hard case, lock, and owner’s manual.

You can’t find any SIG 556s on the shelves right now, and if the ban passes there may not be any more available. Get it while you still can!

If you have any questions or an offer, just email me and I will get back to you as soon as I can."

Along with the FN-style stock and receiver outline, the MK22 has many of the same features as the rifle that inspired it. The receiver is an all-metal construction, with a Picatinny-style rail system on all receiver surfaces. This includes a barrel placement for attaching FN sights. The mussle of the precision match, 16-inch barrel is cut with a 1:28 thread to accept various muzzle breaks and flash hiders.
 The three-position shoulder stock is adjustable for length, features a sling buckle mount and it has a two-position cheek rest that adjusts for height. The stock is fitted with a metal hinge to fold to the side with a polymer frame hook to lock the stock in the folded position for tactical training exercises. 
Comes with 22-round magazine. The adjustable front and rear rifle sights can be folded down to make room for a scope. When in the down position, the sights become a three-dot pistol system. 
The charging handle is part of the patent-pending Universal Charging Adaption System (UCAS), which allows the handle to be moved to three locations on the right or left side of the gun. The hollow grip is fitted with a removable base plate so it can be used for storage. Tan finish.

Here are the drawing numbers for key parts: receiver serial# 366XXXX, drawing number D28291 35 heat lot O81B; barrel D6535448 4-66 VAR; bolt D28287-19SA; op rod D35382 9 SA; trigger housing D28290 18 SA; hammer C46008-7 SA; safety SA 11; elev knob WCE; windage knob BME. This rifle is nearly correct per Scott Duff's book: M1 Garand Serial Numbers and Data Sheets. The M1 has brand new gorgeous natural walnut stock and handguards. The finish matches on all the wood, and it's not shiny. Just natural USGI look. All small pins and springs have been replaced, op-rod spring replaced, and the entire M1 was re-parked in manganese phosphate, down to the handguard metal. Headspaced and timing block checked, then test fired with Greek HXP. This M1 is as close to “new off the rack” as you can get. Nicer than the ones Miltech offers for $1600+ and they don't include the items in this package. It’s simply gorgeous and you’ll agree when you see it. Here's the package: 1945 SA M1 Garand w/like new Danish barrel; Turner Saddlery Black All-Weather 1903 style sling; CMP hard case; repro Garand soft case; nearly $200 in At The Front web gear - cartridge belt, reinforced suspenders, first aid pouch - outstanding web gear made to original specs; nearly $800 in USGI and Fulton Armory spare parts to keep this rifle running a long time - USGI spares include two complete bolt assemblies - one is WWII NOS and a NOS gas cylinder. Spares also include a NIB Schuster adjustable gas plug so you can shoot commercial ammo; over $100 in Garand specific tools and cleaning gear including headspace gauges; various Garand books. All items in the package are in like new condition except where noted. You won't find a package like this ANYWHERE - especially these days! Buyer may also contact me about purchasing a SUBSTANTIAL amount of ammo. Payment via personal check. Package ships when payment clears. There will be at least two packages - rifle in the CMP hard case and all other items in at least one other box. Please ensure your FFL will accept this shipment from a private seller. If it has to come from an FFL, there will be an additional cost."

It's a anti-gun wack-jobs worst nightmare. It has round clip things that hold up to 20 rounds, a flash hider, a pistol grip oh my, TWO pistol grips! It also has rails that let you attach other evil things! Probably the worst feature of all, IT'S BLACK AND SCARY LOOKING! Hide your women and children! Guns like this have a way of killing people all my themselves!  Ok, lets get serious...   

Saiga 12. This gun was custom built here in St. Petersburg by DNS Guns & Suppressors. This build is like no other before. Since the supply of guns has all but disappeared we have more time to spend on each build. Accordingly this is one that you can be assured is done perfectly. 
The ultimate in firepower without going class 3. This gun was stripped of all its parts, media blasted, all old holes were tig welded smooth. Trigger group was replaced by a custom designed Tapco G2 trigger. All measurements of the original hammer were transferred to the G2 hammer. This makes for an action that has no drag, period.  
The gun was refinished in Black On Black Ceracoat Firearms finish. Two different shades of black were used so you have a black two tone gun. A fade to black look. After removing from the oven this gun was built out. It has a Tac-47 Auto Gas System. This system lets you set it for the weakest shells you want to fire and forget about it. Anything heavier and the excess gas pressure is vented away to keep from damaging the rear trunion. All Saiga 12's should be built with this system, most are not.  
A M4 6 position rear stock was added, rear pistol grip, front ATI pistol grip aluminum quad rail, 20 round drum, 12 round drum, and a 10 round stick magazine. SGM Flash Hider/Door Breacher and BSA red dot optics. There is nothing more to add to this gun. Take it out of the box and start sending lead down range. 
We have nicknamed it the Dianne Feinstein-a-nator 2013 edition.

Our supply of Saiga 12's is about exhausted. These guns are getting almost impossible to get for us to build and when we do find them they cost us more than ever before. We don't expect to be making these again anytime soon. There may be one more gun and we may decide to keep it for ourselves."
