Recently acquired off of an auction site. Box was beat to heck, but the stand is perfect. I've already assembled it, so that will save you time and some frustration. Absolute least expensive I can find this online anywhere is $399. Millennium's MSRP is $409. Weighs just 36 pounds. Puts you 10 feet off the ground. Literally 30 seconds to 1 minute from off your shoulder to your butt on the seat. Come try it out in my yard and decide for yourself. Call Steve at 513-886-2125. Please do not call to offer me a used welder or anything else weird. I am not interested in any trades except for U.S. currency."

If the listing is still up the pistol is still for sale.  Would consider trading for a P226 ( in 9mm only) or anything exotic, the more unusual the better."

Good job to those wanting to cheat their fellow firearms enthusiasts.The BATFE has released the proposed changes and are taking comments until June. Here’s how it will read as pertaining to owners:The bump-stock-type devices covered by this proposed rule were not in existence prior to the GCA's effective date, and therefore would fall within the prohibition on machineguns if this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) is implemented. Consequently, current possessors of these devices would be required to surrender them, destroy them, or otherwise render them permanently inoperable upon the effective date of the final rule.So flag it, send me nasty emails, do as you wish.bottom line is “buy a bumpstock, lose your money and become a felon if you don’t abide by the laws”there is a database of over 500,000 sales that will be notified. If you say you sold yours you will have to sign an affidavit stating you no longer own it and give contact info to who you sold it to."

All matching, import marked on the barrel. Bore is worn and dirty, but good rifling still remains. The action is somewhat rough to operate, although I suspect the bolt is the cause. I've tested this action with other M91 and 91/30 bolts and they are much smoother than the bolt that is matching to this rifle. I highly recommend having this rifle checked by a gunsmith before firing. It is over 100 years old and I am selling it as a collectible. Thank you!"

It's brand new and includes the original box, installation instructions, barrel nut, barrel nut wrench, 2 barrel nut spacers and various screws, and 3 smaller picatinny rails that can screw on to the handguard itself.I bought it for an AR build and found that it does not fit with my custom upper receiver. By the time I got around to building the upper and discovered this, the return/exchange period had passed. They will absolutely fit a standard upper receiver and is literally brand new, only taken out of the box long enough for the 2 seconds it took me to realize it wouldn't fit.It's a good quality product for the price range and I use a UTG handguard on another upper receiver, my only issue is that it won't fit on my custom upper. I'm willing to negotiate a bit- I just want to sell and start looking for something that will fit my rifle. I'm located in Lodo but flexible about meeting. I'm also happy to provide a nice paper bag and/or reasonably discrete packaging."
