A durable synthetic stock resists weather and rough use and features removable spacers in the butt of the stock to adjust length of pull. The Pro THB’s heavy barrel is 20” with Mannox finish, and the rifle is chambered in .308 Winchester. The barrel comes with 5/8x24 right-hand thread and has a tactical bolt knob. The standard heavy barrel comes with a 20MOA picatinny rail, but a long picatinny rail is also available. As in other high-performance long-guns offered by Steyr, the Pro THB features the Safe Bolt System (SBS), a unique 2+1 safety function that offers 3 settings operated by a wheel switch on the tang of the stock. The fire mode (safety off) is indicated by a red dot; the first level of safe mode disables the firing mechanism and the second level of safe serves to lock the bolt down against the stock and also features a press-to-release tab that locks the SBS switch in the safe position. Another feature is the 2-stage magazine securing mechanism that uses a first stage that locks the magazine in but allows the bolt to be operated while not engaging and chambering the rounds in the magazine, thereby providing the operator with the option of loading individual rounds by hand while maintaining a full magazine at the ready. One more tap to the bottom of the magazine then seats it in the second stage, which is ready for auto-loading."

Most precise and easy firearm ive ever shot. The only reason Im selling is to fund a motorcycle purchase. There are a couple tiny scufs to the coating but honestly the only bad thing is that its hard to find enough land to shoot it to its full potential. If you are not familiar with the manufacturer, give them a quick search. They also design aerospace parts hence the carbon fiber and design. They have lifetime warranty as well. Its a rare rifle with precision build quality. From the factory, they are an expensive rifle.

It has a threaded 1:7 twist barrel with a thread protector, low profile gas block and handguard, and is equipped with a shockwave brace. I added an angled hand stop and flip up sights. Normally I'd have a red Dot on there too but it's pricey and it looks nice on my other AR so yeah.  The receiver is an FMK firearms lower, the rest is from various upstanding sources. I love this thing. It was built with home defense in mind, and I don't ""want"" to sell it. A recent home improvement put me in a bit of debt and I could use the money so I'm kind of trying to sell this wonderful little thing. That being unnecessarily said, I'm only looking for cash, I'm not open to trades. People like to say crap like ""low round count"" but this rifle has literally been fired once. Like literally 1 round in my back yard to make sure it was cycling. I'm not lying, I can't prove it i guess but it's super clean obviously. It's my 5th AR build so I'm confident. Take that for what it's worth. Listen, if you have any questions, I always have my phone so I respond quick. I'll help out how I can. I also have a C-96 Broomhandle Mauser, it's not for sale, I'm just bragging. Thanks for reading this mess. Take care."

This particular musket comes right out of a 60 year old Revolutionary War collection in the historic Connecticut River Valley. It is absolutely 100% original and untouched throughout. The barrel measures 40 5/8"" long. The lock is engraved ""J. ROUSSEAU / AMSTERDAM"".but will void inspection privileges.

The stock retains a very pleasing untouched original finish showing moderate wear with a blackened patina in protected areas. The upper comb has been re-shaped slightly during the period of use. Aside from just a couple very old chips around the barrel tang and a 1/2"" crack above the rear lock screw the wood is excellent with no additional cracks, chips, or repairs. There are some faint illegible initials marked on the left side of the buttstock. Original brass buttplate, sideplate, triggerguard, wrist escutcheon, and barrel bands have a dark, mellowed patina.

The action is crisp and functions smoothly. These muskets seldom come to market and are a crucial necessity to any Revolutionary War collection. Don't miss this chance to own a superb, absolutely original example! No FFL required on pre-1899 firearms. They were used by American Light Dragoons as well as infantry officers. This particular musket comes right out of a 60 year old Revolutionary War collection in the historic Connecticut River Valley. It is absolutely 100% original and untouched throughout. The barrel measures 40 5/8"" long. The lock is engraved ""J. ROUSSEAU / AMSTERDAM"".but will void inspection privileges. Buyer pays actual shipping costs, including packaging fees, shipping services (USPS or UPS), and insurance. Overall the metal has a rich dark plum patina. The stock retains a very pleasing untouched original finish showing moderate wear with a blackened patina in protected areas. The upper comb has been re-shaped slightly during the period of use. Aside from just a couple very old chips around the barrel tang and a 1/2"" crack above the rear lock screw the wood is excellent with no additional cracks, chips, or repairs. There are some faint illegible initials marked on the left side of the buttstock. Original brass buttplate, sideplate, triggerguard, wrist escutcheon, and barrel bands have a dark, mellowed patina.
