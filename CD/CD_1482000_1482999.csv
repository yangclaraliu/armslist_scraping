Magpul's PMAG M2 MOE AR-15 Magazines are identical to the original time-tested and combat proven Pmag, with the only difference being that the Pmag's optional impact/dust cover is not included. The M2 MOE Pmag is constructed from advanced polymers that are light weight and exhibit superior impact resistance. The 30-round magazine features a constant curve interior profile for enhanced feeding of cartridges. A 4-way anti-tilt follower and high quality stainless steel spring ensure reliable feeding, while the magazine body's distinctive, ""slim"" ribs and flared floorplate improve handling over conventional metal-bodied magazines. The Pmag is designed to lock into place reliably on a closed bolt when fully loaded to its 30 round capacity, unlike standard AR-15 magazines which are generally down-loaded to 28 rounds. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using an improvised punch for ease of cleaning and maintenance. Will accept all Magpul Pmag accessories such as Pmag Ranger Plates and impact/dust covers."

The genesis of modular free float rails has arrived. Building off the TRX Extreme design that revolutionized rail based hand guards; the Alpha Rail® utilizes a new low-profile locking mechanism, which offers unparalleled strength and stability.

Included in the sale is: 
- Walther PPK/s .380
- 1 magazine
- 37 rounds of premium Fiocchi FMJ, the unofficial ammo of the PPK/s 
- 73 rounds of Tulammo
- Holster Kings Yaqui IWB/OWB holster. 

This is a stainless steel Interarms model of the PPK/s, in my opinion the Interarms model is far more reliable than the current S&W model. This is an all-steel gun that rides well with concealed carry on those hot summer days. It is very high quality with tight fittings and low bore access. It's in very good shape with few scratches on the metal. I clean and oil after every range trip to ensure my guns stay in shooting condition.

I am not the first owner so I cannot say for sure how many rounds have been fired through it, but I have put close to 1000 rounds through it and it has functioned really well with several types of ammunition. I recently replaced the old ejector with a brand new one from the manufacturer.

It has a great size, not too small, but not huge. It handles recoil very well and has a great balanced weight in my opinion. It's fun for a day at the range or as an everyday carry. The polish on the stainless steel means it slides nicely in and out of the holster. 

I would keep this gun but I just need the extra money so I have to sell. I have nothing bad to say about it. Anyone who buys it will be getting a great pistol. 


$600 or best offer which is a pretty good deal, I've seen the same gun at a gun show for $650 with no ammo or holster. Plus .380 seems to be some of the only ammo you can still find at Walmart semi-regularly haha. Please include your phone number in email."

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.
Compatible with:  AR15, M16, M4 HK416, FN, SCAR, MK 16/16S, SA-80, M27 (IAR)

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches."

Email me, I'm relatively responsive. Prices are low already. I made some price adjustments yesterday so I can work on bringing in new stock/calibers over the next week or so. The only place there will be discounting on QTY is the .308 silver bear if you buy all of it. We will exchange contact info if it makes sense. Please let me know if you have questions. Thanks!

I have made about 15 deals over the last two weeks and will generally meet someone halfway if possible as long as you're spending a couple hundred bucks and you don't live in Timbuktu.

And to all you people who think people like me are somehow buying this ammo for 2010 prices and getting 2-3x what we paid for it...you are dead wrong. None of us like high ammo prices and my prices are very fair. I put in a lot of effort to find ammo at a decent price and bring it into Indy and you demonize me for making a few cents per round. I put my thousands of dollars of my money at risk by taking an inventory position that could instantly lose value...what...do you expect me to take a loss selling you ammo that you can't find on the shelves ANYWHERE? Haters get a grip!

This two wheel single axle trailer is built to last for years of dependable use. This trailer comes standard with a hydraulic surge brake system to aid in stopping when fully loaded. The trailer also has an adjustable landing leg with a wide foot and replacement hand crank. The original military style double handbrakes are functional and secure the trailer when parked on an incline.

The trailer is still wired for the military style electrical plugs. These can be changed to a civilian style without too much effort. The interior of the trailer measures 65"" W and 96"" L. The trailer weighs about 1340lbs empty and can safely haul another 1500lbs or more off-road or 2250lbs. The trailer has all original side racks, bows and the tarp that is included in this price. This trailer is light enough to be moved by one person and the lunette can easily be picked up and moved over a pintle hitch while empty. There very little to no rust on this trailer.

This trailer would make a perfect choice for towing behind a 3/4 or 1 ton 4x4 pickup; perfect for off-road use (substantial ground clearance). Great for hauling bulk materials or moving boxes, whatever you have to transport or store. If you want to take an off road expedition or to bug out for the next zombie invasion, this trailer is right for you.

TAPCO® GEN II 30-round 5.56 Magazine

NEW!

Brand-new, fully functioning 5.56 magazines. Get them while you still can.

Specs:
Holds 30 rounds of .223/5.56mm Ammunition
Dark Earth Anti-Tilt Follower
Premium 17-7 Stainless Steel Spring
Reinforced Composite Magazine Body and Floorplate
The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower.
We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag.

When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market.

I bought this gun on the internet years ago from a person that thought it may be original bluing on it. It is not. I have pictured the left side of the reciever where someone tried to clean up a small rust pit and re-blue. As you can see in the picture, the front 1/3 of the receiver is different colored than the back. The rest of the gun looks like the back half of the reciever. The only light spot that shows up is on the front half of the left side. The wood has excellent marbeling and beautiful checkering. It does have impressions into the butt stock on the sides. I tried to picture the ones by the shell gate, which are the worst. The wood appears to have the original finish. Serial #27092, which should make it made in 1907"

107 Series Models

The evolutionary successor to the 106 series. This series had the frame redesigned to eliminate the plugging of the spring hole produced with the old tooling. The earliest 107 series pistols were marked ""MODEL 107 / MILITARY"" and the serial number on the right side of the frame. About 1972, the ""MODEL 107"" and ""MILITARY"" markings on the frame weres deleted and then later the word ""MILITARY"" reappeared near the end of the end of the traditional serial number series. The ""MILITARY"" marking is absent from the guns with the ML prefixed serial numbers.. There is no premium associated with these variations. These markings changers were not a change in design series, only a change in markings. The serial numbers of later guns produced after mid 1975 utilized a new serial numbering system. The Military models utilized a""ML"" prefix on the serial number. Early production utilized the red bottomed magazines. Later guns had a blued steel bottom. The 107 series was produced from 1968 until 1981. Production at Hamden, CT 1968 to 1976. At East Hartford 1976 to 1982. Guns with serial numbers above ML 25,000 are manufactured in East Hartford. Guns before ML 29,xxx were made by the Leisure Group and guns made after ML 29,xxx were made by High Standard Inc. The serial number ranges are best estimates as of the revision date. Valued at $695 low end fair condition to $895 high end super clean. Add $200 premium for guns with boxes and accessories if factory records verify Model Number.

*NOTICE: PMAG 20LR COMPATIBILITY WITH LMT MWS RIFLE
A potential compatibility issue has come to Magpul's attention regarding the PMAG 20LR magazine when used in a limited number of 7.62 NATO caliber LMT MWS weapon systems. When the PMAG 20LR is inserted into the magazine well, some MWS rifles exhibit interference between the bolt catch and the rear of the magazine. This can cause partial engagement of the bolt catch and result in unintentional contact between the bolt carrier group and the bolt catch during normal weapon operation. Although this issue has only been reported by a very limited number of end users, Magpul has introduced a slight modification to all new production PMAG 20LR magazines to eliminate any potential for bolt catch interference, effective 5/18/2011.

Magpul is committed to continued improvement of our entire product line to ensure the widest range of weapon compatibility and best functionality possible. To most efficiently handle compatibility inquiries regarding the PMAG 20LR, please contact Magpul via email at REDACTED."

Our Assessment: H-S Precision introduced aluminum bedding clock rifle stocks way back in 1981, and have been making high-end components and rifles since then.

If you had been thinking of ordering a custom deer rifle, why wait months when you can get this one now that already has all the features you would want?

I have a Ruger P85 9mm pistol for sale. I am the original owner. I only shot 50 rounds through this pistol.

	The day I was brought home was the happiest day of my life, but what was once a life of dreams and endless possibilities has turned and forsaken me. Hello, my name is COLT AR-15 5.56 NATO LE6920 and I want to be anywhere but here. 
	My owners treated me like royalty when they brought me home, they showed me to all of their friends and family bragging about ""The COLT AR-15 5.56 NATO LE6920"" being top of the line. Bragging about me being the ""Real Deal"" that I wasn't just some M-Forgery. I felt like the most important COLT LE6920 that had ever been produced. Each person that held me was in awe of my touch, my ergonomics, my aura. Each person that held me wanted to take me home always making a comment about how they had always wanted to hold one…to own one. This went on and on, I never grew tired of the sparkle in their eyes when I was brought out…like a little child on Christmas morning every time they saw me. But this all ended, and abruptly I might add. 
	My owners put me away, never firing me, never allowing me to show them what I can do. All of the perfection, all of the time and energy spent in engineering the perfect AR-15 just to put me right back in my original packaging. Why? WHY!?!? My owners went out and got themselves AK's, I mean, who's side are they on? The male has his Russian Saiga AK-74, and the female has her Egyptian Maadi AK-47. I know they have been out shooting with them too…all the time in fact. They come home smelling of gun powder laughing and retelling their stories to each other about how much fun they had and how well their AK's performed…and all of this was done right in front of me, over and over…in front of me as if I had no feelings at all.
	I can't take it anymore, I need to be freed. I need to do what I was put here to do, and thats Kill Zombies and Commies! Somebody…anybody who reads this please free me, please let me do what I was made to do. Don't let me live my life in this cardboard box to be forgotten.

The good:  strong rifling, excellent shooter, and the kind of quality built into guns from the era. All steel, no plastic, no alloy, just solid straight shooting early ruger quality. 

The bad:  someone re-finished the gun. Looks like possibly cera-kote?  Don't know. It was done before I received the pistol. While its durable, I assume it kills any collector value the gun might have had, and relegates it to ""shooter"" status, which it does an excellent job of.  The stocks/grips aren't the greatest, but they're cheap and easy to change. 

What am I looking for?  I'm hoping to trade or part trade for a kahr (probably cw series, but open to others) in 9, 40, or 45.  Also open to ruger sr compact series, or other solid brand compacts in full size calibers (no hi-points, lorcins, cobras, etc...) and I don't need a .380.  I also like big bore six guns, and am ok with taurus, or European replicas. 
If you have other trade ideas, send them to me. I'm easy to work with, and will be polite if you do the same.  If you like the gun but want cash on my end, I'm open, but be reasonable. I can add some ammo to sweeten the deal as well. 

Prefer WA State ccl holder, and there will be a bill of sale/trade for your records and mine"

This rifle is extremely new, manufactured on 2/24/2013 and purchased by me on 3/8/2013. I took it out to Long Range Alley one time and fired 120 rounds through it. As expected, not a single problem. This was my dream rifle for the longest time and I'm glad I got to own one but I'm selling it because I'm trying to get my family into a new house and would like to put the money towards that. I figure now is a good time to sell since Washington is working on the background check legislation and the time is now to buy any guns people may want without a paper trail.

This rifle is amazing. Sig hit the nail on the head with this one. For those that don't know, it's the ideal hybrid of an AK and an AR. I just read that the Philadelphia SWAT team just adopted this as their standard rifle. It uses a bolt thats basically identical to an AK47. Uses a two position piston system so when the gas port gets gunked up, you can change the position and keep on rockin, if the both get gunked up you can turn it completely off and have a bolt action rifle. Its quite amazing. It uses AR15 magazines and shoots both 556 and 223. This gun is extremely easy to clean and will make you hate cleaning your AR. 

The only thing I did to this gun is remove the A2 birdcage flash hider and replace it with a Stryker Comp from 556 Tactical here in Shreveport. It's a really cool compensator that's extremely effective and attractive. It comes in the box it shipped in with all the paperwork, blank warranty card, coupon for 20% off on Sig's website, unopened 3 pack of Ergo rail covers, small bottle of lube, and one 30 rd NHMTG magazine (scratched up but came that way, it's aluminum what do you expect). The gun features Sig's own RDSS (rotary diopter sight system) that is very much like HK's. It has 4 aperture's, CQB, 100yrd, 200yrd and 300yrd. The top rail of the receiver also has an internal rear sight that flips down and is concealed within the rail.

Any questions please ask. I'm looking for $1,550 or best offer. Like I said, I'm not hurting for money, just trying to give a boost to my dream of moving. I am flexible and I have some 20 round PMAG's that I may be willing to either sell of throw in to make a deal work.
