Without going into the full details, go to Buds Guns.com and look up this marvelous non plastic shotgun.  The details when manufactured exceed most shotguns costing far more than this piece.I've nevr had a shell through it as its been in the carrying bag since day one.  This firearm comes with a gun belt that allows for spare 12 ga shells. I've also purchased a heavy duty carrying bag that has several pockets for addtional shells and other equipment or maybe a sandwich.I've left photos out but at Buds you'll have a full image and the accessories (less bag) included.  What I've found, most dealers are out of stock on this model since they are so popular. You pay the transfer and its yours for noted price.  Sound Loan in Everett has the lowest transfer price I've ever seen."

This rifle's receiver is also in great shape, with no wear/tear, or flaws/defects, either on the outside, or on the innner chamber. Even the barrel is in great shape, with little to no signs of rusting, discoloration, or pitting, either on the inside, or the outside! This rifle features a mounting rail on top of the receiver, as well as a UTG rail at the end of the barrel's heat shield, which allows for a number of optics and other accessories to be attached. This AR DOES NOT have any iron sights, and DOES NOT come with a scope, however, the rifle is prepared, and ready for any optic of scope to be attached. Lastly, this AR features a front grip, mounted to the bottom of the heat shield, that allows for more secure firing, and also doubles as a bipod to increase your accuracy even more!

The rifle is custom built around a Remington 700 long action and is chambered in 300 Win Mag. Base rifle was a Remington 700 Sender SFII. Barrel was cut down to 24"" and given a concentric 11 degree target crown and threaded with a Surefire MB762SSAL/RE muzzle brake. A Timney 510 Wide Bow trigger with safety was installed (user adjustable from 1.5-4.5lbs) with a glass like break and combat toughness and reliability. The factory bolt was polished as was the action for smooth cycling. A Badger Tactical knob was installed. The action is topped with a 20 MOA Badger steel base which was properly bedded to the receiver.Barreled action was mated to a custom Manners MCS T4A DBM stock. This stock has an embedded aluminum Badger Mini Chassis to which the Badger detachable box magazine bottom metal and barreled action mate (fits AI mags). Stock has an adjustable cheek piece, dual forend sling studs, single rear sling stud, QD flush caps installed on left side. Stock has a pronounced toe for hooking support hand and rear bag, as well as a comfortable 1"" recoil pad. A PIGSKIN barricade pad was installed on the forend for helping establish positive grip when shooting from barricades.Rifle is topped with a Vortex Razor HD 5-20x50 FFP scope with the EBR-2B illuminated reticle. It's a mil/mil optic with 0.1 mil adjustments. Eleven illumination settings work in any light conditions and the lowest settings are compatible with NODs. The optic is mounted in matched Vortex 35mm rings. Scope comes with a 4"" sunshade, Tenebraex ARD, and additional custom low light polarized lens which fits in the scope cap to allow a clear view through reflections and glare. A custom switch view lever was machined and installed for rapid magnification adjustments. Scope assembly includes Flatline Ops angle cosine indicator on a Flatline cosine mount. The optic is covered by Vortex's awesome lifetime warranty, no questions asked.These modifications have taken this rifle to its full potential. It is capable of sub 1/2 MOA if the shooter does their part and works up the right loads. Rifle is capable of sustaining rugged and heavy use.The barreled action, scope, and bipod have a heat cured cerakote base coat for durability. The entire rifle sport a custom duracoat camouflage paint job. All accessories have the same duracoat finish.In addition to the items listed above, the package includes:- Harris 9-13"" HBLMS bipod with Phoenix Tactical leg lock screws and KMW Pod Loc.- (2) 5 round AI mags- (1) 10 round AI mag- Triad Tactical double magazine pouch (FDE)- Triad Tactical large stock pack (FDE)- TAB Gear Elite Biathalon Sling with cobra buckles and QD hardware (FDE)- Accushot BT13-QK-PRM monopod- Triad Tactical ammunition pouch with DOPE card window pockets- TAB Gear Suppressor cover (9.5""L x 1.5"" diameter)- Pelican 1750 case with foam cut to accomodate the rifle and all accessories.- Mesh camouflage sniper/rifle veil- OTIS Precision rifle cleaning kit in zippered field pouch- Vortex optics/lens cleaning kit- Tiffen low light polarizer- Extra lithium batteries for the opticThis rifle has been maintained exceptionally well and I can provide a log book for accountability of the 250 rounds fired through her. Priced out individually, this package would cost over $7000. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.I'm having issues upoading pictures here, but I can send some over text if you wish. I love this rifle, but I am transitioning out of the military and could use the cash and don't shoot enough to justify having it lay around unused. I'd much rather see this rifle go to someone who will appreciate it. I am open to some trade (climbing or mountaineering gear or possibly some firearms) + cash offers, but am mainly looking for majority cash.I can be reached at (412) 807-1701."

All matching parts, including the magazine. The grips fit good and are original grips. They have the kanji stamped inside on both. Kokubunji grips were ONLY pencil marked. Those marks are VERY faintly visible on one grip but very visible on the other. Kokubunji gund DO NOT have matching numbered firing pins! They have have an arsenal marking as this does. All Kokubunji Factory T14s have 73mm strikers with the small diameter tip, as this does. This is honestly THE nicest Type 14 I have ever had. The bluing is truly 97%. The only detractant being a tiny spot on the top of the slide (clearly shown in the pics), and one of the grips has a split in it but its not broken in half and can easily be fixed with 5 minutes and a little super glue. Even the bluing on the magazine barely has a rub on it. The barrel and bore are like brand new! I had a hard time photographing it because it shined so much. If you are looking for a like new WW2 era Type 14, this is it. I believe it was carried and not used. Most likely a high ranking officer or the like was issued it. NO IMPORT MARKS!

The rifle is custom built around a Remington 700 long action and is chambered in 300 Win Mag. Base rifle was a Remington 700 Sender SFII. Barrel was cut down to 24"" and given a concentric 11 degree target crown and threaded with a Surefire MB762SSAL/RE muzzle brake. A Timney 510 Wide Bow trigger with safety was installed (user adjustable from 1.5-4.5lbs) with a glass like break and combat toughness and reliability. The factory bolt was polished as was the action for smooth cycling. A Badger Tactical knob was installed. The action is topped with a 20 MOA Badger steel base which was properly bedded to the receiver.Barreled action was mated to a custom Manners MCS T4A DBM stock. This stock has an embedded aluminum Badger Mini Chassis to which the Badger detachable box magazine bottom metal and barreled action mate (fits AI mags). Stock has an adjustable cheek piece, dual forend sling studs, single rear sling stud, QD flush caps installed on left side. Stock has a pronounced toe for hooking support hand and rear bag, as well as a comfortable 1"" recoil pad. A PIGSKIN barricade pad was installed on the forend for helping establish positive grip when shooting from barricades.Rifle is topped with a Vortex Razor HD 5-20x50 FFP scope with the EBR-2B illuminated reticle. It's a mil/mil optic with 0.1 mil adjustments. Eleven illumination settings work in any light conditions and the lowest settings are compatible with NODs. The optic is mounted in matched Vortex 35mm rings. Scope comes with a 4"" sunshade, Tenebraex ARD, and additional custom low light polarized lens which fits in the scope cap to allow a clear view through reflections and glare. A custom switch view lever was machined and installed for rapid magnification adjustments. Scope assembly includes Flatline Ops angle cosine indicator on a Flatline cosine mount. The optic is covered by Vortex's awesome lifetime warranty, no questions asked.These modifications have taken this rifle to its full potential. It is capable of sub 1/2 MOA if the shooter does their part and works up the right loads. Rifle is capable of sustaining rugged and heavy use.The barreled action, scope, and bipod have a heat cured cerakote base coat for durability. The entire rifle sport a custom duracoat camouflage paint job. All accessories have the same duracoat finish.In addition to the items listed above, the package includes:- Harris 9-13"" HBLMS bipod with Phoenix Tactical leg lock screws and KMW Pod Loc.- (2) 5 round AI mags- (1) 10 round AI mag- Triad Tactical double magazine pouch (FDE)- Triad Tactical large stock pack (FDE)- TAB Gear Elite Biathalon Sling with cobra buckles and QD hardware (FDE)- Accushot BT13-QK-PRM monopod- Triad Tactical ammunition pouch with DOPE card window pockets- TAB Gear Suppressor cover (9.5""L x 1.5"" diameter)- Pelican 1750 case with foam cut to accomodate the rifle and all accessories.- Mesh camouflage sniper/rifle veil- OTIS Precision rifle cleaning kit in zippered field pouch- Vortex optics/lens cleaning kit- Tiffen low light polarizer- Extra lithium batteries for the opticThis rifle has been maintained exceptionally well and I can provide a log book for accountability of the 250 rounds fired through her. Priced out individually, this package would cost over $7000. Please feel free to contact me with any questions.I'm having issues upoading pictures here, but I can send some over text if you wish. I love this rifle, but I am transitioning out of the military and could use the cash and don't shoot enough to justify having it lay around unused. I'd much rather see this rifle go to someone who will appreciate it. I am open to some trade (climbing or mountaineering gear or possibly some firearms) + cash offers, but am mainly looking for majority cash.I can be reached at REDACTED."
