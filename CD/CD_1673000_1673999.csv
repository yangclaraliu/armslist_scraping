The grip is very similar feeling to a Beretta 92, and is surprisingly small considering it's capacity. It can be carried cocked and locked. The gun didn't have any failures and recoil was very minimal for a 45acp. When I bought the gun I ordered 2 extra magazines that have never even been loaded. The gun will come with 14 rounds of fiocchi 230 grain ammo, the case, and the literature. This is a very impressive gun, just a little big and heavy for what I need."

I've turned this thing into a pretty cool tactical carbine, and it shoots very well. Not to mention, it folds up for easy storage. The 50 round drum was $150. And the forend was another $150. I've got a good $500 into this gun. If you're interested, you can email me, but the best (and fastest) way to contact me is via text message at REDACTED.

It is a full size 1911. I bought this new from shoot straight in apopka, fl/october 2012 and have the bill of sale from that. This kimber began its life as a custom crimson carry ii. That is what is still inscribed on the slide. I then decided to change it and sent it to kimber to have the frame refinished to their dark earth. They also installed all black parts including an ambidextrous safety. I have all the paperwork from kimber showing what they did. When it returned I sold the rosewood crimson trace grips it originally came with and put on the crimson trace digital camo grips. It comes with a battery installed, an extra battery, the laser sighting tool and a small cloth on a handle to clean the laser itself when it gets dirty. I had trijicon night sights installed (yellow rear, green front) I finished it off with an STI trigger and STI main spring plug. The finished product is a clone of the kimber covert ii but (in my opinion) with a better trigger and night sights. Ive never had an issue with the gun for the short time ive had it. It is a full size 1911 and was my edc gun. Also included are all the grey parts it originally came with that kimber switched out to black and one kimber 1911 mag. It has been frog lubed its entire life (personal preference I know) I can give you any other info you need on it and/or pictures you may want, if interested.

This is a great shooting gun. I'm not sure of the rd count. It's somewhere around 100 as I think I've only taken it to the range 1 time. It still has a little of Glocks legendary gold grease in it. It's in excellent condition. I'm pretty sure I put a 3.5 connector in it because I usually do that to all my new Glocks. It has a nice trigger pull.

This rifle is just breath taking. I bought it and the scope together brand new a year ago, mounted the scope, zeroed the scope, then cleaned the rifle, put it into a gunsock and into my climatically controlled safe where it has sat untouched until just now when I took it out to take these pictures. This rifle is just about impossible to find, there is not one on Gunbroker or anywhere else online for sale that I could find. The tube magazine holds 14 rds of .22 LR ammo which means you will never have to buy a high capacity magazine and it will never be 'banned'. The stock is a beautiful black and gray hardwood laminate with a rubber butt pad and it is light years ahead of any black plastic stock. I zeroed this rifle at 15 yards and it shot a little ragged one hole group; it is a very accurate rifle with a nice trigger. I will also include with this rifle at no additional cost 100 rds of CCI MiniMag 36 gr Hollow Point ammo to get you going. This rifle is a safe queen that has less than 50 rds thru it, has never been beyond my backyard where I zeroed it, and there is not a mark on it, it is absolutely as new. Check out the Simmons 22 MAG 3-9x40 AO scope at OpticsPlanet where you can read the reviews on it, and you can see more about this rifle at Marlin's website; they are both current production models. I will meet the buyer half way between us in a public location during daylight hours for a FTF cash and carry deal. I am not interested in counter offers or trades of any sort; pls dont waste your time or mine offering me less than my asking price. Buyer must be legal Maryland resident who is not prohibited by law from owing firearms; Active duty military stationed in Maryland with orders OK as well.

Adjustable trigger. I have fired 60 rounds with the pictured Nikon Monarch and dialed in the rifle to MOA & some sub-MOA groups. Pretty cool shooter, lightweight & accurate, but I’m more of an iron sight kind of guy, and this rifle isn’t very iron sight friendly without gunsmithing.

Purchased new in Jan. 2013.

$525 for the rifle (includes 10 rd. magazine, org. box, papers, cable lock, etc)

$225 additional for the pictured scope: Nikon Monarch 2.5-10x42 (Nikoplex)

$25 additional for Blackhawk bipod, leather sling and sling swivels

Face to Face only in Fort Collins. Can do background check if so desired. Must have CO Driver’s license or CHP.

This rifle is just breath taking. I bought it and the scope together brand new a year ago, mounted the scope, zeroed the scope, then cleaned the rifle, put it into a gunsock and into my climatically controlled safe where it has sat untouched until just now when I took it out to take these pictures. This rifle is just about impossible to find, there is not one on Gunbroker or anywhere else online for sale that I could find. The tube magazine holds 14 rds of .22 LR ammo which means you will never have to buy a high capacity magazine and it will never be 'banned'. The stock is a beautiful black and gray hardwood laminate with a rubber butt pad and it is light years ahead of any black plastic stock. I zeroed this rifle at 15 yards and it shot a little ragged one hole group; it is a very accurate rifle with a nice trigger. I will also include with this rifle at no additional cost 100 rds of CCI MiniMag 36 gr Hollow Point ammo to get you going. This rifle is a safe queen that has less than 50 rds thru it, has never been beyond my backyard where I zeroed it, and there is not a mark on it, it is absolutely as new. Check out the Simmons 22 MAG 3-9x40 AO scope at OpticsPlanet where you can read the reviews on it, and you can see more about this rifle at Marlin's website; they are both current production models. I will meet the buyer half way between us in a public location during daylight hours for a FTF cash and carry deal. I am not interested in counter offers or trades of any sort; pls dont waste your time or mine offering me less than my asking price. Buyer must be legal Maryland resident who is not prohibited by law from owing firearms; Active duty military stationed in Maryland with orders OK as well. I will not ship this rifle. thanks for looking, pls email with any questions."

It was originally purchased as a fixer-upper - it fires fine every time, but the cartridge stop mechanism that keeps the shells in the magazine tube is worn and either needs to be adjusted or replaced in order to keep the shells from all trying to come out with each pump.  Pretty easy fix, but my family has grown and I don't have time to work on this project. 

The other thing that I read about folks doing is lopping off part of the barrel to convert it to a replica of the Stevens 77E, a popular riot/battle shotgun used during the Vietnam War.  I had also thought about doing this project, but again, my growing family prevents me from dedicating time to projects like this one.

I sometimes travel to Temple for work or Austin, Dallas, Houston to visit family, so I could consider transactions there based on my travel schedule.  This would make a great project shotgun for someone doing the Vietnam era reproduction or for a teenager's first hunting shotgun."

I WILL NOT SELL AT SILVER MELT PRICE SO DON'T EVEN TRY ME! I've been a collector for 10 years as well as a Numismatist for 4 years. I know what I have, I know what they are worth.
I have a very very large collection but I am selling only certain coins. In total, I am willing to sell about 35 graded coins, 150 raw proofs, and some BU rolls of non silver coins. 
The collectibles I have for sale are as follows:
-Autographed and authenticated World Series baseball, signed by Mitt Romney. My uncle worked with Romney from 2001-2010 and this baseball belonged to him before he gave it to me when he moved to Texas in 2012. $120
-Vintage Dietzen surveyors scope. I believe its from the 1940s-1950s. 100% functional, 8/10 condition with no rust except on small spots on the case. Has original fiberglassed hard case, no stand. $90 obo
-Misc political collectibles such as presidential and congressional campaign pins, all 100% original, not repros. Some Ike (Eisenhower), Nixon, FDR, Goldwater. None newer than 1985. An Eisenhower presidential campaign  bobblehead bank. Its slightly damaged but its what you'd expect for being from the 1950s. $150obo for all
-5 Quality freshwater fishing rods. All are baitcasting, 3 were used less than 5 times. Can give more detail on each one per request. $18/each, $80/all
-Roper electric washer and dryer set. Less than 10 months old we bought them new from Lowes and paid $680 for the set. Comes with the hooks ups.  Will sell the set for $400. (lowes has them new for sale, with the dryer being $314 and the washer being $324) YOU MUST PICK THEM UP AS I CANNOT DELIEVER THEM(Don't have a truck).
-Vizio flat screen 32"" 1080p HDTV. Like new, we upgraded to a 40"" Vizio. $180 (Walmart new= $399)

Taurus Model 96 - .22lr, 6"" barrel, 6 shot revolver (mfd 1990) - this is a rare, blued/wood grips target revolver (identical to the Smith & Wesson Model 17). Comes with 2 nice holsters - an Uncle Mike's Sidekick and a handmade ""western"" leather holster with thumb break. I'll include a 50ct box of Federal American Eagle and 6 rounds of Remington Golden hollow points.

 (the wood grips are in great shape. smooth trigger pull in both SA/DA. the cylinder locks up tight and with the 6"" barrel, the gun shoots very accurately. fires every type of .22lr I've tried and the internals are in great shape. the only issue with the gun's surface is a few spots in the blueing on right side and it does not affect funcionality at all - please see pics below - If the blueing was perfect I'd be at $450 for the Taurus)

NO CASH FOR THIS GUN.

This magnum came into my life brand new in early 1992 (made in 1991), as my first handgun. During the first 10 years or so, it was my primary carry gun, and saw a lot of action. Primarily, I fired 38Spl, because I was never very good with magnums in it.

Since then, it has mostly chilled in various night stands and storage rooms, with occasional trips to the range, or a run around town. I would estimate the round count is no more than 5k - 99% of it was 38Spl.

The hammer was bobbed early in its life, back when Ruger didn't make a spurless SP at all. (In 3"" they still don't!) I think the gunsmith contoured it very nicely to preserve as much hammer mass and thickness as possible.

Just recently, I had the HiViz sight put on it, which works great. The springs are all original, and over the years, the action has become lighter and smoother with use, but not as light as Wolff.

At some point, the little pin Ruger gave to use for disassembly got away, but I always liked using a little nail more for that anyway.

Accessories included:
*The holster is a custom-fit Milt Sparks ""Summer Special"" IWB. 
*The speedloaders are Safariland Comp I push-release, which are PERFECT for quick reloads under stress... 
*The holders are also Safariland Split-Six, and are like new.
*The spare grip is Hogue Monogrip.
*Original manual.
*AceCase soft pistol case. (Not shown in the pics) Made in USA The original box was cardboard back then, and I discarded it. 
More pics availabe upon request. 

The 271 rounds of ammo includes:
*6 Silver Glasers 38Spl+P
*35 Federal Hi-Shok 125gr HP 357Mag
*15 Federal HP 357Mag of unknown weight
*200 of Georgia Arms 38Spl 158gr Copper-Plated-SWC (second box not shown)
*15 Corbon 38Spl+P+ 115gr (These are the very hot 38 +P+ loads Corbon used to make in the 90's. The current ones are not that hot. It's almost a magnum round.)

This excellent revolver never failed me, and means a lot to me for sentimental, personal reasons. However, I under-utilize its full magnum potential, have too many guns, want to try new ones, and don't like to form attachments to things. So, it's time to let this trusty friend move on to new adventures..."

Total length is 8.1 inches. The magazine has a 15 round capacity. Ten round magazines can be used also. Total weight unloaded is 2.5 pounds. The Orginal Finish is about 90%. The Bore is excellent. One Grip Panel shows extentive wear at the bottom. The Star 30MI had been developed and manufactured in Spain by Star Bonifacio Echeverria SA company. The Star 30M appeared in 1990 and had been adopted as a service pistol by the Spanish army and police, as well as by Peruvian police. Technically, the Star 30MI is an updated version of the earlier Star 28M pistol. Star 30MI is a recoil operated, locked breech pistol, that uses Browning-designed, linkless locking (High Power-type), with two lugs on the barrel and shaped cam under the chamber that interacts with slide stop axis iside the frame. Star 30MI features double action trigger with slide mounted ambidextrous safety that locks firing ping only, leaving trigger and hammer unaffected in ""safety on"" position, thus allowing the gun to be ""dry fired"" (however, this is unsafe and is not recommended). Star 30MI also features magazine safety, that disables firing when magazine in not in position. Another safety feature is a loaded chamber indicator. Star 30MI features internal slide rails (like the SIG P-210 or CZ-75). The frame and slide are made from steel (the aluminium-alloy frame version of the Star 30MI is called Star 30PK and is somewhat lighter, as one can expect). The front sight is fixed, the rear sight is dovetailed and thus can be ajusted for windage. The Star 30MI is a reliable, accurate pistol and can be used for self defense and Home Protection."

Type: Single Action Chamber: mod.400: 9x23mm (9mm Largo or 9mm Steyr), 9x19mm Luger/Parabellum, 9x20mm Browning long (mod.600 - 9x19mm Luger/Parabellum only) Weight loaded: 1140 g (1080 g) Length: 225 mm (205 mm) Barrel length: 150 mm (135 mm) Capacity: 8 rounds The ""Astra"" trademark belongs to the ""Societa Unceta and compania"" company (current name Astra-Unceta y Cia) , located in the Guernica, Spain. The Astra mod. 400 pistol first appeared in the early 1920s and had been adopted by the Spain Military in 1921. This pistol was also widely exported to many countries, includint the Hitlers' Germany, that purchased the mod. 400 pistols for its army. The production of the mod.400 had been completed in 1950. Technically, the mod.400 is a blowback operated, hammer fired, single action semiautomatic pistol. It was chambered primary for 9mm Largo (9x23mm Bergmann-Bayard) cartridge but chamber and magazine dimensions allowed to load and fire other 9mm cartridges, such as 9x23mm Steyr, 9x20mm Browning long, 9x19mm Luger/Parabellum, offering almost unprecendent versatility. The recoil spring is located around the barrel. The gun featured no manual safeties. One automatic safety is located at the rear of the grip and locks sear when gun does not gripped by the shooter properly; another, internal safety, disconets the trigger bar from the sear when gun is off the battery (slide does not closed completely). The slide stop is located at the left side of the frame. Thanks to the long barrel and heavy weight, the gun was comfortable to fire and showed good acuuracy."
