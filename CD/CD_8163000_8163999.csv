Because of its innovative design, the SRS takes up less rail space while maintaining the durability expected from Trijicon. The shorter housing eliminates the tube-effect typical of other sealed reflex sights. Featuring a large 28mm aperture, the Trijicon SRS provides a massive field of view for quicker target engagements. The 1.75 MOA dot is small enough for precision and with 10 brightness settings it can be bright enough for any speed. Finally, the Trijicon SRS features dual power sources — an innovative solar cell assisted by a single AA battery.

This Single Shot Break Action .410 Shotgun is an ideal first shotgun for a youth or new shooter. Whether you're sharing your passion for breaking clays or chasing upland birds, the lighter recoil of a .410 is easy for youth and smaller framed individuals to manage. Fast handling, lightweight and superbly balanced, this break-action would be an excellent addition to the ranch, farm or vacation property for varmint and pest control. It features a fixed full choke and a functioning hammer with an internal firing pin rest so the hammer is not resting on the firing pin when it is un-cocked. The synthetic stock has a comfortable cheek rest and it comes with sling swivels to get your ready for the hunt. Lightweight, safe, effective and it folds in half for compact storage or transport. Everyone should have an Iver Johnson IJ700 .410 shotgun on hand!

  As Concealed Carry-Handgun instructors, we prepare our students to defend themselves against a physical attack. But what about the legal attack that so often follows? In today's world, you can be arrested, jailed, sued, fired, discharged under ‘Other than Honorable’ (OTH Good of Service) conditions, and bankrupted, even when you have justifiably used a firearm in self-defense. 

  If you had to use deadly force at home, at work, or on the road when travelling, two fights are sure to ensue; the gun fight and the legal fight sure to follow. That's why you must carefully choose a concealed carry training course. Attend a PatriotTAC Training course to learn all you can about the U.S. Criminal Justice system, the courts, and what you should expect to happen if you use deadly force. 

  You can benefit from the decades of real-world experience, training, and education of our instructors. PatriotTACs instructors deliver both the training and the education you will need in order to stand a chance of winning the legal fight. 

  Learn how to prepare to defend yourself twice – first against the physical attack and second against the legal attack. Patriot Training and Consulting is the only training company in Eastern North Carolina that provides complete legal training for armed self-defense. Do not attend a concealed carry class just to obtain the requisite certificate; choose your course carefully. 

  At PatriotTAC, you will become prepared for the aftermath of an armed self-defense incident. Protect yourself and those you care about as well as our Second Amendment rights by becoming educated in the legal aspects of concealed carry.

You have have 50 firearms, 10 tons of food, and everything covered??? Are you forgetting one of the most basic pieces of kit? Your IBA! Interceptor body armor. These are good for the range or just to keep in the trunk, and obviously, if you are law enforcement or Seciruty on a budget. And, because, well, I like not being perforated. Ive seen what police forces give their cops (its shit), Interceptor gives you much more coverage from the neck all the way to the groin. Nobody wants to have an incounter with a dickhead with a gun. Unfortunately, as police/security/sheep dogs you might be forced to confront an armed suspect. It is our job to be ready for anything including an active shooter! During those times, IBA will be worth its weight in GOLD! Every prepared person needs to get some Body Armor and stash it away. I am a former Army Medic NCO. Every purchase will include a proper fit and, basic orientation about how to wear IBA and its capabilities, if you hav questions. I have Interceptor body armor w/ kevlar all Kevlar inserts. This is not a flack vest. Without the ceramic plates it will stop all commonly carried pistols, including .44 magnum, and shotgun threats. I also have several new ballistic collars (yoke back, and collar front). I also have the groin protector and side protectors. All the vests are complete and have collars but, only the first person to buy will get the extra accessories. I have size M, L, XL all in ACU. I am huge and the ACU XL fits me like a dream! I just removed all the armor and laundered the dirty ones. Then, reinserted the kevlar armor panels (correctly). Disclaimer: All of these were purchased with my own money on the Civilian Surplus Market. The Army has moved to IOTV vests and have sold these for years on the surplus market. $350 for your correct size, front, back, collar, groin, & sides.$300 for your correct size and front, back, collar only."
