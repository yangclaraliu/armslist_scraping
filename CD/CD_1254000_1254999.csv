The Ruger LCP-CT features the Crimson Trace LG-431 Laserguard with an instinctive front-activation button, which allows shooters to project the laser wherever the gun is aimed. This ""instinctive action"" provides immediate feedback and gives shooters confidence their shots will hit their target.

Designed with both male and female shooters in mind, the LCP is as affordable as it is reliable. At just 9.40 ounces (with an empty magazine), the LCP is lightweight and ideal for all-day carry - ensuring you have it when and where you need it.

The stories you might read online about Jimenez (jennings) Products are true until the gun is broke in. This Gun jammed 1 out of every 20 rounds for the first 200 rounds. Once I hit that 200 round mark it only jammed once every 50 rounds. Then I got to the 500 round mark and it no longer james. I have not had a jam since before the 500 round mark and I have shot close to 4000 rounds through it. So now it never james.

I'm looking for a .22 long pistol.
If you offer a jimenez, phoenix, or high point .22's I will trade, but you will have to add cash.  

I am not interested in .380's unless it is a Ruger lcp or something else nice, and then I would add some cash, But I don't really like the .380 round.
I am not interested in .22 rifles, unless it is a Ruger 10/22.
I will trade for other calibre rifles as long as they are not bolt actions.
l might trade for a good shotgun. 

You will need a valid WI drives if you don't have a CCW permit. I will want to see one or both for my legal safety.

This rifle does use some AR parts like the pistol grip, stock and trigger allowing for them to be changed.
The magazine on this rifle comes in a 5 or 10 round proprietary magazine.
The innovative Noreen Bad News .300 Win Mag ULR provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform.
Weighing just 13 pounds, the Bad News .3oo Win Mag ULR is light enough and portable enough to serve as a patrol rifle, yet it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. The rifle’s custom muzzle brake and semi-automatic action significantly suppress recoil. With no bolt to manually work, the smooth action semi-automatic action allows the shooter to keep his head in the scope and his eye on the target for rapid, accurate follow-up shots."

Bought this firearm new, haven't shot it much, maybe a BOX OR TWO, just haven't had the time.. bought it for coyote hunting, just hadn't had the time to get out and o it...

Caliber .22-250 is a bit easier to find than the 7mm-08 guns that are currently up on here.. and a bit more of a varmint gun... 

I've been seeing these things on Gunbroker for around  thousand... i kinda think they're high.. on here they're in the 800 neighborhood... hoping to get the same...

Here is a slightly used (could pass for new) Hi-Point .45 ACP in the color of green.  The bore is bright and shiny as it should be and there is not one mark on the gun.  It has adjustable rear sights.  It shoots great and comes with 4 magazines.  These do have a short picatinny on the bottom of the barrel.  Sorry, but no box with this one.  Checking prices on Gun Gouger.com I came up with the price of $165.00 which seems low and a very fair for this gun.  Please e-mail only.  Thanks for looking.

Bolt and bolt raceway polished for smooth operation. 9"" Harris tilting bipod.

Included is the Ruger 10-round metal magazine as shown and Ruger also makes 5-round magazines as well. Upon completion of the work, the gunsmith took the rifle to the range, fired a total of 3 rounds of match ammo and got the bullets on paper close to the bulls-eye, however, gun is range ready for accuracy fine-tuning. Please understand that this GunSite Scout Rifle is in 100% condition. My thinking when having this rifle built was to create a handy urban counter-sniper rifle, short, light and maneuverable enough for perhaps tight working parameters but fully capable of 350-yard pin-point accuracy with the accurate .308 Winchester round.  Since this is my personal rifle and I am an unlicensed seller, please make sure that your FFL is willing to accept a rifle from me,  I can only ship to your FFL so he can email a copy in a PDF file or mail it with payment.

ALL remaining .22 LR Value Packs were SOLD last night (much obliged to that kind gentleman for the cervezas and the fine conversation too, you give me faith man).  The other .22 LR lines are still available as are the 9mm lines but I must say my .22 LR reserves I'm willing to part with are dwindling fast and yes, I marked them up a bit because of that.  If they don't sell, oh well.  I could be asking plenty more.  As mentioned via last update, newly interested in trades for a Zastava PAP M92 PV Pistol - 7.62x39mm (and still the other prior trades mentioned/any decent offer will be considered).  The M92s are still readily available online for under $800 (some one here was trying to get around $1200 for one...) so please don't offer trades above that.  Just picked up some greasy Chinese 53s and they are tasty so I'm lookin' for more of those or of course the M44's by way of Putin.  Additionally, please don't waste time for both sides by making emphatic inquiries... if you're just going to flake out like the typical standard issue Floridian.  I had a few of those last week (this week too...) and I wasn't impressed.  This is a first come first served operation.  If I say I can get a line of ammo your way, I will... but what I won't do is wait around for flakes to make up their minds or take nearly a day to respond and expect the playing field not to change in the interim.  Be adults, it's not hard. 

The world does not revolve around you or me.

Ok, my fellow Americans, here's the deal. Due to the current political climate and the high prevalence of sheeple, I just paid a hell of a lot more than I should have to for another 'black rifle.' I'm not made of fiat currency, so therefore I need to offset my latest endeavor into common sense.

Unlike most folks selling their ammo you will see I'm actually offering high QUALITY products at a premium... vs all the entry-level products at ridiculous mark-ups... that are all over the place out there. Am I charging more than I paid? Yup. I'm fully justified to do so due to the fact that I had the foresight to plan and ACT accordingly. I jumped through plenty of hoops to get what I have. I don't make it a habit to give away any of my labors for nothing in return, at least in this instance Try going anywhere online or elsewhere and see if you can find a better deal on what I have to offer. Most everything I'm offering isn't even readily available these days... and hasn't been for quite some months now.

Period.

It's been my experience that firearms related PURCHASES always turn out to be a most positive and beneficial thing, whereas whenever I've SOLD something I already possessed... down the road I seriously regretted it. Always. So as crazy as it might sound, if I don't sell one solitary round, that would actually work out for me in 'the long run.' Just ask Don. If I TRY to replace anything I'm offering here within the next 6-12 months or even later... most likely I'll be paying more than what you'd be paying to me in the present. Of course that is assuming that these type of QUALITY products... will even be readily available for purchase at that time.

            Sorry........,just shot Frosty out in the front yard with this. He wasn't doing anything wrong poor guy....,just mad 'cause I can't keep my new toy (I have to mention I was also thinking of some of the economic decisions being made for us by our wise officials. Just got this thing all decked out and had to pay or a truck repair. I digress....Frosty ain't doing so hot
anymore because this thing works AWESOME!!!

-Strikeforce Desert Tan Folding Stock
-40 round Tapco magazine
-Sun Optics receiver mounted see through SKS scope mount.
-Sightmark Holograph Sight with 4 reticle selection ($160 one, not one of the $40 economy ones)
-100 rounds of ammo
-The piece of mind that you can fight off the ""zombie invasion""when TSHTF
-The piece of mind that all the stores that I know of have plenty of cheap ammo for this IN STOCK
-A few stray ""Dremel"" marks where I modified the stock to accommodate the scope mount.
  (not ugly-but then again, no one ever claimed an SKS was pretty to begin with)
-Shoots great! (did I mention Frosty?)
-The nice warm feeling of knowing that this isn't in the hands of a pinko commie anymore and is
  now owned by a PATRIOT that'll use it for whatever he feels he/she must because the 2nd          Amendment says it's your RIGHT!
            If you think this costs more than you want to spend, that's fine. You can find plain ones on Armslist or in the stores for anywhere from $375-$500 depending on condition. But if you want this one, that's been well used and broke in, but has had a nice new stock kit, a really cool ""Holo-sight"" and a really big magazine AND 100 rounds of ammo,then it's gonna cost you $750. If you don't like it....you're free to write ""hate emails"" from yer mommy's basement because THIS IS AMERICA!!! I can then delete them and laugh at your sad, poor self.
            Seriously....,if you want this, email me stating your intention to buy, a number that I can call or text, and be prepared to show a valid form of ID and sign a Bill of Sale, because I'm ONLY SELLING to a LEGAL, law-abiding CITIZEN!

$450 FIRM:  many have asked why do you want more than what the gun retails for?  Well it is simple: I am not asking for more than what it is worth.  Yes, Cabela's sells the gun online right now for $399 (SALE Price).  But after taxes, you will be paying about $420 for the gun.  Then you have to wait until it shows up, then if you only have a purchase permit, there is more wait, all the paperwork and possible registration, etc...  What you may not be seeing in the pictures is that my gun's magazines have grip extenders on them, which cost me $40 and the new holster cost me $30.  I paid $415 + 5% sales tax ($435) for my gun, so I am $505 into the gun.  The gun I have is a year old, has maybe 100 rounds through it and despite a couple of very minor blemished it is like new so this is why I am standing FIRM at $450. So if you knock a few bucks off each item, I am really only asking about $400 for the gun, but it is a package deal and an empty holster and/or grip extenders do  me no good without the gun.  It is a sellers market and at least I am not trying to mark it up over 100%...  Just trying to recoup my money...  Sorry for the spiel, but was getting tired of typing this in so many different email responses to $300 offers..."

TACTICAL PRECISION, For 2012, SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our new SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable

One of the earlier model PT92 when quality control was peak. Matte blue with gloss frame, less than 2 boxes ever fired through it.
Will digest anything we have ever fed it without a hiccup. You can count on this pistol to WORK. Included in sale is a 18 round flush mag, extended 20 round MecGar mag, Pachmyer wrap around grips (nice texture), wood factory grips and a Kydex type holster.

I find the location of the safety to be much easier to reach than the Berreta's placement on the slide. Also this model does not have the decocker. You have safe, first shot double action (unless you carry it with hammer cocked) and single action thereafter.
Of course trigger pull is a little long in double action but there is NO grittiness or slop in the trigger in either mode. It shoots sweet. Fixed sights have been dabbed very neatly with tiny dots of GLOW sight paint to give you clear sight alignment in any lighting. They are not night sites however.

You must be willing to come to my residence in North side of Ocala National Forest (Between Salt Springs and Ft.McCoy). Please no lowball offers, I feel the price is right in the current market. Perhaps I can throw in a 1/2 box of Win. Ranger or Gold Dots.

Taylor Fur Getter, .22 LR caliber single shot pistol designed to shoot an animal at close range once the trigger mechanism has been activated. It was patented by C.D. Lovelace in June of 1914 under patent #1,098,742 and marketed under the name Taylor Fur Getter, F.C. Taylor Fur Co., St. Louis, MO. It was manufactured by O.F. Mossberg for Taylor. This gun is engraved with ""TAYLOR FUR GETTER F.C. TAYLOR FUR CO. ST. LOUIS. MO"" on the left side of the frame, and “PAT’D JUNE 2 1914 OTHER PAT'S PENDING"" on the right side of the frame. Serial #2991 engraved on the frame and serial #3098 engraved on the barrel. Total length is 15-1/4” from end of bait hook to end of the cocking / retracting rod. The gun is 11-1/2” long including its 6” barrel. Gun height is 5-1/4” from top of frame to end of mounting screw. This gun has a brass barrel and brass frame. The bait hook, cocking / retracting rod and firing pin are steel as is the lower portion of the wood screw used for mounting. The Fur Getter was a purpose-designed “trap” gun, meant to shoot an animal in the face at point blank range. This was accomplished by mounting the gun to a tree or fence post with its 2-1/4"" screw then connecting the firing mechanism to the bait hook, which extends 4"" in front of the muzzle. The idea is that bait (usually raw meat) was placed on the hook and an animal grabs the bait and yanks on it, which pulls the trigger, which releases the firing pin mechanism. The gun fires at such close range that striking the animal and killing it is almost certain. This gun is in good condition with an attractive patina forming on the brass components. It has a few small areas of pitting on the steel parts. To my knowledge this gun is mechanically sound."

Sabre Defense is no longer in business due to some ATF troubles, something to do with some employees walking away with some of the machinegun parts they made for the military.  Sabre Defense was known to have made higher end ARs, you can google sabre defense for some reviews.

Not really interested in trades at this time, but it never does hurt to ask, it would likely need to be something of lesser value with some cash added, as I need to get about $600-$700 worth of my wife off my ass for some other recent purchases I'm in the dog house for, LOL!

I have been borrowing a friends O/U shotgun and would like to get one for myself, but my budget is small.  I know I can get a low end O/U shotgun from Dicks for about $419 and they had one on sale at Gander Mt. for $379 recently, but I want to see what else is out there. For closer to $600 you can get one with the selectable trigger and ejectors, which I would like to have.  Used guns from the local shops pretty much cost the same as those new guns. I see no reason to pay more for a used gun that is equal in quality and features to those new guns (though I see used guns advertised on here all the time for more then you can get them for new).  Anyway, if you have something you would like to sell please send details.  I am willing to spend more for extra features and/or an older more unique gun.  Thanks."

866,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1254866,For Sale:  Bad s 300 WIN MAG-Picatinny forend rail,"California, California, United States","$ 3,950","Listed On: Wednesday, March 13, 2013",Rifles,Knights Armament                                                                                ,300 Winchester Magnum                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Noreen has created the ONLY SEMI-AUTOMATIC .300 WIN MAG and .338 Lapua on the market. The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.

The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot.

This piston-driven system is unlike any other AR-10 on the market. The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action.

The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action.

The weapon easily disassembles like the standard AR for quick and easy cleaning and reassembly. The piston system drastically reduces fouling, and no venting means no holes for dirt and other contaminants to enter the system.

The full-length Picatinny rail on the receiver will allow you to mount scopes, lights, lasers, bipods, bayonets, etc. The adjustable cheek rest stock option is an added upgrade free bonus.

The innovative Noreen Bad News 300 WIN MAG provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. The Noreen 300 WIN MAG weighs only 13 pounds, and it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. This rifle comes with a custom muzzle-break and semi-auto action that significantly suppresses recoil. In the AR tradition, the Bad News 338 Lapua disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reasembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle seamless. This Noreen includes an ultra-heavy duty Plano case, which is far superior to a pelican style case. 100% Made in the USA.

This rifle is modeled after the AR platform however the take down pins are farther apart than the AR-10 and AR-15 rifles causing the rifle to not accept an interchangeable upper like the AR-15 and AR-10 platform. This rifle does use some AR parts like the pistol grip, stock and trigger allowing for them to be changed.

The magazine on this rifle comes in a 5 or 10 round proprietary magazine.

The innovative Noreen Bad News .338 Lapua ULR provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform.

Weighing just 13 pounds, the Bad News .338 Lapua ULR is light enough and portable enough to serve as a patrol rifle, yet it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. The rifle’s custom muzzle brake and semi-automatic action significantly suppress recoil. With no bolt to manually work, the smooth action semi-automatic action allows the shooter to keep his head in the scope and his eye on the target for rapid, accurate follow-up shots.

In the AR tradition, the Bad News .338 Lapua ULR disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reassembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle virtually seamless. The Noreen Bad News .338 Lapua Ultra Long Range Rifle includes a limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship for 1 year."

Up for sale is my Smith & Wesson 640 Centennial 38spl in stainless steel.

I purchased this back in the early nineties. To the best of my knowledge, we never put more than a couple of hundred rounds through the gun, if even that many. I have the original box and wood grips, no manual. I also have a nice gun rug, two speed loaders and a set of nice Pachmayr rubber combat grips (see the pictures). 

The Pachmayr grips have been on the gun all these years because it made the gun so much more comfortable to shoot but as you can see from the pictures, the wood grips have been reinstalled and really add to the beauty of this pistol.

The retired WSPD armorer performed an action job on this revolver several years ago and so it has a really nice, smooth DA/SA trigger. 

This small J frame is extremely hard to find and especially in this condition. I am asking $500.00 or best offer for everything you see in the pictures. Will consider trades for quality firearms. I am not looking for another wheel gun as I have a 357 that I will keep to satisfy my wheel gun requirements.

Email me for more info or to make an offer. If this ad is still up, the gun is still available. All federal and state firearm laws regarding the transfer of this firearm will be followed. (CHP or pistol permit, positive ID and signing a Bill of Sale will be required, trades included) I prefer a face to face transaction in NC but will consider other sales with minimal hassle factor."
