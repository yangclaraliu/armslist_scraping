Glock 30 SF | G30 SF
The GLOCK 30SF in the legendary .45 Auto offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30SF .45 caliber is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control, especially for shooters with smaller hands.

The sight-made by Eotech and is the same as the Model 511 by that company is an open holographic reticle pattern designed to be instantly visible in any lighting conditions. Instinctive to center regardless of the shooting angle, it stays in view when sweeping an engagement zone or when engaging moving targets. The standard 65 minute of angle ring has four alignment ticks and a 1 M.O.A. aiming dot. The HWS delivers an impressive ten million to one (10,000,000:1) bright to low reticle contrast ratio, ensuring that the reticle is always visible. The reticle can be easily seen against targets in full sunlight - even in desert or tundra environments, and in moonlight. This N cell version takes less rail space than the longer AA versions and is slightly lighter in weight."

I may also have not been using the sight picture right, I'm not a big shooter.  I took it in trade a few years ago and just shot it for the first time last week to make sure it cycled fine before I put it up for sale.    

It cycles perfectly.  I put 10 shells of 000 buck through it rapid fire.

Like all Spikes products they are in high demand. The first $100 cash gets it and price is firm. If interested please include a phone number to contact you on, thanks.

The Spike’s Tactical Dynacomp Extreme is a 5.56 muzzle device designed to reduce recoil impulse and muzzle climb to provide faster follow up shots. The Dynacomp's accomplish this by balancing the direction of the blast along the vertical (upward) and perpendicular planes of the muzzle to lower muzzle rise, while the end of the device restricts forward energy to reduce parallel recoil. 
The ports on the Dynacomp are ball dimpled for smooth expansion of gases and rapid heat dissipation. The front of the device is 0.25"" thick to better handle the abuse of full auto fire. The entire device is Melonite treated to enhance these characteristics and provide a slick black finish. 
NOTE: The Dynacomp Extreme model will bring a 14.5"" barrel to legal (non-NFA) length

I am not really into guns yet I know how valuable ammo is in this time. I own a few but I own more ammo than I need, and what I NEED is listed below for trade. I am new to the Phoenix area and I am looking for a Super Moto or Enduro Cross Sport Dirtbike or Motorcycle. I can trade ammo such as 22lr, 22, 306, 223, 9mm, 45 auto, 38 special, and TONS of others too. I just know these are the most popular right now.

Items I am looking for trade and in certain cases trade + $$$$:

-Motorcycle - Enduro / Supermoto needs to be somewhat street legal and need to have title

-Automotive repair work - I have a 98 Dodge Durango with a HVAC problem (heater and AC do not work)

-Subaru WRX or STI parts (interior, exterior, suspension, drive train, etc)

-A working Car with working AC

-Welding work (trying to build custom headers & exhaust for my RS subaru outback, I have all the designs and ideas, just need a welder & mandrel bender)

-Alignment work on my subaru (just converted rear drums to discs and it threw off the alignment)

There are others too but you can offer me $$ as well.

I have most ammo as Winchester & Remington UMC bulks in 500 round, 1400 round, and 2000 round in 22, 9mm, and 45 all others are either 50 ct. boxes or 100 ct. round boxes. I know back in UT where I just moved from what bullets go for and I know my ammo so dont lowball me because I can save you time, money and stress trying to fight the crowds and lines in sporting good stores!

You will have to email me I do not trust spammers or scammers so email me your number with ammo interested in and what to trade for.

It has a few problems and is being sold for parts or repair:
1. The screw hole for the thumb screw on the site has been stripped out and there is no screw present.
2. There is something wrong with the trigger and it will not engage.  Simply put it is jammed and will not pull back.
3. The safety will not engage (I am guessing this has to do with the trigger problem)
4. The ejector clip is missing.

Over all the stock is in pretty good condition but not perfect (please see picture).

The AMT Backup was first known as the OMC Backup. This early variant was produced in .380 ACP caliber in El Monte, California. OMC produced a short run of these pistols before the molds were purchased by Arcadia Machine & Tool, who took over production.
The original AMT Backup was produced with a single-action trigger mechanism, while the later Backup II used a double-action-only mechanism. These pistols were manufactured by AMT and later Galena Industries (until November 2001).

The AMT Backup is a small semiautomatic pistol in a .380 ACP caliber. This pistol was designed to be carried as a backup gun by law enforcement and security professionals or anyone desiring a small concealable weapon. Its marketing slogan was ""the smallest, most powerful"" backup weapon available."

That is pretty impressive for a lower that only weighs 1 pound, 14 ounces (with all lower parts installed).

CAV-15 MKII Receiver Features:

Receiver weight (complete) is 1 full pound lighter than a complete aluminum receiver with an A2 stock.

A1 Length Integral Stock (5/8"" shorter than A2) with sling loop. 13"" Length of Pull.

Carbine Buffer System

Wider magazine well accepts unmodified, submachine gun magazines in pistol calibers. With caliber conversion upper receivers and magazine blocks, standard AR15 magazines can be used without modifications.

Uses all standard mil-spec parts with the exception of the take down pins. The front pivot and rear pins are a Quick Take Down style with Detents built into them. This allows for quick and easy removal of the pins while maintaining a positive lock.

Longer life, Nylon6 resists impacts and wear better than aluminum.

For sale- is the complete Ar15 dream package. Once you hold it you'll know what I mean.

New, 2013 configuration Colt LE6920-MP-B, MagPul all over this gun. Literally everywhere your hand touches. Ergonomic, and feels like heaven.

This has all the magpul accessories. Grip, stock, fore stock, flip up rear sight, front hand grip. 

Included are 3, 30 round magpul magazines - PMAG 30 AR/M4- gen M2

Also included is a new digital camo tactical case, and 480 rounds of American Eagle AR223 55 grain FMJ.  There are 24 boxes of 20 rounds each of ammo. Ammo comes with clear storage box to keep it dry and safe. You will be ready for the range or just sleep better at night knowing you're SHTF ready.

Asking $2300. If you're wondering how good a deal this is? Call OD green supply - the only gun store I could find that had one in stock- they are asking $2400 just for the gun with none of the extras and certainly not including 480 rounds of ammo with it. Or look at the downgraded version that is listed on arms list here in Denver. The 6900 is NOT even close to the this one.

Do your research, look at what others are asking. It will make you understand what a cool package this is, and why this is a fair price.

The SKS is a semi-automatic rifle chambered for the 7.62x39mm round, designed in 1943 by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov. Its complete designation, SKS, is an initialism for Samozaryadnyj Karabin Simonova. The SKS was widely exported, and was produced by China. The SKS is currently popular on the civilian surplus market in many countries, including the United States and Canada. It was one of the first weapons chambered for the 7.62x39mm M43 round, which was also used later in the AK-47."

P30A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.Key Features:Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral platesMIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail on frame for mounting lights and accessoriesCorrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer framePolygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel lifeMultiple trigger firing modes availablePatented HK recoil reduction systemOne piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steelCorrosion resistant “hostile environment” blued finishAmbidextrous slide levers andAmbidextrous magazine release magazine Patented lock-out safety device."

The Remington 870 was the fourth major design in a series of Remington pump shotguns. John Pedersen designed the fragile Remington Model 10. John Browning designed the Remington Model 17, which served as the basis for the Remington. The Model 31 was well liked, but struggled for sales in the shadow of the Winchester Model 12. Remington sought to correct that in 1949 by introducing a modern, streamlined, rugged, reliable, shotgun – the 870.

Sales of the 870 have been steady. They reached 2 million guns by 1973 (ten times the number of Model 31 shotguns it replaced). By 1996, spurred by sales of the basic ""Express"" models, sales topped seven million guns. On April 13, 2009 the ten millionth Model 870 was produced, and the 870 holds the record for best-selling shotgun in history."

I made collages cause of the three pic limit. Sorry for the hassle.
The pic of the Federal ammo box is a file photo. I threw away the cardboard ammo boxes. The GunVault pic is a file photo as well, those items in the GunVault aren't included.. All the items included are like brand new. Never used. All bought since 2/23/13. I'm asking 800.00, Firm. There are no Glocks in the stores still. And on here they want this much for just the weapon, used, w a couple magazines and that's it. I don't want any trades of any sorts. Thanks for looking. You won't be disappointed. 800 is about 60 bux more than the stuff listed above. But I also drove many many miles to assemble it all together in one location for a good amount of gas and will still be losing money as compared to had I not bought any of it at all. To be clear, I don't NEED to sell it. I will keep it for any less than a fair offer."

Caliber: 9mm x 19
4"" Barrel
DA/SA
Stamped on right side:""P6 - NW - 3/79 -
Stamped on left side: ""Sig Sauer made in W Germany"" 
The only difference between the P6 and P225—the P225 (which was adopted by US civilian law enforcement) has a lighter trigger pull, whereas the P6's trigger pull is heavier. The P225 has tritium fixed sights; P6s had fixed sights only. Genuine P225s manufactured for the West German Police will have a ""P6"" stamp on the right side of the slide. German police pistols can be identified by the hammer, which has small ""ear"" or ""hook"". According to section 7.7 of the German manual, the cutout is the Deformationssporn, which means “deformation spur”. This was a requirement of the West German Police for all their pistols, regardless of manufacturer, to alert police armorers if the pistol was dropped on its hammer.

This is a German police surplus gun issued NEW in Germany.

The SIG P6 is a more compact version of the SIG P220. The Swiss Army wanted semi-automatic handgun, that would provide excellent functionality with a double-action trigger. The 9mm SIG-Sauer P6, debuted with various new and inventive features. It utilized a single column magazine holding eight 9 mm rounds and has a 3.9 in. barrel.

A new German police standard, in the mid-1970s, prompted SIG-Sauer to develop a new pistol that met the standard: The SIG-Sauer P225 (known as the P6) and the Heckler & Koch P7. The SIG-Sauer P225 was the least expensive (due mainly to the inventive design) and received the majority of the orders. To be able to manufacture that many handguns, SIG acquired a controlling interest in J. P. Sauer & Sohn in Eckenförde, Germany to manufacture parts. This is also where all P225s were manufactured. The only difference between the P6 and P225 — the P225 (which was adopted by US civilian law enforcement) has a lighter trigger pull, whereas the P6's trigger pull is heavier. The P225 has tritium fixed sights; P6's have fixed sights only. Because of its compact size, the P225/P6 is quite readily usable for concealed carry. In U.S. states where high-capacity magazines were prohibited, the P6/P225 is in high demand."

Thompson/Center Arms Company is an American firearms company based in Rochester, New Hampshire. The company is best known for its line of interchangeable barrel single-shot pistols and rifles. Thompson Center also manufactures muzzleloading rifles and is credited with creating the resurgence of their use in the 1970s.

In the 1960s, Warren Center developed an unusual break-action, single-shot pistol that later became known as the Contender in his basement workshop. Meanwhile, the K.W. Thompson Tool Company had been searching for a product to manufacture year-round. In 1965, Warren Center joined the K.W. Thompson Tool Company, and together, they announced Warren Center's Contender pistol in 1967. Although it sold for more than comparable hunting revolvers, the flexibility of being able to shoot multiple calibers by simply changing out the barrel and sights and its higher accuracy soon made it popular with handgun hunters. As K.W. Thompson Tool began marketing Center's Contender pistol, the company name was changed to Thompson/Center Arms Company. Then, in 1970, Thompson/Center created the modern black powder industry, introducing Warren Center's Hawken-styled black powder muzzle-loader rifle"

This gun is probably worth a lot more than what I am asking, and I do like to trade so that could be a bonus to you as well.    Now is the time to aquire a desirable pistol that you don't see everyday in exchange for something you don't use anymore.     Let me know what you have so we can negotiate a fair and honest deals.  Thanks for the inquiries"

What a load of crap.  He and his friends create the adverse environment and then it is up to Magpul.  I guess in a sick way under Mr. Kerr's logic, it was the Jews decision to leave the persecution they were experiencing in the the 30s and 40s in Germany - no fault of the government.

""I've met with them (Magpul) and I've talked with them and I understand the decisions that they are saying they might have to make. At the end of the day it's their decision what to do with their company,"" Kerr said

Please call and e-mail Mr. Kerr at the contact information below.  If you are members of other boards please copy and post it there and ask the same.  Mr. Kerr needs to know that many of us strongly believe it isn't up to Magpul, it is up to the elected officials to respect our rights and the second amendment.

985,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1224985,For Sale/Trade:  REMINGTON 721 RIFLE .30-06 mfg 1948-1962,"westminster, Colorado, United States",$ 550,"Listed On: Saturday, March 16, 2013",Handguns,Remington,no type,no type,no type,"he ""F.E.P."" is actually ""R.E.P."" for Remington English Proof. Remington adopted that term simply to add a little cache to their product; their proof practices use SAAMI specs the same as everyone else. 

The history of those rifles is interesting. From 1921 up to WWII, Remington made sporting rifles (the Model 30 and variations) using Model 1917 receivers and parts left over from WWI production. They made only such parts as they had to. At the end of WWII, they decided that the M1917 ploy had about run its course. Even though they used some tricks to disguise the origin of the rifles, customers were aware that they were buying what was essentially a warmed over military rifle.

So they turned their engineers and designers, including the famous Mike Walker, loose with blank sheets of paper. The result was not one, but two rifles, the standard length 721 and the short action 722. The 722 was released with a brand new cartridge, the famous ""triple deuce"", the .222 Remington, from which came a whole slew of cartridges, including the military 5.56mm, aka the .223 Remington.

The 721/722 rifles were made to be affordable, a contrast to the Winchester 70, famed as the ""Rifleman's Rifle"" but quite expensive. The result of the desire to keep the price down was that the rifles were plain. While special treatment, even engraving and inlay, was available, the standard rifles had no checkering, trigger guards were stamped steel, and so on.

But they shot and shot well. A lot of owners wanted to upgrade, and for a while gun shops had bins full of take off stocks, replaced by better grade custom stocks. Eventually, Remington got the word and, using the same basic action, produced the Model 700, now I believe the best selling CF sporting rifle in the world.

There is a sad sidelight to the Remington success story. Winchester (Olin) was unable to admit that it was losing sales to Remington and began to focus on military surplus rifles as the source of their economic woes. So they persuaded Senator Tom Dodd, of CT, father of the current CT senator Chris Dodd, to include a ban on military surplus imports in his Gun Control Act of 1968, not hard to do after JFK was killed with a surplus rifle. In a nasty example of special interest lobbying, Winchester's attorneys even wrote that part of the law. There were hints that Dodd received more than thanks and campaign support, but nothing was ever proven.
