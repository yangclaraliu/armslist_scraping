Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at info@freerepublicfirearms.com or by phone at 3309040222 with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

Trades:
We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $25 for handguns and $35 for long guns, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to most of the lower 48 states.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

About us:
Free Republic Firearms is a family owned FFL dealer located in Massillon Ohio. We are dedicated to supplying quality firearms, ammunition, and accessories to responsible gun owners for the purposes of self-defense, recreation, hunting, shooting sports, and collections.

We seek to make products affordable for our customers by stocking products that our customers need, rather than incur the costs of huge inventories, and large payrolls. Unlike large retailers, we keep our costs low by using our suppliers’ inventories to supplement our inventory. We bring additional products into our inventory as our customers need them, and pass on the savings of our low overhead costs to you.

We believe in providing firearms to responsible people who understand the importance of the 2nd Amendment, and the responsibility we have to protect it.  We are not interested in supplying firearms to those in society who do not have the morals, maturity, and character to be responsible gun owners.  It is our right to refuse to sell firearms to any person. We are interested in arming responsible citizens so that they can defend themselves against the criminal element, not arming the criminal element of society.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. 6.5% Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed.

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. 

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. We are located in Massillon, Ohio. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Occasionally we have problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. Our reply emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, magazines, and accessories, because people do not always follow through with the purchase. Items are sold on a first come; first serve basis.

Trades:
We will consider trades from local, in-person buyers, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Most of our firearms are new, and we are very selective about what used firearms we sell.   Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.  Let us know what you have to trade, and we will let you know if it is something we need.  If you are an out of state buyer, we will not consider a trade. 

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. 

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
 If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This firearm has a lifetime warranty through our distributor, and we will provide the warranty paperwork with your gun.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

Trades:
We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. 

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
 If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This firearm has a lifetime warranty through our distributor, and we will provide the warranty paperwork with your gun.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

Trades:
We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. 

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
 If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This firearm has a lifetime warranty through our distributor, and we will provide the warranty paperwork with your gun.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

Trades:
We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

She comes with everything you would get if you could purchase her new. Manual, factory scope rings, lock etc. She also comes with 1 extra factory 5 rnd mag, 1) Triple-K 10 rnd mag, 2) 30 rnd Promag mags and 100 rnds of TULA 7.62x39. Ruger does not make factory 10 & 30 rnd mags for the Mini 30. All the mags are new. The 30 rnd have a few minor scratches from test fitting and hand cycling to make sure they feed.

$1750 cash is the package price. I will entertain serious offers (lowballs ignored) and would consider selling without the mags & ammo, but I'm in no hurry to sell. In fact I will probably regret selling someday.

*** For an aditional $150 I have a new in box Factory Ruger by ATI, 6 position collapsable, folding stock with rails. Fits mini 30,mini14. Has the Ruger Logo on it instead of ATI.

OVERVIEW: When our triangular barrel contour made its debut in varmint/target weight on the Model 700™ VTR, it was deemed one of the most innovative barrel designs conceived. We’re proud to unveil its big-game evolution, the Model 700 XHR (Xtreme Hunting Rifle), firmly seated atop the food chain with the renowned accuracy and supreme strength of our Model 700 action as its foundation. Pick it up, and the first thing you’ll notice is the impeccable balance. With a magnum contour barrel crafted in our patent-pending triangular formation, the rifle seems to point itself. This barrel design allows us to shave weight while maintaining the rigidity of a traditional round barrel. And the weight that remains is in all the right places. Plus, its surface area facilitates rapid cooling for more accurate followup shots. Not that you’ll need them. Like all new Model 700s, the XHR features our new externally adjustable X-Mark Pro® trigger system that comes set from the factory with 3 1/2 lbs. pull, and can be easily fine-tuned to your preference – by you.Its cutting-edge performance and looks don’t stop at the barrel. The Realtree® AP™ HD™ camo synthetic stock is equipped with patented Hogue overmolding accents at the grip and fore-end areas for comfort and a firm hold in adverse conditions. Then we added the world’s most effective recoil pad – SuperCell – that reduces rifle kick to a gentle push. The barrel and action are finished in durable satin black oxide. A hinged floorplate magazine and jeweled bolt round out the impressive list of features. Gain the ultimate lethal advantage with the new Model 700 XHR. KEY FEATURES: • Patent-pending 24"" triangular barrel in magnum contour • X-Mark Pro Adjustable Trigger system • Rugged synthetic stock in Realtree® AP™ HD™ camo • Hogue® overmolded accents on grip and fore-end • Extremely durable satin black oxide metal finish • Polished blue jeweled bolt • Hinged floorplate • Patented SuperCell™ recoil pad 

Scope: Feature for feature, stunning Euro Diamond™ Rifle Scopes deliver optical performance virtually identical to higher priced, ultra-premium scopes. Engineered with a proprietary light management system, precision-ground optical glass, Euro Diamonds provide a level of sharpness well beyond what the human eye can process. When matched head-to-head under real-world conditions - lousy light, bad weather - Euro Diamond scopes flat outperform high-end scopes costing hundreds of dollars more. Euro Diamonds get a boost in optical performance from proprietary, ultra-sharp, ultra-bright and glare-free HiLume multi-coating. It’s got all the proofs - waterproof, fogproof and shockproof. Factor in internal focusing, ergonomic adjustments, up to 4” of eye relief, a 4:1 magnification range, an expansive field-of-view, and it’s clear Euro Diamonds have everything it takes to elevate your shooting to the next level. SPECIFICATIONS: • Power/ Obj Lens: 3-10x40 • Reticle: Plex • Finish: Matte • Field of View (ft@100 ft.): 38- 11 • Exit Pupil (mm): 13 - 4 • Click Value (in @ 100yds): 0.25 • Max Adj.

This is a SIG quality AR15 platform for functionality and accuracy right from the factory. Every write up I have ever read has praised the SIG M400 AR-15. After all it is a “SIG.”

As seen in pic it is shown with a SIG scope and mount, with manually illuminated graduations both in red and green from 100 to 500 yards, and a 6 position collapsing stock and sling. Also comes with Tactical Light with mount and a Small Tactical Laser, as well as front folding handle grip.

Gun has less than 70 rounds through it, and was 100% reliable and extremely accurate.

If you are looking for a good quality AR15 that won't break the bank then this is it. Stay away from the AR's that are pieced together by everyone that suddenly thinks that they are a master AR builder. Also the entry level AR's all seem to have feeding problems.

I have more than 4K rounds of 7.62x39 ammo for my AK's and have decided to stay with the AK platform for the Zombie Apocalypse. 

So I'm selling or trading off my last AR-15.

When responding with offers please include your name and contact number and pics of what you have to offer, otherwise you will not get a response.

Only pistol trades will be considered no older guns or relics. I Like 9mm, & .45 ACP's."

LNIB Ruger SP101.  Straight from the factory, exactly 200 rounds downrange, and put away in the safe.  I don't carry it and it's a shame.  It's a beautiful gun.  The specifics:

 - Stainless steel finish
 - 5 round cylinder
 - Chambered in .357 Magnum / .38 Special
 - 2 1/4"" barrel with full underlug
 - Spurred hammer
 - Single action is around 2 lbs.
 - Double action has stacking trigger and is smoooooth
 - Pistol will come with OEM factory rubber grips

I'm asking $475 for the pistol.  Again, this is just for the pistol along with the factory box with everything they threw in.  It DOES NOT come with the Badger grips pictured.  I will make the following package available to the buyer of the pistol for an additional $100:

 - Badger rosewood boot grips
 - Black cowhide Galco OWB holster
 - Two HKS 36-A speedloaders
 - Black cowhide Tagua speedloader pouch
 - 20 rounds of Federal Hydra-Shok +P .38 Special 129 grain JHP

The additional stuff is the complete concealed-carry package that will be available for convenient, one-stop shopping.  I'm not going to tack it onto the price of the pistol and force it down your throat for an unreasonable price, however.  If you want to go a different route, that's your option.

 - I will not break this package up.
 - I will not entertain any offers.

 - The only trades I'm currently interested in are the following:

     - Springfield XDS (.45 ACP w/ 5-round single-stack magazine and 3.3"" bbl.)
     - S&W 686+ (.357 Magnum w/7-shot cylinder and 4"" bbl.)

I know the odds are pretty slim on actually finding either of these exact pistols, but they're what I want to upgrade to and are the reason I'm selling the Ruger.  If, by some miracle, you have one and want the Ruger, we can talk about a trade.  No rules on that as we'll have to see what the other person wants for the pistol and accessories and then we can hammer out a deal.  I'm flexible on this, so don't be shy.  I have cash, ammo, and/or some assorted magazines to throw in if need be.

I'm near old downtown Everett and am willing to drive an hour or so either way to meet up with you.  I'll require transfer paperwork to be filled out along with a peek at your CWP and WADL.  My name is Ryan."

out to dealers and retailers with an established customer base in the ""spy gear"", privacy, security, travel and related niches.

It occurred to me that these would probably sell well as an impulse buy novelty item on a gun shop checkout counter.

Since our primary focus is marketplace e-commerce, this is a one-time bulk
discount offer.

Covert Coin Half Dollars - Up to 300 units at $12.63/unit 
Covert Coin Nickels - Up to 300 units at $14.75/unit
Covert Coin Quarters - Up to 200 units at $10.92/unit

These coins, based on the Cold War era hollow coins, are precision machined
from authentic US Mint circulation nickels, quarters, and half dollars. Each
unit includes an opening ring. The nickels and half dollars effectively conceal a micro SD card. Some of the quarters do as well, but we can't guarantee those. Retail prices are generally $22-30.

Background info:
During the Cold War, Spies from both the East and West used Hollow Coins to
ferry secret messages, suicide poisons, and microfilms undetected. On May
1st, 1960 U2 Pilot Gary Francis Powers was shot down over the Soviet Union
and taken captive. In his possession was a hollow silver dollar containing a
poisoned needle that was to be used to take his own life in such a
circumstance. For one reason or another, he did not use it and was held for
21 months by the Soviets. He was then exchanged for Soviet spy KGB Colonel
Vilyam Fisher (aka Rudolf Abel) at the Glienicke Bridge, in Berlin, Germany.
Colonel Fisher was also no stranger to hollow coins...his original capture
by the United States FBI was directly related to a hollow nickel that was
used to transport microfilm.
