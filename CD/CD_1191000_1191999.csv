The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. And, it's water resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.

If your not familiar with the CZ Wikipedia it the 7.62x.25 ammo is an amazing round I have indoor gun ranges always cut one round open to make sure they are lead core rounds because they are so fast they don't let the harder cored ammo be shot indoors."

139,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1191139,For Sale:  Comment on all those angry editorials being posted!,"Florida, Florida, United States","$ 64,000","Listed On: Monday, March 4, 2013",Rifles,Ruger,no type,no type,no type,"Good afternoon everyone. I have never responded to anything I've read anywhere in my life, however all of the angry editorials that have been posting to this fine site recently have finally pushed me over the edge.

Many years ago in the 80's & 90's I decided to buy the American Eagle silver coins. Back then there were times when you could buy them for $4 or $5. They fluctuated with the price of silver and I always felt like investing in something tangible would be a good idea. So over 15 or 20 years - I bought a good size pile of them. Mind you I was no where near wealthy, and I'm still not, but I found a way to invest a little when I could over a long period of time. Today those same coins that cost me maybe $5000 or $6000 are worth at least $50,000 and maybe more. So if I decided to get them out of my safety deposit box tomorrow and sell them at the market rate - would I be an idiot or gouger for doing so??? Should I sell them for what I originally paid for them or risk being labeled a profiteer??

Take it one step further and suppose that some disaster (natural or otherwise) were to effect silver production and the price of silver doubled in a month (and it would) - would I be a stupid or less than upright for selling while the market was at it's peak???? So how is selling your gun any different? The way I see it is that if a man or woman who bought a Colt AR for $500 back when you could do that decided to sell it today for $2000 (because that's what it is worth now). Then I think it's a fine move and it's his right as a law abiding citizen to do so! You have to remember that by selling it he gives up his rights of ownership. Therefore if he should ever decide to buy another - he knows up front that he'll have to pay the going rate!

Heck I bought a plain jane 10-22 a few weeks ago for $375 and you know what - I was darn happy to get it! Mind you I saw them at Walmart back before Thanksgiving for $209, But I procrastinated and didn't buy it and that was STUPID on my part. I want to teach my grandson to shoot. So once again - I was delighted that someone would sell their Ruger to me even at nearly double what I would have paid a few months earlier.

I like the the vast majority of good American gun owners would much prefer that the panic being caused now by a horrible tragedy and our political appointees would have never happened in the first place! That being said however - I still thank God everyday for the hard fought freedom we all enjoy here in the good old USA! Is there anyone out there who would rather live in a place where communism or dictators reign? Where the government tells it's people who they can sell their belongings to and for how much! So think about this before posting anymore angry ads!!

Those who have rifles, pistols, ammo, etc.., and want to sell them for what they are worth - then please do so and without feeling bad about it!

Thanks for listening and God Bless the USA!!!!

421,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1191421,For Sale/Trade:  New information on weapons ban and what weapons they are going to ban,"California, California, United States","$ 1,000,000","Listed On: Friday, March 15, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"California Senator Dianne Feinstein wants 150 types of weapons banned. The Democratic Senator held a press conference to announce her lengthy gun ban bill. Some of the weapons on the list include pistols, shotguns, and rifles.

Feinstein posed with 10 weapons at her side during the Capitol Hill media event, the Daily Caller notes. New York Senator Chuck Schumer and Illinois Senator Dick Durbin stood with Feinstein during her weapons ban speech. The Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 would terminate the sale, transfer, importation, and manufacture of specific weapons.

The Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 would also ban ammunition clips which hold more than 10 rounds. While some gun control supporters feel a high-capacity magazine ban could help prevent more mass shootings, gun rights proponents largely do not agree. The average gun owner can reportedly fire and change three 10 round clips in approximately 30 seconds.

Senator Dianne Feinstein had this to say about the Assault Weapons Ban of 2013:

“Getting this bill signed into law will be an uphill battle, and I recognize that. But it’s a battle worth having.”

The proposed gun ban is more “far reaching” than the ban that expired in 2004, according to the Washington Post. Pistols and rifles that can be used with detachable or fixed ammo magazines that hold more than 10 rounds are included in Senator Feinstein’s proposed ban. Guns with “military style features” such as pistol grips, are also on the Democrat’s list.

The Assault Weapons Ban of 2013 excludes 2,250 guns used for sport of hunting purposes. Assault weapons owned legally before the potential enactment of the bill as also exempt from the ban. Unlike the previous gun ban, the 2013 ban would be permanent in nature.

This is an absolute Cold War time piece and is amazing condition.

Barrel is just about perfect with no flaws what-so-ever.

One 6 round mag and one in the chamber makes this a 7 round conceal carry.

This does not shoot regular 9mm, it shoots 9x18 which is a larger diameter cartridge over the standard 9mm. 

For all those who seem to know more please read the following:

9x18 actually is slightly larger in diameter than 9x19. .363” vs .355”. 9x18 is generally a bit less powerful than 9x19, both in bullet weight and velocity. It’s considered the intermediate between .380 ACP (9x17) and 9x19 Parabellum. Much like 7.62x39/5.45x39 and 5.56x45, 9x18 and 9x19 were the standard cartridges between ComBloc forces and NATO forces.

It is new in the box. It has never been fired other than the factory test round. I am not trying to sell this glock for $800 or $900 like some crazy people on here. This is the best deal you'll find on a new Glock. Production date is Feb 2013. Reason for selling is I found a shot gun I'd rather have. The guy at the gun shop said Glock was 1,000,000 guns behind. I don't know if thats true or not but they are indeed hard to find.

I'm willing to trade one or both for a semi-auto pistol in either 9mm or .45.  NO HI POINTS or .40 cals!  I prefer something with three or more mags, but open to stock trades.  Obviously looking for cash on top of the pistol as well.  Let me know what deal you're offering when you contact me, for pictures or more specifics, so I can tell you up front if I'm interested before we go any further.  I'm really interested in a Ruger 1911, but open to anything."

The scope alone is $1700 new from Leupold directly. See Leupold sight for more info at: http://www.leupold.com/tactical/scopes/mark-4-lrt-riflescopes/mark-4-lrt-3-5-10x40mm-lrt-m3-illum-ret/

These have not been imported since 1994 and are hard to find.  This will replace the fixed 10 round magazine on your Norinco SKS and give you 20 rounds instead of 10.  Since there are some manufacturing tolerance variables among the Norinco SKS's, some may require slight tweaking to fit to your gun.  This does not usually require a gunsmith.

I have no preference other than 9mm auto
it can be wood grips or synthetic
full frame, micro, mid size Just need it to be able to be handy in the boat for snakes an such like we get here in South Florida

Up for trade or sale is my LNIB Bera Thunder 380 pistol. I bought the pistol new about 3 months ago and have fired approximately 250 rounds (flawlessly). The pistol is in LNIB with no blemishes or problems of any kind. The only reason I want to sell or trade is because it sadly does not fit my hand as well as I want. Included with the pistol are some Bersa OD Green grips (just bought for $40 a week ago), the original grips, 2 factory mags, 86 rounds fmj practice ammo, 2 boxes of corbon 90 gr jhp which works great in this gun, a galco tuck'n go holster (LNIB), and a brand new still in packaging Remora IWB holster (not pictured).

I would prefer a trade for another good small semi auto pistol that I could carry preferably a 9mm although I will also consider 380s, 38 special snubies, and maybe a small .357mag revolver. Please dont offer me any kel tecs, ruger LCPs, or taurus pistols, or similar stuff as I am simply not interested.

I am especially interested in a S&W Shield 9mm, sig p238, glock 26, and glock 19 (would add cash depending on deal).[/b]

I saw ATP gun shop selling these for $16.99 per box and people were buying 'em up.  That's $0.85 per round.  Buy it all and I'll go cheaper.

500 rounds (25 boxes) of 55 grain at $0.85 per round = $425
260 rounds (13 boxes) of 75 grain at $0.85 per round = $221

I will sell in those quantities (will not sell individual boxes) for that price, otherwise I will sell everything for $575 which is $0.7565 per round.  For everything it would be $71 cheaper and tax free compared to the store.  

-Cash only, no money order, check, etc. 
-No trades unless you have 1,150 rounds of .40 S&W FMJ new brass (identical brand).  That's $24.61 per box of .40 cal FMJ which is what it's going for right now after tax.  That's highly unlikely, but that's what I'll be using the $575 for.

 12 gauge Slugs 7/8 ounce(382grains) 2 cavity, diameter .624 inches (.62 cal!), length .545 inches Lee style. Made with 80% lead 20% alloys, then cold water forged. These slugs are hard (18-19 BHN), penetrate very well with very little kick . With only 7/8's ounce they shoot fast (1800+fps) they also have a flat trajectory for slugs. These are also fun to load to subsonic (1100 fps and lower) for quiet, low kick, close range shooting. The slugs work great in 2 3/4 inch shells. They use a standard flat cardboard wad and or plastic. These are perfect to fill cheap birdshot loads, even in the field. Can be loaded with a standard shotshell crimp. The slugs work well in smooth bore barrels (Impoved Cylinder) and can be fired in modified chokes as well (not recomened).These are exceptional to shoot and are a fraction of the cost of manufactured slugs and ammo.
