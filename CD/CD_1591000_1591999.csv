This gun is great. Probably the best target gun available for the price, but it's more than I need and now I'm looking for a smaller semi-auto 22lr. I don't keep track of how many rounds go through it, but estimate 600-800. Cleaned after each use. The wood handled model is more expensive. I paid $359 for the pistol and $109 for the sight in March.

Smithy Midas 1220 3-n-1 lathe, dril, mill combination. 110v with 20"" distance between centers. 1.17"" chuck/spindle bore. 

Has power feed and can be used to thread. I have used it to shorten and thread barrels as well as chamber barrel blanks. I have used it to make custom bolt knobs as well as custom flash hiders. I have also used it to make and modify reloading dies. Great machine that does not take up a lot of real estate on the floor. Great for making one off parts for cars, guns or anything really. Well maintained.

Milling head works great as well. I will include a small clamp so you can also use the mill. I used it as a lathe 90% of the time.

It will come with all the gearing to change the TPI when threading. Also comes with plenty of other tooling. I will include a live center and drill attachment for the tailstock. All th extras are worth well over $150. I will even include the heavy duty desk it is sitting on. 

It was being used up until about a week ago when the power switch went bad. The power switch is available from Smithy for $50 and is easily installed. I am upgrading to a larger lathe so I would rather not mess with it but the wiring is simple and easy to do. Overall in great shape except for the power switch. These are selling for well over $1,000 so I am knocking off $200 for the switch and to have it installed. If you want the switch installed the machine will be $950 afterwards. 

These rarely come up on the used market because they do work so well and do not take up a lot of space. It is literally a little over 3' long and 2' wide

               The Finnish M39 Mosin Nagant is the best quality and most accurate series of the Mosin Nagant line. Each and every M39 built was individually ""accurized"" by the Finnish Arsenals. It has been proven in many official Military surplus rifles only matches that The M39 can equally compete with the 1903 and Swiss K31 and has earned many 1st place awards even with old surplus ammo. It is not hard at all to achieve a 4"" group at 200 yards and even tighter groups with high quality ammunition such as Prvi Partizan and Sellior & bellot factory ammo which is priced at $15-$20 per 20 round box which is not bad for match grade quality ammunition. The M39 is the Finnish answer to a single design battle rifle that has match and bench accuracy.

Stock is beautiful and has the ""round finger"" splice joint. The bore is excellent with very strong lands and grooves. The rifle is ""D"" stamped which means it can safely fire the longer and heavier 182gr. Machine gun ammo.

               The Finnish M39 Mosin Nagant is the best quality and most accurate series of the Mosin Nagant line. Each and every M39 built was individually ""accurized"" by the Finnish Arsenals. It has been proven in many official Military surplus rifles only matches that The M39 can equally compete with the 1903 and Swiss K31 and has earned many 1st place awards even with old surplus ammo. It is not hard at all to achieve a 4"" group at 200 yards and even tighter groups with high quality ammunition such as Prvi Partizan and Sellior & bellot factory ammo which is priced at $15-$20 per 20 round box which is not bad for match grade quality ammunition. The M39 is the Finnish answer to a single design battle rifle that has match and bench accuracy.

The left side of the grip frame is marked “G”, “H”,”R”,”M”, and “N”.
  This pistol retains about 70% of its metal finish. There is surface loss at the following points: the front of the barrel and top of the front sight, the front edges of the frame and receiver and the left side plate. The barrel shows very small and light scattered spots of pinprick surface erosion, while the rest of the finish shows heavier erosion and/or pitting. The front strap and back strap also show thinning. The knurling of the takedown lever and toggle knobs, and the serrations of the safety show light wear. The grip screw slots are sharp, but the right screw shows erosion. The markings are clear. Overall, this pistol rates in about Very Good condition."

Introduced in 2009, the Colt LE6940 Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine is best thought of as a semi-automatic-only version of the M4 modified with Colt’s proprietary monolithic one-piece upper receiver and handguard. This upper receiver traces its origins back some six years to guns Colt produced for the SCAR (Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle) program of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). It is designed to obviate the need for a separate multiple-rail handguard for mounting accessories, affording perfect alignment of accessories mounted in-line with the primary optical device, providing extreme rigidity, and allowing the removal and reinstallation of optics without loss of zero. Additionally, the handguard section provides sufficient ventilation to prevent heat buildup around the barrel. And the monolithic upper weighs less than a standard upper receiver with separate quad-rail handguard attached. The upper, made from a CNC-machined 7075-T6 aluminum forging, features integral top and side Picatinny rails extending forward just to the rear of the gas block. Recesses for quick-detachable sling swivels are located on both side rails. The bottom rail is a separate piece that can be detached for cleaning or installation of under-barrel accessories. All rail sections have numbered slots for repeatable installation of devices. The LE6940 has extensive parts commonality with the M4, sharing the barrel’s chrome-lining, four-position collapsible stock, and birdcage-style flash hider. Also present are the familiar shell deflector, ejection port cover and forward assist. The LE6940’s bolt, carrier and trigger mechanism also follow the proven AR-15 pattern, as do the controls on the lower receiver: magazine release, reversible safety and bolt release. Like all current Colt-produced rifles, the LE6940 uses 0.154-inch-diameter hammer and trigger pins. The 1:7-inch twist of the barrel and 5.56x45 mm NATO chamber allow the use of 55-grain, 62-grain and 77-grain ammunition. The M4-style barrel measures 0.750 inches at the gas block, but decreases to 0.640 inches under the handguard, and incorporates the M4-style step. Barrel attachment is by way of an improved barrel nut that reportedly offers greater strength. Specifications: Action: Semi-Automatic Caliber: 223 Remington/5.56 NATO Bbl Length: 16.1"" Capacity: 30+1 Trigger: Direct Safety: Lever OAL: 35.25"" Weight: 6.6 lbs Stock: 4-Position Collapsible Finish: Black"

This rifle was purchased by me brand new in October of 2012. The rifle has about 200-250 rounds through it since that time (brass only).

During my time with this rifle I have not experienced a single FTF or FTE. I have always kept the rifle clean and also cleaned it right after firing. Notice that my price is not inflated, stop getting ripped off by people trying to sell you a C15 for more then $1000. This rifle MSRP's around 700-900.

Included in the 850 is of course the rifle, 4 30 round magazines and the sight. This is not the less the perfect bushnell trophy that is typically sold with the C15, it's a much better red dot. With it I can easily hold decent groupings at 100 yards. Costs around $180. Therefore with that and the magazines I think 850 is a fair price.

No trades, no checks, no money orders, cash only.

Savage Arms has a history of producing good-shooting, affordable combination guns. Unlike many of the European combo guns that cost more than a new pickup truck, the Savage Model 24 that was built in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s provided shooters, campers, hunters, and survivalists with handy firearms that would fire both rifle and shotgun ammunition, at prices that most folks could afford. However, several variations of these discontinued Model 24 combination guns are now fetching princely sums of money, as most folks who have these guns are not willing to part with them. If you do find one for sale, they are sometimes in pretty rough condition, as these were working guns; riding in pickup trucks and living in the woods much of the time.

Savage has now introduced a thoroughly modernized version of the Model 24, called the Model 42. Instead of blued steel and walnut, the Model 42 wears a matte black finish on the receiver and a satin black finish on the barrels, all fitted into a lightweight black polymer stock. The forend is slim and easy to grasp, with long finger-grooves on each side, and texturing along the bottom. It is very comfortable to hold. The buttstock has a generous pistol grip, also textured for a secure hold. The polymer is impervious to harsh weather and rough handling. The recoil pad is soft and effective, and the black stock is accented with red butt pad, pistol grip cap, and forend cap spacers. “Savage Arms” is proudly shown in red letters along each side of the forend. The action is a non-ferrous casting, with the barrels, mono-block, trigger, hammer, and other small parts made of steel. Thankfully, the Model 42 has sling studs, as should any such firearm that is meant to live in the great outdoors. The barrels measure twenty inches in length. Each barrel measures .555 inch diameter. As far as I can tell, the 410 barrel has no choke constriction, and it is not threaded to accept choke tubes.

To open the action of the Model 42 for loading, a lever in front of the trigger guard is pulled rearward by the shooter’s trigger finger. The mono-block hinges to allow loading and unloading of the weapon. The upper barrel accepts any 22 Long Rifle cartridge (a 22 Magnum version will be available later), and the bottom barrel accepts any 2.5 or 3 inch 410 shotshell. The crossbolt safety pushes to the left to fire. The rebounding hammer is blocked from contacting the firing pins unless the trigger is pulled. The hammer nose rotates to select either the upper or lower barrel to fire. The extractor is manually operated, but I found it easier to just flick out the empty 22 cartridges with my fingernail, using the extractor to remove the empty 410 hulls.

The Model 42 is very light and handy, weighing in at just under four and three-quarters pounds (4 lbs., 10.6 ounces, to be precise) on my scale. The overall length measures thirty-five and three-quarters inches, and the length of pull measures thirteen and one-half inches. The trigger pull feels somewhat heavy, but released crisply with five and one-half pounds of resistance, as measured on my Lyman digital scale.

I don't need to sell it so please do not try to offer me less. These are hard to come by right now and I would be willing to sell at asking price, otherwise I have no problem keeping it.

Brand new in box. Never removed or played with. These are really hard to find right now, Adams Arms 7.5"" PDW Pistol Gas Piston Complete Upper. Complete upper receiver assembly comes ready to install on mil-spec lower receiver to produce a reliable, positive-cycling gas piston gun. Adams Arms’ proven piston system doesn’t vent hot gases and burned powder into the bolt carrier and receiver, so the gun runs cooler, with less fouling and wear on the action, and easier maintenance. Short-stroke piston shaft eliminates concussive gas expansion in the upper receiver for less violent cycling, smoother feeding, and reduced felt recoil. The receiver is forged from 6061 T6 aluminum and features M4 feed ramp cuts and a 13-slot Picatinny-cut flattop rail. The adjustable gas block allows three levels of gas release: normal fire, firing with a suppressor attached, or a single round fired without cycling. Picatinny rail on top of gas block accepts a variety of clamp-on tactical sights. All models have chrome-lined barrels chambered for 5.56mm NATO, with an A2 flash hider and a black Melonite® finish for superb wear resistance and up to 60% more corrosion resistance than traditional phosphate coating. Pistol - 7½"" barrel and two-piece, machined aluminum handguard with four, 3"" Picatinny rails. Side rails include sockets for QD sling swivels. All NFA rules apply. You must own a registered pistol lower receiver in order to own this upper."

This item is brand new but doesn't come with the box.  It has not been installed on a rifle, but I misplaced the box.  I do have the instructions and ATF letter stating its legality though.

Specs:

•	Allows shooter to shoot as quickly as desired, in a safe manner
•	Easily installs on most AR-15 rifles equipped with a carbine style buffer tube
•	No permanent modifications necessary
•	Made in the USA
•	Constructed of Premium Reinforced High Strength Polymer

I paid $369.00 for this but due to a baby on the way need to sell. I'm asking for $275 since it comes without the box. 

I am willing to ship this item and will accept PayPal (3% added to cover fees). I'll cover shipping CONUS.

591,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1591591,For Sale:  Noreen -- Bad s 338 Lapua w/ Timney upgrade .338,"New Haven, New Haven, Connecticut","$ 3,249","Listed On: Thursday, May 9, 2013",Rifles,no type,338 Lapua                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"NOREEN BAD NEWS .338 Lapua !!!!

Noreen has created the ONLY SEMI-AUTOMATIC .300 WIN MAG and .338 Lapua on the market. The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.

The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot.

This piston-driven system is unlike any other AR-10 on the market. The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action.

The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action.

The weapon easily disassembles like the standard AR for quick and easy cleaning and reassembly. The piston system drastically reduces fouling, and no venting means no holes for dirt and other contaminants to enter the system.

The full-length Picatinny rail on the receiver will allow you to mount scopes, lights, lasers, bipods, bayonets, etc. The adjustable cheek rest stock option is an added upgrade free bonus.

The innovative Noreen Bad News .338 Lapua provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. The Noreen 338 Lapua weighs only 13 pounds, and it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. This rifle comes with a custom muzzle-break and semi-auto action that significantly suppresses recoil. In the AR tradition, the Bad News 338 Lapua disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reasembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle seamless. This Noreen includes an ultra-heavy duty Plano case, which is far superior to a pelican style case. 100% Made in the USA.

Introduced in 2009, the Colt LE6940 Advanced Law Enforcement Carbine is best thought of as a semi-automatic-only version of the M4 modified with Colt’s proprietary monolithic one-piece upper receiver and handguard. This upper receiver traces its origins back some six years to guns Colt produced for the SCAR (Special Operations Forces Combat Assault Rifle) program of the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM). It is designed to obviate the need for a separate multiple-rail handguard for mounting accessories, affording perfect alignment of accessories mounted in-line with the primary optical device, providing extreme rigidity, and allowing the removal and reinstallation of optics without loss of zero. Additionally, the handguard section provides sufficient ventilation to prevent heat buildup around the barrel. And the monolithic upper weighs less than a standard upper receiver with separate quad-rail handguard attached. The upper, made from a CNC-machined 7075-T6 aluminum forging, features integral top and side Picatinny rails extending forward just to the rear of the gas block. Recesses for quick-detachable sling swivels are located on both side rails. The bottom rail is a separate piece that can be detached for cleaning or installation of under-barrel accessories. All rail sections have numbered slots for repeatable installation of devices. The LE6940 has extensive parts commonality with the M4, sharing the barrel’s chrome-lining, four-position collapsible stock, and birdcage-style flash hider. Also present are the familiar shell deflector, ejection port cover and forward assist. The LE6940’s bolt, carrier and trigger mechanism also follow the proven AR-15 pattern, as do the controls on the lower receiver: magazine release, reversible safety and bolt release. Like all current Colt-produced rifles, the LE6940 uses 0.154-inch-diameter hammer and trigger pins. The 1:7-inch twist of the barrel and 5.56x45 mm NATO chamber allow the use of 55-grain, 62-grain and 77-grain ammunition. The M4-style barrel measures 0.750 inches at the gas block, but decreases to 0.640 inches under the handguard, and incorporates the M4-style step. Barrel attachment is by way of an improved barrel nut that reportedly offers greater strength. Specifications: Action: Semi-Automatic Caliber: 223 Remington/5.56 NATO Bbl Length: 16.1"" Capacity: 30+1 Trigger: Direct Safety: Lever OAL: 35.25"" Weight: 6.6 lbs Stock: 4-Position Collapsible Finish: Black"

Since its introduction in late 1997, the STI Edge has become the undisputed standard for USPSA/IPSC Limited Division competition shooting as demonstrated by Michael Voigt and Frank Garcia finishing one/two as they led the US IPSC Limited Team to victory at World Shoot XII. It has been adopted by SWAT teams, HRT teams, street cops, and law enforcement training sites. It has been embraced by almost all other shooting disciplines.
Built on the patented modular steel frame with polymer grip, the Edge delivers the traditional features of a 1911 and allows the added benefit of high capacity magazines. The innovative frame design preserves the 17° angle of the grip in relation to the slide, original to the 1911. The essential design element for high capacity, the polymer grip, allows for double stack magazines without over-sizing the circumference of the grip, which remains comparatively the same as the circumference of a 1911.
True to 1911 tradition, the Edge has a unique full length slide with front and rear cocking serrations, STI dovetail front sight and STI adjustable rear sight. The Edge comes standard with features such as a stainless steel STI knuckle relief hi-ride grip safety and stainless steel STI ambi-thumb safeties. It comes with an STI stainless steel fully supported, ramped bull barrel. You can add custom serial numbers, colored grips and triggers, hard chrome, engraving inlays and fiber optic or tritium sights. Not only is it the most accurate and reliable handgun on the market, it can now be one of the most beautiful. The Edge ships with one 126mm magazine.

Magazines:   BX-25x2 (50 rounds total)     $100
  These are NEW never been used Ruger BX-25x2's. [NOTE: These are NOT two separate magazines! These are actually molded together, so while they can be disassembled like the other bx-25 mags, they CANNOT be taken apart from each other. Each side can take 25 rounds for 50 rounds total.] I have one I have kept personally and I have put 300 rounds through it without a single hiccup, and still going strong. Due to them being actually molded together they are THINNER than two separate bx-25's taped/glued together.
 These are very difficult to find right now with the current craze, and I have seen them going on sites like ebay for $130 or even $150 +.

I have several of these magazines.

FOR AN ADDITIONAL $10 I will include 50 rounds of Remington Thunderbolt shown in the picture, so you can try out your new toy. If you (or your gun) don't particularly like the thunderbolts, we might be able to work out a small amount of different .22lr ammo.

For those who are unfamiliar with the product, this is the info that Ruger has on its website: 

""Ruger came up with an innovative design to couple two magazines together. Once thefirst 25rds. are used, all you have to do is flip the mag over. As reliable as the standard BX-1 10-round Ruger rotary magazine. Stainless steel feed lips are designed to present cartridges into the action at a 30 degree angle for better feed reliability. Stainless steel, constant force spring provides feed consistency round after round. Anti-tilt follower is injection molded from a high lubricity polyacetal for consistent reliability. BX-25 X2 magazines will work with any factory original Ruger 10/22 Rifle, SR-22 Rifle, 22 Charger Pistol and 77/22 Rifle. The BX-25 will run reliably with a wide variety of ammunition and requires no lubrication. If it becomes necessary to clean the magazine, loosen the screws on the right and left side of the magazine with a 3/32’’ hex tool."" 

Each box also includes a dust cover to keep dirt/dust out of the feeding lips."

The Rossi Matched Pair has set the standard for 2-barrel guns. This combination long gun package is unequalled, having been recognized as the best 'youth-size' gun and a top notch 'full-size' backpack take-along. We start with one of our popular single shot rifles, then hand fit a shotgun barrel to create the Matched Pair. The result is a highly reliable rifle with adjustable sights and a button rifled barrel for enhanced accuracy, which quickly swaps barrels to become your favorite shotgun. This makes the Matched Pair the perfect gun for hunting or a fun day at the range. Available combinations are listed below. Change Barrels Faster Than You Can Change Your Mind To change barrels, make sure the firearm is unloaded. Loosen the front swivel and remove the forend and swivel. Open the action and insert the barrel, replace forend, tighten the swivel and you are done and ready to shoot. One screw, one minute, no tool, no kidding!
