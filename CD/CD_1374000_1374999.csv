The VEPR comes with a 20.5"" barrel, with a walnut stock.  The  rifle has a special 5 or 10 round  magazine. Each rifle comes in a black oxide finish, a users manual, cleaning kit, rod, 5 and 10rd magazines.  The VEPR rifle has the same reliability as an AK allowing it to work at temperatures of -50 to +50 C and in any conditions.  However the rifle also has accuracy, allowing it to obtain scores of  92 points out of 100 at 200 yards.  The VEPR has a stamped receiver, however the receiver uses thicker steel which is 50% thicker than the standard AK.  Furthermore, like the RPK, the trunion of the VEPR receiver has reinforcements on each side which are not found on the AK47.

It comes with 3 13rnd magazines. 

The only reason I want to trade it is because I have another one (in 9mm along with a subcompact kit in 9mm, I feel like I shoot that better because I am still a beginner. It is a pretty cool gun. Below is an excerpt from wiki to explain the very cool, unique feature of this gun.

A key feature of the pistol is its modular design. The main module of the P250 is an internal stainless steel frame fire control unit which consist of the integrated fire control group (trigger, hammer and all necessary linkage and springs), ambidextrous slide release (one on each side of the pistol), ejector and four slide rails. This steel receiver unit is used in every P250 grip module, top end, and chambering combination and is inserted into the grip frame module and held in place by the axis pin of the disassembly lever. The firearm's serial number is on the fire control unit instead of the grip module. The fire control unit allows the operator to interchange differently-sized slide assembly or top end modules and polymer grip frame modules and trigger shoes and (limited) chambering conversions to adapt the gun to the individual user and address different needs.

The P250 was designed to be ambidextrous in handling, sporting an ambidextrous slide catch lever and user reversible magazine catch. All other operating controls are designed so they can be operated from either side. The firearm can be field stripped with no tools.

The full-size and compact grip modules feature an integral Picatinny rail mounting-bracket at the lower forward edge of the module to allow the mounting of laser sights, tactical lights, and other accessories."

It has two factory mags and one 10-round after market mag.  No problems with either.

Comes with original box and goodies.  I paid over $600 for it new.  I figure I should be able to get $450 for it.

Glock 23   This was a carry pistol for a few years the sat in a safe for many years.
The pistol does have some exterior wear, maybe 800 rounds through it but always cleaned after shooting and well care for.  All the components are in great shape, they have been polished for a nice smooth trigger pull.  It has a New York (Olive) trigger spring with 3.5 lb. connector, for a 5.5 lb. trigger pull.  Great for concealed carry.  I will be glad to put in the stock spring and connector if you prefer.  I can do a full stip and let you inspect every piece, it's in great shape and the new owner will be very happy with the way it shoots.

This Mark 23 is in excellent condition. It was first manufactured in 2010 and I purchased it in 2012. I am the first and only owner. I have fired 22 rounds through it for familiarization and to check proper functioning. The top of the chamber shroud is worn on the tilting edge due to continuous racking of the slide for safety checks and presenting to customers by the gun store owner over the past two years. This wear is perfectly normal and can be easily repaired by almost any local gunsmith if desired. It does not effect the performance of the pistol in any way. The pistol functions flawlessly and otherwise there is not a single mark on it. 

The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns — yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun.

The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more.

One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces.

On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1.

During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!
The Mark 23 is available in .45 ACP

Without knowing the exact year of manufacture, I will require a FFL for shipping. It is mechanically perfect and locks up tight, fires, and extracts with no issues. Both bores are excellent with no pitting or corrosion. Cosmetically, I would rate it at between 80 and 90%. There are some small areas on top of the upper and under the lower barrels where the blue is thinning to a brown patina. $395.00 + $20.00 shipping to your FFL.

MARLIN 39A. This is the real deal, not a Remington thrown together rifle, but a high condition 39A manufactured during the golden age of Marlin quality. Prices on Marlins of this quality have about doubled in the last five years. They are not coming back again, and will continue to appreciate in value. ""J"" prefix serial number puts D.O.B. at 1952 (also making it C&R eligible). It has the pre Micro Groove, Ballard rifled barrel. Overall condition of this one would rate an easy 98%. Wood and metal are great, bore is perfect, and functioning is flawless - you'd be hard put to find a nicer one, and will not be disappointed with it. It also comes with a period correct all steel Weaver (U.S.A.) D6 six power scope in the same fine condition with sharp clear optics. $625.00 + $20.00 for insured delivery to your C&R or FFL.

Lower Receiver Specifications

The lower receiver used in this build is a True MIL-SPEC forged lower, quality made using 7075 T6 aluminum (aircraft grade). The Lower was manufactured by Aero Precision Company. They make lowers for large manufacturers such as Spikes Tactical, and Palmetto State Armory for example. These are the exact same lowers made on the same machines as the large brand name lowers. Before you buy an AR-15 always make sure that the lower receiver is a Forged Lower Receiver made with 7075 T6 aluminum.

Lower Parts Kit Specifications

The lower parts kit used in this build was made by a military contractor CMMG. These are true mil-spec lower parts used by the military and other large manufacturers. These are high quality lower parts made to last. Before you buy an AR-15 always make sure that the lower parts kit is from a reputable manufacturer and are not made from polymer parts. Some manufacturers use cheap imported parts from overseas that will not last long under the high heat and pressure of firing multiple rounds quickly. Always ask about each part before buying an rifle. If the seller cannot or will not tell you where the parts come from beware.

This Tomcat is in excellent condition with approximately 100 rounds fired through it without a single stoppage. Comes with replacement grips and an extra magazine from Beretta . 

The 3032 Tomcat offers all the features of the 21 Bobcat. Both pistols have a snag-proof design that permits quick presentation to the target, a slide blade front sight for fast target acquisition, and a smooth, crisp trigger pull in double/single action.

QUALITY POCKET PISTOLS. 
The same dedication to advanced design, uncompromising quality and strict quality control that make the 92FS, Cougar and Cheetah such international standouts is found in all Beretta small caliber, pocket-size pistols. Simplicity, safety and practical use are their best qualities.

PRACTICAL AND SIMPLE.
The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by allowing a live round to be easily removed from the chamber and the bore quickly checked. Jamming and stovepiping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas.

3032 TOMCAT. EXCELLENT POWER VS WEIGHT.
Stopping power, concealability and lightweight – that’s what the double-action Tomcat is all about. Using 60-grain .32 ACP (7.65 mm) hollow-point ammunition, this latest addition to Beretta’s small frame collection provides firepower equalling the punch of a .380 (9mm Short). Yet, all this serious capability is packed into a compact, lightweight 4.9” (125 mm), 14.5 ounce (400 gr.) package. A drift-adjustable rear sight provides for superior accuracy."

I acquired this in a trade last week but then found a different 45 Auto at Gander Mountain that I liked better (due to the size...this is a smaller gun, I prefer something bigger). I haven't had a chance to even take this to the range. It doesn't come with the original case or owner's manual (you can download it online) and it's just the gun plus one magazine as pictured. I am selling it as is, no warranty obviously since it's a used firearm. I was going to ask Gander Mountain if they would take it on trade but the sales guy was honest with me and said they only give 60% of the book value as a standard practice for all firearms they buy from the public.  I'll throw in a cloth pistol carrying case that I bought but don't need. It's a Winchester brand 11-inch sporting pistol case with 4 magazine pockets inside. Nice low budget gun, probably small enough to conceal carry. 

I am asking $350 firm (less than what I have in it from the previous trade) so that I can get the other one I found more quickly. Prefer meeting on west side of Madison and will not travel outside of the Madison area. Face to face of course, cash only, and by buying this firearm you agree that you are legally able to own a gun in Wisconsin. I reserve the right to decide who I will sell the gun to as well, and if something doesn't seem right about you or your offer or if I get a better offer than yours, I reserve the right to move on to another potential buyer. Thanks for looking.  

I would consider trades in the form of 40S&W, 45Auto or 38 Special ammo towards this, but not interested in reloads. If you have something in mind, send me an email. The worst I can say is no."

As you know this is the premier 1911 to have. I wish I could keep it but another firearm I've been looking for just became available to me. Therefore the wife says I can't have both. This is the latest version of the Colt Gold Cup series model 05070X. From Colts site: The Colt Gold Cup is known as the finest shooting semi-automatic in the world, and is the standard for competitive guns. The first Colt Gold Cup pistol was introduced in the late 1950’s to give competitive shooters a gun to take directly from the dealer’s showcase to the firing line. Colt Gold Cup pistols have been used to compete in local club matches through the National Matches at Camp Perry. It features an Adjustable Wide Trigger, National Match® Barrel, Adjustable Target Sights, and many other refinements as standard. It is your responsibility to know if you are legally allowed to own this gun in your state. I will ship fedex 2nd day air for a flat rate fee of $40. I will only ship after payment has cleared.

I have a brand new Vortex PST. I bought this for a long range trainer I had built but ended up getting a killer deal on a US Optics so I don't have a need for this. The scope comes with the box and everything else that a new one would come with.. Scope caps, zero stop shims, batteries for the illumination & a Vortex microfiber towel. I'm willing to trade.. For the money the PST line cannot be beat! If you do a quick google search you'll see that they stack up against optics twice the cost and come with MORE features. I currently own another PST and I've used it multiple times to shoot at ranges from 100 yards to 1300 yards, You wont be disappointed. This is a awesome scope for someone on a budget who doesn't want to sacrifice quality or the seasoned precision shooter!

If you're interested please text me @ REDACTED

I've attached two photos. Please excuse the iPhone photos as they lack in showing the complete robustness in the optical image. The building in the photo is 715 yards away @ 10x.

All specs shown on the scope are merely dust it's in perfect condition. If the buyer/trader needs I have a set of 30mm low rings and a Harris 6-9 BRM (S) bipod I could include to increase the value if TRADING. The bipod is not for SALE.

SINCE I HAVE HAD NUMEROUR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE “PRE-BAN” HERE IS A LITTLE INFORMATION I HOPE HELPS EVERYONE TO UNDERSTAND BETTER

The TEC-9 and, eventually, TEC-DC9 variants were listed among the 19 firearms banned by name in the USA by the now expired 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB).[1] This ban caused the cessation of their manufacture, and forced Intratec to introduce a newer model called the AB-10, a TEC-9 Mini without a threaded muzzle/barrel shroud and limited to a 10 round magazine instead of a 20 or 32 round magazine. However, it accepted the high capacity magazines of the pre-ban models.
The Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB), or Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, was a subtitle of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a federal law in the United States that included a prohibition on the manufacture for civilian use of certain semi-automatic firearms, so called ""assault weapons"".[1] The 10-year ban was passed by Congress on September 13, 1994, and was signed into law by President Bill Clinton the same day. The ban only applied to weapons manufactured after the date of the ban's enactment.
In the former U.S. law, the legal term assault weapon included certain specific semi-automatic firearm models by name (e.g., Colt AR-15, TEC-9, non-select-fire AK-47s produced by three manufacturers, and Uzis) and other semi-automatic firearms because they possess a minimum set of cosmetic features from the following list of features below:
•	Pistol Grip 					(Tec 9 has)
•	For end Grip					(Tec9 has)
•	Flash Suppressor 				(Tec9 has)
•	Grenade Launcher				(does not have)
•	Magazine that attached outside of the grip	(Tec9 has)
•	Folding stock					(does not have)
•	Bayonet Mount					(does not have)
During this ban, your weapon was legal with only 2(TWO) of the accessories. As you can see this PRE-BAN weapon has  4!!!!!

II. The Tec-9 Is A Semi-Automatic Version Of A Military Submachinegun

The TEC-9 is a semi-automatic version of a military submachinegun. Although it has been marketed under various names -- the KG-9, the KG-99, the TEC-9, and the TEC-DC9 -- and by various companies owned and operated by the Garcia family, the basic design of the weapon has remained virtually unchanged. The company decided to manufacture the KG-9 because of the growing market for military style guns in the United States. The KG-9's manual described it as: 
Combining the high capacity and controlled firepower of the military submachinegun with the legal status and light weight of a handgun.The term ""assault pistol"" was coined by the firearms industry to describe the KG-9 was an illegal machine gun, due to the ease with which it could be converted to fully automatic fire.


A. The KG-9 Was Banned as a Machine Gun, and Renamed the KG-99

In 1982, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms ruled that the KG-9 was an illegal machine gun, due to the ease with which it could be converted to fully automatic fire.

The company redesigned the KG-9's bolt to make conversion more difficult, and renamed the weapon the KG-99. Otherwise, the design remained essentially unchanged. Intratec confirmed that like its predecessor, the KG-99 could be fairly described as ""combining the high capacity and controlled firepower of the military submachinegun with the legal status and light weight of a handgun.""

Intratec U.S.A. (""Intratec"") manufactured a vertical foregrip for use with the KG-99, which it marketed as an ""Assault Grip."" Intratec used the term ""Assault Grip"" in marketing the foregrip, ""[b]ecause you basically hold the gun with two hands like you would as assault weapon, a military weapon.""

In November 1982, and again in March 1985, the ATF notified Intratec that it was unlawful to possess a KG-99 and an attachable foregrip, even though the pistol and the foregrip were disassembled. Although Intratec understood that they should not be selling the assault grip, he continued to sell it as an accessory for the KG-99, stamping on the order form that ""ATF has ruled that the KG-250 assault grip may not be attached legally to the KG-99 or the old model KG-9.""

B. Intratec Rename the KG-99 the TEC-9, and Continued to Sell the ""Assault Grip.""

Intratec renamed the KG-99 the TEC in August 1985. The TEC-9 was substantially identical to the KG-99, with just a few cosmetic changes. The company resumed marketing the assault grip without any warning, advertising that it ""Attaches to All TEC-9"" Intratec advertised the TEC-9 as a ""High-spirited"" weapon that is ""as tough as your toughest customer."" The company’s brochure emphasized the weapon’s ""paramilitary"" appeal, its ""Military blowback design,"" and its ""Combat-type"" sights. The brochure depicted a smoking target of a human being shot dozens of times through the head and the heart in what appears to be a fusillade of automatic weapons fire. In April 1987, Intratec was sued by the Estate of David Bengston in Connecticut state court. The complaint alleged that the decedent, a school custodian, was fatally shot in the head with a TEC-9M [""Mini""], and that Intratec ""knew or should have known that the TEC-9M gun was and is primarily suited for an/or used in criminal activity,"" and that it ""lacks legitimate use, such as sporting, law enforcement of self-protection."" In November 1987, Carlos Garcia formed Navegar in order to take the assets of the business back from his father and avoid Intratec’s liabilities. Navegar continued to manufacture and market the TEC-9, and continued to do business as Intratec. Intratec U.S.A. declared bankruptcy in 1989, with the Bengston and Alicki lawsuits as its only significant liabilities."

It came out of Colt's Custom Shop in 1978 and was in JPL's glass case marked ""Personally Owned Firearm - Not For Sale."" That sticker is still affixed to the well-worn original Colt Box. Of course, since it was marked not for sale I had to try to buy it. It took the trade of two other fine handguns and a cash hand of poker to walk out the door with it. I will be glad to provide a sworn letter to the buyer if desired. It has sat in my safe now for 28 years. In that span of time I've owned a total of four different Pythons, a couple of Trooper Mk IIIs and a couple of Detective Specials, and as fine a revolvers as they all are, none come close to the action on this one. And no matter what angle or lighting is used, the camera simply cannot capture the incredible deep beauty that was Colt's Royal Blue at that time. There are many more pictures available; just email for them.

I'm old now, and I am simply not ever going to take this gun out and shoot it. I suppose there are still some fine unfired Pythons out there, but probably few like this one. How to say this in the most polite possible way: I'll be using the funds to enhance my granddaughter's college account, so please don't waste my time and yours with low ball offers or trades, I am not interested and they will be ignored. I figure I will probably need to list this revolver on Gunbroker to get its value but I decided to try Armslist locally first. If you're looking at Armslist from outside Colorado, yes, I will ship this gun from my dealer to yours at extra cost. Thanks for taking the time to read this listing."

The Megastar pistol is a heavy, powerful pistol, which appeared on the markets in 1993. It was designed and manufactured by the Spanish company Star Bonifacio Echeverria SA, and its design is based on the previous guns by the same manufacturer, such as Star 30M. Production of the Megastar was completed in the late 1990s.
Megastar is a recoil operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistol. It uses a Browning High-Power type locking system with tilting barrel. Megastar is a hammer fired pistol, with double action trigger and ambidextrous, slide mounted safety-decocker lever. The safety lever has three positions: upper one for ""fire"" mode, red dot is shown; medium one for ""safe"" mode, this withdraws and locks the firing pin; and the lower one for safe decocking (after decocking safety lever springs back to the ""safe"" position). Megastar also features a magazine disconnect safety which does not allow to fire the gun with out the magazine in the place. Megastar slide and frame are made from the steel, and like other latest Star pistols, Megastar has internal slide rails, instead of more usual external rails. This pistol features non-ajustable sights. Magazine capacity is quite impressive, especially when speaking about the period of the early 1990s, and is 12 rounds of .45ACP.  Overall, Megastar represents one of the strongest designs in auto-pistols, heavy but powerful and built to last forewer. Heavy weight also helps to control the recoil of the powerful cartridges used."
