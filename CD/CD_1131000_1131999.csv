This is a great AK47 in 7.63x39, the standard AK round. The finish is good to excellent as is the wood. The Folding stock works great. I would never have guessed this gun was 25 years old. Bright, shiny bore, smooth action, perfect functioning. Chews through any kind of ammo you throw at it.
If you don't understand the significance of ""Pre Ban"" it means that this gun was made with authentic parts and pieces before ""they"" started making manufacturers put ""compliant"" parts on it and taking off things like a threaded barrel and bayonet lug, which this one has. So if you want more of an authentic AK, this is it. It is made much better than the Romanian WASR's you will see around and is much more on par with the very nice Bulgarians or others.
Thanks for looking.

This is a great AK47 in 7.63x39, the standard AK round. The finish is good to excellent as is the wood. The Folding stock works great. I would never have guessed this gun was 25 years old. Bright, shiny bore, smooth action, perfect functioning. Chews through any kind of ammo you throw at it.
If you don't understand the significance of ""Pre Ban"" it means that this gun was made with authentic parts and pieces before ""they"" started making manufacturers put ""compliant"" parts on it and taking off things like a threaded barrel and bayonet lug, which this one has. So if you want more of an authentic AK, this is it. It is made much better than the Romanian WASR's you will see around and is much more on par with the very nice Bulgarians or others.
Thanks for looking.

Extended Ejector Rod
For positive extraction of fired cases.
 	Ribber Grip 
Exclusive Taurus orgonomic shock absorbing grip design provides a firm grip under virtually all shooting conditions.
 	Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
 	Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.
 	Fiber Optic Sight

This is a like-new, Yugolsavian M76 8mm sniper rifle. It is an AK 47 design and will most likely be banned due to its ""assault"" nature, with hand grip and flexibility of magazines. It comes with the ZRAK ON-M76B scope and scope cover, hard case, 10 round magazine and manual. I am the second owner of the gun and have only shot about 20 rounds through it. I have another one that I am keeping and it is an amazing gun. Ammo is cheap and if you don't know the balistics of the 8mm, look it up. 800 yards is reasonable for an average user. Here is one review on it.

The finish is good to excellent as is the wood. I would never have guessed this gun was 25 years old. Bright, shiny bore, smooth action, perfect functioning. Chews through any kind of ammo you throw at it.
If you don't understand the significance of ""Pre Ban"" it means that this gun was made with authentic parts and pieces before ""they"" started making manufacturers put ""compliant"" parts on it and taking off things like a threaded barrel and bayonet lug, which this one has. So if you want more of an authentic AK, this is it. It is made much better than the Romanian WASR's you will see around and is much more on par with the very nice Bulgarians or others.

163,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1131163,For Sale:  The threat posed by limiting gun magazines,"colorado, Denver, Colorado",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, February 24, 2013",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"A limit on magazine capacity is emerging as a leading contender for the something that supposedly must be done in response to last month's massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. A ban on ""large-capacity ammunition feeding devices"" is one of the new gun restrictions approved by the New York legislature this week and one of the measures President Obama wants Congress to enact. 

The rationale for such limits is that mass murderers need ""large-capacity"" magazines, while law-abiding citizens don't. Both premises are questionable, and so is the notion that politicians should be the arbiters of necessity under the Second Amendment. 

The problem with letting legislators decide what gun owners need is immediately apparent when we ask what qualifies as a ""large-capacity"" magazine. Under current New York law and under the federal limit that expired in 2004 (which Obama wants Congress to reinstate), more than 10 rounds is ""large."" This week the New York legislature redefined large as more than seven rounds. 

Why? Because seven is less than 10. Duh. Or as Gov. Andrew Cuomo put it last week, ""Nobody needs 10 bullets to kill a deer."" 

That might count as an argument if the right to keep and bear arms were all about killing deer. But as the Supreme Court has recognized, the Second Amendment is also about defense against individual aggressors, foreign invaders, and tyrannical government. 

Toward those ends, the Court said, the Second Amendment guarantees the right to own weapons ""in common use for lawful purposes,"" which clearly include guns capable of firing more than 10 rounds (and certainly more than seven) without reloading. The Glock 17, one of the most popular handguns in America, comes with a 17-round magazine. One of the most popular rifles, the AR-15 (a style made by several manufacturers), comes with a 30-round magazine. 

Measured by what people actually buy and use, magazines that hold more than 10 rounds are hardly outliers. In fact, there are tens (if not hundreds) of millions already in circulation, which is one reason new limits cannot reasonably be expected to have much of an impact on people determined to commit mass murder. 

Another reason is that changing magazines takes one to three seconds, which will rarely make a difference in assaults on unarmed people. The gunman in Connecticut, for example, reportedly fired about 150 rounds, so he must have switched his 30-round magazines at least four times; he stopped only because police were closing in, which prompted him to kill himself. 

Magazine size is more likely to matter for people defending against aggressors, which is why it is dangerously presumptuous for the government to declare that no one needs to fire more than X number of rounds. As self-defense experts such as firearms instructor Massad Ayoob point out, there are various scenarios, including riots, home invasions, and public attacks by multiple aggressors, in which a so-called large-capacity magazine can make a crucial difference, especially when you recognize that people firing weapons under pressure do not always hit their targets and that assailants are not always stopped by a single round. 

Living in Los Angeles during the 1992 riots, I was glad that shopkeepers in Koreatown had ""large-capacity"" magazines to defend themselves and their property against rampaging mobs. I bet they were too. In fact, argues gun historian Clayton Cramer, those magazines may have saved rioters' lives as well, since they allowed business owners to fire warning shots instead of shooting to injure or kill. 

If magazines holding more than 10 rounds are not useful for self-defense and defense of others, shouldn't the same limit be imposed on police officers and bodyguards (including the Secret Service agents who protect the president)? And if the additional rounds do provide more protection against armed assailants, it hardly makes sense to cite the threat of such attacks as a reason to deny law-abiding citizens that extra measure of safety."

The finish is good to excellent as is the wood. I would never have guessed this gun was 25 years old. Bright, shiny bore, smooth action, perfect functioning. Chews through any kind of ammo you throw at it.
If you don't understand the significance of ""Pre Ban"" it means that this gun was made with authentic parts and pieces before ""they"" started making manufacturers put ""compliant"" parts on it and taking off things like a threaded barrel and bayonet lug, which this one has. So if you want more of an authentic AK, this is it. It is made much better than the Romanian WASR's you will see around and is much more on par with the very nice Bulgarians or others.

This is a like-new, Yugolsavian M76 8mm sniper rifle. It is an AK 47 design and will most likely be banned due to its ""assault"" nature, with hand grip and flexibility of magazines. It comes with the ZRAK ON-M76B scope and scope cover, hard case, 10 round magazine and manual. I am the second owner of the gun and have only shot about 20 rounds through it. I have another one that I am keeping and it is an amazing gun. Ammo is cheap and if you don't know the balistics of the 8mm, look it up. 800 yards is reasonable for an average user. Here is one review on it.

Telescoping stocks are necessary for operators wearing body armor, or for smaller statured shooters; a telescoping stock provides the length of pull the situation demands.
The concept behind the telescoping stock system is simple: the shotgun’s factory stock is replaced by an adapter, to which standard AR-15 grips and telescoping buttstocks can be reliably attached. All of our stock adapters are investment cast aircraft aluminum, which are then CNC machined before being anodized with a Type III Class 2 mil-spec finish.The LEO adapter, manufactured for the Remington 870 and Mossberg 500/590 are our most popular models, and features a lowered stock elevation allowing the use of iron sights or even the bead sight.

LEO adapters also accept optional stamped steel sling loop and hook loops. The LEO’s low price and streamlined appearance make it the best choice for agencies looking for a simple, reliable telescoping stock at an affordable price.

The trigger guard on this one isn't cracked!

This shotgun looks good and appears to not have been used much. The bolt had some surface rust, no pits, and I sprayed a bit of Gunzilla on a rag and wiped it - it appears it will clean up very easily. The bluing is very good as is the bore. The stock looks good but has signs of handling, but over all in excellent shape. The red and green safety pins are still embedded in the stock. I think I have at least one box of bird shot for this too. Look at the pictures and make me a reasonable offer."

“- Melonite coated barrel: Melonite coating reduces internal barrel friction which extends the barrel life. Melonite coating also improves accuracy due to tighter coating tolerances and improves muzzle velocity by over 100 FPS. With no chrome lining to flake or peel over time, these melonited barrels will outlast hard chrome lined barrels two to one! 

This new line of uppers will give you the most inexpensive option on the market for a free floating, tactical piston upper, and added it to our standard government contoured barrel and standard picatinny gas block. 

These barrels and blocks take less time to machine and less money to produce than the ultra lite barrel and gas block. 
This means a savings in manufacturing cost, which we can pass on to the customer. 

These are hard to find and on Backorder.

.416 Remington Magnum
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The .416 Remington Magnum is a .416 caliber (10.36 mm) of a belted bottle-necked design. The cartridge was intended as a dangerous game hunting cartridge and released to the public in 1989. The cartridge uses the case of the 8 mm Remington Magnum as a parent cartridge. When the cartridge was released in 1988, author Frank C. Barnes considered the .416 Remington Magnum to be the “most outstanding factory cartridge introduced in decades”.[2]

The cartridge was conceived as a less costly alternative to the .416 Rigby cartridge and was intended to replace the latter. 

While today the .416 Remington Magnum is considered in the field the most popular of the .416 cartridges.

The .416 Remington Magum is one of the more popular dangerous game cartridges used for the hunting of dangerous game in Africa. It also has been increasingly used in North America, in Alaska in particular for the hunting of and as a defense to large bears.[3]

Sporting Usage:
The intent and purpose behind the .416 Remington Magnum cartridge was to provide a dangerous game rifle cartridge which could emulate the performance of the vaunted .416 Rigby cartridge. While the .375 H&H Magnum is considered marginal on heavy, dangerous game, the .416 Rigby was recognized as a big bore with definitive stopping power to put down elephant, African Cape buffalo and rhinoceros. The cartridge has been successfully used against these game species in Africa and is a popular cartridge among professional hunters and has been slowly replacing the .458 Winchester Magnum.

Although dangerous game hunting is conducted at fairly close ranges rarely exceeding 60 yd (55 m) the .416 Remington Magnum has the required energy and penetration to kill heavy dangerous game at ranges over 100 yd (91 m). The cartridge has an effective range against bear, lion and leopard out to over 250 yd."

Commando MKIII .45ACP carbine, a semi-auto rifle styled after an Auto Ordinance Tommy Gun. This gun is a late model, manufactured in 1975, making it one of the highest-quality and most reliable Commandos out there. It uses 30-round M3 Grease Gun mags, which are still cheap and plentiful on GunBroker - much cheaper than actual Thompson 20-round stick mags. The receiver, 16-inch barrel, compensator, and magazine have been recently refinished in DuPont Teflon black at a cost of $250, and look excellent. It also has the highly-desirable vertical foregrip. It has been thoroughly cleaned and lubed, and only 5 rounds have been fired since the refinish to ensure proper function. 

I am also including a spare lower receiver, which I had planned to refinish and convert to use a genuine Thompson wooden handgrip and trigger, as well as the mechanism required to convert the stock to a push-button release, again emulating a genuine Thompson. The wooden buttstock can be easily removed with two screws, and the gun is quite fun to shoot without the stock. I am also including two spare firing pins and two firing pin springs, very hard-to-get parts when you need them, and a spare ejector, ejector pin, and ejector spring. It has the rock-solid feel and fun of a Thompson to shoot, at a significantly lower cost. 

33rd-edition of the Blue Book of Gun Values places the value of this rifle in good condition at $825, which does not include the spare parts (firing pins are $25 each). I am willing to accept offers in the neighborhood of $725. Full and partial trade offers will be considered, but I am most in need of the cash. As much as I don't want to admit it, it may not be possible to sell this gun (or mag) without a costly FFL transfer in Colorado soon, so this is a good opportunity to pick this gun up before that nonsense goes into effect. 

I am in need of funds quickly, so I would like to sell this today or tomorrow. For this reason, please call me on my cell phone at 720-987-4060 to arrange a meeting."

It is (or was) the stainless and black synthetic model. Last summer I wanted it to be a little more hunting friendly so I camo'd it with Krylon camo paint and a clear coat.

It also has a Bushnell Banner 3x9x40 scope mounted and painted on it. The scope has a nice 6"" eye relief. 

The gun has less than a full box of ammo through it. Took it to the range to sight it in and took it hunting a couple times last fall. 

Looking to sell it outright for $575 obo.

As for trades, I have my eye on a Ruger American Rifle in 30-06 but would listen to any decent 30-06 trade proposals.
