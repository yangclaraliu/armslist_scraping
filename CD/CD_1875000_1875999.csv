Mag-Na-Port has been building and customizing firearms for decades, and is known for their remarkable work. Their craftsmanship is obvious in the visually stunning look of their products, and in the enhanced performance they deliver from their customized guns.

Karla's work has been featured in American Handgunner Magazine, and for obvious reasons. Hand tooled, this is literally ""the best"" in leather and is a great compliment to the Ruger Mag-Na-Port Predator .44 Magnum!

Springfield Armory® has just introduced a new 1911 designed for 
 people interested in shooting competitively. It is called— The RO™, 
“Range Officer™”. The RO™ is designed to give the shooter 
 exceptional quality, at an affordable price. One of the goals was to 
 create a pistol that is acceptable in many different styles of 
 shooting competitions, so the shooter can decide which one he 
 likes most. It is built with the same quality as the TRP™ and Trophy 
 Match™ models, but Springfield has removed the “extras” that result 
 in a higher price. It’s everything you need in a competition model, 
 at an affordable price, and easily upgradable for your future needs.

When I bought the rifle it was soaked through with cosmoline and it was a mix master. I cleaned the rifle up and because I can be obsessive compulsive about things ‘corrected’ the rifle to have all Springfield parts on it. Many of the parts on the rifle are new old stock parts. Also included is a reproduction M1907 leather sling.

the stock was dry when I got it so I applied several coats of boiled linseed oil to it. I cut down the hand guard to accurately represent how the USMC did it, and treated the hand guard the same way as the rest of the stock."

Was used for hunting small game, and it's in pretty good condition. Some weathering on the stock but no rust or pitting. Receiver and barrel look great. They have engravings on them. I'm really looking to trade for bull riding gear. All i would NEED is the rope, vest, spurs, and chaps. just throw in as much as you feel comfortable throwing in. I know how expensive chaps can be so if you don't want to include those in that's fine. Helmet isn't needed, but I sure wouldn't mind lol Most likely a small vest, but i think medium would work also.Glove if it is left handed. The rope doesn't have to be left handed, I can use a right handed rope until I have enough money to get a good one. Like new gear would be nice, but I'm also realistic and know what it all costs so condition isn't a huge importance, just as long as it still works good. Hoping someone that can't bull ride anymore due to injury or something can pass the torch. If you know anyone that has any old gear they don't use let me know, it'd be appreciated. Willing to drive quite a ways to come get it too. I am open to other offers, just let me know. Thank you. 

If you want to buy it, it'll be $425. That's how much I found some gear for so ill just go buy it if you want to pay cash."

     Item 27G/20 is a 90gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet. It is traveling over 1,050 fps out of my BDA (Browning Double Action) with its 3.75 inch barrel.  We've utilized the very same flash suppressed powders that we've used in our two other 380 auto standard pressure loads. If you like the idea of the extra big hole this expanding load makes in human flesh, we would advise that you load this bullet in your chamber, followed by a magazine full of our non-expanding loads. So, if the first shot does not incapacitate the attacker, your magazine is full of ammo that will, if you can put the bullet in his spine or brain from any angle."

The engine started life as a 1600cc type 1.with an aftermarket aluminum case. it has a 84mm stroker FORGED SCAT Volksracer Crankshaft, Forged Piston and Cylinder Kit, 4340 SCAT Chromoly Gland Nut and HD Washer, 4340 H beam Forged Rods,SCAT Cam, SCAT Lightweight Lifters, HD Chromoly Pushrods, Gasket Set and Silicone Flywheel Seal, HD Oil Pump, Main Bearings, Rod Bearings, and Cam Bearings.Aluminum performance Crankshaft Pulley. it is a dual port with custom made intake ramd that go to a holley 500 blow threw carb. all air tight
The turbo set up is home made. the turbo appear to be a KkK turbo it is a k16 m&n . #REDACTED6. there is no intercooler it goes straight from the turbo to hood over the holley 500. there is a typre rs blow off valve inbtween the turbo and car of course. i have it set at 6 psi. for daily driving but it can be turned up for playn in the sand or mud. there is a good waist gate on it i could not find a name or part number most likely a ebay one. it dus have a performance turn dile boost adjusment on it so u can turn it up and down on the go. i will be 100% honest the guys i got it from said thay just had the turbo rebuilt but i had a lil oil come out of the blow off. im not sure but i think the shaft seal might be leaking but it could be something else. thay sle rebuild kits for these turbos online for around $100. it can run as is with no problems but if u are like me u want it to be perfict. u can either rebuild this one or replace it with a garret t3 which u can find all over online used for under $100 or u can just take it off and run it with out one. i just like having the extra power when i need it 
The trans is a trans from a 70 -75 vw bus. thay are the best to be used on sand rails and dune buggys. all of the pro shops use these. it is a bus type 2 irs syle 091. 4.57 Ring and Pinion Ratio, weddle Gear Sets 1st thru 4th, Super Diff, 6 rib 4 speed with rev. has prosche heavy duty axles. the rail has doetsch tech high performance shocks on the rear, i cant find out wut style are on the front 

It is a 2 seater with 2 race bucket seats with 4 point harnesses,thay have seen there fair share of weather and could use been replaced. in the drivers cock pit u have gas peddle, brake peddle with its own master cylinder,and clutch pedel. in between the driver seat and pas is a gemuine neal brake lever. it looks like a e brake but if u push it down it brakes the pas side raer tire and if u pull it up it brakes the driver rear. this set up is so when u are doin a wheelie u can turn the rail with the front tires in the air. on the roof above the driver seat u have a toggle ingnition set up.not the cheap one. u have toggles that run everything. has ones for the high flow fuel pump,headlights,taillights,lights on the gauges,and a light that is over the engine bay just in case u have to work on it at night. has oil temp gauge,bosst gauge and a few others.
The sand rail is titled as a 90s model gmc sanoma. im not 100% sure how thay did this but it works for the dmv and police,so it worked for me. only thing the rail needs to e 100% street legal is turn signals, and depending on the state it might need a windshield but a helmet works just as good.
When i got the sand rail the guys had made a custom built trailer to haul it on. it will go with the rail. it has both new wheel bearings and is ready to go. it is not a show trailer just something to haul it around on.
i am looking to trade it for a 4x4 truck of a big lifted 4 wheeler. i will look at all offers but i dnt want any 4cyl cars, or boats. unless it is 2 good jet skis. i am really looing for something like a k5 blazer lifted and road and mud ready. my toy runs and drives great ur trade offer has to also. i know wut i have i know how much it would cost to build one just like this so trade offers have to be at least 6k, or ur offer and guns or cash txt me ONLY if u call i will not pick up. REDACTED or email me threw the add thank u for ur time and god bless


http://youtu.be/FltOqHWFl5c 
the video is of a walk around of the rail. it was a cold start and had not warmed up yet. the noise u hear is not a valve or engine problem. the donut gasket that goes from the head to the header was missing. i have ordered a new set of gaskets and thay will be in some time this week. the rail is so loud because there is no exhaust on it at this time i do have a koyotec auto high performance exhaust pipe that will go with the rail.in the video u will c a lil smoke coming off the pipe under the turbo. the o ring to the turo oil line was leaking. i have sense then took it apart and replacked the o ring and cleaned it up. it is no longer leaking there. as of right now all the rail needs is to be tuned. it might need the distributer turned a lil to be put in time. she back fires everyonce in a wyle on cold starts but once warmed up i have no problems with it."

This model is a decocker version of the basic CZ 75 B model. The decocking lever mounted on the left side allows the hammer to be easily lowered on a loaded chamber for a safe ""hammer down"" carry. CZ 75 B is used by more Governments, Militaries, Police and Security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol. All steel construction (except alloy framed compacts). High capacity double column magazines. Hammer forged barrels. Ergonomic grip and controls. Unparallel accuracy, slide-in-frame design for better recoil control, 3 dot sighting system. Smooth double action and crisp single action.

Hello! Here's what I have:

Triple Serial W. German P228- Date Code: 1990
Original cardboard box with small corner ding (not from me, from previous owner) and test target
3x13 round factory mags
2x15 round mec gar mags
1x18 round mec gar mag
Galco stow n go holster
Nightingale leather OWB holster (I believe it is Raven V)
Hogue rubber grips (not finger groove ones, plain)
Original solid (no lanyard loop grips) grips
New ""P228, M11A1"" grips (with lanyard loop)

I am open to offers, both cash offers and trade. I REALLY want an HK P2000SK in 9mm.

If I had to rate the gun I would say it is roughly ~90% condition. Holster wear on typical high points on slide. Minor wear on trigger guard and magwell, (very un-noticeable). I will show what I'm talking about in pictures. For being 23 years old, It's in great condition.

The date code on the gun is 1990, and I am the second owner (as far as I know). 

Location: Currently in Muncie but I am willing to meet as far North as Ft. Wayne, and as far South as Gander Mountain off 82nd in Indy."

""The world’s famous Austrian arms-making company Steyr-Mannlicher AG in 2004 complemented its long-popular, but somehow ""old-style"" SSG-69 sniper rifle with completely new offering, the SSG 04 (ScharfSchÃ¼zen-Gewehr 04 - precision-shooting rifle, model of [20]04). Unlike the SSG-69, new SSG 04 rifle is based on much more modern SBS bolt action, developed by Steyr in mid-1990s for their current line of hunting and target rifles. The SBS system is often advertised as ‘safest’, and it is certainly is very safe against such dangers as fractured cartridge case or obstructed barrel. Combined with Steyr’s famous cold hammer-forged barrels and new, single stage trigger the SSG 04 action is capable of excellent (sub-MOA) accuracy. The Steyr SSG 04 rifles are believed to be in use with some law enforcement organizations around the world.""

""Steyr-Mannlicher SSG 04 sniper rifles are based on Steyr SBS rotary bolt action with four frontal locking lugs, arranged in pairs. Cold hammer-forged barrels are available in standard or compact lengths (compact only in 7.62 NATO), in either case fitted with muzzle brake. Feed is from detachable box magazines, holding eight .300WM or ten 7.62mm NATO rounds. Single-stage triggers are factory set for optimum performance, but can be adjusted by operator if desired. Stocks are made from polymer and feature adjustable cheek rest and length of pull (by using removable rubber spacers). Steyr SSG 04 rifles are offered without any iron sights; telescope or night sights can be easily installed using standard Picatinny-type rail, attached to the receiver.""

 World War II. It was a descendant of the M-22 prototype and the KP/-26 production model, which was revealed to the public in 1925. The Suomi-konepistooli KP/-31 is often abbreviated to Suomi KP.

The Suomi KP/-31 is regarded by many[3] as one of the most successful submachine guns of World War II, also the soon developed 71-round drum magazine was later copied and adopted by the Soviets for their PPD-40 and PPSh-41 submachine guns.[4] The accuracy of the Suomi was superior to that of the mass-produced PPSh-41,[4] thanks in part to a noticeably longer barrel, with the same rate of fire and the equally large magazine capacity.[4] The major disadvantage of the Suomi KP/-31 was its high production costs.

The Suomi KP/-31 also incorporated a few new design features, including an arrangement whereby the spring was mounted inside the bolt in order to make the gun shorter. Its 50-round quad-column ""Casket"" box magazine was more reliable than the early 40-round ""bullets loaded nose down"" drum magazine, and similar applications were used on the Argentinian C-4 submachine gun and present-day 60-round 5.45x39mm AK-74 compatible magazines.

The M-22 and KP/-26 were made by Konepistooli Oy, founded by Master Armorer Aimo Lahti, Captain V. Korpela, Lieutenant Y. Koskinen and Lieutenant L. Boyer-Spoof. The Suomi KP/-31 was designed by Koskinen and Lahti.

The Suomi KP/-31 went into serial production in 1931 by Tikkakoski Oy and most of these weapons were bought by the Finnish Defence Forces. The Finnish Defence Forces were equipped with about 4000 Suomi KP/-31 submachine guns when the Winter War started. During the course of the war, the design was altered with the addition of a muzzle brake, which increased the submachine gun's overall length by 55 mm. The revised version was designated KP/-31 SJR (suujarru, or ""muzzle brake""). Aimo Lahti was displeased with this revision, believing that it decreased muzzle velocity and reduced the weapon's reliability, and even sought in vain to have the muzzle brake's designer court-martialed. Ultimately, roughly half of the KP/-31s in Finnish service were of the SJR version. Initially the KP/-31 was issued as a substitute for a light machine gun, and proved inadequate in this role. Instead, soldiers learned by trial and error how to use submachine guns to the best effect. By the time of the Continuation War, Finnish doctrine had been altered to include both a KP/-31 and a light machine gun (usually a captured Degtyaryov DP) in every infantry squad, and by 1943 this had been expanded to two KP/-31s per squad. KP/-31 production continued with the intention of adding a third sub machine gun to each squad, but this plan was shelved in 1944 when the Continuation War ended.."

Will meet the first 8 hours of training required for IL.*
Taking our class now will automatically put you on the waiting list for our IL specific class (second 8 hours) when we become IL certified.
IL residents will need other state permits like AZ or FL to carry outside of IL since IL won't have reciprocity agreements.*
It is a good idea to have more then one CCW permit due to changes in reciprocity.
Reciprocity is when one state agrees to honor another states permit, meaning you can then carry in another state.

CCW applications will be available at class

About the class-
Classroom and Range are at the same location.

Try out some different calibers/guns before you buy one.

FOID not needed to take the class as long as you are not a prohibited person, if you could legally own a gun but are waiting for your FOID card then you can take the class.
You do need a FOID if you transport your own guns/ammo to class.

A minimum of 50 rounds is required, please bring more, we try to shoot 75-100 rounds or more if possible.
We like to shoot.

What the Class covers-
Firearm Safety, this is first and foremost a firearm safety class, the only way to fail is to be dangerous on the range/classroom.

9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9mm NATO, 9mmx19mm (all the same round, just different names.
9x18 or 9mm Makerov different ammo and I've seen people buy it for their 9mm Parabellum guns and it wouldn't work.
There are many more ammunition differences to watch out for, like 45 ACP vs 45 GAP vs 45 Colt.

Shooting stances- Isosceles, Weaver, Single handed and proper grip.
