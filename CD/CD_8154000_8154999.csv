This is the reason for .40s&w being chosen as it is ""THE"" cartridge for Limited. I know without a shadow of a doubt this gun has no more than 200rds through it total. It's essentially brand new and not even broke-in. It runs and functions great, feels great in the hand and shoots better than I can. It's box-stock with exception only to a HiViz fiber optic front sight I installed (original included) and an extended mag release. I am also including 3 MEC-GAR anti-friction coated full size 12rd mags for the SP01-40/CZ75, all 5 have MEC-GAR Plus-2 base pads making them 14rd'ers. I put MEC-Gar Plus-2 pads on the OE mags too. Also includes a VPS custom Kydex competition holster on a Tec-lok belt attatchment. Its a really nice shooter, stout all-steel construction which does a good job taming .40S&W. Many CZ parts fit these clones and there is also a good amount of product specific aftermarket support for these guns. Check out Cajun Gun Works for the cool aftermarket goodies. Only looking to sell it to make room for other projects and need the cash. I can ship from my FFL to the FFL of your choice at the buyers expense provided it's not a restricted state. Thanks for looking!"

Everyone's happy! Especially my girlfriend, she's getting rather tired of this expensive 'hobby'. Oh well, lets get on...   Per MagpulAR-15 MilSpec Stock - Storage Type, Restricted:https://www.magpul.com/products/str-carbine-stock-mil-specBasically perfect condition, installed once and shot for roughly 200 rounds. Never 'mortared' or butt stroked anything, hasn't even been shot prone off the ground - as you can see from the photos the butt pad is completely fresh.I can confirm that this WILL FIT Vltor A5 buffer tube and fully collapse. I have an A5, it fits almost perfectly flush with the castle nut. This is a MilSpec stock, so if you got duped on a 'bargain' AR and don't know if it'll work, try somewhere else. If you run an AR-10, AK, etc this will also fit if you have an AR-15 tube.The battery tubes in the cheek piece are indeed rattle free with batteries installed, but tragically a .223 boresnake won't quite stuff inside. Fits AA and CR123 batteries, but not 18650s. Magpul was clever enough to include a buffer to stop rattling, but not smart enough to see the coming rechargeable 18650s...The stock itself has a single QD swivel (with limited rotation! Gasp!) as well as slots for traditional two point slings. The friction lock is what sets this version apart from the MOE and other similar stocks like BCM and B5 - it's simply fantastic. It'll lock up tighter than Congress during a filibuster, but snaps right open when you press the lever to adjust length of pull. The weight is good - almost enough to balance out my MedCon 14.5"", so a Gov't 16"" should be perfect unless you run a suppressor.I'm not looking for much right in the way of trades right now, but PM me and I'll take a look. I will definitely ignore you if your price/trade is a ridiculous low ball, otherwise I respond within a day, usually hours.

The rifle will come with a scope rail already installed and that saves you a couple bucks! Here is some information that I found on the Hell's Canyon Rifle: The best factory bolt-action hunting rifle just got better. The X-Bolt Hell's Canyon Speed rifle is built to exceed your accuracy expectations, straight from the box. The action and stiff, fluted barrel are bedded and free floated to ensure straight shooting. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and is easily removed and replaced with a thread protector that is included in the box with this rifle. In place of traditional bluing, a Cerakote Burnt Bronze finish was chosen. Not only does it look great, the flat finish aids in concealment. Cerakote is also tougher than other firearm finishes to keep this rifle looking its best for years to come. Very light to carry yet with heavyweight performance. The lightweight composite stock makes this rifle easy to carry; and the A-TACS AU camo is versatile enough to blend into nearly every background. An Inflex recoil pad tames the recoil of even the most savage magnums by redirecting recoil down and away from your cheek. The features just keep coming. The RECEIVER is Steel and has Cerakote® Burnt Bronze finish; Glass bedded; Drilled and tapped for scope mounts. The BARREL is a Heavy Sporter with deep fluting and the barrel has the same Cerakote® Burnt Bronze finish. The barrel is Free-floating and Hand chambered and has a Target Crown. The Bolt-action has a 60° bolt lift. Adjustable Feather Trigger and Detachable Rotary magazine. Top-tang safety for easy on/off use and a Bolt Unlock Button.

Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16’s unique design.

The SOCOM 16 starts with a specially-engineered 16 inch barrel that is mated to the gas system with a proprietary muzzle brake. Shoot the SOCOM 16 and you’ll be double-checking the stamping on the barrel, because you’ll have a hard time believing that you’re shooting a .308. The muzzle brake reduces felt recoil and keeps muzzle rise so flat that follow-up shots with a caliber this powerful have never been so easy. The enlarged ghost ring aperture rear sight and XS Tritium Insert in the front sight give you the quick target acquisition capability you want and need under any conditions. If your mission calls for optics, the SOCOM 16 features Springfield Armory®’s forward scout-style Picatinny mount. Of course, the SOCOM 16 also has the legendary performance and reliability that M1A™ shooters have come to love and expect."

I have used these in many semi auto 22's simply by dropping them in the breach. I did not load them through a tubular magazine. Great for pumps and better for single shots. This is Parlor ammo. Meaning you could use this inside your home to practice. A cap with a slight charge and a conical projectile. Very fun to plink with. Extremely hard to find. Super quiet , the longer the barrel the quieter the sound. If you know anything about these then you know they are extremely hard to find and equally over priced. Buds has them for over $54 a can. Most other stores if they're still in stock, are even higher. When I worked in the heating and air field I would keep a derringer in my tool bag just for the unexpected opossum whenever I would crawl under a house. Pellet Guns shoot harder then these Floberts do that's why it's safe to use inside the home. ( PRICE IS PER 1 TIN OF 100rds EACH)"
