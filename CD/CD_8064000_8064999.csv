It is all loose and mixed between lake city, federal and Winchester roads. I will not dive in to look and see how many of each I have or if they are stamped .308 or 7.62 because it would take forever and I don’t have the time or energy or mental capacity for such a task. So please do not ask as you will be ignored. I am looking to trade these for .45 ACP ammo. I know I’m not going to get what I paid for it, but I’m willing to value it low at about $0.60ish a round. So with that in mind, I’d trade 1 of my .308 rounds for 2 of your .45 ACP ammo. I just looked at field and stream, Walmart, Dunham’s, Cabelas, and rural king and can get cheap .45 target ammo for around $15.99 a box of 50 which is $0.32 a round. So if you are interested in making a deal, I’d trade up to 500 rounds of my .308 for 1000 rounds of your .45 and I will only accept factory loaded brass ammo. Sorry not interested in wasting my time to meet to trade for anything less than 500 rounds of .45call or text is preferred anytime at REDACTED and please leave a message if I don’t answer.

The unique design of the spring loaded rear sight, ensures constant battery action and repeat zero. The sight is held in the locked down position by a quick release lever, that prevents the sight from being accidentally engaged, but is as fast as a trigger to release even with arctic mittens. Flip up rear sight uses the standard A2 rear sight apertures. The initial elevation zero utilizes the standard M16/M4 front sight bead. Other type rear iron fold-down sights require the shooter to push it into position, which means they can be accidentally knocked down at the worst time. The A.R.M.S. spring loaded flip-up sights never let you down, because they're designed to always be there even when going thru brush or being dropped.

This model has the 16.5 inch heavy threaded barrel and Hogue rubber over molded stock in Gillie Green. Not only does this feature give a solid positive grip in any hand placement for the shooter but it also acts as a sound deadner for tactical and hunting applications. It is currently topped with a NC Star 2.5-12×40 scope featuring a 30mm body, target style turrets, and dual illuminated mil dot reticle. The scope is mounted with a one piece Leopold scope base and 30mm Leopold rings. I also have the 6 lug rings that came with the scope for mounting to a picitiny rail if you choose to mount this scope on a different rifle or choose a different picitiny base on this rifle. I also have 187 rounds of mixed ammo for the rifle. All ammo is factory loaded, no hand loads, and this rifle has never fired a hand load. It blows my mind what some guys are calling a ""sniper rifle"" on here these days. This is a true factory purpose built sniper rifle. It is very accurate out to 300 yards. It' very likely it will do just as well at longer ranges, I just haven't had the opportunity to shoot it any farther.  With everything listed I just sat down and added up what I have spent on the whole package. I'm consertively $1250 into it. I say consertively because I'm not pulling the normal BS of adding in taxes, shipping, and rounded down to the nearest 10 from what I actually paid. Not the highest price I could find on the internet or judging from high priced auction sites like gunbroker. I really prefer to just cut out the middle men and trade directly to what I list below. But because of all the ""how much cash"" emails I've received, I will entertain serious cash offers."

The Lancer Systems L5 AWM Magazine is a polymer and steel hybrid that combines the best features of each material. The one-piece steel feed lip unit is permanently fixed to the polymer body. The steel is hardened so the dimensions will not change in long term storage or rough use. The PTFE coating ensures the steel will not rust. The polymer body is designed with an internal dimension that is a constant curve, combined with a no-tilt follower for maximum reliability in feeding 5.56x45mm NATO ammunition. The steel feed lip assembly and the polymer body are corrosion and chemical resistant. The floor plate slides off similar to a USGI magazine for cleaning and maintenance.
