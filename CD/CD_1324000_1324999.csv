Fantastic fit Polish AK-74 firing the 5.45x39 cartridge, much better build quality than those built by Century Arms. 14.5"" Chrome-lined barrel with removable muzzle brake and side-folding wire stock.  This rifle is lightly used.  No wear marks other than by safety selector switch and near sling attachment points.  Side-folding wire stock locks up tightly, no magazine wobble.  I have only fired 120-150 rds out of the gun.  Action is smooth, trigger break is clean, recoil lighter than nearly all .223/5.56 rifles I have shot.  Almost no muzzle rise due to light cartridge, muzzle brake, and sturdy steel frame.  I will be selling all of my ak-74 accessories and ammo with this rifle including:

4 thirty round magazines.  Two polish steel surplus magazines, two tapco magazines.
1 ten round magazine for shooting from bench rest.
1 Polish surplus magazine pouch (holds four thirty round magazines)
1 Bakelite spare pistol grip
1 Green nylon surplus sling (I believe it is Russian, not certain though)
1 Uninstalled cheek-weld riser bar

40 rds 60gr Hornady V-Max (Non-Corrosive)
~90 rds loose 7n6 Russian surplus 5.45x39 (Corrosive)
720 rds 60gr Silver Bear FMJ (600 boxed, 120 loose) (Non-Corrosive)

I have only put two magazines of corrosive ammo through the barrel, and have cleaned it thoroughly after every shooting session. Most of the ammo shot out of this rifle have been the cleaner shooting hornady's and silver bears.  The cheek weld riser bar included will make for a much more ergonomic wire stock (when installed), and does not interfere with folding the stock at all.  Chrome-lined barrel is important for firearms that may be fed with corrosive ammo.  Rifle has been dead-reliable as any ak should be.  This rifle DOES NOT keyhole like some of the earlier Century Arms builds have been reported to.  Very accurate and flat shooting.

14,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1324014,For Sale/Trade:  Matched pair of Colt Derringers .22,"Trenton,il, Southern Illinois, Illinois",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, July 21, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,This is a matched pair known as Lord and Lady. They have sequential serial numbers (DER suffix) and are in good condition. These originally were firing models but somewhere along the line they were rendered non- firing. I had a gunsmith look at them and he said the hammers had been shortened so as not to strike the round. There also was a pin and spring of sorts in the barrels that had  been removed which causes the barrels not to lock in place. His opinion of condition was 60-70% overall. These would be worth near $500 IF they hadn't been modified. If you have a set of these with some crappy pieces this set may be what you need. I would rather trade for something rather than sell. I realize these are only worth what someone is willing to give for them

The bolt handle is mounted in an ergonomically perfect position just above the trigger guard. Rifle and eye remain focused on the target, the hunter gains time to aim exactly and ensure a perfect shot. ""Blind"" magazine exchange The magazine buttons are positioned above the trigger guard and can be operated „blindly“. When pushing both buttons at the same time, the magazine releases directly into the shooter‘s hand. If required, a second loaded magazine can be inserted within a split second. The magazine is loaded by pushing in cartridges from above, so that pushing the cartridges under the magazine lips is not necessary. Thus, the magazine can be loaded easily, even when it is inserted into the rifle which is a huge advantage for active hunters. Magazine capacity: caliber group Mini: 5?+?1 Standard: 4?+?1 Magnum: 3+1 Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot. The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs. Superior barrel bedding Cold hammer forged barrels and chambers provide superior quality and utmost accuracy. The barrel is embedded in the massive R8 action. Distortion of the wooden stock caused by dry or wet conditions does not affect the point of impact. Even when exchanging the barrel, the R8 barrel bedding provides optimum repeating accuracy Blaser Radial Locking System Extremely strong consentric locking directly to the barrel without rotary motion. Besides barrel bedding and quality, the Blaser radial locking system contributes decisively to unsurpassed accuracy. Success Factor: The stock Different from some traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. Due to the increased muzzle stability the felt recoil is substantially reduced. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Manual Cocking System The R8 offers the capability of safely stalking with a round in the chamber without any chance of discharge due to the innovative manual cocking system. Without the need to move your hand from the pistol grip you can silently push the cocking lever forward allowing the firing pin and spring to be cocked, ensuring a shot at a moments notice. To de-cock the system simply push the cocking lever forward with slight downward pressure and the lever will return to the neutral position removing all tension to the firing pin spring. For the past half century the Blaser manual cocking system has been recognized as one of the safest systems in hunting rifles.No conventional safety system can surpass the uncocked firing pin spring. To safely open the bolt, simply move the cocking lever forward until you meet the first resistance (about 3 mm?/?1/8“) to unlock the bolt handle"

If shipping through an FFL is not insured enough or receiving your payment through paypal is not also enough for you to know that once your payment is confirmed your rifle will be shipped then I will advise you pass.

Not a mile long 91/30...

-This is an early 1955 model and as all early T53's it is a mix of Soviet parts and chicom (no #'s matching) w/swing'in spiker bayonet. 
-It has strong rifling and does not swallow a bullet, the bore is a little dark. 
-The exterior is..well working condition-not pretty, but it shoots just fine. 
-I checked the head spaced this and shot it years ago and it was just as good as any of my other M44/T53's. 
-The triggers on the T53's are actually quite good, better than a Russian 
-You know this is cheap fun and ammo is in stock at Cabelas! 

This guy would be a great canidate for a ATI composite stock and a finish strip and re-cold blue. 
OR 
Leave it alone, put it behind your seat of your truck. When you run out of ammo, throw the SOB with the bayonet extended as a F'in spear! (ok, maybe not)

$115. This is cheap enough, dont make me an offer - it'll go BACK into the safe..

NOTICE, this picture is actually quite flattering. This stock has some gouges and the metal is pitted! I just don't want any surprised buyers, remember this is NOT a $200 T53, it's a $115 beater!

The Ruger 10/22 is a black synthetic stock carbine model with a blued barrel. I bought it and polished the bolt, drilled a hole for a cleaning rod (very neat work) and installed studs for a sling/bipod. I also installed a set of TruGlow fiber optic sights. I fired the rifle 10 times just to sight the new sights in on paper. Comes with original box and everything just like it would from the store. Spotless and clean inside and fully went through.

•If you intend to reload cases fired in others guns, or you are reloading for more than one gun select the Deluxe Rifle die set. The Deluxe set includes a full length resizing die that allows you to restore any case to factory original dimensions so that you can fire form in your gun and then reload using the superior Collet neck sizing die.
•The Lee Deluxe Die Set is the most flexible and accurate die set available. The Lee Collet neck sizing die is enhanced by the addition of the patented Lee full length resizing die, which allows you to produce ammunition to factory-new specifications using cases fired in other guns. Your precision fire-formed brass can be used to reload the most accurate ammunition for your gun using the Lee Collet neck sizing die. No other die can produce more accurate ammunition. We are so confident, we guarantee it.

We’re honored he used the Lee Collet Die to load his record setting ammunition. World record breaker Robert Frey commented : “The Lee Collet Neck Sizing Die enables me to get top accuracy from my rifles (match and hunting). The design principle of sizing the case neck to a mandrel is unmatched for accuracy potential by any other dies. It is one of the best ways to make all of my rifles shoot their tightest groups.”

Do you want extreme accuracy and increased foot pounds of energy out of your.223 caliber Saiga?  If so, then you want this baby.  We have a few different Saiga Rifles in the 20"" barrel configuration.  Why get a 20"" barrel?  Well typically the longer barrel provides a longer site radius and greater accuracy as well as slightly increased velocity and foot pounds of generated energy.  They also have slightly less bullet drop over a longer range making for a flatter trajectory.  Same great fit and feel as the standard length Saiga, but with a 20"" barrel.

info on gun... After WWI the newly formed Marlin Firearms Corporation started the serial numbers all over again. If your gun's barrel is marked, ""Marlin Firearms Corporation"" it is made in the mid to late 1920's. If it is marked, ""Marlin Firearms Co."" it was made in the early 1920's. If it has this same Marlin Firearms Co. marking on the barrel, but also has the ""bullseye"" in the buttstock, it is post1924-1930 era. All Marlins marked ""Model '93"" on the top tang were made after WWI. The catalogs designated the change from 1893 to '93 in around 1905, but too many receivers with the early marking were already made up, so the new stamped 93 after WWI"

691,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1324691,For Sale/Trade:  GECO Flare Pistol package - German quality impossible to find,"Valrico, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, March 24, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is a Geco 26.5mm all steel flare pistol. The Geco is made in Germany and was imported into the US in fairly limited quantities in the early 2000's. Sportsman's Guide and several other retailers sold them inexpensively then. However today they are nearly impossible to find. In my opinion the Geco is the highest quality, strongest and most interesting of all of these type pistols brought to US during the last 20 years. Many feel that the HK is a better pistol however I've owned both and unlike the Geco - the only steel part on the HK is the barrel as the entire frame is plastic.

This Geco is in original UNFIRED condition. Also included in this package is:

26.5 mm to .410/.45 Long Colt adapter that allows 2.5"" & 3"" .410 shotgun ammo or .45LC ammo to be safely fired.

26.5mm to 12 gauge adapter that allows the less expensive 12 gauge flares to be fired. This adapter cannot be used with regular 12 gauge shotgun shells and must never be attempted as the results would be catastrophic.

Original German flap holster that is weather resistant and has room to store the pistol, cleaning brush, 26.5mm ammo, .410 or.45 ammo & one or both adapters. Holster also has a shoulder carry strap attached.

26.5mm cleaning brush and nylon lanyard strap for pistol

(3) 5 round boxes 2.5"" .410 rifled slug ammo. (1) 25 round box of 3"" - 00 buck with 5 pellets per shell, & (1) 25 round box 3""  #7.5 shot (devastating close range defense load).

(2) 26.5mm white parachute illumination shells, (2) 26.5 mm Red Rain shells & (2) 26.5mm orange smoke shells.

(1) sealed 4 round package of Orion 12 gauge super red flares - expire July 2016

The last Geco I saw on Gunbroker was before Christmas and it sold for over $200 without accessories similar to what the HK's do when they come up for sale. So if you investigate and price everything included in this set - you'll see that my asking price is a bargain.

Price: $350 obo. Also this is a pickup item as shipping live flare shells is a hassle and it's costly. Also because this flare pistol becomes a real firearm when the .410 adapter is inserted you must be at least 21 to purchase."

935,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1324935,For Sale:  Noreen -- Bad s 300 WIN MAG-Picatinny forend rail,"colorado, Colorado, United States","$ 4,850","Listed On: Saturday, March 23, 2013",Rifles,Knights Armament                                                                                ,300 Winchester Magnum                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"NOREEN BAD NEWS .300 WIN MAG !!!!

Noreen has created the ONLY SEMI-AUTOMATIC .300 WIN MAG and .338 Lapua on the market. The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.

The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot.

This piston-driven system is unlike any other AR-10 on the market. The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action.

The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action.

The weapon easily disassembles like the standard AR for quick and easy cleaning and reassembly. The piston system drastically reduces fouling, and no venting means no holes for dirt and other contaminants to enter the system.

The full-length Picatinny rail on the receiver will allow you to mount scopes, lights, lasers, bipods, bayonets, etc. The adjustable cheek rest stock option is an added upgrade free bonus.

The innovative Noreen Bad News 300 WIN MAG provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. The Noreen 300 WIN MAG weighs only 13 pounds, and it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. This rifle comes with a custom muzzle-break and semi-auto action that significantly suppresses recoil. In the AR tradition, the Bad News 338 Lapua disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reasembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle seamless. This Noreen includes an ultra-heavy duty Plano case, which is far superior to a pelican style case. 100% Made in the USA.
