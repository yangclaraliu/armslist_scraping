Very fine historical gun. Owned by Pinkerton Detective Agency employee George Bangs. Mr. Bangs was Allan Pinkerton’s right hand man. He was one of the first employees to the agency and became the General Superintendent of the Pinkerton Detective Agency. This meant he was the man in charge who ran the business. The Pinkerton Detective Agency while a private company, was almost an unofficial Government Agency that acted as The Secret Service, FBI. The agency did everything from thwarting attempts on President Lincoln’s life to breaking up Union riots to having the shootout with the “Wild Bunch” to pursuing Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and much more in between. The Pinkerton Detective Agency was the very first private detective firm. Pinkerton became known to criminals as “The Eye” which led to the term “Private Eye” and then became Private Investigator. A picture of an eye and the words “We Never Sleep” was the logo of The Pinkerton Detective Agency. This revolver is a first model Remington Smoot revolver. The gun is in new condition with nickel finish and a gold plated cylinder. This gun has beautiful pearl grips that have an escutcheon on the left hand side that has the name “George Bangs”. The case has a silver escutcheon in a banner on the lid with the eye and the agency motto of “We Never Sleep”. This is a fantastic historical set! Along with this gun comes a binder of research into Mr. Bangs along with pictures and correspondence between the previous collector and The Pinkerton Detective Agency.http://www.collectorsfirearms.com/pinkerton-detective-agency-employee-owned-cased-remington-smoot-revolver-ah4667/"

Ed brown puts out a smaller number of 1911s than the other big name custom makes and has a strong commitment to quality. These firearms are custom build from the ground up providing a way better shooting experience than any production 1911 like Kimber, Sig, Colt, Springfield, etc. This gun is guaranteed to have a 2"" spread at 25 yards. It is amazing to shoot. From the frame details all the way to the trigger everything is quality. This firearm costs $3200 to get it with all the options like the two tone custom color scheme, trijicon night sights, lighter trigger, etc. This is one of the few times you'll see one of these up for grabs. I got this for a surprise for the wife, who loved it but prefers to carry a 9mm. A gun this expensive shouldn't sit around in my opinion so here it is up for sale/trade.  It comes with 2 Ed Brown 8 pack mags and 2 Wilson combat mags also with the classic Ed Brown Carry case.  Open to multi gun trades, high end items and cash offers. Not looking for any 9mm rifle builds, 22 calibers or bolt action hunting rifles. Open to all offers so feel free to ask questions. Thanks!"

If you’re seriously interested in it and would like to check it out, feel free to message me and you can see and use this puppy in person. Ammo taken care of by yours truly! Some uneducated individuals apparently don’t know what a scam is. I’m literally inviting you to to try before you buy... haha! But yeah, this is totally scam alright. I mean my IP shows up on this website as coming from Africa, my grammar is god awful, and I totally only put a 5 word description for a brand new Glock 19 at $250. Yup... you caught me! Other individuals like to constantly try and argue with me about the legality of it. I like how you haven’t even seen or used it and claim to know more about it than I! Lmao! But that’s the norm these days; moronic egotistical men with anger issues acting like they know everything and blowing off steam by trying to create arguments so they can feel like a “Big Man”. They don’t even know how to spell!!! HAHAHAHA you guys are killin’ me! Copy and paste old Ad... :) So I’m letting go of a HIGHLY tuned AR-9 Pistol. It shoots just as fast as full auto while remaining fully controllable and COMPLETELY LEGAL! It’s only (1) round fired per trigger pull. It’s built of extreme quality parts and is WORTH EVERY PENNY! The trolls tried to tell everyone that this is a thousand dollar build... LMFAO!!! No buddy, it’s not PSA. Before you try to sit here and tell me it’s illegal, no... it’s not. I’ve done extensive research and talked to and SHOWED it to all the right authorities. This is 100% legal. And NO... it’s not JUST a “binary trigger” (broseph). The speed you see is NOT EVEN USING binary function. Attaching a link to the video to see it in action. I posted It for $3,000 last time to basically bring the trolls out of hiding. People get all riled up when they see you post something They don’t like. They feel it’s their civic duty to post a Public Service Announcement and let everyone know that it’s overpriced... as if others can’t see the price for themselves. And because this Website is for posting your feelings and not your guns. I would realistically take $2,000 cash for this. Might be interested in trades. Trade value must be $2,200-2,300 or so. I like Sig Sauer, LaRue, LWRC, LMT, Lantac Raven, ETC. If you have something I may be interested in, just let me know. I can add cash to work something out. I won’t be rude if it’s not something that peaks my interest. You can of course join me at the range to use it before you buy it. You’ll have a blast, I promise! Here’s the link I promised you ;) Pause and click the highest playback quality. https://youtu.be/hS-Fdp9QMOA some people try to say “that’s 100% illegal” or “that’s not even the same gun.” you should read some people’s comments. They’re funny and uneducated. I have another video where you can clearly see the gun and see that I shoot at 3 different rates of fire all without moving the safety selector."

When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it     Finish: Stainless SteelCaliber: 454Casull, 45LC, 410GAGrips: Rubber with cushioned insertCapacity: 6Weight: 73ozBarrel Length: 6 1/2""Fiber Optic SightCome in and check it out in store at Gun Commanders on Cleveland Highway or visit online at www.guncommanders.com"

Any size female could also easily handle this pistol if one is looking for more stopping power for defense situations. For a full-size, 15+1 round capacity .40 caliber everyday carry pistol, it conceals just as well as a compact, is not bulky by any means, and doesn't print when concealed.The accuracy of this gun is phenomenal, and will put a hole where you put the sights at a easy 50yds+.It has ambidextrous safety, and clip release, also with the XDS style safety trigger, and loaded indicator on the top of the slide. It's equipped with a picatinny style rail under the barrel for a easy add on of any laser/flashlight combo you might want. The grip also features a reversible rubber strip on the back the allows you to chose a arched, or flat style grip choice which is very nice. I fell in love with this gun the moment I got it, but am looking to TRADE for a lower-end, used AR-15, AK, SKS, or maybe a bolt-action tactical style rifle with optics with a caliber of .223, 7.62, .308, .300 WIN, .270 or like caliber rifle.

This is the reason the black machine screws are sticking up. You can either hunt with the factory installed fiber-optics or purchase a scope for it.This is a fun gun to shoot; what makes this muzzle-loader even better than a new one is; When the Black Diamond in-lines first came out, they came with three interchangleable breeches; 211, #11 cap, anTherefore, this gun has all three so you can work around state regulations. This is a magnum in-line, it will shoot 150 grains of powder/pellets. Shooting a deer over 200 yards is not a issue with this gun, believe me. With the right scope, hunters are hitting elk with these in-lines at 250 yards plus.I have taken excellent care of this gun and have all the tools.I have more pictures if needed"
