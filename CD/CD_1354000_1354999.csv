Benelli Nova Pump, Black Synthetic, 12-Gauge 28 Inch Barrel

Back when everyone thought that the pump action shotgun couldn’t be improved, the Benelli Nova Pump proved otherwise. Completely original and innovative, the 12-gauge pump incorporates a polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics make the gun not only pleasing to look at, but a delight to hold and handle. Distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and forend in place of conventional checkering provides a positive gripping surface and complements the innovative engineering of the Nova Pump.

With dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, the Nova 12-gauge shotgun can handle anything from target loads to 3-1/2"" magnums. Black Synthetic, the Benelli Nova Pump is the most versatile pump action shotgun ever made"

I have a Glock 22 gen 2 with 2 15 round mags, night sights that are hardly glowing but they still glow some and a holster. I would like to trade for a different pistol/revolver. I have another Glock 22 that is a gen 3 so Im just seeing what kind of offers people have for me since I don't really need two.
There has been about 350 rounds through it so it shows a little wear but nothing crazy. There are no problems with the G22 at all. Shoots amazing.
Here are some ideas of what I might be interested in:
Anything to use as my carry pistol- My G22 is too big being a full size frame
Taurus Judge- Would really love to trade for a Judge
Any other Glocks
Walther
Beretta
FNH or FNX
LCR or Bodyguard
Maybe a pink gun for my girlfriend
Really open to ALL offers. The worst I can say is no. Im just looking for something different since I have a G22 already. Anything that is fun to shoot out at the range or use for my carry pistol.
I can text pics if needed. And if you have offers please text or email pics as well. I will meet up for an offer that I would really like.
Thanks a lot in advance for the offers.

Here's the description from Sig:

The P250® Tactical takes the P250 Compact in 9mm and adds All Terrain Digital Camo, threaded barrel and three magazines. The pistol ships with a Holster and Double Mag Pouch in Flat Dark Earth in a matching pistol case. The P250, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250’s innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism (the frame) and place it into the polymer grip of choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size (subcompact, compact and full), and after any change, the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also theres a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style.

This is Spikes' top of the line complete 5.45 upper and it includes the Magpul MOE Forearm and Nickel Boron BCG. This is an AWESOME upper that shoots an AWESOME round. 5.45x39 is arguably more effective and more accurate than .223/5.56, yet can easily be found for 19 cents per round during the madness that we call the current gun market. 

DESCRIPTION:
“Spikes Tactical complete 5.45x39 caliber 16"" Upper Receiver Group. This is a Corrosion Resistant Upper that features a Melonite finish inside and out. Features include a Lothar Walther Barrel with Nickel Boron M4 Extension, Melonite coated F-marked FSB, Melonite coated Gas Tube (stainless roll pin), Melonite coated A2 Flash Hider, and Nickel Boron coated Bolt Carrier Group. The upper is designed to chew through cheap surplus ammunition.”

Watch this guy shoot 2800 rounds through one of these uppers without lube and without cleaning, before he gets consistent failures. He then adds just 1 drop of oil to the cam pin of the BCG, and continues shooting fine... Most 223/556 rifles wont do this, much less one that eats corrosive surplus ammo for breakfast, lunch, and dinner ;)

Stock # MSH230915SP. Serial # K49xxx. Another great addition to Jackson Armory’s growing inventory of Colt Pythons and other Colt “Snake Guns” (see our other listings) this is a fairly RARE Colt Python Silhouette. Designed, obviously, for competition silhouette shooting, the Silhouette, made only in 1983, is chambered for .357 Magnum, has an 8” barrel, and it originally came fitted with a Leupold 2X pistol scope. Looking somewhat like the Python Hunter, the scope mounting area on the barrel’s vent rib is in a different position than the Hunter, and the barrel is marked “Python Silhouette” on the left side. This pistol does not come with the scope. It has a blue finish, Colt factory wooden checkered grips, and a factory red ramp front sight. The pistol may have been refinished, certainly there are areas where it has been “touched up,” and there is minor freckling and service marks here and there, especially on the left side of the receiver –this was a “working gun,” not a “safe queen!”. Overall finish condition is about 85%"

As the spent casings are ejected from the front, this rifle is an ambidextrous, CQC assault-rifle (unique foward ejection enables both right hand and left hand firing without changing bolts, ejectors or ejection ports). The use of modern polymers makes it highly resistant to impacts, and immune to corrosion."

Highlighting the revolvers are meaningful symbols from the history of Sturm, Ruger & Company and portraits of founders William B. Ruger and Alexander Sturm.  The detail on this edition is meticulous with subtle features displaying extraordinary clarity.

The Premier version of our Tribute include important events and motifs honoring Sturm, Ruger & Company, and its founders, Wm. B. Ruger and Alexander Sturm. Pistol comes with an unfluted cylinder.  This allows our craftsmen to use the cylinder as part of their canvas in producing the art honoring William Ruger and the firm he founded.  
Pistol has portraits of Wm. B. Ruger, Alexander Sturm and the trademark of Sturm, Ruger, & Co., Inc.  In addition, each pistol pictures the handsome sculpture of a father showing his son how to use a gun, commemorating Mr. Ruger's lifelong dedication to the safe and responsible use of firearms.
The left side of the frame features the letters RGR, which is the company's symbol on the New York Stock Exchange, where Ruger stock has been traded since 1990.  On the right side, the states of Arizona, Connecticut, and New Hampshire are depicted to honor the locations of Sturm, Ruger & Company's manufacturing facilities and corporate headquarters.  Wm. B. Ruger's distinctive signature completes the decoration.
The grips feature Sturm, Ruger's trademark medallion inlaid on each side.  Mr. Ruger authorized the use of the original red medallions for this special Tribute, making the revolvers particularly striking.

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

    Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
    Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
    Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
    Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
    Includes binoculars!

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights.

The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

• Massive .500 S&W Magnum® Cartridge - 2600 ft/lb. Muzzle Energy
• A Hunting Handgun For Any Game Animal Walking
• Removable High Efficiency Compensator
• HIVIZ® Red Dot Interchangeable Front Sight

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun."
