FREEDOM MUNITIONS inspects all cartridge cases for defects. The Scharch Range Master machines are fully automated and cases are checked for any debris and pressure tested for any splits or cracks. Primers are removed, flash holes are cleared, and primer pockets are reamed to accept new primers.

FREEDOM MUNITIONS then washes cases in an acid wash specially designed to remove all remaining burnt powder from the flash hole and interior of the case which tumbling doesn't remove. Then cases are tumbled in a dryer for a factory look and finish.

FREEDOM MUNITIONS roll sizes all cases on our own designed machines to meet S.A.A.M.I.specification. This method is the industry standard for commercial sizing, insuring the case wall is sized down to the rim which insures new component performance.

FREEDOM MUNITIONS then loads these processed components on the same fiber optic-controlled Ammo Load machines as our premium new ammo. These are the same machines used by some of the largest manufacturers in the industry. These machines assure S.A.A.M.I. specifications for priming depth, pressure and overall cartridge length.

FREEDOM MUNITIONS ""Like-New"" manufacturing process with the new projectile, powder and primer assures factory ammo performance that discriminating shooters expect.

I've got 500 rounds (10 boxes of 50) for sale. This has been kept in an ammo can, indoors. This ammo was purchased around January of this year, so it hasn't been sitting long. I'm just trying to consolidate calibers. I've personally shot about 200 rounds of this stuff, and it's great for the range.

I am firm on my price. No trades welcome. You must be willing to meet somewhere in Geauga County. You must be over 21 and show proof. You must be legally able to purchase/own ammunition."

I am currently not so busy and ready to sell this firearm. Since the last add I have taken it to various retail stores in the area, and gotten the firearm appraised. All the retailers agree they would put it out on their shelves for 550-650. I therefore have set the price at $650 firm with the additional accessories. I would like to sell this ASAP (it is holding up other projects) and will only sell local face to face or through local FFL (will not ship).

Quoted previous post-

I have for sale, a Sig P226 West German. This was imported and sold in 1992. I have original documentation of sales to a local law enforcement agency. From what little I know about the history, I am the 2nd owner, as the officer who used it kept it and then sold it to a pawnshop, which I purchased it from.

The gun has holster wear, but functions flawlessly. The springs in both the magazine as well as pistol could probably do with replacement due to age (if you plan on using this as a carry weapon or self defense) but as a range toy it still works flawlessly. I have put 500 rounds of range 9mm through it without one hiccup.

It comes with original box
Hogue grips as well as original German grips
Original factory target
Import and sales paperwork (It did come through exeter)
3 pre-ban magazines (the original sig mags, dovetail pattern)
manual
1x box 9mm (50 rounds 115 grain FMJ)

Not pictured is the woven law enforcement style holster (leather).

As ammo is purchased, I will update quantities available.

Hello there,

Some time ago, I sold the only .40 S&W-chambered handgun I had, and I never got around to getting rid of the large amount of ammo I had accumulated for it. I'm selling cheap because I have no real use for the ammo. I'd rather sell it cheap and quickly than have it sitting around. Here's what I've got:

-Independence .40 S&W, 180 gr. FMJ, 50 rounds per box; 6 boxes available. $20 per box.
-Independence .40 S&W 165 gr. FMJ, 50 rounds per box; 16 boxes available. $20 per box.
-Winchester .40 S&W 165 gr. FMJ, 50 rounds per box; 10 boxes available. $22 per box.
-Winchester Supreme Elite .40 S&W 180 gr. Hollowpoint (personal defense ammo), 20 rounds per box; 1 box available. $25 per box.
-Magtech .40S&W 180 gr. FMJ, 50 rounds per box; 4 boxes available. $20 per box.

If you want to take all of the ammo, I will sell it all for $740, which saves you $25.

Rules of Sale:

1. Cash only, no trades.
2. Face-to-face transaction only.
3. Buyer must have valid Oregon DL that they are willing to show.
4. Buyer must be at least 18 years of age to purchase.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries."

The LWRC REPR is being currently deployed with U.S. and British troops overseas. The REPR is accurate enough that it is substituting for the bolt action sniper rifles in some multi role applications.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle. This rifle is the Sniper version which includes the Geissele trigger. To complete the system all you would need to get is a short barreled upper.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes a patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers."

Compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. 

Features
 •Compatible with all weapons that accept standard STANAG 4179 compliant magazines
 •Reliable functioning due to mechanical simplicity and high-quality non-binding coil springs—no lubricants required
 •Long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance
 •Easily seated in weapon with bolt forward
 •May be kept fully loaded for extended periods without spring fatigue
