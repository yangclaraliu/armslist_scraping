Buffer system was purchased from KAK with the Shockwave as a package. Castle nut is staked. * Mapgul MOE k2 FDE pistol gripAccessories:* YHM metal back-up sights. They have a precise and up-close aperature. * Aimpoint PRO with QD ratchet mount.* Streamlight pro-tac HL-X. Throws a very nice beam and floods well for short distance. It produces 1,000 lumens.  * Cloud Defensive Light Control System (metal housing to hold the pressure switch and manage the Streamlight cable). Probably forgetting other stuff. For those that don't know, the ATF recently ruled that a KAK shockwave can be shouldered and is adjustable in length. This is legally considered a pistol and will be sold as such. I will remove the foregrip to sell it as a pistol. However, it does measure more than 26"", meeting the ATF requirment for a foregrip (I think its 28.5"") if you want to add one later. I'll sell it bare-rifle and swap the BCG and charging handle to mil-spec parts if you want, or without these parts if you want to add them later. I have about $1,800 into it, with many of the parts being purchased on sale. Round count is 150-250 of quality brass, no malfunctions. Absolutely love the gun, just selling to fund another build. I'll include a magpul mag or a metal mag, your choice. I'd prefer to keep accessories but I'm open.I can send pictures and answer any questions!

Unlike many similar rifles, the receiver is milled from a single bar of steel, and combined with it's peerless barrel design, provides for ""unmatched accuracy from an out-of-the-box rifle."" Further enhancing the accuracy of this precision rifle is the X-Mark Pro adjustable trigger, set at 3.5 pounds. This model includes a tactical-style bolt knob and the hard-to-find Bell and Carlson Medalist Varmint/Tactical composite stock with OD Green/black webbed finish. The stock has an adjustable cheek piece, adjustable butt plate assembly, and the fore-end is tapered for minute elevation adjustments when shooting from a rest..This rifle was previously mounted with a Nightforce scope, which was sold previously, and the package now includes a Burris Eliminator III. This scope is BRAND NEW and was only mounted on the rifle for the photos. This ballistics laserscope is arguably the most sought-after long-range scope on the market, with a built-in laser rangefinder, automatic trajectory compensation and an integrated inclinometer.
