I purchased it used as an inexpensive way to get familiar with 1911s.  I have since purchased a higher end 1911 and this one must go.  It came to me with wear in all the normal places, and the idiot scratch pre-installed.  The slab sides , trigger, and safety, have all been polished.  The slide serrations and top are left with the original finish , giving a nice high-contrast look.   It has Pachmayer wood/rubber grips, a plastic case and 3 magazines.  1 factory and 2 Mecgar.  The factory mag has functioned flawlessly, the 2 mecgars have had some intermittent feed issues.  They seem to work better when down loaded by 1 round.  It has Heini 2 dot factory sights.  The gun is very accurate and fun at the range. The serial number puts the year of MFG at 2007.  Prefer text messages to 316-two90-9one32.  FTF Wichita only, must be 21+, Kansas resident, and legal to own a firearm.

Because the Hi Power is one of the most reliable pistols in any configuration, and field-stripping and assembly are as simple as it gets. The Hi Power’s grip might also be the most ergonomic of any handgun. Slim, trim and just about the perfect weight for carry, the Hi Power is almost perfectly balanced, with the barrel and slide weighing within an ounce of the frame. This, with the grip, makes the Hi Power one of the easiest-shooting, easiest-to-control 9 mm pistols in the world.

Why do you want *this* Hi Power?
This is a TRUE Browning Hi Power, made in Belgium by FN Herstal. S/N starts with 245PV - 1986 manufacture. Jim Garthwaite, renowned Pistosmith, performed the custom work on this Hi Power, and all the papers, both Browning & Garthwaite, are with the pistol. Since the Garthwaite wait time exceeds one year now, this is the only way for a shooter wanting a Garthwaite BHP to have one today.

This work was done in 1999: Novak rear sight. Dovetail front sight. C&S hammer, trigger, trigger job with frame to slide fit. Remove mag safety. Strip pistol, complete radius, soften & deburr. Re-Parkerizing. 

The barrel was replaced in 2000. Fitted, crowned, and the front sight got it’s dot. It’s worn a Wolff 18.5 recoil spring & buffer since ’99. They’ve both been recently replaced. No time on the spring. Buyer will recieve all springs, buffer, stock grip panels, and two good magazines."

This gun is the commercial version, and the 6th variant (there were six model variants?). The Ortgies pocket pistols were made (officially) from 1919 to 1924. This particular gun (according to the serial number) was made around 1922-23. The Orgies semi-automatic pistols were excellent, well made guns. The design was ahead of its time. This gun has the factory original 7rd magazine. Overall, this gun is in very good condition. Has all matching numbers (barrel, frame, slide). Bluing is in really good condition for its age (this gun is at least 90 years old). All original finish, not re-blued, or anything like that. Has factory wood grips. The grips has no cracks, splits, or damages. Has a few minor dents and dings. Barrel is in very good condition - has a few minor surface rust. Bore is in very good condition. Has a a few minor rust (the Germans or people back in the old days used highly corrosive ammo). In addition, there's an old Ortgies owner's manual. It's really worn out, tattered, but all the pages are there (but not intact - it looks like as old as the gun itself). I took this gun as part of a package gun trade, and I like German made guns, however, I need to sell/trade this pistol to get a revolver for my wife for her CCW. She prefers a 38 Special snub nose revolver. You must be at least 21 years old or older and have a valid Kentucky driver's license (KY CCDW) to buy/trade this gun. Local (Kentucky) sale/trade only. No shipping. Just email me with any questions. Serious enquiries only please. Thanks for looking.

-- Below is an excerpt from one of the Ortgies websites. It is not my own. I am just giving a credit to the author/creator of that particular website. You can do a google (or yahoo) search on this particular pistol on the internet. There are several Ortgies websites on line --

"" The Ortgies pistol has a number of unusual design features.  The most obvious is its grip safety which, once squeezed, stays in the “fire” position without further pressure of the hand on the grip.  A button on the left side of the gun allows the grip safety to pop back out.  Since the grip safety is powered by the striker spring, the safety can only be popped out, i.e., placed in the “safe” position, when the striker is cocked.  Hence, if the safety is enabled, the gun is cocked.  When the grip safety is enabled, the sear is prevented from moving downward and the tension on the striker spring is reduced.  Pressing the safety- enabling button also allows the slide to be lifted off the frame rail for disassembly.  The striker serves as the ejector. ""

200 rounds or so flawless function
  factory description: 
 The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.

Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson.  The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish and available in both 9mm and .45 ACP. Stopping power is not a concern.

If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed.

I have two 7 round mags for it, The gun has the original finish with the patina intact never been refinished, I have put only one mag of ammo through it since I have had it but it fired flawlessly.

It is a very well made copy of the Beeman R9 with a superb adjustable trigger, great accuracy and solid power (about 800fps w 15g pellets). This rifle came with a special hone/lube/tune job from Flying Dragon Air Rifles (a fellow named Mike Melick runs the shop). If you have been around any of the air rifle forums, you will know his name, which is synonymous with quality air rifles that shoot consistently and accurately. This is a high quality air rifle, not a cheap Walmart Gamo. Look at the photos and see how nice the metal work and wood is. The rifle will come with an extra spring, breech seal and cocking shoe. 

The rifle is in 'like new' condition. I've shot it very little over the last few years and it may only have 500 pellets fired through it. Despite its little use, I can consistently make 3/4"" or smaller groups at 20-30y distances. 

I'm asking $185 for this rifle alone, or I currently have a very nice Centerpoint 3-9x40AO scope mounted with Leapers mounts. I will include the scope for an extra $50. So, $235 for the rifle with scope mounted."

The 1907s were used in WWI by the Royal Flying Corps, French aviators (aerial observers) and by the US 1st Aero Squadron in support of General Pershing's troops in the Punitive Expedition. In the 1920's and 30's the M1907 was used by Police and Gangsters like Bonnie and Clyde and John Dillinger.
This particular rifle was the rare Police version with the larger mag release, front sling swivel and unique ""finger grip"" charging plunger. The non-Police versions have a round plunger end. You can see on the right side of the stock where the Police ID was removed.
The Rifle fires the powerful .351 Winchester round(still available on the internernet and through Buffaloarms.com. I have six or seven rounds with the rifle. It fires flawlessly from a factory 10 or two factory 5 round mags that come with the rifle.
To go along with this rifle's long history of Military, Police and Gangster use, I moded the rifle into a gangster carbine, as follows:
The Police identifiers on the stock were long ago removed, so I decided to create a Gangster version, which in fact actually existed. I skifully removed 2"" of the stock, which was ridiculously long from the factory! I removed three inches from the 19"" barrel, professionally threaded and crowned it and added a Thompson muzzle compensator.
I then had a special forend made so that I could introduce a Thompson foregrip inside the forend. I matched the forend with the stock perfectly!. The grip, does not match perfectly by design...they never did or would match as they were a Gangster mod. Has a period Thompson canvas sling.  The overall length is 35"". The original bluing is about 98% and is much brighter than my pics indicate. Where it looks worn is glare. This gun will make a great Gangster Wars period showpiece or re-enactor gun. It fires like the day it was made! It is a Beast! The .351 is equivilent to a .357 mag. ballistically.

Do not buy this from me if you have a Glock 17 or 19 that is not registered as a ""short barreled rifle"" with the ATF.  If you do not want to deal with registering with the ATF, owning this is only legal if you get rid of the short barrel to your Glock first.  I am no legal expert, but you could be charged with ""constructive possession"" or ""constructive intent"" by having all the parts for an SBR, even if it is not assembled.

MARKED DOWN FOR THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND!!

THIS GUN COMES WITH A LIFETIME REPLACEMENT GUARANTEE!!

Despite the small size of the SR22, the controls all have generous surface areas and provide good tactile feedback, so handling them is literally a snap. Lefties will appreciate that the magazine release and safety switches are both completely ambidextrous. 

The safety switch was nicely clicky and required just the right amount of thumb pressure to shift between the fire and safe positions. The location of the safety also worked great for me; I didn’t have to change my grip to switch back and forth from safe to fire, and I never accidentally tripped the switch.

The well-shaped and very comfortable grip is customizable. Ruger includes two grip sleeves in the box. With the smaller grip sleeve preinstalled, the SR22 fit my average-sized hand well. Ham-fisted shooters will want to swap the smaller sleeve for the larger.

The Henry Lever Action is a classic Western-style lever action rifle, and one of the most popular .22's on the market today. The reason for its popularity is because it shoots great, looks great and is remarkably affordable - about half the price of the competition's rifles.

The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself.

I installed a set of TechSight sights (Peep sight and thinner front sight post) which doubles the sight radius and really tightens up the groups at 100 yards.  I still have the original leaf style sights if you want to return it to original specs.  Included with the rifle are ten (10) Chinese military stripper clips, original sling and a 30 round extended magazine.

http://youtu.be/vclZSXQapCg
http://youtu.be/kHsfGWkO7SM
This is a little graphic: http://youtu.be/xYCq9pIB0sc

I bought it for $350 at that time. Since then the sword has been replaced by the tenchi model (just a different looking hand-guard). These swords are for some reason getting quite difficult to find. Locally impossible. A sword dealer at a gun show offered me $300 and said he would try to get a hundred out of it for profit.  

The only reason I am getting rid of it is that it has come to my realization that I have not practiced or performed any cuttings on milk jugs in the last 3 years. Since I have not been using I more than likely will not be using it anytime soon. Rather than selling it, I would much rather trade it for the items below. I don't have to get rid of it, I am just looking to see what I can get.

Awesome concealed carry gun but I have too many carry guns as it is and this one never gets shot. Maybe 50 rounds through it. I have an older one that I will not sell and love the accuracy and weight of these guns. The metal frame is easy to carry but adds the perfect weight for a comfortable recoil. For a small gun these are more accurate than most people would imagine...far superior to the LCPs of the world. I would do partial trade on a good home defense shotgun.
