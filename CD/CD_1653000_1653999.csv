Message from: REDACTED 
Message regarding: Pristine Condition Glock 19 with Trijicon Night sights, extra mags, in box
Message: Please Call REDACTED sent from my iPad

My response - Why am I calling you?
Todd asks me: Do you still have the Glock for sale? Sent from my iPad
My response - Yes, I was considering a shotgun trade, but it is still for sale at the moment.
Todd Castle to me:  Will you take $650?
Sent from my iPhone

I eventually responded - Yes, I will take $650. He asks how many rounds and what condition it is in. (There are pictures and the condition is listed as excellent.)

I tell him again. So he then re-offers $580.

If you get an offer from Todd Castle... REDACTED  in San Antonio, I'll give you a few tips.
1) He has an iPhone, iPad, and apparently the memory of a Goldfish.
2) He doesn't understand that accepting an offer is when you arrange to meet up to exchange for the agreed price
3) He can't figure out what city you are in, even though it was in your ad, and he looked through the ad.
4) He's probably not supposed to owning a firearm. He is probably mentally defective. 

You've been warned."

I have up to 400 round of this for sale..two lots of 200. Price is 75.00 per lot of 200. I will not ship---costs too much to make it worth your while. Only FTF with valid Illinois FOID and DL.

Don't be concerned about the plastic bags. Once polished the brass has been stored in the plastic bags in a controlled environment out of heat and humidity so there is no moisture buildup to cause tarnishing.

Payment by American greenbacks if face-to-face transaction or IF shipping it to you, then I'll accept only a USPS (Post Office) Money Order. 5-7 work days to clear before shipping the brass. 

No exceptions because technology allows faking documents too easy. I'm not selling to commercial vendors who buy brass by the pound. Only reloaders will find these prices attractive. I checked this past week, this is much better price than you can find at places like Cabelas."

Shipping is an additional $13, paid by the buyer. No trades. 

Don't be concerned about the plastic bags. Once polished the brass has been stored in the plastic bags in a controlled environment out of heat and humidity so there is no moisture buildup to cause tarnishing.

Payment by American greenbacks if face-to-face transaction or IF shipping it to you, then I'll accept only a USPS (Post Office) Money Order. 5-7 work days to clear before shipping the brass. 

No exceptions because technology allows faking documents too easy. I'm not selling to commercial vendors who buy brass by the pound. Only reloaders will find these prices attractive. I checked this past week, this is much better price than you can find at places like Cabelas."

Don't be concerned about the plastic bags. Once polished the brass has been stored in the plastic bags in a controlled environment out of heat and humidity so there is no moisture buildup to cause tarnishing.

Payment by American greenbacks if face-to-face transaction or IF shipping it to you, then I'll accept only a USPS (Post Office) Money Order. 5-7 work days to clear before shipping the brass.

I've been trying for over six weeks now with no luck. I have admittance of selling one of my guns for my asking price (over $2000) and yet to see any money, plus those things that may or may not of sold. 

Not one mention of ""hey we're closing down our business, come get you stuff"". But instead I find out the hard way like everyone else that has personal items there... A sign on the front door that reads ""closed for a family emergency"". Look at their Facebook page, no mention of anything closing down until someone posts on their wall ""where are you, I want my guns back"". 

Maybe you are in the same boat as I am in? Steve and Michael are just stringing you along telling you that your stuff will be shipped to you, and weeks later still nothing. Contact me if you want to join me in taking action against these individuals that show no intent in following through with getting what rightfully belongs to us. 

I have email after email, text after text with either no response back to those communication attempts or empty promises of ""things will ship, I'll get you a check, things are in storage, things got mixed up during the move, I'll replace your things"", ect... 

MOA... Maybe you have come across this listing and have had the chance to read this... Stop delaying in getting your consignment clients taken care of. Return to us our items we in trusted you to sell for us, and return to us the money you have received for those items that were sold.

Most likely what has taken place here is that items have sold, money has been spent, and bankruptcy will be filed. Why else the delay to hand over what you have that belongs to others? Because you probably do not have it any longer and you're buying your time to file for bankruptcy to protect yourself from the many lawsuits that are coming down the pike for you.

Shipping is an additional $6, paid by the buyer. No trades. 

Don't be concerned about the plastic bags. Once polished the brass has been stored in the plastic bags in a controlled environment out of heat and humidity so there is no moisture buildup to cause tarnishing. Primers need to be removed.

Payment by American greenbacks if face-to-face transaction or IF shipping it to you, then I'll accept only a USPS (Post Office) Money Order. 5-7 work days to clear before shipping the brass. 

No exceptions because technology allows faking documents too easy. I'm not selling to commercial vendors who buy brass by the pound. Only reloaders will find these prices attractive. I checked this past week, this is much better price than you can find at places like Cabelas."

-	150 Lumen foregrip with quick detach 
-	Phoenix Kick-Lite 6 position tactical stock (I can go through 12 rounds of 00 buck in a row and feel nothing, you’d think you were shooting a .410)  
-	3 inch breacher teeth MONSTER CLAW SMALL BRAKE, from Carolina Shooter     Supply
-	Carolina Shooter Supply Barrel locking nut

I’m ALSO including:
-	The 5 round factory mag
-	12 Round SGM mag
-	15 Round Pro-Mag drum

I'm asking 1200 which is a steal, especially with the given upgrades. I’m open to a BIT of negotiation but please spare me the low ball offers, this is priced to sell. Thank you for viewing my ad."

The Franchi I-12 represents a new line of Franchi auto-loaders by incorporating a free-floating bolt with the Inertia Driven System like the Benelli. This Franchi shotgun will handle anything from 1-1/8-ounce target loads to the heaviest 3"" magnums. The I-12's specially-designed recoil pad incorporates a two-part system called the Twin Shock Absorber. During firing, the TSA recoil pad initially holds its shape, and then deeply compresses with the recoil, soaking up the kick and spreading recoil energy over a wider area of the shooter's shoulder, reducing felt recoil by up to 44%.

VERY RARE DUE TO THE EXCEPTIONAL CONDITION THIS REVOLVER IS IN! For sale is a model 929 H&R- 9 shot .22LR with swing out cylinder, 4” barrel.  This is a like new pistol for being over 30 years old with all original parts and less than 50 rounds shot through it.  I believe it was manufactured in the early ‘80s.  The yellowish substance you'll see in two of the pictures is just grease for storage.  This gun has been in a climate controlled safe for the majority of it's life.  

It also comes with the belt holster described below.
-Vintage Safariland S&W #10 MD/FR Right Handed leather basket weave belt holster for double action revolvers with 4"" barrel.  It was manufactured in Monrovia California. It fits Smith & Wesson and similar type double action revolvers with up to 4"" barrels. All stitching and leather are in very good shape-it shows signs of use but no abuse and all 4 snaps work perfectly.  It’s in really good condition for its age which I know is over 30 years old.  It fits belts up to 2-1/4"" wide.  Email or text me if you'd like to see photos of holster.  

Please respond to this ad or give me a call if interested.  The value of both of these items combined, due to their condition, is much greater than $305FIRM but I priced the set this low just so it will move.  If you're even slightly interested at least take a look at them, it will be worth a few minutes of your time.

If you're looking at this ad then the gun is not sold!  I will take it down as soon as it is.

The most compact EOTech holographic weapon sight yet, the XPS/EXPS series runs on a single CR-123 battery, yet delivers up to 600 hours of continuous operation. These sights deliver all the fast, heads-up, both-eyes-open target acquisition of the traditional EOTech sight in an ultra-compact package. Overall sight length is less than 3¾"" because the battery is mounted crossways, at the front of the housing. Sealed, waterproof buttons let you activate the high-visibility red reticle and precisely adjust the brightness level for any ambient light conditions. Automatically shuts off after 8 hours (user may reset to 4 hours) to preserve battery life. Fully adjustable for windage and elevation in ½ MOA clicks. Non-magnifying, fogproof optics of shatter-resistant, anti-glare coated laminate provide exceptional clarity and unlimited eye relief. Base requires only 2¾"" of rail space; fits MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny or Weaver rail. Screw-on, O-ring sealed battery cap keeps out moisture (submersible to 10-ft. depth). Standard XPS models have rear-mounted control buttons. XPS2-0 model features a reticle with an easy-to-see 65 MOA circle with a 1 MOA aiming dot in the center. XPS3-0 is night-vision compatible with a night vision brightness range of 1,280:1 with NV switch engaged. Extreme-XPS3 (EXPS3) models are both Gen I-III+ night-vision compatible and feature a battery compartment positioned above the base so the sight can be mounted closer to the Delta ring. A slightly higher base positions the viewing window to co-witness with iron sights. Quick-release rail mounting system has a release lever that fits flush along the side of the sight, so the EXPS is no bulkier than the XPS. A locking tab prevents accidental lever release, yet enables easy intentional removal. Control buttons on the left side of the housing. EXPS3-0 has a 65 MOA circle/1 MOA center dot reticle.

Doing some more research this is a very good example of this AC41 in contrast to what is on the market, finish is closer to 95-97% Also, noting the magazine has an extremely rare double eagle 359 stamp on the spine.

I've been trying for over six weeks now with no luck. I have admittance of selling one of my guns for my asking price (over $2000) and yet to see any money, plus those things that may or may not of sold. 

Not one mention of ""hey we're closing down our business, come get you stuff"". But instead I find out the hard way like everyone else that has personal items there... A sign on the front door that reads ""closed for a family emergency"". Look at their Facebook page, no mention of anything closing down until someone posts on their wall ""where are you, I want my guns back"". 

Maybe you are in the same boat as I am in? Steve and Michael are just stringing you along telling you that your stuff will be shipped to you, and weeks later still nothing. Contact me if you want to join me in taking action against these individuals that show no intent in following through with getting what rightfully belongs to us. 

I have email after email, text after text with either no response back to those communication attempts or empty promises of ""things will ship, I'll get you a check, things are in storage, things got mixed up during the move, I'll replace your things"", ect... 

MOA... Maybe you have come across this listing and have had the chance to read this... Stop delaying in getting your consignment clients taken care of. Return to us our items we entrusted you to sell for us, and return to us the money you have received for those items that were sold.

Most likely what has taken place here is that items have sold, money has been spent, and bankruptcy will be filed. Why else the delay to hand over what you have that belongs to others? Because you probably do not have it any longer and you're buying your time to file for bankruptcy to protect yourself from the many lawsuits that are coming down the pike for you.

The triumphant advance of the smallest GLOCK pistol, specially developed for concealed carry and previously a domain of 5-round snub nose revolvers, started with the presentation of the GLOCK 26 in August 1994. The GLOCK 26 offers more than an alternative in this field. The magazine capacity of 10 rounds as standard and the highly accurate firing characteristics explain the worldwide distribution among security personnel and secret services.

Call or TXT Joe @ (602)3 six 1 seven 2 7 three or email
The Beretta PX4 Storm sub compact .40 S&W is the ""little brother"" to the full size PX4 Storm, with many of the same features. It also has an ambidextrous safety. It sports a technopolymer reinforced fiberglass frame, advanced ergonomics, and a modular concept that allows you to modify the pistol to suit your needs and modes of operation. The JXS4F20 model comes with two 10-round magazines, but will accept the 14 round magazines from the full size model. Model: JXS4F20 Caliber: .40 S&W Frame: compact Overall length: 6.2"" Overall height: 4.8"" Barrel length: 3.0"" Sight Radius: 4.5"" Overall width: 1.4"" Weight (unloaded): 26.1 ounces Magazine capacity: 10 rounds Beretta PX4 Storm Features: 1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. 2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions. 3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer. 4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc. 5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop. 6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol. 7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol. 8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use. 9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design. 10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer. 11. Barrrel: the Px4 Storm Sub- Compact uses a very reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system, providing a more compact and lighter weight system. A stainless steel barrel requires less maintenance and is corrosion resistant, perfectly suited for concealment close to active, perspiring bodies."

The FNS™-9 pistol has been developed around a pre-loaded striker mechanism, which provides a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots, ensuring fast and accurate shooting. Additionally, the polymer frame is designed with a low bore axis for reduced felt recoil and enhanced control. Each FNS™-9 pistol features a manual safety, trigger safety, firing pin safety, out-of-battery safety and a drop safety, ensuring maximized security. All operating controls are fullyambidextrous. The FNS™-9 has a low bore axis providing minimized perceived recoil for even higher accuracy. The handgun features a newly designed three-dot combat sights with deep rear sight notch which improves significantly the accuracy.
The two-piece trigger prevents the weapon from firing without a pressure on the trigger. The rear of lower trigger piece catches on the frame if the mechanism is moved without pulling the trigger.
Ammunition
The FNS™-9 pistol uses the current standard handgun 9x19 mm ammunition. The 9mm is one of the best rounds ever developed. It creates a low recoil, which allows for quick follow-up shots. The 9mm has a very high chamber pressure, which demands a high quality weapon, but that energy is used to propel the 9mm to a very high speed. Its high speed makes the 9mm useful at longer ranges and is thus very suitable for sub machine guns. The stopping power of the 9mm round, especially FMJ rounds, is moderate. However, it is quite effective in piercing objects and if necessary one can quickly fire a second round. The 9mm is quite small and allows for a high magazine capacity.
Accessories
Additionally, the pistol comes standard with a number of ergonomic features: ultra no-slip checkered grips for an improved grip, front serrations for press check and three interchangeable backstrap inserts for a customized fit. All operating controls are fully ambidextrous.

        Dual recoil spring assemblies
        Three backstraps included to customize fit

Glock's Gen4 series of semiautomatic pistols incorporate all the features and benefits Glock is famous for, along with upgrades to enhance performance and shootability. This series still boasts nearly indestructible polymer frames that are stronger than steel. Tenifer-coating on slides and barrels makes them as impervious to the elements as their predecessors. And Safe-Action-Pistol integrated safety features are still standard. Upgrades includes Rough-Textured Frames (RTF) to make them even easier to handle in extreme conditions. RTF improves Glock's all-weather performance when shooting with or without gloves. Each Gen4 includes three differently sized backstraps, so shooters can adjust the grips for a custom fit. Magazine-release buttons are larger and reversible to make them easier to operate for both right- and left-handed shooters. Dual recoil spring assemblies increase durability and reduce recoil and muzzle flip.
Available:

Gen4 Model 17 – An updated version of Glock's venerable 9mm Model 17 pistol. Enjoy standard Glock features with the added benefits of RTF, adjustable backstraps, dual recoil spring assembly and improved magazine releases. 17+1 capacity. Available with standard fixed sights or Glock night sights."

This gun is very customize-able. It has a 20 in barrel to help with accuracy and helps the barrel not get hot as fast so you can use it for a longer period of time. With this gun some of the cool features you could get upgraded are: you can replace the stock to get an adjustable one, you could take of the iron sights and get a nice red dot or a scope,change out the trigger and trigger guard for a better feel, get a new grip. Personally i would change the grip and stock on it so i could get a btter more comfortable feel. The armalite AR-15 is a great gun with the ability to be upgraded to your specifications or just be left how it isw and you will be getting a reliable and accurate firearm. Also with the Armalite Ar-15 is a Trijicon MOA Amber Triangle Reticle with A.R.M.S #15 Throw Lever Mount. The Trijicon’s technologically advanced Reflex sights offer shooters the perfect combination of speed and precision under virtually any lighting conditions.

From markings definitely not Russian capture, I was told it was a bring back. Great, smooth action. Nazi Swastikas have been scratched out, probably per orders upon surrender. I have not shot this on paper, but it has been reasonably accurate when shooting random stuff on the range. Ring securing top hand guard has loose tolerance and slides off easily (see pic)...this is a minor problem that a layer of tape where the ring goes will create a tight enough tolerance for it to stay on by itself..comes with a bag full of stripper clips, probably at least 20, some yugoslavian, some authentic german. I have been extremely happy with this rifle, just selling to create funds for other projects and it is also hard for me to find time in my schedule to go to gun shows to find reasonably priced ammo. Good shooter or wall hanger. Feel free to ask any questions. Santa barbara/ventura area ftf cash and carry preferred, shipping may be possible if i figure how to work it out . Price negotiable"

841,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1653841,For Sale:  2006 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon Unlimited,"Northeast, Houston, Texas","$ 24,500","Listed On: Tuesday, May 21, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am offering up for sale a fairly rare Wrangler – a TJ Rubicon Unlimited.
I am the second owner. At time of listing the mileage is 15,271. Obviously it is driven very little, and I’ve decided maybe I don’t need this.
I bought this in 2009 from a dealer in Gatesville, Texas. They were being shut down by Chrysler and I picked this beast up with 8,000 miles on it a day or so before they closed the doors. This jeep has never wrecked or abused.  Everything works well as like new. I have never had it offroad, although the previous owner evidently did. Garage kept, and the top condition is like new.
Here is a summary of the features:
Automatic transmission.
6 cylinder engine.
Factory locking axles, all the typical Rubicon goodies.
The Unlimited Package: 9” longer than the standard TJ for more interior room and more highway stability 
Cruise / Tilt.
Factory ‘Sunrider’ soft top. Allows for partial opening in front. Nice.
Charcoal gray-black interior.
Original Factory manual.

I’ve added a few things.

Kenwood CD player / radio with MP3 and USB port.
Self-enclosed speakers in rear, upgrade to factory in front.
Viper Alarm system
Wheels: Polished Aluminum 16” Mickey Thompson with locking lugs.
Tires: Michelin LTX M/S, P245/75R16. Better mileage, quieter than the factory tires.
Bestop “InstaTrunk”. Great extra locking compartment for valuables.
Aluminum Door pivots / restrainers. Much better than the silly cloth straps.
Allen-head nut on door hinges (anti-theft protection for the doors).
K&N Intake system (about 1-2 MPG better with it, but I have the factory system if you want it).
Tuffy steel locking center console with cupholders front and rear. Large locking storage area.
Hitch, drawbar and trailer socket / connection box. I think this is a Class 3 hitch but I’m not sure. Fram mounted.
Optima Battery, approximately 2 years old.
Heavy Duty steering arm damper replacing the factory damper; helps to stabilize the steering on rough roads / conditions.

Defects
There are the typical tiny paint chips on the front grill as jeeps will get. I suppose a flat painted horizontal surface is just going to get these.
There is one small dent / chip on the driver fender where it appears a rock flew upward and hit the underside of the fender. 
The previous owner evidently left his keys in the rear gate and slammed it shut and made three nice little ¼” dents in the tailgate. Dummy.
The rear wheel / fender / mudguards have lots of pockmarks on them. It appears the previous owner took this on gravel roads and while there is no paint damage, the rear plastic fenders are damaged. If it bothers you, these are cheap and easy replacements.
Overall this is a fine jeep, the last of the TJ line in a very rare configuration, excellent condition, extremely low miles, well-cared for, with lots of quality additional features. If you want the best, this is it.
I am looking for a cash purchase but MIGHT consider a low mileage Mini Cooper (with certain characteristics) in partial trade."

If you are looking for an FNP-45, but in USED/NEW condition, this is it. This Pistol is in Great, Clean Condition and sells for half the price of a tactical version for basically the same gun ($1399).  As the Owner I am obsessive about cleanliness and you won’t find a cleaner Pistol. This auction is for a used/like-new FNP-45. It has L&R ambidextrous decoking levers, removable back straps, accessory rail, loaded chamber indicator, external hammer, polymer frame and stainless steel slide. It comes with two 14 round magazines.

The FNP offers all of the features that dedicated hand gunners want. The ergonomic polymer frame has a low bore axis for less felt recoil and improved control. The grip panels are checkered and ribbed for comfortable, no-snag carry. The profiled stainless steel slide has cocking serrations front and rear, and the 4"" hammer-forged stainless steel barrel delivers pinpoint accuracy. Ambidextrous operating controls make the FNP perfect for competition or personal defense."" USA Made.

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."
