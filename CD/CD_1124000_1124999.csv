Sold five, only have TWO LEFT!

Ultra-high capacity magazines keep your rifle running longer between mag changes during competition or tactical operations. These magazines meet NATO STANAG 4179 specifications and are compatible with all rifles that accept AR-15/M16/M4 magazines. Less than two standard magazines wide, so they’re easy to hold and handle with one hand. 60-round model fits most dual-mag pouches for 30-round magazines. Weight is centered under the weapon to help you maintain a normal shooting grip and stance. Seats fully loaded on a closed bolt. “Nesting” nylon followers require no lubrication and fully support the round stack to aid in reliable feeding. Cadmium coating on springs reduces friction and resists corrosion.

If you order from a banned location your order will be canceled

The 1911 RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS – which stands for 1911 Compact SAS – comes from the SIG SAUER® Customs Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. Available in either a Natural Stainless (shown) or Nitron® finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom wood grips. The grips are either gray diamondwood on the Stainless model or rosewood on the Nitron® version. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols features a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability"

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This listing will be deleted if the gun is sold.

Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at info@freerepublicfirearms.com or by phone at 330-904-0222 with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This listing will be deleted if the gun is sold.

To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

Steel magazine, this was traded a few weeks ago
Plastic handguards, these were replaced with the MI rail

Excellent condition, safe kept, has had 150 rounds fired for function check, folding stock locks up tight, sights are zeroed and straight as an arrow. No problems with function, reliable as expected, as with all well-built AK rifles. Very accurate.

AK prices are all over the place right now, so it is even more difficult than usual to establish fair market value, but Atlantic had these recently at $1,289 (http://www.atlanticfirearms.com/component/virtuemart/shipping-rifles/arsenal-slr-107cr-62-7-62x39mm-detail.html?Itemid=0), though out-of-stock right now.

Comes with both original 10-rd Bushmaster mags, and another 30-rd aluminum mag made by Center Industries that looks new. 

You might have noticed the CMP logos on this rifle. Bushmaster only produced logo'd rifles for a short time, and while I don't know if they add any collector value, in my opinion they at least make the plain black a little less boring.

If you're interested in buying the rifle outright, the price is $1500 cash, FTF only.  I'm located in Harrisonburg VA. You can get me by Armslist's email reply, or call me at REDACTED.

PS - Package Deal - There are a couple of other AR-related things I'm selling as well - 684 rounds of Fiocchi ammunition and 9 new-in-wrapper Center Industries mags. If you want them with this rifle, the total price will be $2000. They will also be listed here separately in the appropriate sections."

bushmaster

One of the world's most popular military and law enforcement carbine models, the Bushmaster M4 features the distinctive M4 barrel profile and a six-position telestock for ease of deployment. The Bushmaster A3 Patrolman's Carbine is modeled after their U.S. Military and law-enforcement utilized M4 Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individuals. The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. calibered 16-inch barrel is chrome-lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a ""birdcage"" type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material and the handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on the Patrolman's Carbine offers both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. The rifle weighs just 6.7 pounds and has a 1 in 9 right-handed twist. Shipped complete with 30-round magazine, a safety and operations manual, and a carrying sling.

If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

I have a DPMS Oracle Panther 223 / 5.56 AR15 Rifle that is looking for a new home.  The rifle was removed from box and unwrapped at FFL dealer to confirm operation and then promptly placed back in the packaging and box.  

Reason I'm selling is simple, I backordered this rifle in early January and no longer have a need for it because I already purchased another AR since then.  I was going to cancel, but didn't want to pay the large fee the company wanted.  So, last week it showed up at my FFL. I am selling for just over my cost (price+shipping+FFL fee), so please don't accuse me of price gouging.  This price is much cheaper than local dealers, especially when you consider this is a brand new/never fired DPMS rifle.

I will also include a 20 round box of Wolf FMJ 223 ammo to get you started on your first magazine.

5R RIFLING LEADS TO A BETTER SHOT, PERIOD!!

Different from conventional 6-groove rifling, 5R rifling results in less deformation of the bullet jacket and a better gas seal. It causes less bullet upset and less barrel fouling, leading to a cleaner shot that you can count on hunt after hunt, year after year, with easier cleaning.

The Hungarian SA-85M are considered to be one of the best AKM imports around. Made by FEG in Hungary, they feature Hungarian receivers and chrome lined hammer forged barrels. They accept regular mags without modification. They come standard with a thumbhole stock, and blond beech(?) handguards. Beautiful blued finish throughout. Although they lack threaded muzzles and bayonet lugs, they can be reconfigured into original format with surplus parts. These are easily one of the best AKs around, and they go for around $1,100-$1490. One thing to note is that some of them use a shorter gas system, and will need proprietary gas tubes if you need spares."

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This listing will be deleted if the gun is sold.

If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.

We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.

To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

This is a 4th Generation Charter Arms “PUG” from the plant in Shelton, Connecticut, and is the best model they’ve ever designed. The alloy frame keeps it light, the 2"" barrel keeps it pocketable, and the .44 Special cartridge packs the punch of a .45 ACP with far less recoil than a .357 Magnum. Magnum recoil is very sharp and snappy, whereas the .44 Special is more like a firm push. This is the best big bore caliber for short barrels or recoil sensitive shooters, and is a very accurate round.

The PUG has a stainless finish, practical sights, and a snag-free DAO hammer. Lockup is very tight and revolver has a VERY low round count. It is practically in like new condition.

There is exactly 120 rounds of defense ammo (80 rds Gold Dot, 20 rds Silvertip) and a couple of loose Remington lead flat tips. I can also throw in a cheapo IWB holster to complete the package.

I’m asking only $550 CASH for the revolver and ammo, which is a very good deal. Not particularly interested in trades as I’m funding another purchase, but I might consider a K38 Masterpiece or Speed Six with at least a 4"" barrel, or possibly a pre-lock Centennial Airweight. ONLY interested in .38 Special caliber.

Face to face local transaction with LEGAL buyer only. I reserve the right to refuse to sell to anyone I don’t like, or to withdraw this item from sale if my pending deal falls through. Thanks."
