More pictures of this gun can be seen here: 

http://imgur.com/a/v7Utc

HISTORY

I bought this AR15 many years ago from a local police officer who stated he was a member of SWAT team in Alabama years before I met him. It was his ""secondary gun"" as he used his shotgun or handgun as his primary weapon for close quarters combat. He said this gun was strapped across his back for easy access. It does have a nylon sling that goes with it that looks like type of sling a person would use to put the gun out of the way across their back.

He stated that his police department in Alabama contracted a military armorer to assemble these guns in the very late 1980's. He was able to buy this gun for his personal use when he left the department.

This AR15 is compromised of a PWA lower, Olympic Arms upper in 45 ACP, and 3 UZI adapted magazines for an AR15 system. 

LOWER

The PWA ""Commando"" lower has only a 4 digit serial number and original PREBAN. These low serial number PWA PREBAN lowers have been going for $1,000+ as Gunbroker prices denote. I read somewhere the company that made the lowers for PWA is Lewis Machine & Tool ( LMT ) and are the contact company today. 

UPPER

The 45 ACP Olympic upper is very hard to find as those have not been made in many years. This upper alone goes for over $1,000 with just 1 of these original special plate welded magazines.

MAGAZINES

The 3 special magazines are that of the older UZI brand with the welded plate. These were discontinued many years ago. These very rare HEAVY DUTY magazines were designed for AR15's with 45 ACP uppers. These magazines (if you can even find one) alone were going for $125-$150 EACH a few months ago even before the prices drastically rose. Again, these are very hard to find even ONE...and I have THREE!

FOREARM

You can see the officer mounted a Weaver rail on top of the forend. He told me this was so he could attach a red dot scope to it. And on the left lower side in the front is another Weaver rail. He also told me that was for an attached flashlight.

MISC NOTES

This setup (The Upper, the Lower, and Magazines) would have went well over 
$1,500 a few months ago even before prices rose. You just don't see one of these special AR15's show up very often with these same 1994 original PREBAN components.

I have not shot this, it's been sitting in storage for years. Was getting around to using it, but more pressing bills force me to sell it. 

The trigger feels really nice, but could not tell you what make\model it is, nor do I want to take this apart to find out.

It comes with a very nice case that holds the 3 magazines...and also a sling that does 
not show in the pictures, but can take a picture if needed.

PRICE and TERMS

$1,500 plus shipping.

I live in NC in case you want to do a FTF.

If you live in NC and need it shipped, I can mail it to you WITHOUT an FFL transfer. You just pay shipping and insurance. And I would be willing to drive within a few hours of say Grand Rapids if you say Paypal me the fuel money in advance...so I don't get stuck with the fuel bill and lost time for a no show...fair?

If you live in another state, I will ONLY mail to your FFL and WILL NOT mail to a state 
that does not accept these components...please know your laws and do not waste 
both our times with erroneous information. Again, you pay shipping and insurance.

If any questions...please email me.

Thanks!"

Known for being the highest quality 9mm available Speer Lawman is chosen hands down more than any other 9mm for training by professionals around the world, with a velocity of 1,200 feet per second it's loaded to a higher velocity than normal in order to mimic the recoil impulse of the more powerful Gold Dot self-defense loads. Lawman is one of the best training rounds available. Each cartridge features a re-loadable brass case with a non-corrosive primer. Speer uses a total metal jacket, meaning that the whole core is completely covered by the jacket, unlike most bullets which leave lead exposed on the bottom. This means that less toxic lead residue is released into the air when the rounds are fired. That makes Speer Lawman ideal for extended training in an indoor environment, where minimizing airborne toxins is essential.

Price is $30 for a 50 round box.

lowballer disclaimer-- some people have an attitude that ""it doesn't hurt to ask"" regardless of how ridiculous an offer is. Fair enough, I guess, but if you're dealing with me, it does hurt. It hurts your reputation as a buyer and it hurts your ability to get a deal with me in the future. I'm not desperate and I will not fool with someone who has no concept of what current market prices are. 
P.S. I love it when this disclaimer ticks people off and I get ehatemail- The only type of person this disclaimer would infuriate is.... you guessed it... Lowballers... Which I want lowballers to send me emails identifying themselves anyway, so I can add them to my blocked email list- That way I don't ever have to waste time with them:) Hatemail and rediculous offers result in blocked email.

DPMS RFA3OC Panther Oracle Semi-Auto223 Rem/5.56 NATO
Whether you are buying your first AR rifle, or need an affordable yet
accurate plinking gun, the Panther Oracle is for you. Built to bridge the
gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets, this introductory level
carbine features a 16' light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with
Picatinny Rail, heat dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible,
six-position Pardus buttstock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs.
The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice
on the Picatinny Rail. The 16"" barrel, although light, provides plenty of
velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. The Pardus stock
makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter.

The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own. 
The 92FS, Beretta's premier full metal gun, most resembles the military M9 9mm pistol. Accurate out of the box, this workhorse features an open slide design that virtually eliminates jamming, a safety system that combines de-cocking with a slide-mounted positive thumb safety, and a combat muzzle crown. Beretta's proprietary black, non-glare Bruniton finish gives your 92FS a wear-resistant coating, which means it will stand up to any special duty. The Inox model features a stainless steel slide and barrel designed for corrosion resistance.

Specs from the site:

GunVault pistol safes are truly premium products that set the standard for the rest of the industry.  We know that security and reliability are prevailing priorities when you need our products, and that's why GunVault pistol safes have the features you want.  Our Biometric scanner provides lightning-quick access, even in the dark. Improved high strength lock mechanism and precise fittings make it virtually impossible to pry open with hand tools. Battery powered for maximum security and easy portability. The MVB500 (MicroVault Bio) uses fingerprint recognition, to access the safe contents. A high-performance algorithm is used to achieve speedy identification of enrolled fingerprints; and at the same time has a very low False Reject rate (FRR) for a given False Accept Rate (FAR). This self-learning algorithm of the GunVault Bio adds new minutiae to the fingerprint templates each time a user touches the finger print scanner, which decreases the likelihood of FRR, updates slight changes that might occur over time to an enrolled fingerprint, as well as to help distinguish variations. The MVB500 can handle a maximum of 15 fingerprint templates and comes standard with a 4 foot security cable that allows you to tether it to a fixed object, making it perfect for home and travel."

Added info. People seem to not know the value of this gun. Retail $699 plus tax. I paid about $740 on 2/4/13 and have the receipt from Clemson gun and pawn. Right now I'm interested in long guns, 1911, or water sports, utility trailer. Lemme know what you have. I can't walk right now so if its big you may need to deliver.

Tuesday I'll have 2000 rds of Remington 9mm ammo to make up for any price difference if needed. I'll have 8000 more rds around the 13th and another 8000 around the 25th. I will have them up for sale. I'm not price gouging or looking for a hand out but I had back to back surgeries in January and February and I'm out of work for 6 weeks or more. So I need to make a little money to help my family. I'll be asking $25 per box of 50. Please consider helping me out.

Comes with a lifetime warranty and includes an instruction manual. Currently available in black.

The Huldra Mark IV Tactical Elite’s patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The mid-length piston system will give you the benefits of a longer free float forearm (with anti-rotational tabs) and extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you a longer, more ergonomic grip, as well as a longer sight radius between the front and rear sights for quicker acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome. The 4.5 pound JP Trigger (a $259.95 value) gives you a perfectly crisp, precise break and extremely short reset. The complete absence of take-up and over-travel provides the best combination of speed and precision on the market. The ambidextrous safety allows you to flip off the safety on either side of the weapon. The rugged Mil-Spec Vltor IMod Stock has an extremely comfortable superior cheek weld with a non-slip removable butt pad. Each side compartment of The Vltor IMod can hold two AA or three lithium CR123 3-volt batteries and accepts a push-button, quick detachable sling swivel. The Ergo Grip is solid and comfortable. Its superior texture reduces slippage, even while wearing gloves and is virtually impervious to oils and solvents. 

Our melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished, reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical tooling dimensions held within ±.001"" and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control."

The gunsmith name is unknown. All parts are ORIGINAL to this rifle and bear the Waffenampt acceptance stamp 214. There is absolutely NO rust or pitting on this rifle whatsoever (very rare and unusual for these). The barrel and receiver have a fine patina (no reblue job has ever been done on this). The action locks up tight as a vault. It is a .323 bore with good rifling. Bolt handle has been finely turned to allow for a mounted scope, but doubt you will find rings for it. The stock is in fantastic shape with a couple of minor dings and a small hairline crack on the left side of the forearm. Rifles like these were made by gunsmiths in Germany after the war as bartering tools because their currency wasn't worth anything. Estimated time of work puts it at 1945-1947.  I would like to find this piece of history a good home and an owner who would appreciate it. I am not interested in trades at this time due to trying to offset the cost of a recent purchase. My current asking price is $500. Located in Enterprise."

Up to 100 yards would be great for bench resting rifles, and we would always be respectful and clean up after ourselves whether brass, paper, or any other trash.  If we wanted to shoot any other targets such as clays, we would ok this with you first, and also clean up better than when we found it.  Most targets would be paper or steel.  Most shooting that would be done is .22 handgun/rifle at various distances on paper/steel, handgun up to 20 yards on paper/steel, defensive shotgun on paper/steel up to 30 yards and occasional slug long range, benchrested or tripod rifle up to 100 yards or more if space is available, and skeet shooting (only if allowed due to busted clays everywhere, but would try to clean up as well as possible).  I love to shoot, but I think I get more satisfaction out of watching someone I help such as my spouse grow more confident by putting rounds on target.

If this is something that might interest you, please feel free to contact me.  I did not intend to take away from the other person that recently posted a similar ad, but this is something I have contemplated posting for awhile.  I have lived in Alabama my entire life, but a somewhat recent Bham transplant due to work and living in the city for right now isn't my cup of tea.  I would just like to be able to get outside in nice weather and shoot for a few hours like I used to with not a lot of folks around.  I think it's important also as shooters to pass along good and safe information to new shooters and get as many people interested as possible, such as my new spouse.

Again, if this is something that interests you, perhaps we could work something out such as a range fee or work on the range.  We would like to maybe be able to shoot once a month or so, but with my work schedule this might vary and we can work out details as we go along.  Of course, we would notify you BEFORE every time that we would want to come, and could give you as many days advance notice as you need.  Thanks in advance."

The upper assembly is genuine Colt, CH proof marks, C MP CHROMEBORE 1:12  barrel, MPC on the bolt, faint C on the front sight -- all indicative of a correct/matching 1974-1982 era M16A1 upper. Lower is a NoDak Spud full-fence A1, and receivers are CeraKoted in 'Sniper Grey'. Stock is genuine surplus Colt Type E, with a modern buffer tube and buffer. LPK was treated with naval jelly before installation for color matching, and mag button/trigger guard are anodized in XM Grey, and the selector is a correct ""no tick"" style. Also has the correct Garand sling.

Everything is in very nice shape. This was not built from one of those junk Israeli M16A1 parts kits that hit the market earlier this year.

Shoots great, nice and accurate too. I have shot about 250rds of Prvi and Wolf 55gr, with no issues.

Will also include three original 20rd Colt mags -- "".223 Cal"" marked floorplates indicate pre-1969, and they look like it. 2 of them probably need a new mag spring.

This isnt a cheap set up for a .22 and its a very very hard to find one since the mags will be banned within months and probably so will the rifle unless you already own it. Makes shooting fun again when you can leave the range with 500 rounds of ammo shot for 50 bucks ?

If the mags are banned they arent going PERIOD I can try and find a 10 round to add in those are cheap online but I will not ship to states with size limiations PERIOD and I have google so dont lie to me I will check
Your funds have to clear my bank account first so if you paypal (which I prefer the funds have to hit my account ususally within 3 days and I will ship within 24 hours of the funds in my account. 
Legally speaking the gun has to ship to your FFL but the mags and other toys ill box and ship to you directly You will pay shipping costs (around $30 -40 not super bad and get it within a few days.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol. Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use,the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A."

I am asking $1800 for the package. I am not gouging at this price. Please bear in mind that this is not your $700 DelTon or DPMS production rifle. This is a former military issued rifle that has extremely accurate and reliable. It has proven itself at 250yds with a 2"" group of three. I clean this rifle after every outing and it stays in a humidity controlled safe. I have never fired steel ammo from this rifle either. I am in no hurry to sell. Please do not low ball. If you are not prepared to make a reasonable offer, please do not take time to respond to this posting. You will be ignored. Gun/Accessories/ ammo all included. Will not ship, will not travel far to meet, will not separate. Must be an AL resident over 21 and be willing to sign a BOS.

Thanks for looking."

It is a colt LE MPR  556/223. It's upgrades include a Troy battle rail, in my opinion, these are the best rails on the market. It has an upgraded Yankee hill gas block with the rails on the top and bottom. It has a magpul ACS stock in Flat Dark Earth, Miad Grip in FDE, afg2 in Fde(angled foregrip), mbus sights in Fde(back up flip up sights), xtm rail panels in fde, it then has an Eotech 551 law enforcement/military issue holographic sight( I paid 550 for it and its only been mounted, never used) the sight has GG&G flip up covers that are anther pricey add on, it has a laser/flashlight combo mounted and a pressure switch to activate it mounted by the angled foregrip, has a magpul single point sling  loop and the newest ms3 sling in fde(you can't find these). On top of all the accessories, what's inside makes the beast. It has a 180$ slide fire trigger assembly in it, smoothest trigger I've felt, also has an accuwedge and brownells receiver shims( these take all of the play out between the upper ad lower so there is no wiggle, only solid machinery, then I put in anti rotation pins so they won't spin in the trigger group and get loose, the rifle has a Magpul Bad Lever on it, really nice addition, also has the magpul enhanced trigger guard. I spared no expense on this rifle as you can see and it would be tough to find a more complete combat ready firearm.  It also comes with a black windowed pmag that has a fde ranger plate on it. I have all the new boxes for all the parts, also I didn't mention, this rifle is brand new, I had planned on shooting in this weekend. I have the original box for the rifle as well that will go with it. I have receipts totaling 3500 on this rifle. As you can see it is a complete monster.
