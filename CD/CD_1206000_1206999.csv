12,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1206012,For Sale/Trade:  QUALITY 9mm and .22 LR for ... ?,"miami, Miami-Dade, South Florida",$ 15,"Listed On: Wednesday, March 6, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Ok, my fellow Americans, here's the deal.  Due to the current political climate and the high prevalence of sheeple, I just paid a hell of a lot more than I should have to for another 'black rifle.'  I'm not made of fiat currency, so therefore I need to offset my latest endeavor into common sense.

Unlike most folks selling their ammo you will see I'm actually offering high QUALITY products at a premium ... vs all the entry-level products at ridiculous mark-ups ... that are all over the place out there.  Am I charging more than I paid?  Yup.  I'm fully justified to do so due to the fact that I had the foresight to plan and ACT accordingly.  I jumped through plenty of hoops to get what I have.  I don't make it a habit to give away any of my labors for nothing in return, at least in this instance  Try going anywhere online or elsewhere and see if you can find a better deal on what I have to offer.  Most everything I'm offering isn't even readily available these days... and hasn't been for quite some months now.  Period.

It's been my experience that firearms related PURCHASES always turn out to be a most positive and beneficial thing, whereas whenever I've SOLD something I already possessed ... down the road I seriously regretted it.  Always.  So as crazy as it might sound, if I don't sell one solitary round, that would actually work out for me in 'the long run.'  Just ask Don.  If I TRY to replace anything I'm offering here within the next 6-12 months or even later ... most likely I'll be paying more than what you'd be paying to me in the present.  Of course that is assuming that these type of QUALITY products ... will even be readily available for purchase at that time.

Are you receiving my signal?

Due to MY inaction (and stupidity) as to not stockpiling enough 'black rifles' ... that's where I'm feeling the pain.  It bites like a vicious beast.  I dropped the ball ... same as you ... just in a different facet of preparedness.  If you really want to jack up my game plan ... you might be sportin' an M variety SKS (accepts AK mags) or maybe even a Type 56 in good condition.  I digs me some SKSs.  No ducks.  You also might be the proud owner of a Ruger Mark II with a bull barrel.  I could use one of those for the kitchen.  I dig working man's steel, so you could also hold sway over me with a... wait for it ... EAA Windicator 357 Mag, preferably the new and improved model.  Hell, I might even entertain a WASR but no dice if you're looking to score $1000 in trade for it.  Reasonably affordable and QUALITY AK 'type' rifles are like memorable girlfriends, one can never have too many in life.  Take care of them and they'll take care of you.  Be reasonable and I'll act in kind.  If you have a QUALITY piece that is understandably marked up some, I may bite.  It you're slangin' cheap studge ... and marking it up into the stratosphere, I'm going to ponder your significance to society and your relevant importance to my life personally.  Just to round things out for both sides, I could possibly use more 7.62x39 or 7.62x54R.  I dig sealed surplus and love those Russian crates full of steel business cards.  Also ... I actually help out squirrels with their food storage and if I ever so much as thought of hurting one, even in a dream ... I'd wake up and apologize to my neighbors in my avocado tree.  So ... you can keep the 5.56, I'm not the type to break a heel in a rush or never admit I'm wrong ... or get my rocks off by killin' fuzzies in an effort ... to compensate for something.  My apologies if my tastes offend the masses. 

Kinda.

So, ladies and gentlemen ... that's the car I'm drivin.'  I'm right next to you in the thick of it.  I don't see any lanes opening up any time soon.  I'm just as pissed at (and screwed by) the current state of affairs in our country, a country that no longer resembles the one I was born into and grew up in (hangin' out on The Rez in the 70s and down the road was so much more palatable).

It is what it is.

I had no intentions on keeping the rifle as I have no use for this type of rifle.

It is in very good condition and I purchased it back in the Summer to Coyote hunt with. Well it has just been sitting in my safe and I have yet to hunt with it. At this point I am just considering my options and may still keep it. I would like to sell/trade as a package. Please keep mind the options and night vision scope I have on it (otherwise I would not ask as much). It is also a newer 581 series gun.

I will provide a bill of sale if you want. To ensure you prove ownership before the law is effective.

MONDAY the Senate passed bills that will ban this permanently in Colorado. (don't bust my chops-read for yourself).  You can own if you prove ownership before Governor Lickingpoopers signs the law.

Black Dog is out of these- Black Dog is the manufacturer and once they make them-they go out to vendors first. No backorders taken and no sympathy for Colorado buyers (too bad). You can find these listed on varous gun sites for about $100, but not available.

GET IT NOW while available and legal.

http://www.gazette.com/articles/final-152111-gives-bills.html
If owned before laws enacted it is legal.
Will provide bill of sale.
Picture is of same drum with ammo. The one I sell you is new still in box..... in plastic and with all papers.
You must come to meet me...I will not travel to meet you.

Some people have contacted me stating I am wrong busting my chops.  SOrry but I am correct. House Bill 1224 specificaly staes- 22 ammo is only exempted in tube magazines and lever actions permeanently attached:
10 (2) (a) ""LARGE-CAPACITY MAGAZINE"" MEANS A FIXED OR
11 DETACHABLE MAGAZINE, BOX, DRUM, FEED STRIP, OR SIMILAR DEVICE
12 CAPABLE OF ACCEPTING, OR THAT CAN BE READILY CONVERTED TO
13 ACCEPT, MORE THAN TEN ROUNDS OF AMMUNITION OR MORE THAN FIVE
14 SHOTGUN SHELLS.
15 (b) ""LARGE-CAPACITY MAGAZINE"" DOES NOT MEAN:
here it is folks......
16 (I) A FEEDING DEVICE THAT HAS BEEN PERMANENTLY ALTERED SO
1 THAT IT CANNOT ACCOMMODATE MORE THAN TEN ROUNDS OF
2 AMMUNITION;
and specific to 22 ammo.......
3 (II) A .22 CALIBER TUBE AMMUNITION FEEDING DEVICE; OR
4 (III) A TUBULAR MAGAZINE THAT IS CONTAINED IN A
5 LEVER-ACTION FIREARM.

So get it now while it is still legal. Please don't send me mails telling me I am wrong- read the HB1224 yourself."

This is the public defender model in blued steal (black looking). It shoots the 2 3/4 size .410. I loved this little guy as a car gun but it has been replaced so i'm looking to get the bigger version. I also have the box and all the factory goodies... I think.

PS: COME ON people! This was once a great place to get good deals on used guns... now I see used guns on here for above MSRP! FYI Stores DO have guns in stock or are getting them in! Don't pay these over inflated prices, just be patient.  The Gander Mountain in Woodbury just got a ton in stock!"

213,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1206213,For Sale/Trade:  QUALITY 9mm and .22 LR for ... ?,"miami, Miami-Dade, South Florida",$ 15,"Listed On: Wednesday, March 6, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Ok, my fellow Americans, here's the deal.  Due to the current political climate and the high prevalence of sheeple, I just paid a hell of a lot more than I should have to for another 'black rifle.'  I'm not made of fiat currency, so therefore I need to offset my latest endeavor into common sense.

Unlike most folks selling their ammo you will see I'm actually offering high QUALITY products at a premium ... vs all the entry-level products at ridiculous mark-ups ... that are all over the place out there.  Am I charging more than I paid?  Yup.  I'm fully justified to do so due to the fact that I had the foresight to plan and ACT accordingly.  I jumped through plenty of hoops to get what I have.  I don't make it a habit to give away any of my labors for nothing in return, at least in this instance  Try going anywhere online or elsewhere and see if you can find a better deal on what I have to offer.  Most everything I'm offering isn't even readily available these days... and hasn't been for quite some months now.  Period.

It's been my experience that firearms related PURCHASES always turn out to be a most positive and beneficial thing, whereas whenever I've SOLD something I already possessed ... down the road I seriously regretted it.  Always.  So as crazy as it might sound, if I don't sell one solitary round, that would actually work out for me in 'the long run.'  Just ask Don.  If I TRY to replace anything I'm offering here within the next 6-12 months or even later ... most likely I'll be paying more than what you'd be paying to me in the present.  Of course that is assuming that these type of QUALITY products ... will even be readily available for purchase at that time.

It's made of what appears to be heavy aluminum cast,   the locking lever shows rust pitting and has been wire brushed and oiled to prevent further rust.  It functions fine, locks closed well,  the wire safety appears to work OK as it blocks the hammer from falling.  25mm flares are available online and at marine suppliers, and there are a couple places online where you can buy a 25mm to 12 ga adapter to fire the less expensive 12 ga flares.   This is a Marsh  Co model, it's not terribly rare, but it does have way more coolness than the standard  Olin plastic ones I've got for sale in another listing.

IT comes with (8) High Cap Factory Glock 13rd mags, (6) of which are brand new still in the package. With the gun comes 250 rounds of FMJ ammo, also less than 2 months old. It also comes with a frame plug installed as well as some grip tape that I added to the frame, but can be removed if you dont like it.

 I have to say that the G21 is one of the sweetest shooting 45's out there, with very minimum recoil. Ive owned several in the past and they were always really straight shooters.. You will definitly not be disappointed with this beast.

On top of this nice rifle is a nice scope.  The scope is a Redfield 2x7 with flip-up lense covers.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with this rifle.  It is a duplicate gun for me, and I would like to sell it to help fund a 1911.  (If I could think of a way of buying what I want without getting a talking to by the Mrs. I would hang onto it :-)

Another gun I have for sale is a Mossberg 835 Utili Mag.  This is a great shotgun for hunting and trap shooting.  It is chambered for 3 1/2"" shells, but shoots 2 1/2"" and 3"" shells as well.  It is not a Citori, but it shoots and looks great, AND for this price you don't have to worry about getting a little mud on the stock when you're goose hunting!  The price I'm asking on the Mossberg is $300.  This price includes a case.  You will find (based on other posts this is a great price).

Should you be interested in both guns I will sell them together for $550. 

Also for sale is a complete compound bow set-up.  My bow is a RH Proline Pointblank.  It comes in a hard case, with tons of gear.  Items included are as follows; Quiver, Stabilizer, Overdraw, Whisker Biscuits, Arrows, Points, Release and a Field Bag.  The price I'm asking for this Bow is $250 (Again, you are not going to find a better price)

Should You be interested in all 3 items, I would let it all go for $750

Daniel Defense’s new caliber option, the 300 Blackout, was originally designed to give the shooter a 30 caliber projectile which could be fired out of the AR platform without an increase in magazine size while still utilizing a standard bolt. The 300 Blackout is 7.62x35mm which gives the shooter similar ballistic qualities as the .308 and the 7.62x39mm, the AK round, without having to give up the light weight 5.56mm/AR platform.  The 300 Blackout can still utilize in standard AR magazines without a reduction in magazine capacity. Unlike the 7.62x39mm, the 300 Blackout cartridge is still light on the shoulder with similar recoil to the 5.56mm.

The Daniel Defense, v5-300 URG is equipped with a single pinned low profile gas block that is drilled, taper rimed, and press fit into place to securely attach the low profile gas block to the barrel assembly. This creates a rock solid platform that will never let you down.

These are on the top of Obama’s ban list!  Professional modifications are as follows: 
Gas ports properly sized so that cheaper low-brass ammo can be used; Bolt and carrier ground and polished at contact/action points for smoother action and easier magazine installation; Fire control group replaced with US-Made G2 unit and moved forward; fire control group is also machined and polished for supreme fit and function; Trigger guard replaced with modified 5-rivet AKM unit; Pistol grip nut clearance machined into receiver and grip moved forward; The entire firearms is then coated with extremely corrosion resistant, mil-spec SSI phosphate parkerizing, which is then sprayed with Graphite Black CeraKote -  proven to be the Absolute BEST gun coating available! Most firearms have a single coating, but we integrate a Dual-Coverage System for long-term corrosion-proof usage and unmatched protection.
Premium features are as follows:
18.5” threaded barrel; US-Made 6-Position Mil-Spec Telescoping stock with rubber shoulder pad and rigid billet trunnion mount, Veriforce tactical pistol grip; US-Made aircraft aluminum, hard anodized handguard with extended top rail for iron and or other optics; Indexed SGM slotted breacher muzzle brake; modified G2 fire control group with shepherd’s hook retainer; Bolt hold-open latch; side-rail scope mount; Fitted and tested ProMag 10-round magazine; MFT Rubberized Vertical foregrip. NOTE: red dot is not included, as it is for display/photo purposes only.
Also includes the following original Russian OEM items:
Owner’s manual; oil can; tool/cleaning kit; long cleaning rod.
If you're in the market for the ultimate defensive weapon, a competition shotgun, or just a high-quality scatter gun, get yours while they last. This is a solid and affective Russian shotgun, tweaked to perfection…and it will last for decades. NOTE: red dot is not included, as it is for display/photo purposes only."

This gun is in new condition and only had 50 rounds go through it and has been a safe queen in the original box since.

They no longer make this line anymore and it is rare to see these come up for sale.

It comes with one 10rnd mag. 

If you’re not familiar with the Mini Cougars they can be converted to a full sized duty gun just with the addition of a full size mag and grip extension. Beretta still sells the mag extensions to do this. It’s nice to have the option for a full sized pistol and a compact with just the change of a magazine.

I’m only going through an FFL and the buyer pays the transfer. So those that have a CCW, good, I but I don't have a FFL transfer book, so we still are going through a FFL. If someone wants it shipped, it is my FFL to your FFL. Shipped buyers pay with money order.

Firm on the price.

First come first serve. If you're out of town I'll take a nonrefundable PayPal deposit of $100 +3% until I get your money order for the full amount. I sorry, i'm not doing this sale pending stuff anymore only for the buyer to back out.

TulAmmo Primers Are Same as Wolf — But Cost Much Less
Powder Valley Inc. now offers Russian TulAmmo primers. TulAmmo primers (for rifle, pistol, and shotgun) are the exact same primers as Wolf. Both TulAmmo and Wolf primers are produced in the same Murom Apparatus Producing Plant in Russia and they have the same product codes. However, TulAmmo wholesales its primers at lower cost than Wolf-branded primers. Powder Valley is passing this great savings on to the customer. You will find that in many cases TulAmmo primers cost 15-20% less than the identical Wolf primers.

TulAmmo offers Non-corrosive Boxer primers, Lead-free non-corrosive Boxer primers, and Non-corrosive Berdan primers in all popular sizes including small rifle, small rifle military, small rifle magnum, large rifle, large rifle military, and large rifle magnum.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

I have the box, sling, paperwork and just added a fore-grip. Gun has had 30 rounds run through it.
