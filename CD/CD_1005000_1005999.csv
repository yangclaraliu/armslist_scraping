Since 1919, O.F. Mossberg & Sons has produced weapons that all levels of gun users – including novices – continue to operate today. In fact, Mossberg was the first long-gun manufacturer in the U.S. to achieve ISO 9001 certification, which sets the standard on manufacturing and quality control procedures. The Mossberg 500, which was first produced in 1961, continues to be one of its most popular shotguns for sale on the market, and it’s currently used by the United States and allied armed forces, as well as by police and civilian gun owners. The Mossberg 500 also makes for an excellent field weapon, and is often used as a trap and skeet gun.

Take advantage of your rights! Don't give up on your hi-cap mags!  You can't find parts online right now. When I've seen them, they are hovering around $150 and are gone in minutes. Prices will only go up until the Feds make a decision. Then prices will either skyrocket again or slowly subside, taking years for prices to return to ""normal"". I guarantee mine will on the next shipment. Wholesale prices on mags have risen 250% in 1 month. Since they are scarce, some companies are doubling or tripling that. I realize these prices are not cheap, but they are compared to what the online retailers are selling for.

The Model 760 Gamemaster has been prized by hunters for more than 50 years due to its rock-solid accuracy and legendary reliability. The forebearer to the Model 7600, the 760 is a high-powered, slide action hunting rifle first introduced in 1952. The Gamemaster is perfectly balanced for fast, accurate shooting with a free-floating barrel and an encased bolt head. The 760 has a solid steel receiver that houses a smooth, trouble-free action. A rotary breech lock and a heat-treated barrel add to the Gamemaster's time-tested durability. This .35 calibered rifle features a 22-inch blued barrel with a scope base. Its wood, metal, and bore are all in good condition.

NOTE: These drum mags may not fit your Saiga right out of the box- this is not a magazine issue, it's a manufacturing issue with the Saiga 12 shotgun, some just won't fit properly, therefore- the drum magazine comes with instructions on how to shave the material down for a precise fit.

I currently have the scope removed, but it screws right on and should be zero'd to 50 yards. The gun is in perfect working condition and very good cosmetic condition. I've shot it several times with good results, and carefully cleaned and oiled it after each trip to the range.

The current ""Remlins"" are made in New York and are generally not as well-made or valuable. This is a pre-Remington Connecticut-made rifle.

Very good for:
- Cowboy action shooting
- Hunting small game with .38 Special
- Hunting deer and big game with .357 Magnum
- Some home defense situations
- Pairing with a .357 or .38 revolver

The rifle can use any .357 or .38 Special, except wadcutters (too short for the action, will result in a jam).

On my ""trade for"" list, those are things I'm interested in. I'm not saying I want all four of those for the rifle. We can discuss/negotiate what you've got, with perhaps some cash going one way or the other along with the trade."

American Eagle brand.  I ordered 9mm ammo from an online ammunition supplier, but they sent me .40 S&W instead by mistake, and I tried to call them about it but they told me they were too busy to deal with it, and since I don't have a firearm chambered in .40 S&W (nor do I want one) I am selling this for BELOW what it normally costs in retail stores, therefore the price is FIRM!

Uses: Target practice, economical self-defense

I am selling this in 1000 round bulk,  because it's not really worth the hassle of selling it by the box so please do not ask me to sell you a few boxes.

This ammo may become rare, gun shops and large retailers are reporting ammo shortages in semi-auto calibers, 9mm, .40 S&W, and .45 Auto, therefore the selling price is firm.

Of those just 62 were ever even referred for prosecution. When recently asked by NRA representative Jim Baker about the lack of prosecutions for lying on form 4473 Joe Biden responded: ""And to your point, Mr. Baker, regarding the lack of prosecutions on lying on Form 4473s, we simply don't have the time or manpower to prosecute everybody who lies on a form, that checks a wrong box, that answers a question inaccurately."" 

So, basically, the Obama administration can't be bothered to enforce the laws we already have but wants new laws to burden law abiding gun owners. Tell your senators and rep: No new gun control and that Obama needs to do his job and enforce the laws we already have.

You can write all your senators and reps here. 

http://www.nraila.org/get-involved-locally/grassroots/write-your-reps.aspx

Proposed text follows:


""
I would like to know why we are even considering additional gun control laws when existing federal law is not being enforced? 

In 2010 according to a report entitled:

 ""Enforcement of the Brady Act, 2010: Federal and State Investigations and Prosecutions of Firearm Applicants Denied by a NICS Check in 2010"",

Which can be found at:

https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/bjs/grants/239272.pdf

there were 72,659 NICS denials. Only 6.2% were even referred to ATF field offices for investigation and of those only 62, yes, that's right 62, not 62% but 62, were ultimately referred by the ATF to federal prosecutors. 

It is against federal law to provide false information on form 4473, which must be completed prior to a NICS check, and the NICS check is not run if an answer is given that indicates an individual is prohibited from receiving a firearm. Based on this, either, NICS is so flawed that out of 72,659 denials only 62 should have denied, or the Obama administration has absolutely no interest in enforcing federal law. I'm betting on the latter since according to the NRA, of which I am a member, when their representative, Jim Baker recently asked why the prosecution rate for lying on form 4473 was so low, Joe Biden Responded:  ""And to your point, Mr. Baker, regarding the lack of prosecutions on lying on Form 4473s, we simply don't have the time or manpower to prosecute everybody who lies on a form, that checks a wrong box, that answers a question inaccurately."" In other words, the Obama administration, which wants to burden law abiding gun owners with numerous additional gun laws, cannot be bothered to enforce the ones we have now.   Why should we even CONSIDER passing more laws when the administration refuses to enforce those we already have? What's the point? Perhaps if the administration would actually do it's job and enforce existing law there wouldn't even be a perceived need for any more laws. We certainly don't need more laws for both criminals AND the Obama administration to ignore.

 I oppose ALL new gun control laws, and, frankly, think that if Obama and Biden cannot be bothered to do their jobs and see that existing federal law is enforced they should both either step down or be removed from office.

Nice blue steel and serial number 366XXX (last three digits not shown for privacy). This is a 1967 manufacture, based on the serial number and barrel as well, as it says ""67"" on the barrel as well and has the deer antlers and other marks, as to show proofings of being assembled and test fired at Ulm/Do (West Germany at the time and now Germany, having been reunited long ago). Importer is Interarms (Alexandria, VA). 

Fires great, accurate and all. James Bond style all the way. Never had a jam with it either on both European and American made ammo. Magazine holds 8 rounds. 

This gun is NOT on the California roster, thus very rare in California and not easy to find. Being that it's not on the roster, like many other guns, any of these old Walthers cannot be sold by an FFL here in this State or by FFL or private party out of State, so one cannot get one online and have it shipped here, since it's not on the roster. It can only be sold private party within this state. They just keep getting more and more difficult to find here in California, so this is a great chance to get one and a cool piece of history.

The gov't considers this to be armor piercing, has banned it from being imported, and has made it illegal for dealers to sell it. If you're going to get it you'll have to buy it from a private seller.

Not really interested in trades, though I'd look at AK47s and 74s, but I'd want to trade based on what that rifle was worth 2 months ago, or at least close to that value. Only other thing I'd want is a Mossberg 590 (8+1). Cash to go either way to square a deal depending on what we trade. Please don't offer a trade if you don't have what I just listed.

•	Original Mossberg turkey choke
•	Kicks Industries Gobblin Thunder turkey choke in camo and ported
•	Original manual and lock
•	Original box
•	Original screws if you want to remove the picatinny rail


I bought this gun brand new last year.  I took it hunting twice and killed 3 male Toms.

It shoots 2¾, 3, and 3.5 inch lead shells.

It came with a screw in choke from Mossberg but I upgraded it to better choke.
Kicks Industries Gobblin Thunder with .655 constriction in camo.

It shoots a very tight pattern at 50 yards and that is how far away I killed all three Toms.

I put a picatinny rail on top of the pre-drilled receiver.  You can use that rail or take it off and go with the standard adjustable fiber optic sites on the vent rib barrel.

The shotgun is all synthetic and totally camoflauged.  I have shot skeet with it using lighter loads.  It kicks really hard with the turkey loads so I only shot maybe 10 rounds total in the 3 inch magnums for turkey sighting and hunting.

It is clean.  No scratches.  No problems ever.  Never jammed.  Never misfired.  It works as good as new.

I am selling it because I recently bought a Remington turkey gun so I don’t need the Mossberg any longer."

Both of these guns are complete and work well. I think these are kit guns, I got them completed and have had no problems at all. They both have a couple minor imperfections but look good and shoot great. I got on a kick with these things and ended up with 4. I love shooting black powder and when I see a working gun for 125-150 bucks I just have to buy it. Anyways time to pass them on so I can get some new toys. I was at bass pro last week and the only thing that was in stock was Black Powder stuff, they had plenty of everything, balls, powder, gear, all of it.

Super fun to shoot. $100ea or both for $175."
