This is a great AR build, only has about 500 rounds through it and is very clean. Flawlessly cycles both 5.56 and .223 ammunition, never had a malfunction. Weapon feels great, has a clean, crisp trigger pull and shoots great. EOtech is a breeze to zero and will hold it through almost anything. The case is a decent soft case for a carbine length rifle. It has a padded inside for the weapon and external pouches that hold 8 magazines and 1 zippered pouch. 
Great rifle but doesn’t get much use so I’m selling it. Selling as a full kit and not willing to separate items. Looking for $3500 or best offer. Not up for trade. Please only contact with actual interest and legitimate offers."

The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

One is a norinco mak90, made in 93. Has the slanted reviever. 6 position stock, tapco forend etc...i bought this from a gun store in 2007, not sure exact round count but i havent shot it much. Maybe 100 rounds

Next is a converted saiga ak, has tapco 6 position stock. Tapco trigger group, bullet guide etc...cant say much about it. It was converted when i got it and i havent shot it yet. 

The last is the basic century wasr10. Nothing fancy, plain jane ak. Havent shot this one yet either. The sights are straight and the mag does not wobble. Maybe a little too tight because my tapco mags wont fit. The metal ones fit just fine.

I have no problem keeping these but maybe someone has something they dont mind getting rid of and i have three of these.

This is a Superior Arms (www.superiorarms.com) S-15 Carbine .223 Rem./5.56x45mm. I own another Superior Arms AR that's identical to this one, and it is a fantastic rifle!

This particular rifle was acquired as part of another deal, so I have not fired it myself. But looking it over it appears to have been fired very little, maybe less than 200 rds. It is clean, in like-new condition. I would have thought it was new myself until I noticed the SLIGHT wear on the bolt carrier.

Lock-up of the upper to lower receiver is TIGHT (usually an indicator of quality of fit and accuracy).

I am selling it for $975 OBO together with (2) 30-round aluminum C-Products magazines with Magpul anti-tilt followers, carry handle, and an Aimpoint CompM4 clone. If you don't want the carry handle, I'll knock $40 off the price.

The Aimpoint is a clone and not the real deal, but it LOOKS EXACTLY like the real thing. It came on another rifle, and while I prefer a real Aimpoint (of course), I did use it for a couple of trips to the range, and it worked fine!

I would prefer to sell this without the background check requirement, and I am sure you would prefer to buy without the BG check, so give me a call at (720) ONE-SHOT or shoot me an email and let's talk a deal!"

800,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1829800,For Sale/Trade:  First Aid & Casualty Response Kit from North American Rescue,"Security, Colorado Springs, Colorado","$ 1,000","Listed On: Sunday, June 30, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a fully equipped casualty response kit from North American Rescue. It has everything you would need as a first responder on any casualty situation. Success is confirmed. The US Army selected the WALK® as its official vehicle life-saving kit. 

 North American Rescue pays attention. We listen. We learn. We act. We develop products like the Warrior Aid and Litter Kit™ (WALK®), our innovative and reliable response to requests from Warfighters and Tactical Healthcare Professionals to re-think the purpose of vehicle life-saving kits and re-engineer them to decrease preventable death. 

 How did we do it? 

 First, we gathered as much information as possible to correctly define the requirement. From numerous observations and after-action reviews compiled from operations Enduring and Iraqi Freedom, we learned that a new focus was needed for vehicle first-aid kits. From Warfighters and Tactical Healthcare Professionals, we learned that the focus ought to be decreasing preventable combat death at the point of wounding. 

 With the task defined, we developed the product. The Warrior Aid & Litter Kit™ (WALK®) allows first-aid treatment and immediate evacuation of one patient in a non-traditional vehicle, plus it allows multiple other trauma patients to be treated until additional transport arrives. That's successful engineering. 

 Our engineers took the state-of-the-art Talon® 90C (a quad-fold rigid litter with retractable handle system) and designed a package that holds not only the litter, but also a streamlined pocket-system containing self- and buddy-aid medical supplies. The WALK® gives true definition to the term ""aid and litter"" kit. The WALK® also contains our Hypothermia Prevention & Management Kit (HPMK™) to help stabilize patients during transport. 

 Light and compact, the WALK® reduces cubic weight and, thereby, evacuation time. 

 The WALK® interfaces with any standard or non-standard casualty evacuation asset and is ideal as part of the pre-positioning of medical supplies or cache for disaster response.
