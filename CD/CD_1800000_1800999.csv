The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market.

Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3""."

I purchased this rifle from my dad about a year ago. When I bought it, it had the original wood stock (which had quite a few scratches). I decided to have the rifle cerakoted by Advanced Tactical Coatings in central Washington and fitted it with a Remington SPS lightweight polymer stock. Rifle is in fantastic condition with silky smooth Cerakote finish (in graphite black). The bolt is coated as well and is one of the smoothest sliding bolts I've felt in a Remington. The rifle shoots great and has shot many of my loads sub-moa. Bore is shiny and smooth with a crisp crown. The serial # puts the rifle manufacture date in either 1980 or 1987. There are a few tiny marks on the gun, but nothing I can capture with the camera.  Feel free to ask any questions about the rifle by emailing me. Thanks, Scott

This rifle like all of my rifles has been cared for, and cleaned after every range visit. This one in particular hasn't seen many rounds (maybe 50-60) since I got it brand new last month (can provide paperwork upon request).

Fact is though I don't really need another AK. One or two is enough and they will last a life time. I wanted to see if a Wasr is just as reliable as your top of the line Izhmash or Arsenal and I don't have a single complain. No issues whatsoever. I inspected the weapon prior to purchase to insure all parts have matching serials and as said before, I have not experienced a single issue with this rifle. Take proper care of her and she will last longer then you and your great grand children.

Gun is in like new condition with approximately 100 rounds fired. This gun was purchased in early May brand new and has been taken to the range twice, cleaned thoroughly, and never carried. There are no issues with this firearm, I just would like to sell it in order to purchase the 3.8 Compact model to conceal carry easier, due to this firearm's long grip. Items included in this deal are the handgun, two (2) 16-round magazines, XD Gear paddle holster, and XD Gear magazine pouch/carrier. Box is NOT included, as I chose not to keep it, however the pistol is kept in a GunMate zippered handgun sleeve, which is included at buyer's preference.
I am asking $550.00 for this gun and all accessories. Let's be honest, that is a bargain considering these pistols sell for well into the $600's. I am open to negotiate, but don't waste time with low-ball offers. Not interested in trades, cash only. Let's make a deal!

This started life as a Sig P226 Dark Elite.  I replaced the standard aluminium grip with the E2 grip which, imnsho, turns this gun into a modern fighting pistol.  If you don't agree, however, you can always pick up a set of stock grips and screws from topgunsupply.com for $14.95 and install them quickly :)

Round count is unknown, like the vast majority of guns on this site - you really think all these guns have less than 200 rounds through them?  I'm just being honest.  I would guess the round count to be less than 1000, but I'm not going to attest to that.  Considering that I don't think any of use can afford to shoot enough to wear a modern service pistol out, ti's a non issue.  The gun is perfectly broken in :)

This is probably the absolutely smoothest shooting pistol I've EVER owned.  Comes with 2 15 round magazines and box/papers. 

Adjustable night sights.  

SRT trigger.

Smoothest DA pull I've ever felt.

Darkness.

This Sig is an absolute treat to shoot.  You'll love it.

Freedom Munitions ""Like-New"" manufacturing process provides like-new ammo performance.
FREEDOM MUNITIONS inspects all cartridge cases for defects. The Scharch Range Master machines are fully automated and cases are checked for any debris and pressure tested for any splits or cracks. Primers are removed, flash holes are cleared, and primer pockets are reamed to accept new primers.
FREEDOM MUNITIONS then washes cases in an acid wash specially designed to remove all remaining burnt powder from the flash hole and interior of the case which tumbling doesn't remove. Then cases are tumbled in a dryer for a factory look and finish.
FREEDOM MUNITIONS roll sizes all cases on our own designed machines to meet S.A.A.M.I.specification. This method is the industry standard for commercial sizing, insuring the case wall is sized down to the rim which insures new component performance.
FREEDOM MUNITIONS then loads these processed components on the same fiber optic-controlled Ammo Load machines as our premium new ammo. These are the same machines used by some of the largest manufacturers in the industry. These machines assure S.A.A.M.I. specifications for priming depth, pressure and overall cartridge length.
FREEDOM MUNITIONS ""Like-New"" manufacturing process with the new projectile, powder and primer assures factory ammo performance that discriminating shooters expect."

 Gun is in like new condition with approximately 100 rounds fired. This gun was purchased brand new in May and has been taken to the range twice, cleaned thoroughly, and never carried. There are no issues with this firearm, I just would like to sell it in order to purchase the 3.8 Compact model to conceal carry easier, due to this firearm's long grip. Items included in this deal are the handgun, two (2) 16-round magazines, XD Gear paddle holster, and XD Gear magazine pouch/carrier. Box is NOT included, as I chose not to keep it, however the pistol is kept in a GunMate zippered handgun sleeve, which is included at buyer's preference.
 I am asking $550.00 for this gun and all accessories. Let's be honest, that is a bargain considering these pistols sell for well into the $600's. I am open to negotiate, but don't waste time with low-ball offers. Not interested in trades, cash only. Let's make a deal! 
 I live just outside of Memphis, TN, and will not travel further than 30 miles. Because of my odd work schedule, meeting time needs to be convenient to me. Buyer must be 18+ and possess Handgun Carry Permit or show valid Driver License. Call or text (901) 412 - 8423 with offers.

-skorpion armaments adjustable stock.
-Israeli made (mako) grooved stippled pistol grip.

-trigger assembly moved forward
-aluminum quad rail.
-razor flash hider (really really works well!)
-0.75 cheek riser for better cheek weld with sights.
-primary arms red dot multi-retical model. very long battery life! (Ak point clone)
-~300rds through the gun.
-riser for red dot to make a perfect co-witness.
-much longer than average AK sight radius.
-Texas weapon systems top rail (gen 1) hold zero perfect.
-100rds of fmj ammo comes with it.
-2 included 30round tapco magazines that run perfect.
-1 included 10 round saiga factory magazine. Runs perfect.

There's surely more but I can't think of it right now. Feel free to ask questions.
The gun has never failed me once! Always loads, fires and ejects perfectly. Even leaves the cases in pristine shape for you reloaders.
The camo which I have dubbed ""desert viper"" works beautifully in the Arizona desert.
The camo is baked onto the gun and is more durable than your average home-job.
I do NOT want to sell this gun but divorce has forced my hand.

I am willing to let this gun go for $1250.  NOW if cash and if sold by this upcoming weekend i will be more Bendable on the price.  if you dont want the red dot or the ammo i will let the gun go for $1000. If you want the optic (these are very hard to get a hold of) and 200rds of ammo and I'll throw in a lockable hard rifle case I'm going to need closer to $1250.
As far as trades... I like semi-auto 308s they can be offered and i may accept BUT  i much prefer cash.  I will accept some haggle but not much. And please don't try to low-ball me."

Gun is immaculate. And runs flawlessly. Has a polished barrel with polished feed ramp and contact points. Reduced trigger kit spring to 4.5-5 lbs from the standard 6-6 1/2 lb pull. Breaks like glass with a clean reset. Has all the gear that came with it...including holster mag holster speedloader box lock and paperwork. 3 mags..9..12..22 round mag. The 12 rounder has the extended grip from the factory. The 22 round functions great with no feeding problems. Not really looking to trade but ill entertain offers that aren't crap. No rifles or shotguns please. I have alot into this gun and my asking price is firm and its more than fair 580 firm gets everything. Which is what I paid for the gun by itself before all the work and parts and extra mags went into it. The gun has been to the rsnge with exactly 150 rounds through it with not a single issue even running the 22 extended mag. It amazed me...most extended mags with that capacity have feeding problems but it worked great.  May trade for full size m&p 9mm with extra mags and  accessories or flat dark earth pistols.... ...i don't need to sell this gun just seeing whats out there thanks. must meet close by to franklin and ID and bill of sale is required. Can add cash or self defense ammo for the right trade package. Might trade for a full size m&p 9 blade tech carry/range kit.

Which is a great shotgun... But... Remington seems to have fallen in love with putting plastic parts all over their guns. I'm an all metal reliability guy!  
And the big difference between this shotgun and the remmy is this one holds one more shell than the remmy and is full metal.
I have customized this gun a good bit. 
Specs:
- 18.5"" barrel with 3"" chamber to accommodate the larger magnum shells. Including but not nearly limited to rifled slugs!  My favorite!  But if you wanna skeet shoot with #8 2-3/4"" bird shot shells. They run just fine too. 
- Ive upgraded to an adjustable 6 position stock and pistol grip (Includes a nice recoil pad).
- i've also upgraded to a tri-rail forend. For any lights/lasers you may want to add later as I won't include accessories.
- (2x) 3 shell holders that can mount on either or both sides. 
-  vertical fore-grip.
- (6x) rubber rail covers.
- included is the factory stock and fore-end (hunting type) with buttpad.  
-  I'll also include the fore-end wrench so you can change stocks quickly and simply.
- this gun has a custom camouflage paint job you will not see anywhere else. This gun dawns my favorite self-made camo I've dubbed ""urban night viper"" this camo plays the shadows and streaks of dim light found in the environment of the interior of a home at night. 
This gun damn near completely disappears in a dark house! 
- all metal construction reliability. 
- I'll include some 00buck and 7-1/2 shot shells. As well. Probably around 30-40 shells.
- if I get my asking price or close I'll include a hard case and a lock. 

This shotgun doesn't quit. Fires every time. And this gun doesn't have the ejector problems that the Remington 870 express it was modeled after is known to have. 
As long as you positively work the pump i doubt this gun will ever fail!  It's certain never failed on me! 
I've put probably around 200 mixed shells through this gun and and cleaned it after every use. To say the least it's in good shape.  The camo is baked on and allowed 24 hours dry time between coats. This will produce a much more durable finish than the average DIY paint can job. 
Basically this has been my home defense shotgun for about 2 years. And it definaty makes you feel safer at night!
I am welcome to a small amount of haggle but I'm not taking $100 off the price either.
I will accept some trades of equal value but i do not have cash to put on top. So anything worth more than $350 won't be accepted unless you're willing to take the loss.

I will want to see a drivers license or some form of valid identification with proof of age. A bill of sale will also need to be signed. But as this is a shotgun... You're only required to be 18 years old.
 I feel these two simple steps will cover both of our asses in the long run.  So don't sweat it."

Model: Model 625-6 Mountain Gun 

Serial Number: CAL1750

Barrel Length: 4” Tapered Light Contour 

Sights / Optics: The revolver is mounted with a pinned black Patridge front sight. There is a micrometer click adjustable rear sight. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The grips are checkered walnut K Frame Hand Ejector style with silver colored S&W logo medallions and a black Tyler T-grip. There are no chips or cracks in either grip panel. The left panel checkering is good, while the right panel checkering is worn towards the rear. The grips rate in about Very Good to Fine overall condition. These grips are not original to this revolver and were adapted by the previous owner. 

Type of Finish: Stainless Steel 

Finish Originality: All Original 

Bore Condition: The bore is bright and the rifling shallow with evidence of fouling in the forcing cone and down the barrel. There is no erosion evident. The muzzle crown is good. 

Overall Condition: This revolver retains about 90% of its metal finish. There are to small dings, one on the left above the cylinder release and the other on the right side of the frame centered forward of the cylinder. The serrated back strap is mildly distressed. Most of the other use marks should polish out. There are drag marks on the cylinder. The screw heads are sharp and clean. The markings are clear. Overall, this gun rates in about Fine condition.

Our Assessment: The S&W 625-6 Mountain Gun is largely distinguished by its tapered light contour barrel. It was designed to lessen the load for those who want to carry a .45 Colt double action in the field. With its adjustable sights this revolver can be sighted in for a wide variety of loads, from plinkers to bear stoppers. With its all stainless steel construction it is heavy enough to be controllable and light enough to carry for field conditions."

 Assessment: The S&W 1066 is the carry version of their single stack 10MM, with low mount Novak’s sights and a bobbed hammer. The 10MM was designed by Col.

Paraphrased from Wikipedia “The government of Denmark has issued the 10MM to members of the Sirius Sledge Patrol in Greenland as a defense against polar bears which the unit might encounter."

Low round count
You're looking for a 1911 that stands out in a crowd, you'll want to look at this bi-tone model. The frame is hard-coated anodized black, while the slide is satin-finish stainless. Add to that rich brown hardwood Cocobolo grips, and you've got a looker.

This pistol is about more than appearance, though. The alloy frame reduces the overall weight to just 33 ounces, which is very light for a full-size 1911, and makes it a good choice for carry. The low profile 3-dot Tritium combat sights won't snap on your clothing, and give you an edge in low light.

Front and rear slide serrations allow for fast cycling of the action with either hand. The ambidextrous safety is a great bonus for left-handed shooters, or for shooting weak hand

Well taken care of. I have always cleaned it after every use.

Specs:
The P220 Combat with threaded barrel is designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards. The P220 Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron® over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the threaded barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Outfitted with a true M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights.

This is possible due to the side-folding stock of shaft design that makes it more compact. The 12.6-inch barrel is also relatively short for the 7.62×39mm cartridge. The operating mechanism does not require a gas expansion chamber at the muzzle as in the AKS-74U to ensure reliable functioning, but does use a specially designed muzzle brake, which reduces muzzle flash, but makes the weapon louder. It's only fired 5 rounds to make sure it worked. It's nearly impossible to find a Amd in such good condition, this one is in excellent condition. Flash compensator makes the barrel legal length for North America. FYI. Might take trade."

 For those wanting a deep penetrating all copper expanding 38SPL+P load, this is it. Depending on individual impact velocity, (barrel lengths and distance to target vary) you can expect between 12 to 14 inches of penetration in flesh and bone.

 Buffalo Bore was able to engineer a flash suppressed powder for this load and therefore the shooter will not be blinded by his own gun fire in low light. This creates a huge tactical advantage as most civilian shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is out and about.
 This load is safe to fire from all 38SPL +P rated and all/any 357 firearms that are in normal operating condition. However, when fired from super light weight alloy J frame revolvers, recoil is stiff. This cartridge is designed so the bullet will not jump crimp when subjected to recoil from firing in super light 12 OZ revolvers, provided you do not subject any cartridge to the recoil of more than six or seven firings.

With great pleasure, we noted that every test gun delivered tiny little groups at 25 yards. It is normal when we observe good accuracy from most test guns and exceptional accuracy from some test guns with any load we are developing, but this load gave exceptional accuracy from every test gun. Most of our adjustable sighted test guns, needed the rear sight raised as this high speed, light weight bullet shot to a lower point of impact than normal loads our guns were already sighted in for, but the groups (accuracy potential) were very small, none-the-less."

It is more used than many Swedish, but it shoots really well, and has a neat rear sight. I am no expert, but I believe the sight is actually a military one rather than the more common civilian match guns. From discussion on AR15.com, I believe the sight is worth about $100 if you want to sell it to recoup some of your cost. The wood has beautiful grain and color on 1 side, but the whole stock is dark from oil, etc. If you know how to refinish a stock it will look really nice. It will come with reloading dies, and about 35 virgin brass cases. A nice lower cost deer rifle. A perfect 1st rifle for hunting and learning to reload!"
