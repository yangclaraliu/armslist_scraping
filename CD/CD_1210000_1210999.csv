Product Information
 The MagPul 20LR PMag is constructed from advanced polymers with superior impact resistance and light weight. This 20-Round magazine is designed to replace the standard SR25/ M110 pattern magazines. The 20LR is less than half the weight of a standard steel mag and has a true 20-round capacity. The body is designed with a constant-curve inside dimension and a self-lubricating follower for reliable feeding. The textured magazine body and flared floorplate improve handling over standard magazines. The snap-on impact cover protects the feed lips from impacts and debris while in storage. The impact cover also allows loaded magazines to be stored long-term (over 1 year) without compromising the integrity of the feed lips. The design of the floor plate is simple to disassemble using the impact cover or simple punch for cleaning and maintenance.

GET IT WHILE YOU STILL CAN!!!  LWRC is no longer producing rifles with the cerekote finish so this is your chance to get one of the last SPR Rifles manufactured with the FDE finish.  LWRC is a top quality manufacture.  They were the only manufacture to survive the Military’s Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) 22,000 round torture test.  All other manufactures rifles locked up except for the LWRC.  In fact they put the LWRC through a second 22,000 round test and it still didn't lock up.   That is something to said about the quality of LWRC.

Words from LWRC:
The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol. Features & System Characteristics:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
No snag, bobbed hammer

Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Contoured, extended slide release

From website:
This Tobago Large Pack from Voodoo Tactical is a great piece of equipment that competes with the CamelBak BFM and similar packs that sell for more than $200. Honestly, we think this is a steal at this price. It has all sorts of clever accouterments and extra touches, such as Velcro covers for the hydration tube passage and tie down straps in the main compartment.
 The pack itself is 20"" x 19"" (at the widest point) x 12"" with two large pockets on the back and two additional pocket on each side. If that isn't enough space, you can add to it using the many MOLLE PAL attachment points. It also features internal pockets, two radio pouches and room for two hydration bladders of three liters each (you can add more hydration carriers in the main compartment or externally, if you wish). The thickly padded adjustable shoulder and sternum straps can be removed to convert the pack to a carry-all by using the top and side nylon carry handles. Fully covered zippers with pulls, bottom bedroll loops and side compression straps to secure your load

The pack is surprisingly comfortable under heavy loads, with body-contoured shoulder straps, a sternum strap with lumbar support and a waist belt. It has an aluminum and polymer internal frame to add structure and also has individual back panels to promote maximum air flow, keeping you cooler.

The Tobago Large Assault pack is as big or bigger than many three-day assult packs, but we think it holds enough to last most of us much longer in the field.

The Saiga 12 is the most bad ass shotgun a civilian can own. Imagine an AK-47 chambered in 12 gage, well that's what this is... These are extremely hard to find, even before all the firearms craze over the last 6 months it took me almost a year to find a brand new one because customs was holding up their imports. Very soon you will not be able to buy these anymore which will make their value skyrocket. 
FYI I don't buy cheap UTG equipment or BSA-Leapers type scopes so all of the accessories on this gun are top notch quality equipment.

This Package includes the following:

-Saiga 12 shotgun 6 months old with approx. 50 rounds shot thru it. 
-Chaos USA quad rail with integrated sight mount, this is the best quad rail you can buy for this gun. I paid 400 bucks for this quad rail alone.
-Red Jacket Firearms/ Sons of guns TV show, Muzzle break/ Door breaching tool. $129.00
-Tapco intrafuse stock with integrated pistol grip. $150.00
-Eotech HWS (I will sell without the Eotech.) $400.00
-Carolina Shooter Supply reliability kit installed for multiple gas settings 1-6, which enables you to shoot 3"" buckshot-2-3/4"" birdshot. $100.00
-2x 20 round drum magazines these go for over $100.00 a piece.
-1x 10 round extended magazine Flat dark earth.
-1x 5 round factory magazine.
-Extra stock and grip kit.

Has some blue but mostly silver/brown, the walnut stock is better looking than the rest of the rifle, so was probably replaced at some time. The 18"" barrel has a decent amount of rifling but also some pitting, since not all boys could afford Kleenbore ammo. I bought it from the Grandson of the original owner in the 1990's and only shot it a couple of times.  The canvas case to carry it on a bicycle was completely rotted away, not salvageable.

The Heckler and Koch 416 Pistol is a handgun version of the H&K 416, chambered in .22LR. This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the .22 416 rifle.

The 416’s pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic.

I don't know if anything is missing, or if the parts will all fit up, but it looks like it shouldn't be too terribly difficult.

The frame/barrel/cylinder were all one matching assembly.  The birds head grip frame is made from brass, and while it fits recesses really well, the sides are still proud and will need to be dressed down.  Stocks fit the grip well.  I paid $110 for this birds head set up at a show five years ago.  Looking at Brownells now, this was a bargain.

The small bag of screws are new, and were purchased specific to this project. These were $20 
The sealed bag of parts that includes the hammer are old 'take out parts' from a Ruger that was sent back for conversion.  This 'kit' will generally fetch $150 or more on eBay.

I think there is $500 worth of stuff here.  I'll sell it for $400 or trade for some sort of good duty pistol/revolver."
