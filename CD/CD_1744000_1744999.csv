There may be one or more dead bodies or those who need medical attention.  As a responsible police officer and a law-abiding citizen, your first phone call should be to 911.  You should report the incident and request that police and a medical crew come to the scene.  However, once you have done your civic duty to notify police and bring medical attention to the injured, you then have a responsibility to yourself and your family to make sure you are protected against the legal forces that may be brought against you.  So your second phone call should be to Second Call Defense.

If you carry a concealed gun you must have thought about it?  What would happen if you had to use your firearm?  In any self-defense situation, your primary responsibility is to survive and protect those who are in your care. You may face one or multiple threats.  Assuming that you have used good judgment and successfully ended the threat, you are now faced with the aftermath of your actions.

There may be one or more dead bodies or those who need medical attention.  As a responsible police officer and a law-abiding citizen, your first phone call should be to 911.  You should report the incident and request that police and a medical crew come to the scene.  However, once you have done your civic duty to notify police and bring medical attention to the injured, you then have a responsibility to yourself and your family to make sure you are protected against the legal forces that may be brought against you.  So your second phone call should be to Second Call Defense.

The number you call will be our 24-hour Emergency Legal Hotline.  This line is manned day and night and available exclusively for those who have been involved in a self-defense shooting.  A real person will answer immediately.  Tell us what happened and we will give you simple instructions for what to do next.

If you're so upset that you are unable to follow our directions, you can hand the phone to responding police and we will intermediate for you on-the-spot to make sure your legal rights are protected.  If necessary, we will provide you with a referral list of highly rated attorneys in your area within 24 hours to provide legal consultation and help protect your rights.

Ill list off what I have. GET THESE BEFORE JULY 1ST! Trading will be a bitch and high cap mags are going to be illegal unless you grandfather them. Get in on this tricked out AR with hi cap mags

For starters I have a DPMS AR15 carbine length .223/556. I added a Magpul CTR collapsible stock, a hogue grip, a DPMS detachable carry handle, a black rain ordinance billet aluminum charging handle with tac latch, zombie hunter dust plate, a midway USA ultra light modular rail. My rail weighs less with rails attached than a Magpul MOE rail without rails, this thing is light!. I bought a couple extra rail slots to put a longer slot on the bottom and both sides have a 3 slot rail front and back, I have a magpul foregrip attached to the rail. I added KNS Precision anti roll pins for the receiver so you never have to worry about messed up trigger/hammer pins. Custom paint job on the lettering. I've had the rifle for 2 years and the color still looks great. I also haw a black rain ordinance flash suppressor. This rifle has only had 500 through it and is freshly cleaned. It comes with a different gas block if you want a railed one, a loaded mag 30 rd with magpul pull assist, a 20 round mag and a magpul 30 round mag. Comes with total of 280 BRASS rounds 20 of which are varmint tipped and 200 once fired shells. Comes with a gun lock. Comes with a nice tactical soft case with MOLLE mag pouches and a MOLLE pouch with some AR15 tools

The shotgun is a mossberg pump with a collapsible stock with a side saddle full of 00 buck, a Mesa tactical optic flattop rail with an integrated side saddle full of 5 Armor piercing Incendiary rounds and an ALS stabilized rubber riot slug. Has the original forend and comes with a never used tactical forend with rails. The gun comes with the regular barrel and a 28"" vented hunting barrel that's formed to a modified choke. This gun is lightly used and has only about 400-500 rounds through it. Also comes with a couple military grade 00 buck. Comes with a gun lock. Comes with a nice hardcase with the extra barrel in it.

The handgun is a Jennings 9mm with a hardcase with foam, a holster and some federal home defense rounds. I have 2 boxes and 5 loose FMJ. This gun shoots great, has actually cycled every type of ammunition and the mag has very little scratches on it showing its lightly used. I just recently cleaned this. Included is a bag of once fired 9mm shells.

A pretty much brand new nice plate carrier without plates but accepts front, back, and side plates. I saw a place online that sells formed, unfinished plates for cheap. All you need to finish them are rhino lining spray or textured spray. It is fully adjustable. It has an AR15 quad mag pouch attached and on the back there is a Paracord survival bracelet attached. This comes with extra MOLLE gear, mag pouches and grenade style pouch, etc.

Included in the package is: paracord, a Sub Commander neck knife never used, barley used bushnell binoculars in camo, a pair of Oakley gas cans for the bright sun, shooting glasses or tactical look, and an Extreme survival book and a special forces survival guide and a US Army LED headlamp with regular led light, blue,green and red led lights.

This gun is in mint condition, all original, and comes with the original box and contents including the extra cylinder with matching serial. Ruger recalled these pistols to install a transfer bar making this one a rare find as it was never sent in. I called Ruger to run the serial number but it was to old for their records. I bought it from the original owner who purchased it on base for $63.50 back in the sixties. He shot it a couple times, oiled it, and put it away until the day he sold it to me. $800 obo.

If you carry a concealed gun you must have thought about it?  What would happen if you had to use your firearm?  In any self-defense situation, your primary responsibility is to survive and protect those who are in your care. You may face one or multiple threats.  Assuming that you have used good judgment and successfully ended the threat, you are now faced with the aftermath of your actions.

There may be one or more dead bodies or those who need medical attention.  As a responsible police officer and a law-abiding citizen, your first phone call should be to 911.  You should report the incident and request that police and a medical crew come to the scene.  However, once you have done your civic duty to notify police and bring medical attention to the injured, you then have a responsibility to yourself and your family to make sure you are protected against the legal forces that may be brought against you.  So your second phone call should be to Second Call Defense.

The number you call will be our 24-hour Emergency Legal Hotline.  This line is manned day and night and available exclusively for those who have been involved in a self-defense shooting.  A real person will answer immediately.  Tell us what happened and we will give you simple instructions for what to do next.

Let me know what you got, but I only deal in military style battle guns: AKM, AK47, AK74, AK101, AK106 etc. Also M1 garands, M1A, SCAR 16 or 17, ACR, CETME, HK rifles, I love AK underfolders and true side folders (not tantal style, that's ugly) mostly polish and Bulgarians but let me know I don't care if it's a wasr if it comes with 2,000 rounds and $7,000, 1911, ACR, HK USP .45 or USP Compact, HK P2000 or P2000sk any caliber, Colt Single Action Army SAA, Ruger Vaquero or similar, Colt or Pietta or Cimmaron 1851 cap and ball, yellow boy lever action, Glock 19, Glock 17, Glock 21, I love compensated Glocks like a 19c, Glock 26, Glock 27, Steyr AUG stg556 or similar, I have a huge list. 


THE BUG: 1967 VW all original great condition. Came from the Barrett-Jackson car show in Las Vegas. Keep the picture in the dash. Runs real smooth. 1300cc strong engine rebuilt a couple years ago, LESS THAN 67,000 original miles. White leather ceiling and sun visors. Tan leather seats and side walls. 4 speed manual. Everything works but the windshield wiper fluid (not sure about that one) but the wipers work great, fast and slow. 

I do NOT need: ANY other vehicles, no 4 wheelers and motorcycles, I have a 2013 Camaro and a Buell XB12r with a Harley 1203 that will smoke your Ninja and Hyabusa on a real track. I don't need an XBOX, microwave, TV, garden hose, mail box, or your son or dog. I need cash and guns. Don't be afraid to give me a cash offer (especially with guns listed above) but low ballers will be ignored. If you low ball me, it's much bigger waste of your time to type letters and numbers than it is for me to click the email and then click back. Just saying"

If you carry a concealed gun you must have thought about it?  What would happen if you had to use your firearm?  In any self-defense situation, your primary responsibility is to survive and protect those who are in your care. You may face one or multiple threats.  Assuming that you have used good judgment and successfully ended the threat, you are now faced with the aftermath of your actions.

There may be one or more dead bodies or those who need medical attention.  As a responsible police officer and a law-abiding citizen, your first phone call should be to 911.  You should report the incident and request that police and a medical crew come to the scene.  However, once you have done your civic duty to notify police and bring medical attention to the injured, you then have a responsibility to yourself and your family to make sure you are protected against the legal forces that may be brought against you.  So your second phone call should be to Second Call Defense.

However, once you have done your civic duty to notify police and bring medical attention to the injured, you then have a responsibility to yourself and your family to make sure you are protected against the legal forces that may be brought against you.  So your second phone call should be to Second Call Defense.

I'd much rather pay $3 for 250 .177 pellets than $60 (or whatever people are charging now) for 500 .22lr shells.

If you carry a concealed gun you must have thought about it?  What would happen if you had to use your firearm?  In any self-defense situation, your primary responsibility is to survive and protect those who are in your care. You may face one or multiple threats.  Assuming that you have used good judgment and successfully ended the threat, you are now faced with the aftermath of your actions.

There may be one or more dead bodies or those who need medical attention.  As a responsible police officer and a law-abiding citizen, your first phone call should be to 911.  You should report the incident and request that police and a medical crew come to the scene.  However, once you have done your civic duty to notify police and bring medical attention to the injured, you then have a responsibility to yourself and your family to make sure you are protected against the legal forces that may be brought against you.  So your second phone call should be to Second Call Defense.

I'm changing careers and I need some extra cash for a Nice acoustic guitar. This rifle was treated great by me, veteran and CCW instructor. I've had this rifle about 7 months and have taken it out 5 or 6 times with no more than 280-300 rounds through the barrel. That's all. Its barely broken in. 

I bought this weapon on gunbroker and it came with a few very small paint wear marks on the quad rail. Given the wear from shipping and the wear from me taking it out I give this weapon a grade of 97-98% for any collectors out there. I'm not a collector, just a survivor. For that purpose, this weapon is 100%. 

Comes with everything in the box, and a bi-pod.

RARE Customized - This is a 1942 issue Mosin- Nagant. Black ATI Monte Carlo stock. Previous owner removed rear iron site and attached scope picatinny in it's place.  Round receiver. Good Clean weapon. Comes with OnTarget JH400 Red and Green Dot Scope & Russian insignia ammo pouch. Selling as is. No trades or returns. 

Someone once asked..""Why have a Mosin?"" The answer is, ""Because sometimes the bad ones hide behind things."" This is one pwerful rifle. A 7.62X54R will rock your world.

Monte stock is a $75 value and the OnTarget JH400 Red and Green Dot Scope another $75.  Picatinny mounts for scope is an extra bonus. So keep in mind when considering purchase. Also this is a clean ready to fire rifle. Beware those cheap Mosins that may (probably) have rim lock interupter problems or whose ejector is worn down and won't consistently eject rounds. I can verify good clean feed and eject works perfect on this weapon.

This neat old rifle is WW II Capture rifle that was brought back by a GI. It does not have any Import stamps on it. The bore is in good shape, shiny with light pitting. The stock and hand gaurd are in good condition. The blueing is worn and there is some light pitting but most of the perceived roughness is casting marks. This rifle has a threaded muzzle which allowed the use of rifle grenades and comes with two magazines.

History
Germany's quest for a semi-automatic infantry rifle resulted in two designs - the G41(M) and G41(W), from Mauser and Walther arms respectively. The Mauser design proved unreliable in combat when introduced in 1941 and at least 12,755 were made. The Walther design fared better in combat but still suffered from reliability problems. In 1943 Walther combined a new modified gas system with aspects of the G41(W) providing greatly improved performance. It was accepted and entered into service as the Gewehr 43, renamed Karabiner 43 in 1944, with production amounting to just over 400,000 between 1943-1945.

Description 

ITT's MX-11769 Gen 3 18-mm image intensifier is completely self-contained with an integral high-voltage power supply. Equipped with automatic brightness control (ABC), this power supply provides constant output image brightness as light levels increase. It also provides bright-source protection to guard the tube against exposure to high levels of light. 

ITT's Gen 3 F9810SLG (MX-11769) image intensifier tubes consists of a high-efficiency GaAs photocathode bonded to a glass input window, a microchannel plate (MCP) current amplifier, and a P-43 phosphor screen deposited on an inverting fiber-optic output window. The Gen 3 photocathode is very sensitive to low-radiation levels of visible and, especially, near infrared light. It also provides very high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for extended detection ranges at very low light levels as well as variable gain to optimize performance in the PVS-14. 

The 6-micron channel spacing in ITT’s MCP provides exceptional resolution. The MCP has a thin ion-barrier film that preserves photocathode sensitivity during operation, thereby greatly extending the life of Gen 3 tubes compared to Gen 2. ITT continues to improve Gen 3 MX-11769 image intensifier tubes to increase operational range and situational awareness for the user. Equipped with an auto-gated power supply, the Pinnacle® versions provide truly outstanding performances in high-light or light-polluted areas, such as urban environments. In addition, the PINNACLE® tube provides a much reduced halo.

The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2"" to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire."

SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association’s coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year.

This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250® is a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and grip size at will. One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose.

The new SIG SAUER® P250 is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned SIG SAUER quality – the performance, the accuracy and the reliability – into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. Choose the caliber: 9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W, or .45ACP. Choose compact, subcompact or full size polymer grip module. Select one of three grip sizes and two trigger lengths. Now it’s a fully customized P250. But then you can change everything to meet new requirements. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality SIG SAUER pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a new SIG SAUER pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance.
The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

I have a Browning A-bolt in 300 Win Mag for sale or trade. It is the first generation and I am guessing it to be around 15-20 years old. It has a 22"" barrel, a magna-port style brake machined into the barrel, has been teflon coated, and has a great trigger .

This rifle had the trigger damaged in shipping, so the bottom 1/8""-3/16"" of the actual trigger blade has been broken off. It has not appeared to effect function, and a replacement trigger can be had for about $40.

The stock is walnut and has been used and shows many handling marks. It has shortened to about a 12.5"" LOP.

This rifle consistently prints 2"" groups at 100 yards. 

A nearly new set of Talley 1 piece rings and bases (1"" Med height) are included, as are a set of aluminum Weaver bases.

I am unsure how to price this given the condition, so I am selling it as a ""gunsmith special."" $375 shipped would be great for me, but I'll take offers.  

Scope, bi-pod, and stock pack are not included.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact carry pistol.
Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.
Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.
The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.
To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.
The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.
Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.
Made in The U.S.A.

Also included will be 39 boxes (780 rounds) of ammo for the gun. I will not separate the mags or ammo from the gun. The Round Count on the gun is around 250 with no failures of any kind.

To Do The Math on what I paid for things (the gun and everything was purchased before the cost of imported AK’s went through the roof, I am told what I paid is now close to dealer cost): 
$899 + Tax and Background check for the gun (2 steel mags included)

I will not ship the gun, the transaction will be conducted face to face at a gunshop of my choosing so that both parties are comfortable with the purchasing process.

Duracoat protects the steel of the gun and protects it.  It is impervious to oil and water.   No more wiping down a gun every time you touch it.

Duracoat comes in many colors and even in camo patterns. 

I do not charge more then what duracoat charges.  And it is usually less expensive to duracoat an entire gun then the cost of shipping to blue a gun.  Typically I have a one week turn around time.  

I will barter for labor but I will not barter for material.   I do accept credit cards as well.
Let me know if I can help.  I can usually give a pretty close estimate over the phone as ling as you are up front with me about its condition.

looking to trade for or towards a 9mm glock for mom to carry. dont need 19 extra mags, crimson trace grips, trijicon RMR etc.. you get the point. strictly a 9mm glock, gen 3 works fine.

my G22C with the Strike industries glock buffer still has too much recoil for her, she has carple tunnel, so i figured i would trade my gun and ammo to help her out.

if you have what we're looking for feel free to email this post or text/call (812/545/1694) and we can go from there.

she does have a LTCH and IN driver license

The only reason I'm selling it is because there is something else I want more and since I just purchased a rifle, I can't justify another purchase to my wife yet. I bought this gun in May of last year and have been upgrading it ever since. It started out as a DPMS Recon, their top tier tactical rifle. Many upgrades have been installed. Here are the current specs:

Stainless steel 1/9 twist 556 barrel
AAC Blackout 51t flash hider
Midlength free float quad rail with lo pro gas block
M4 feed ramps
Nickel Boron (NiB-X) bolt carrier group, one month old
Colt mil-spec buffer tube
Latch plate with loops for slings on either side
LaRue Tactical RAT stock in thier proprietary urban dark earth
Magpul MBUS front and rear sights
TruGlo Tru-Brite red/green dot
LaRue Tactical index clips and handstops in urban dark earth
Ambidextrous charging handle
Yankee Hill Machine EZ-Pull takedown pins
KNS Anti Walk trigger/hammer pins
Short throw 60 degree ambidextrous safety selector
Magpul trigger guard
LaRue Tactical A-PEG rough grip in urban dark earth

This rifle looks, feels and shoots great. I've had it a year and put about 600 rounds through her. Not one single malfunction, not even during the break in period. The sights and red dot co-witness perfectly. My last trip to the range I was ringing the plate at 400 yards without the use of magnified optics, just MBUS and the red dot. The only reason I didn't go out farther is because my eyes couldn't see the 500 yard target. Very well maintained. Thoroughly cleaned after each range visit and oiled once a month even if I didn't get to shoot it. 

I'm looking for $1,600 or best offer on this, I've got more than that in it. I would trade... I'm looking for a comparable 9mm set up. A quality gun, preferably upgraded like mine, and with multiple magazines. Show me what you've got and maybe we can make a deal. Email or text REDACTED

I've got a ton of 223 and 556 ammo and the person who ends up with this rifle will have first crack at it. Good stuff, Lake City green tip on stripper clips, Hornady, Federal etc... I also have PMAGS available to the purchaser; 8 gen 2 pmags, 30 round, black, with windows and 8 gen 2 pmags, 20 round, black, windows not offered"
