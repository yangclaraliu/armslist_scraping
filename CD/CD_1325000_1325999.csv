I have refinished this mosin to a honey blonde color using a wood stock from a standard mosin. Attatch a recoil pad and an allen company butt stock shell holder.

The Bayonet has been cut off so you cannot use a bayonet with this rifle without changing the front sight mount from another type 53.

I am just looking to trade only, not selling. I can possibly add cash for a trade that interests me

Obama urges vote on assault weapons ban

Posted by
CNN's Ashley Killough

(CNN) - President Barack Obama called on the Senate to vote on a controversial ban on semiautomatic firearms modeled after military-style assault weapons, despite dim predictions from Senate leadership that such a ban will have any luck passing the upper chamber.

""These ideas shouldn't be controversial – they're common sense. They're supported by a majority of the American people. And I urge the Senate and the House to give each of them a vote,"" Obama said in his weekly address.

He said there is still ""genuine disagreement among well-meaning people"" on how to combat gun violence. But he, added, the American people ""have spoken.""

On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, introduced gun legislation targeted toward curbing gun deaths. However, it did not include the so-called assault weapons ban, nor another proposal backed by the Obama administration that would place limits on magazine capacities.

The bill instead included measures that expand the background check system, boost school safety and toughen laws for gun trafficking. The Senate will begin debating the bill once it returns from recess in two weeks.

Because of fierce opposition by the National Rifle Association, Republicans and some Democrats would get fewer than 40 votes on the assault weapons ban, Reid said, far below the threshold needed to defeat a filibuster or pass the Senate.

He added that Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the main proponent behind the ban, can propose the legislation as an amendment and therefore get a vote on the Senate floor.

Shortly after the Connecticut elementary school shooting that left 20 children and six adults dead, a majority of Americans–52%–favored major restrictions on guns. However, that number has since dropped to 43%, according to a CNN/ORC International poll released earlier this week.

Comes with the box, original paperwork, lock and key, sling, 30 round magazine, rail risers in case you want to use a big scope or whatever, and whatever extra paperwork/coupons/etc might be included normally.  This model does not have any sights installed - it has a top rail that is ready to accept whatever optics you might wish.  It comes with the 6-position adjustable stock, flash suppressor/compensator, bayonet lug, and sling swivels attached.  And unlike most modern AR's, it is stamped on the mag well so you know it accepts BOTH .223 AND 5.56 ammunition, whatever you can find to use - no guessing that the NATO rounds MIGHT work in your gun!  I'm also throwing in 20 rounds of PMC brass-cased .223 ammo so you can get it sighted in on the range without having to resort to steel case foreign surplus ammo (if you can even find that).

I found another gun I want even more, so I'm looking to sell this quick.  I have some parts already in the mail and once they arrive and I start customizing this Bushmaster, I'll probably be taking it off the market.  These have been selling out in hours online at $1300, and I saw them at the last gun show going for around $1600, so I'm listing it at $1300 and you won't have to pay shipping, taxes, or transfer fees.  Face-to-face cash sale, prefer you have a CCW but not required.  I have a Browning reflex red-dot sight I'll throw in for an extra $50 if you want it to come with optics in place to take it right to the range.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask."

Upon arrival I did a quick drive around to scope the place out before contacting the individual I was supposed to be meeting. Suprisingly enough there was a STATE TROOPER and a WHITE VAN parked next to eachother both with their running lights on alongside the far backside of the building. I immediately left and contacted jp to let him know what I had seen. He then tried with full effort to get me to reveal my location and return to the meeting place. Funny thing is when he called my phone I answered but did not say anything and caught him speaking with a normal accent to an un known individual, opposed to his fake southern accent which he originally had!!! Beware they are out there and obviously are trying to make examples out of whoever they can to intimidate the American people!! JP did not seem concerned at all about the police presence, only about MY presence. Be Smart People!!! This is a police state we live in and day in and day out our rights are being abolished. I am not a liar and have witnesses to the above described events. Feel free to contact me with any questions. I just leave you all with this thought, how much tax dollars were wasted today in a failed attempt to entrap this AMERICAN CITIZEN.

Top of the line S&W .44 magnum - Performance center is S&Ws premier in house build shop, so the performance center pistols are the finest models they put out. Purchased by a buddy of mine who is a NRA instructor and shooting coach - its had maybe 30rds down the barrel. Looks brand spanking new. 

Comes with all the original stuff (box, paperwork, lock etc). I'll also throw in a box of 50 high end defense rounds and another box of target shells.

Price is $1,200 firm....a simple fair number, so no haggling accepted. Picture is stock but looks exactly like the one you'll get. Ask for additional pictures and I'll email or text them. 

Might accept trades, but if your trade does not have a value equal to the asking price please don't bother. 

Please note this is not a beginner's pistol. Not being a jerk just trying to save you the pain of making a bad purchase. You need to have experience firing pistols and an appreciation for what this is in order to enjoy what you're buying. If you're just looking for a run of the mill .44, you can buy a nice one for a lot less than this. If you haven't heard of the performance center line from S&W, you probably don't need one. 

Will meet within half an hour radius of West Knoxville. 

Shoot me a text (727 417 9818) for additional pictures.

Must be a TN resident for me to deal with you - sorry, thanks the law

First, my receiver says ""Made in Russia By IZHMASH""
It is a stamped receiver made in the arsenal factory in Russia.
Second, look at te other Saigas on here, they don't have the dimpled mag well like mine has, therefore they have mag wobble and mine doesn't. 
Some of them are in 223, which if you buy an AK, it's for the power of a 7.62!
My Saiga was fully converted by PROFESSIONALS, not Jow Blow in his garage!
I paid $300 at Sovereign Guns in Fuquay to have it converted.  I paid them because I care for my firearms and wanted a professional job done!
The Trigger group has been upgraded to the Tapco Trigger, which everyone knows is a superior trigger to all other ak triggers! It was moved forward and the pistol grip was installed along with the AK buttstock. 
I see people wanting $1500-$1800 for their Saiga's and some don't even have a dimpled receiver! This is crazy and if you pay that, you're even worse than they are!
I am not looking to screw anyone over here, I am offering the best Saiga on armslist for a fair price! Especially considering mine has extras that theirs doesn't.

Fully converted Saiga 7.62X39 rifle
4 thirty round magazines

This was well before the Braztech--and far superior in quality, fit and finish! This rifle was made by Rossi (barrel with ""Amadaeo Rossi SA"" stamp) for the USA market imported by Interarms. This is a very fine specimen of the rare model early import with the Puma on the left side of the receiver. This rifle has seen VERY little use and maybe unfired. This is a saddle ring model but as you can see from the photos a previous owner removed the ring to avoid scratching the receiver and to keep it from rattling. The saddle rings are available very cheaply if you want to replace it. If you know Rossi 92 lever guns the actions are very, very stiff out of the box and need broken in with the action worked over and over again and/or shot a lot to loosen up at which point they are some of the finest versions of the famous Winchester model 1892 lever action rifle. This action was VERY stiff when I got it. I have worked it some and have gotten it somewhat loosenend up but still needs more. This action stiffness, the bore being spotless and the gun having virtually no wear except for the action working I did lead me to believe this gun is in near new condition, maybe unfired. but I'm selling as ""used"". I have not shot the gun. The brazilian hardwood and very deep blued metal are gorgeous. I'll probably regret getting rid of this one but I am refining my lever actions to Winchester, Marlin and Browning so I'm going to let this one go. I will sell outright or will trade:"

The reason I am selling it is because my brother who is an FFL dealer owed me money, so instead he gave me this Scar. He just got it from an FNH rep. and the new wholesale price to the distributors and dealers is between $3600-$4200 depending on what point in the future they are delivered. MSRP is never going to be what it was before the FNH factory invested in large production expansions.

Having said that... I am just trying to get my money back in cash, I am not price gouging, and if you think I am, I challenge you to find a cheaper price on a brand new Scar from any dealer in the country by the end of the year.

I will post pictures soon.

What? I should keep describing what I have?

Remington M887 Nitro Mag Tactical with: ($610)
80 rounds of 00 buckshot.
50 game loads #6 shot. (All ammo for $85)
5 round buttstock sleeve. ($15)
Tactical spiked choke. (Came with the gun)
TLR-1 tac light (not pictured). ($160, at lowest)
But I'm not asking the $870 that all of that would cost brand new, even though the shotgun is unfired.
I'm asking for $780 cash or trade value. Giving you the gun and accessories for exactly what you'd pay for them new, but throwing in the ammo free.

All to give you a great setup for home defense. 7+1 capability, can fire shells from 2-3/4 to 3-1/2.
___
Bersa Thunder .380 ($295 on Impactguns, with $40 ship to FFL)
Total of 2x7 round magazines, one in addition to what came with the gun. ($31 online, plus $12 shipping)
$378 seems like a fairly high price for this gun being a few years old, and without ammo, so I think $310 cash or trade value would be better.

For both, I'm hoping for a cash or trade value of $1,075, which can be negotiable, to some extent.

I'm always on the lookout for good deals on ammo and accessories, so I may be adding more to what I have.

I have no need to sell, so trade is preffered.
I got both guns to expiriment, and I personally prefer my compact 9mm, and my 1911 to these great guns for the roles they fill."
