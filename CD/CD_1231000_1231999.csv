Regular cab. 4cyl 4 speed(22r mtr), short bed, 2wd. Odo has 298???, engine has been rebuilt(head work, valve job, crank ground, everything) 40k ago, new clutch, flywheel, throwout installed at same time. Tranny rebuilt 100k ago. Shifts great and drives great, newer tires. 
Has No ac(didn't come with it), no power steering(didn't come with it) no power windows or power locks. This is just a base truck! There is a bit of rust, but not bad. 
Gets about 38mpg hwy. and 25-28 in town. 
There are no rips in the seat, seat belts work, very clean interior. Manual windows work, door locks work, heat works great! All fan speeds work, 
It is carbureted so it has some trouble starting when it's really cold if you forget to choke it first, Other than that, it runs good. 
I got it in a trade a couple months ago, I have no use for it, 
I am a certified mechanic and have thoroughly looked it over because I was going to drive it to work, but found my dream car a couple weeks after and decided to buy that!! 

So like I said before, I have no use for it. I did drive it around 100 miles at once just to make sure everything was good and that is was going to be a dependable truck. 

I sent in for the title not to long ago, so I still don't have it back from the state, but it is a clean and clear title! im the 3rd owner. I was just putting this out here to see if there was any interest in it at all. 
Your welcome to come take a look at it, and drive it, 

Only thing to my knowledge that is not right, is the stick doesn't stay in position. For instance, if you put it in 1st gear the stick falls back to the neutral position, but trans stays in gear, Same for the rest if the gears, stick always returns back to neutral position, but trans never pops out of gear!! Ever! It's a coil spring and an eclip that will fix this problem, but I really don't feel like its that big of a deal, it's not hard to find the gears, and it isn't going to hurt anything. 

That is the only down side I can think of. My wife, who can not really drive a stick shift drove this truck with no problems. Clutch is extremely easy on the knees and engages very nicely! Nice smooth truck to drive! 

I'm asking $2000obo. NADA value on it is; $1500 fair, $2475 average, and $3250 high. 
I would also be interested in trading for guns. Not interested in any antique guns, but maybe a couple conceal carry sized 9mm or .380 or .357 mag or .38 spcl snub nose revolvers, big game rifles, carbine rifles, or tactical rifles. We could maybe works something out like a couple guns and some cash, or just straight up trade for multiple guns.

NEW NEVER FIRED!

This is the same rifle used by the navy seals for the raid on Osama!  Spikes Calico Jack Lower ALG Match Grade Trigger!  ONE 30 RD MAG PULL GEN 2 PMAG NEW IN THE WRAPPER INCLUDED!

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.

The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.

This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.

The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system.

The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled.

The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems.

Thanks for Looking!

I have for sale or trade a very unique Remington Model 1100 20 Gauge Youth model, 20 years old ( Mfg 1993 ). It is in 99% pristine condition never fired or loaded, this is a true safe queen, 21"" vent rib Remchoke barrel ,Full, Modified and Improved Cylider Chokes included, Checkered satin finish stock, none of that pressed checkered  polyurethane crap! Here's the most unique thing about this gun, it is engraved (etched) on both sides of the receiver with bird dogs and quail in flight, I have not been able to find this configuration on any website!  No box or papers .

Research Gunbroker and GunsAmerica and see what is available for remington 1100 LT 20 Gauge guns and the pricing, nothing offered will compare to my gun.

For those of you who do not know what the youth model is, the only difference is the youth model stock has a 13 1/4"" pull instead of the standard 14 1/4"" pull. 

 24 and 26"" Remchoke barrels for this LT 1100 available online.

I have two Bushmasters.  Would like to sell this to fund other things.
Only 80 rounds fired through this gun.  Rifle has flat-top upper, a 16"" CMV Chrome-lined 1/9 twist rate barrel, dust cover, and forward assist.  Included is one used 30 round USGI magazine.

This rifle was built before Remington bought Bushmaster, as the receiver is stamped ""Windham, ME"" -- Bushmasters built by Remington are stamped ""Ilion, NY"""

Here is a as new CZ 52 with very few rounds through it.  I bought it new several years ago and shot it very little, maybe 50 rounds.  The CZ 52's shoot the 7.62x25 tokarev round.  It comes with the holster, extra magazine and cleaning rod.  I'll toss in a box of ammo also as the ammo is sometimes hard to find.  Looks like the average price on gunbroker.com is around $335.00.  I am going to ask just $300.00 for gun and ammo.  Thanks for looking.

You get about 30 to 40 charges from a tank before it drops below 3000 psi and then you get it topped off at a dive shop for usually less than $10.

http://www.airforceairguns.com/CondorSS-s/73.htm

This is an Airforce “Condor” Model with a 18” German Lothar Walther .25 caliber barrel with an installed “LDC.” Comes as seen, for selling price or deduct $150 for the rings and scope. Comes with about 800 rounds of .25 cal pellets of different weights from 25 grains to 42 grains. Comes with charging accessories except for high pressure hose and scuba tank. I have the original box.

The Condor is for shooters who need a rifle that is not only more powerful than a spring-piston air gun, but is also more powerful than any other pre-charged pneumatic rifle. It is the most powerful pre-charged air gun on the market as it easily achieves 1250 feet per second in .22 caliber. The Condor is light weight (6.5 lbs) and offers adjustable power (600-1300fps depending on power setting, caliber, and pellet weight). Dial the power down for target shooting at close ranges, or dial the power up for long range small game hunting.
I have several PCP rifles and just decided to go to one that cost $2500, so selling one to get another.
This particular rifle will put 10 shots inside a quarter at 40 yards and punch through 1 1/2” of construction siding board + 1/2 piece of plywood at the same 40 yards. This is an adult air rifle and is extremely powerful. The internet shows people with these guns taking 180 lb. Hogs with one shot behind the ear.

Call me stupid, but I'm going back to Glocks. I like how I can do all the work on them myself with my unskilled monkey hands.

So, I'm getting rid of these 2 guns. Bought them both less than a month ago, paid $1200 each for them.

Full disclosure is the name of the game, so here goes.

Gun 1:

The first up for sell doesn't have the stock sights, grips, or mags. Since the 2 mags and rubber grips can be found for less than $50 online, I'm sitting at $1150 on it.

I had the sights removed to replace them with a 10-8 performance .375'' tall rear with .140 notch, and a Dawson .125 wide by .180 tall fiber optic sight.

I didn't install them because by the time the sights had come in I had decided to sell the gun and didn't want to risk dicking them up in the install.

I'm asking $1150  for this gun.

Gun 2:

The second one has the sights and grips, but no mags. So I'm at $1175.

This gun hasn't been fired either, but from hand-cycling it has a small rub mark on the slide. I'm guessing it is rubbing the dust cover.

I asked on a different forum about it and was basically told I was being a whiney-ass and it is just a cosmetic issue.

Plus, if you know anything about Springfield Armory customer service, it is the best in the business, and they will fix it if you have a problem.

Also, I tried to remove the rear sight and failed, I used a brass punch w/ tape over it, brass hammer, and a small table vice.

The brass hammer rubbed the lettering off the rear sight, but didn't scratch it or anything. I'll take detailed pics of everything.

Regardless, because of these things I'm knocking $100 off the price, and asking $1075.

These guns are pretty damn hard to get a hold of, I've looked on and off since I was 21 and just now found these in stock.

If you know anyone that wants one, feel free to direct them here. No trades.

This gun is in about 98% condition. It appears to be all matching except for the rear sight assembly. All of the commercial artillery guns were made up from surplus military parts and marked with Crown N proofs. This pistol does not have the usual “Germany” markings. It does have the adjustable front sight. The commercial magazine is unmarked. The holster is not marked and is in pretty rough condition. The barrel appears almost as new and the sideplate shows only minimal wear. The shoulder stock is numbered but is not matching and it bears a “Germany” marking. The 1920 Commercial Artillery was made in limited numbers and for a limited time span. Match this up with one of the 32 round snail drum magazines currently available and be the envy of all your gun collecting friends.  PAYMENT PAYPAL ONLY
