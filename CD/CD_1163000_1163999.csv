These stock sets are not easy to find and are not cheap! Why spend $1500 on a Romanian Wasr when you can own a Polytech for around the same price.

These uppers are amazing in quality but I am selling because I bought the black version and prefer it instead.

This upper has only been function tested, cleaned and stored.  It is absolutely as new as it gets.  All pics show wear and I can take more pics upon request.

Price is $1,600 shipped for the Upper, BCG, and Charging handle OR it will be $1,300 shipped without a BCG or CH... It will come in the box Daniel Defense ships their uppers in.


If you have any questions, just email me.  I accept Paypal (+4 for their Fees), cash if meeting face to face, and other options...I am relatively flexible.  This is an upper so it can be shipped to your door.  Know your NFA laws as this is a 10.3"" barreled upper receiver.


************I can also add the NiB BCG for the price of $300...it will not be for individual sell until the upper sells.  This is a good price since these sell for $400 all day...These are mil spec'd bolt carrier groups with Nickel inside of Boron coating...they are very slick, self lubricating, and high quality...known to be one of the best BCG's on the market."

The Springfield Armory Black Stainless 1911 is a piece of art. The stainless steel frame and slide are finished in matte black, then the flats are polished, leaving a subtle dark tone in the flats that looks like a custom finish. 

The pistol features G10 grips, adding to the striking looks. VZ grip tape was added to the front strap. Like all Springfield 1911's, it has a skeletonized aluminum match grade trigger with adjustable overtravel. This Black Stainless model is fitted with black-on-black combat sights. The pistol has an ambidextrous safety, not just for left-handed shooters, but also for competition shooters who need to shoot weak-hand. Front and rear slide serrations are also helpful for competition shooters.

Comes with three magazines, carrying case, and gun lock. Also comes with a Fobus holster.

Some Features
3-Dot Sight System: Like the 92FS, the M9A1 features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The front and backstraps of the frame are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. The frame of the M9A1 has a
 Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.The magazine well has an aggressive internal bevel to facilitate fast tactical reloads in combat situations. Developed for the sandy environments of Iraq and Afghanistan, this unique sand resistant magazine comes standard only on the M9A1.


The special PVD coating reduces friction, while the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of sand accumulation within the round column, greatly increasing
 the reliability and functioning of the M9A1 in desert or other extreme conditions."

The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine.  It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine.  First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel.  Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds.  Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about.

If your state permits, I have included the original magazine release parts so that you can return the rifle to its standard factory condition in a few minutes. A plug has been inserted behind the factory stock folding button to prevent the stock from folding inward to comply with CA law. This too can be removed to return the stock to factory condition.

Fully-ambidextrous operating controls instantly adapt the SCAR 17S to any user or any shooting position. The receiver-integrated MIL-STD 1913 optical rail plus three accessory rails enable mounting of a wide variety of scopes, electronic sights, tactical lights and lasers. This rifle does have marks on the picatinny rail from optics that were mounted. The plastic floor plates on the magazines have small holes where CA bullet button release tools were installed and then removed. I have also wrapped the bottom half of each magazine with black gaffers tape for better gripping. This too can easily be removed.

Included with the pistol and holster are two photographs. One of the Glen Line building taken in 1945 (Google it, it still exists today) and one photo of seven members of his group taken in front of the building.

Part of the frame on the right side behind the breechbolt is scarred which appears to be from improper disassembly at one point. The one magazine is nickel plated but is not SN matching.

574,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1163574,For Sale:  Winchester Model 1897 12 gauge M97 Take Down,"Cumming, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 400,"Listed On: Friday, September 6, 2013",Shotguns,Winchester                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"The Winchester Model 1897, or M97, is a classic Winchester take down shotgun built in 1912 chambered for 2 3/4 shells.  This is the platform that was invented by John Moses Browning.  It was very popular with American GI's in WWI, and it's use was protested by Germany because they felt it caused unnecessary suffering to those on the receiving end. (I found that quite amusing that anyone, or any country for that matter, would protest the use of a weapon because it would cause excessive suffering.....it's a war not a chess match right?  LOL)  You can see the finish in the pictures.  It's developed a pretty nice patina over the years.  There is one small rust spot about the size of a skittle candy on the barrel.  Inside the bore shows it's age and has some wear from years of use, but there are no visible nasty areas that I can see. (I don't have a bore scope so I have looked down the barrel using a flashing to illuminate it which is the best I can do with what I have on hand)  The forearm wood shows a good amount of usage wear, but is still intact with one 3 inch crack.  The stock itself is in decent shape, with one small hairline crack about 1 inch long.  The butt plate also has a crack. Mechanically it functions normally, the action is tight and crisp as it should be.  Inside the chamber shows normal usage wear patterns, nothing out of the ordinary for a 101 year old shotgun.  These guns are becoming more and more rare nowadays.  I have many pictures, these ads only allow for up to 3 pictures.  More available upon request, and I can take pictures of any particular part wanted.  $400 cash only, no trades.  

Also, I have had several inquiries about shipping this shotgun and out of state buyers wanting to pick it up face to face.  Current BATFE rules and regulations state I CANNOT sell a firearm to anyone not a resident of my home state (GA) without going through a licensed FFL dealer and filling out a form 4473.  I can ship it to your local FFL dealer of choice after receiving a copy of the FFL dealers license, and the buyer will have to pay the $25 outgoing FFL transfer fee from my local dealer.  It is C&R eligible.

Anyone who would like to see this shotgun in person is welcome to email and setup a time to do so. All meetings to view will take place locally at Bullseye Marksman Gun Club in Cumming, right off GA400 exit 13. I will need to see at a minimum a GA drivers license. This shotgun is listed by the BATFE as C&R eligible, so those holding a C&R license may have it shipped directly to them. Anyone else wanting shipping not holding a C&R license will have to use an FFL licensed dealer. As long as the ad is still up, the shotgun is still available."

Unlike most unconverted SAIGAs, it has the fire control group moved forward (to the standard AK47 location) which makes converting it to ""assault weapon"" configuration a snap. All you have to do is swap out the FCG ($25), file down the mag catch and you will then legally be able to use hicap AK47 mags. Takes 30 minutes. Some guns require bullet guides ($20) to feed reliably but it depends on the gun/mag combo. Sometimes you don't need it.

This is a quality Russian made AK47, made by Izhmash which is a much higher quality than most other Eastern Bloc AK47s that you see.  It has a 22"" chrome lined barrel, and wood furniture.

As mentioned it is NIB. Comes with cleaning rod, cleaning/oil accessories, and 5 rd mag. All still wrapped in protective paper.

Do not try to buy unless you are LEGAL TO PURCHASE firearms. If you have a CHL we can do face to face with a Bill of Sale. Otherwise we will go through a FFL."

When Texas undercover narcotics officers started looking for the perfect concealable pistol, they came to the premier Texas pistol manufacturers. Based on their input, STI has come up with the STI Shadow- a light weight pistol that is as reliable as it is concealable.

The classic slide is 3.0"" in length with rear cocking serrations & standard STI oversized ejection port. The 2 dot tritium night sights have been recessed into the slide and, along with the integral sight channel, provide the perfect compromise between easy sight acquisition and snag free carry. The STI Shadow is built on a forged aluminum STI officer sized frame with a stippled front strap. The grip includes a flat checkered polymer mainspring housing configured to provide excellent retention. The controls are STI’s single sided blued thumb safety and STI’s bobbed high-rise, blued, knuckle relief beavertail grip safety. The barrel is a 3.0"" fully supported STI ramped bull barrel. The STI Shadow comes standard with an STI RecoilMaster guide rod system, STI commander hammer, and patented STI International trigger system.

Model 700P LTR TWS, chambered only in .308 Win., features a slimmed down stock to improve portability and reduce weight.

I have kept this rifle in a pelican coffin, but will come to you without the case. Scope has original box, papers and bullet drop compensators. This rifle has had exactly 230 rounds through it and I have kept all the brass to reload. 

This IS a Police/Military weapon that is very rare on the civilian market. MSRP is $3763 for the stock set up, but this one is the upgraded version with the illuminated reticule on the scope.

I also have 20 150 grain tracer bullets that I pulled from a partial machine gun belt.
$800 value in factory ammo and $800 value in reloading supplies. A small quantity of large rifle primers may be purchased as well. All reloading supplies are in the sealed packaging, with the exception of 1 box of bullets.

I am interested in a partial trade for a quality, modern, lever action rifle in 45/70, 357 Mag or the like and possibly a Kel-Tech Sub2000 chambered for Glock 17 mags. Will take cash, trade value, gold or silver as payment.
