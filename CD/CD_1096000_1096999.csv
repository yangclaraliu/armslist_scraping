Don't wake up to a new Executive Order and regret not buying mags while you can!!

10 Lancer L5 translucent polymer mags with steel feed lips.  8 are gen. A1, 2 are gen A2 (bottom right two are A2, they are all physically the same).

Lancer's are considered superior by most to pmags because of the steel feed lips.  Meet/exceed military drop tests and for durability.  If you are not familiar with the brand, please feel free to research.  You will find these are high quality magazines.

These are lightly used.  All are 100% functional, drop free, and still really really stiff in the spring.  I still have the packaging/labels for all of them and can provide them if requested.

Price is very firm at $50 each, $500 for the lot.  Prefer to sell in lots of at least 5 for $250 so I'm not driving all over the metro area to do business.  

At sale, I will test currency with currency testing pen.  We will meet in an area that is compliant and respects the law with Denver local ordinances on mag capacity.

Probably 1500 rounds or so put through this, which isn't much considering that you are normally loading up 50 rounds at a time. First and only owner of this nice gun, and has been babied and well kept over the years I have owned it.

Get one of these while you still can! It's been specifically named in the new assault weapons ban, and you can bet if there is ""any"" sort of ban, this will be on it as the smallest magazine it can accept is 50 rounds!

Price if FIRM at $850, this is probably the cheapest Calico 9mm you will find on Armslist. CASH ONLY, I'm not a bank so I can't take cards and I don't want to take a check hoping it won't bounce. Buyer agrees to meet at Buds Gun Shop in Lexington, KY to do a proper FFL transfer of the firearm into your name. If you are a felon or have any reason for why you cannot own a firearm or have one transferred to you, then don't bother inquiring about the gun."

Polymeric Adsorption:

We bind a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene to each part to reduce friction and improve wear.

Much more than typical Parkerizing, phosphating or black oxide, Blacknitriding℠ is a thermal chemical diffusion of nitrogen and carbon into the surface of the steel.

It has a tiny rust spot on the piston tube housing, which can be replaced or polished off. The front sight is canted to one side the slightest bit (which is very common with all ak-47's).
This bad boy accepts all ak47 magazines and drums.
They are perfect for making galil clones (which look awesome!) And fetch big money.
The last picture is a Galil clone conversion! (looks awesome right?)
These rifles are extremely rare and were imported in the 90's to get around the ban, hence the stock and missing pistol grip.
The last picture is a stock photo of one that was converted using a tapco trigger and forend.  Very simple conversion!
Just the 40 round magazines are going for $100 dollars each right now, and I have two in this package! I will even throw in a cheap (kind of broken) plastic rifle case!
These rifles are also very accurate compared to a traditional ak-47's. I've seen these rifles sell for as much as $1,500+on gunbroker.

Perfect in every way except the finish behind the forward assist is spotty. Contacted the retailer to exchange, but they said wait is 2 months due to backorders and I already waited near that long for this one. If you want a decent upper and don't mind the finish in this one section this would fit the bill. See pictures below. Description from manufacturer is below:

The MUR is a flattop upper receiver with thicker walls than a standard upper to provide a more rigid platform for greater stability, better accuracy, longer service life, and improved reliability. Precision machined from a fully heat-treated and cryogenically stress-relieved aluminum forging, before hand finishing to final dimensions. All critical interface points are 100% compatible with mil-spec select-fire AR-15/M16/M4 components and lower receivers, and will fit most commercial semi-auto lowers. A slick, dry-lube coating over the hard-anodized finish further guards against surface wear and helps ensure smooth operation of bolt/carrier and other internal components. Comes with true MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail with 13 cross-slots, plus forward assist and ejection port door pre-installed. Gunsmith installation recommended. Includes M4-type feed cuts

Can ship if buyer pays shipping costs. Can take cash face to face or USPS money order or discreet PayPal plus fees for shipping."

All three mags are 30 round magazines, it also comes with a 5 round magazine. The scope rings came with the Mini-14 and are both brand new. The reason I took a picture of the serial number is to prove that this gun is chambered in 5.56. So unlike it's Target counterpart, this Mini-14 can shoot both .223 and 5.56. 1200.00 or best offer. I'm not desperate to sell it, but I would like to sell it as soon as possible. Willing to make a trade.

So, I have 500 rds of 5.56 federal green tip steel core ammo. I have zero reason that I need to get rid of this. The only thing I shoot .223/5.56 for is hunting coyotes, predator's or other varmints. I very seldom target shoot and don't have a specific need for it. So being that I know that many people really like to stock pile this ammo and now with laws being proposed to stop the sale of any type of armor piercing type ammo the availability of this ammo is going to be slim to none for the future.  If someone has some type of brass case FMJ bulk ammo such as PMC, Federal, Lake City, Remington, Hornaday or any other type of decent none reloaded ammo and would be interested in trading a larger quantity of for the 500 rds of ammo that I have please get a hold of me. 

To clarify I am not interested in trading for 50 extra rounds,  1-200 extra rounds of a cheap bulk ammo isn't worth the time and effort to meet someone and trade.  If you happen to have some higher grade ammo such as a match grade, varmint or other types of .223/5.56 hunting ammo and are interested please contact me as I will entertain offers.  I would be interested in some type of heavier grain ammo maybe some 75 grain Hornady Vmax .

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .22lr ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't delay.

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales. 2 box minimum on orders I have to ship.

FYI: Colorado House passes gun-control measures
DENVER (AP) - Limits on the size of ammunition magazines and universal background checks passed the Colorado House on Monday, during a second day of emotional debates that has drawn attention from the White House as lawmakers try to address recent mass shootings.
The bills were among four that the Democratic-controlled House passed amid strong resistance from Republicans, who were joined by a few Democrats to make some of the votes close.
The proposed ammunition restrictions limit magazines to 15 rounds for firearms, and eight for shotguns. Three Democrats joined all Republicans voting no on the bill, but the proposal passed 34-31.

Magpul has posted that they will withdraw their facility from Colorado.  These mags will be hard to find in the interim if Magpul leaves CO.

""Although the bill has been amended to exempt manufacturers, Magpul still plans to leave the state if the measure banning high-capacity magazines passes."" 
""We can't disappoint our customers nor ignore our convictions. Anyone who votes in favor of this bill votes to drive over 600 jobs out of [Colorado],"" the company said in a post on its Facebook page Thursday.

Scope mount included. Here is the specs:


The AK-54R rifles are built upon Category 1 (nice, minty, un issued) Romanian PSL rifle parts kits, using a special receiver that allows for the use of regular AKM type butt stocks and pistol grips. They also feature a correct, and fully functional, scope mount, installed on the left side of the receiver . The barrel is shortened to 16.5 inches, and is re-profiled, allowing the gas block and handguard retainer to be moved rearward, so that standard AKM length gas pistons (we use a Tapco stainless unit, which provides an extra 922r compliance part) and standard AKM type handguards can be used! The idea is simply to give the end user an AKM sized package that delivers the powerful punch of the 7.62x54R cartridge. This initial batch of rifles will feature a non-pinned Romanian PSL muzzle device, on 14x1 LH threads, K-VAR synthetic furniture, in plum, beautiful gun kote finish . 

These are very hard to come by. Plus the ammo is still affordable. I can add ammo for the right deal. More pics upon request. No trades 1500 OBO. Buyer must have IN DL and LTCH. FTF in Indy area."

...M16 bolt carriers are not designed and intended solely and exclusively for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun and are not any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled.  Further, an M16 bolt carrier is not a firearm as defined in the GCA or a machinegun as defined in the NFA.  An M16 bolt carrier is simply a machinegun part and as such its domestic sale and possession is unregulated under the Federal firearms laws.  It is not unlawful to utilize a M16 machinegun bolt carrier in a semiautomatic AR15 type rifle.
