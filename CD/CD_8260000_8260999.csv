Comes with 2 magazines and a kydex holster. Great trigger on these guns. Can be shipped to your FFL dealer.
The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day, snag-free carry.
Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.
The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.
Note- Some CZ-USA dealers order special versions that vary from the standard configuration. This might be a difference in sights, safety mechanisms, finish or accessory package. From time to time you may find a P-07 with an extended barrel, tactical light, tritium sights or safety levers only. There are a number of special versions we ship throughout the year."

Bore is bright and shiny with lots of life remaining. 
here are two kinds of 30 Cal. carbines … . One that loses its value over time ( a commercially made rifle ), and one that is an investment….that is, it will at least HOLD its value, and likely INCREASE in value over time. ( a genuine U.S Carbine .Caliber 30 M1 rifle , made during WWII). You DO get what you pay for
As well as being an important part of the United States Military history, you can defend your home and family with it. It is also easy for anyone in the family to shoot…. Very controllable, with plenty of punch ( more muzzle energy than a .44 magnum ).  Just as important, you can find parts for it if something needs to be replaced ( not always true with a commercially made rifle ).   
The rifles that I have listed from my collection, are all investment quality USGI rifles .  You decide what will be best for you in the long run…"

The BFSIII™ for HK is a 3-Position Trigger. In position 3 it will fire 1 round on Pull and 1 round on Release. This makes it the fastest semi-automatic trigger on the market. The BFSIII™ is ideal for Tactical and Competition use. The BFSIII™ provides greatly reduced split times between rounds and the ability to place two separate shots into a tighter group.
Position 1 – Safe –Will not fire.
Position 2 – Semi – Fires 1 round per pull.
Position 3 – Binary – Fires 1 round on pull and 1 round on release."

With the CZ grip angle, the P-10 avoids that ‘brick-in-the-hand’ feeling that has plagued many in the striker-fired genre, allowing it to point naturally. A mild palm swell, deep beavertail and three interchangeable backstraps make the P-10 fit a wide variety of hands as if it were built for them. Because it was.So many striker-fired pistols do many things right, falling short when it comes time to pull the trigger. The P-10’s trigger is designed to minimize creep and stacking, and after initial break-in averages a clean 4.5-5 lb pull and rebounds with a short, positive reset — meaning single shots can be meticulously placed while follow-ups are effortless. Built to withstand the rigors of military use, its fiber-reinforced polymer frame and hardy nitride finish are made for the daily grind. A generous trigger guard allows use with gloved hands while being undercut to allow as high a grip as possible, and a set of metal tactical sights allow for one-handed manipulation of the slide on a belt. Like all CZ pistols, the P-10 is built with CZ's legendary cold hammer forged barrel. The ‘C’ in the name indicates that it is compact in both frame and slide size, and magazines are of the same family as the hammer-fired P-07, meaning the P-10 C holds 15+1 in 9mm in a flush-fitting mag with extended bases allowing 17+1. Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market.

But didnt do well in that market . The unintended market it took off fur trappers of Hudson bay and the Alaskan fisherman bought these that is why they are a hard to find item. The reason why these did well in these markets was simple they did not jam in extreme cold weather. Mine isnt in mint condition for a gun that is older than me. If you look on International gun auction you can see why these are getting harder to find ,collectors are grabbing them up. I could put it there ,but a firearm needs to be shot not stored in a vault ."

Listing was from a “registered user” use claimed to be a dealer. Sent me his FFL info and in turn I sent him the FFL info to my local licensed dealer. He requested a USPS Money order and so away I sent one, $990. Two days later he sent me a text stating he was waiting on the funds to clear his bank. When they cleared he stated he was trying to find the original paperwork as ATF was requesting it, which is complete bullshit because they don’t request that information. He sent me a check last week for $1850.55 and said not to worry about the fact that it was for more...his accountant made a mistake and for the inconvenience to just keep it.I filed a report with my local police department, the FBI through ic3.gov and the ATF, as Armslist is not help. I’ve bought, sold and traded hundreds of firearms through various avenues (armslist, Texas Gun Trader, gun broker). No more! I’ve taken all my listings down off armslist and I will never purchase another firearm unless it is new from a trusted dealer or local retail location. Another issue, back in Texas. I met a guy to purchase a Glock 19, signed a bill of sale. Later I called ATF to check the gun as I do all of my used Purchases, to find out it was stolen. I had to hand over the gun and lost out on money on that deal as well. Beware who deal with and always call the serial number into ATF during the transaction. People these days are shady, liars, theives and most of all dishonest! It’s a shame!"
