I am asking $0.40 (forty cents) a bullet for them.  They are loaded with 4.2gr Titegroup powder in standard once fired brass that my father tumbled, full length sized and deprimed, then belled and reprimed before topping them with 140gr flat-nosed wad cutter Laser-Cast bullet heads.  They shot amazingly through my Taurus; maximum load of Titegroup powder in these send them out of a 7.7"" barrel at 919fps as listed in the Hodgdon 2013 Annual Manual.

I have several hundred sitting here but they went fast last time I posted them so get them while they're hot.  This is the remainder of my personal supply so once they are gone there will be no more.

Please send any and all offers; trades for a canoe or non-professional kayak, money plus trade, etc..

I have a like new (75 rds) Benelli Super Black Eagle 2 with Comfort Tech stock.

This is the most versatile shotgun out there. Great for turkey, goose, ducks, dove, and pheasant. Also amazing for trap and sporting clays 

These sell new for $1749 plus the 4.7% sales tax. 

Look at the link above for info on the amazing shotgun. 

The Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility, and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. Utilizing the proven Benelli Inertia Driven bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"", and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments. The Super Black Eagle II also incorporates some basic improvements, like the ComforTech system which reduces recoil up to 48% without adding any moving parts or weight. Compared to competing brands, the Benelli weighs 13 to 15% less on average; that's more than a pound less! The ComforTech system reduces muzzle climb by 15% for fast follow-up shots, which allows shooters to get back on target up to 69% faster than the competition. The Super Black Eagle II is the quickest-shooting, most reliable shotgun ever."

 The FN FNS-9 is the latest handgun innovation by FN Herstal.

 Additionally, the well thought out design of the FNS results in a stable, highly ergonomic and ambidextrous pistol that is easy to operate.
 Fast and Accurate Shooting
 The pre-loaded striker mechanism of the pistol means that energy has been pre-loaded partially. This ensures a short and light trigger pull identical for all shots allowing fast and accurate shooting.
 The FNS has a low bore axis providing minimized perceived recoil and reducing muzzle rise for a perfect weapon controllability.
 The handgun features a newly designed three-dot combat sights with deep rear sight notch which improved significantly the accuracy."

Please note that the Hydraulic Pump & Foot Pedal are NOT included with this listing.   

One reloader is set up for 0.410 and the other is a 20 gauge.  Each has its own hydraulic piston with male-end coupling. You are bidding on BOTH reloaders together as a package deal.  In other words, the listed price gets you both reloading stations.  I've never utilized the loaders personally as I inherited them.  However, I have taken them to several local sporting goods stores for appraisals and have gotten positive feedback concerning their condition.  They are used with minor wear and tear, but these babies are made with good old-fashioned metal and appear to be in decent shape.  Please look at the photos to verify condition, description, and all included parts. I did notice that the pre-crimper (spindex) is missing from the 410 bore machine.  Haven't gotten around to replacing it, but I found a replacement order page for the part (about $10) on MEC's site: http://www.mecreloaders.com/Order/OrderItem.asp?PartNbr=REDACTED&Type=P&PageId=762RPartsList.asp

This is an early Colt Model 1903 .32 Pocket Hammerless.this pistol has several early features including the longer 4"" barrel and the seperate barrel bushing. This handsome gun is elaborately engraved in a lovely floral scroll pattern and has gold wire inlay on both sides of the frame and slide. The top of the slide also has what appears to be the U.S. Presidential Seal engraved and filled with gold wash. The engraving is not factory original but is perfectly executed and easily equal to that of a factory engraved gun. The grips are ivory with flush Colt gold medallions. Overall condition is extremely nice and the pistol retains almost 100% of the blue finish (there are only a very few light handling marks keeping it from being perfect). The mechanics appear to be in perfect working order. The bore is the only weak point as it is frosted throughout, apparently put away without proper cleaning. The serial number places production in about 1908. Overall, a great gun and an exceptionally handsome pistol!"

We also supply our products to several special forces units and law enforcement teams worldwide.

This kit is designed with ease of use and professional end results in mind.

Contained inside are 7 grams (1⁄4 Ounce) of our green luminescent powder and 5 ml (1.69 US Fluid Ounces) of our specially designed binder compound.

Buy online at http://www.GunGlow.com

Simply mix the two components together to achieve a bright glowing paste that dries to with a strong, hard wearing finish.

Our cutting edge luminescent material is specifically designed for use with weapons systems. The use of a glow in the dark marker on gun sight systems aids the use of these systems in nighttime and low light conditions.

Shooting tests prove sights equipped with these glowing markers are easier to see and more accurate than instinctive shooting with standard black or iron sights. 

Used by leading weapon manufacturers, law enforcement and special forces worldwide. Gun Glow has proven itself again and again."
