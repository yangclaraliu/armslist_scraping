DON’T YOU THINK ITS TIME YOUR GUN MONEY WENT FURTHER?

When it comes to handguns, what are your hard earned dollars getting you these days? A (probably over priced) gun and what, maybe 1 magazine? For the kind of money your typical “popular” semi-automatic pistol is going to set you back, wouldn’t you like to get more bang for your buck?

It is for this reason that Amaroq Armaments is excited to bring you the Canik 55 TP-9. This is a top of the line polymer framed, striker-fire, 9mm pistol made in Turkey. It is designed with reliability and ergonomics as top priorities. The TP-9 comes from Canik’s ISO 9000 certified factory in a strong plastic case, with two 17 round mags for plenty of self-defense firepower. A spare backstrap is also included for fit flexibility. Every single outer steel part is poly coated to prevent corrosion and to help lubricate the slide and frame. The TP-9 also features a black chrome lined - cold forged barrel, an ambidextrous top-slide-mounted de-cocker for super-safe carry, click adjustable 3 dot sighting system, cocking indicator and a front accessory rail for all your accessories!

Caliber: 9mm.
Weight: 1.6 pounds.

Barrel length: 4 inches.
Overall Length: 7.25 inches.

Canik is a subsidiary of Samsun Yurt Savunma, one of Turkey’s biggest defense contractors. This is not some gimmicky knock-off. This is an incredibly well made and durable gun that is sure to stand up to the toughest abuse you can throw at it.

Best of all, since you are saving several hundred dollars (and still getting a quality product) you will have much more capital left over to purchase ammo! You will not find a better high capacity 9mm semi-auto pistol on the market.

Why train with airsoft? Airsoft is an realistic training alternative to actual firearms that is both more affordable and safer than using live ammunition. We customizes all of our airsoft pistols to make them as realistic as possible while still keeping them affordable. While our pistols may feel and act realistic they only fire harmless plastic BB's allowing for you to practice simulated aggressor scenarios that would not normally be done with real firearms.

Barrel length-- ---18.5""
Total capacity ----6+6+1
Weight empty ----6.9lbs
Weight loaded ---8.5lbs
Length------------ 26.1""
Height------------- 7""

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

You can read a review of this model here: GunBlast.com Review 

The DT Sport proved to be one hundred percent reliable, as expected. The carbine fed, fired, and ejected every cartridge perfectly. Accuracy was excellent, especially considering the mil-spec trigger. I do much better work with a match trigger, such as the Alexander or Timney, but this carbine is built for fighting, and the trigger is well-suited to that task. The AR-15 is a wonderful concept, and Del-Ton executes it very well. The Del-Ton rifles are built very well, and just because the DT Sport is one of the most affordable AR-15 carbines available, does not mean that it sacrifices on quality. The DT Sport has everything that you need, and nothing that you don’t. It performs as well as rifles costing three times the price, and buying a basic rifle such as this leaves a lot more cash to purchase a good optic, plenty of extra magazines, and ammunition. You can’t have too much ammunition. The stuff keeps well, needs no refrigeration, and several thousand rounds will fit neatly under your bed. Buy it while you still can.

It was purchased as new in box. I didn't like the look of the cheap synthetic stock and the heavy 3 lbs trigger pull and it suffered the accuracy. So I had my gunsmith adjusted the trigger down to 12 oz ( very light )professionally,but it can till be adjust up to 3 lbs safely when carrying around for hunting. Then he bedded the stock, and free floated the barrel. It has woodland/tiger stripes camouflage finish.
After the trigger adjustment's done, the gun shoots very well with cheap CCI Blazer 40gr .22lr. The target shows 5 shot groups at 25 yards. Almost went through the same hole. The rifle had exact 50 rounds through it. No more. No less. Basically it is just a new rifle, which still 99% condition. The original box, all paperwork: warranty card, manual are included.
What are so special about a factory Marlin XT-22 ?
*The gun is 100% American made, Marlin did a very good job on it.
*The trigger is fully adjustable, Pro-Fire series trigger design ( like the Accu-trigger on Savage's ).
*Microgroove barrel rifling.
But, what made my gun even more special over the factory's one?
* Trigger job is already done on this rifle, 1.1lbs pull with no creep and travel. It breaks like glass.
*Camouflage painting.
*Extended picatinny rail. 25MOA rise. Not a Chinese's crap on Ebay. This rail is 100%, high quality material, American made. And it isn't cheap.

Its take 12 gauge 2 3/4"" - 3"" shells. For those who dont know what a Stoeger shotgun is....
""Stoeger is a Turkish made semi- auto shotgun. It is based on benelli's inertia system which has proven to be extremely reliable in harsh hunting conditions. As opposed to a gas systems which use gases from the firing of the shotgun to cycle the action, the inertia systm uses the recoil and the actual force from the discharged shell to cycle it. Since there are no gases escaping or being used they are known for being extremely ""clean"" guns. Meaning they can go long periods without cleaning. Some people feel there is more felt recoil than in a gas gun but trade that off for the reliability. Similar guns are the benelli m2 and franchi I12. Both are considerabley more expensive and made in Italy.""
The shotgun functions and works very nicely. It has some minor wear and tear on it ie, a small scratch on the receiver.

So the serial on the side of the gun is 4982xx so did some rough research via colt’s look up and it’s a 1918 MODEL 1911 MILITARY so a pretty early model. I’m not a gun expert so don’t take my advice on it. But what I know about the gun is:

1. Its been rebuilt and blued before me maybe more than once. There are some modern parts and upgrades on it.
2. Don’t know the round count as I’m the 4 or 5 owners. But it’s a great shooter.
3. In pretty good condition still.
4. Comes with 1 mag.
5. Pretty sure this was a US Army gun or a government gun. Says “United States Property” on it, which is pretty cool.

So I’m looking to trade for another hand gun (something in a 9mm or .45 or a nice wheel gun) or maybe an AR15 or a nice bolt in .308, or FAL or something interesting or nice looking, I can add cash if need . I’m open to cash offers too or part trade +/- cash. Asking $1300obo? Not sure about how much its worth so shoot me an offer or trade.

No rush to trade or sell. If you have any questions let me know. Or if you know any information or value on it, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

Comes with: Two 17 round Magazines, two 10 round Magazines, top of the line Holster (High Noon Holster's Closing Argument - cost me $120!), Case, Safety System Key, and Manual.

I am the original owner, purchased new in late 2004. Exactly 3,040 rounds fired with only 4 malfunctions (all were magazine related and occured around the 300-500 round mark, Taurus sent me a new mag and there have been no troubles since) so this is a supremely reliable weapon. Not that there is anything to worry about though thanks to Taurus' Lifetime Warranty.

This gun has always been cleaned right after every session. There is holster wear on the front and rear corners of the gun as well as some missing finish on the top of the rear slight, and some light scratches here and there. It's been used but not abused.

This pistol caliber carbine is a blast to shoot, VERY accurate -- silver dollar size groups with iron sights at 50+ yds . Comes with 2 factory 10 round mags, sling, and the clips on the stock to hold 2 extra mags. 
Great self defense gun -- short, easy to manipulate, packs a good punch but the 9mm won't over-penetrate through your neighbors house (if you ever have to use it for self defense indoors). 
I was getting 1300-1400fps with regular loads, and it is factory rated for +P ammunition as well. All my guns are meticulously maintained with Frog Lube lubricants (google it if you don't know what it is).
It's a ton of fun to shoot and best of all, with 9mm ammo, you can actually afford to shoot it!

No low-ballers, I'm not in a hurry to sell. 
Please don't bother e-mailing me to ask if it's available, I'll take down the ad after it sells.

I've been doing research on this beautiful gun and this is a summary of what ive put together: It was ordered by the Army during WWI and manufactured in the third fiscal quarter of 1918. The 333XXX serial number indicates it was built after Colt started doing the Black finish, which is consistent with the way the finish looks and has worn, and it shows no arsenal rebuild marks. It was later issued with its original magazine to a Marine Naval Aviator and carried during WWII in the Pacific Theatre with an additional 2 magazines made as part of a Colt contract by a company called Risdon. As was possible at the time, the service member chose to purchase the gun from the government and took it home back home, in this case Pensacola, FL. It was then put away in condition 1, in its holster with 7 rounds of Federal ammo manufactured in 1942. 

I came across this gun at the estate sale of the son of the aforementioned Marine. I have the gun, the holster, the original WWI magazine, the 2 WWII magazines, the black USMC stamped holster, and the 7 rounds it was stored with for 70 years (which have developed a fascinating patina on the copper jacket). After getting it, I inspected it, cleaned it, lubed it and being impressed by the condition, I put 140 rounds of 230 gr fmj through it without a single hiccup using the WWI and WWII magazines. It does hand cycle wwb jhp, but I have not fired any. It has fired perfectly for me and is a true testament to old American craftsmanship and the perfection of JMB's design.
As can be imagined with a gun that is almost 100 years old and was carried in at least one if not both World Wars, it is not perfect. It has some scratches around the slide stop and the hammer was slightly shortened (to prevent hammer bite, which was an issue later addressed with the A1 at the request of our veterans). Also, the WWI magazine does not drop free, but otherwise functions perfectly. There is no rust anywhere on it, the barrel rifling is sharp and it shoots almost as well as my Kimbers. I believe that the difference is in the sights and not in the accuracy of the gun itself. It has a real soul that you can feel when you hold it. It sounds strange but it is the only way I can explain how it feels. 

I can send more pictures upon request. I'm more than happy to show the gun to serious prospective buyers, or even meet at the range for test shooting. 
Happy to ship to your friendly local FFL if necessary. 
I am asking $1999 for the complete package:
The gun itself is valued at $2050 according to the 33rd Edition of Fjestad's Blue Book of Gun Values. The rare holster is valued at $200, the WWI mag at $100, and each of the WWII mags at $50 each, for a total value of $2450. I am selling it because I am not a collector, I could use some cash right now, and I believe it could be truly appreciated for everything that it is as the crown jewel to the right collection.

If you are interested please feel free to contact me anytime day or night. Text preferred.
