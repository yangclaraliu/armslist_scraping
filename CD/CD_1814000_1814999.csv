Great package, beautiful gun.  Hate to sell it but I need the money because I am getting married soon.  The gun is Variant 1 and only has 200 rounds down the barrel.  It has been meticulously cleaned and cared for. The gun also comes with its original box/paperwork/lock/shell casing from factory firing as well as all of the original trigger parts/hammer from before the match trigger system.

Also willing to throw in around 70rds of 9mm ammo in with it (a mix of personal defense and target).  Will post pictures later when I am off work but you can always contact me and I will send pictures to you.

So, with the pistol retailing for $952
Match trigger for $139 plus shipping
Five 15 rd mags (5x$60) for $300
About $30-$40 in ammo
I have about $1400 invested.

126,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1814126,"For Sale:  45 AUTO RIM +P WADCUTTER ANTI-PERSONNEL - 225 gr. Hard Cast Wadcutter @ 1,125 fps - 20 Round Box","azusa, California, United States",$ 31,"Listed On: Thursday, June 27, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"http://extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=294

 This 225gr. full profile wad cutter, 45 auto rim +P, is the most deadly load ever devised for the 45 auto rim cartridge. It utilizes the same bullet as our 45 colt ANTI-PERSONNEL ammunition (Item 3I) and because of popular request to have that bullet loaded into 45 auto rim ammo, here it is.

This bullet will penetrate around 30 inches in flesh and bone and makes a horrific permanent crush cavity because of its wad cutter profile. This load is the power/pressure equivalent of 45 ACP +P+ (otherwise known as 45 Super) and is safe to use in all modern 45 ACP revolvers including any post war 1917 model revolver in normal operating condition.

Flash suppressed powders are used in this ammo so the shooter will not be blinded by his own gunfire and this is a tactical advantage as roughly 95% of all civilian shootings in the U.S. happen in low light when the criminal element is at work.

The 225gr. wad cutter bullet is hard cast (not lead) and is properly lubed and will not substantially lead foul your barrel even after extensive shooting sessions, nor will the bullet fragment, smear or mushroom on impact with flesh and bone, thus insuring very straight and deep penetration with a consistent crush cavity throughout its path."

This does not have the box but has never been carried other than putting it on in the house. Never has left the house. Has been in my safe for about a year. 
The item is in perfect condition still hasn't been broken in except for one small scratch across the outside of the holster near the thumb break. I tried to show it in the picture. It was from one of my rifles leaning against it. Other than that the thing is brand new. 


This will fit Glocks 17, 19, 22, 23, 31, 32, 26, 27, 33,34 & 35.

Our Miami Classic™ is quite possibly the most imitated shoulder holster system in the world. A direct descendant of the original shoulder system first introduced by Galco in 1970 (then the Famous Jackass Leather Company), the Miami Classic has since become the favorite of professionals worldwide. 

A key component of this patented shoulder system is its spider harness. All four points of the spider harness pivot independently and are connected by our unique clover shaped Flexalon™ swivel back plate, which is a Galco trademark. This results in a perfect fit and lasting comfort for all sizes and shapes.

This system is constructed of premium saddle leather and includes holster, harness, ammo carrier and a set of system screws. The Miami Classic is fully modular. Optional accessories and components may be purchased separately.

Made for semiautomatic pistols and some revolvers, the Miami Classic is available in right hand draw in tan or black finish.



Harness fits chests to 52""."

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

You will not find one like this with the miles unless you spend tons more. Its riding season now, the hotter it gets this bike will go up in price as do other ones with tons of miles. The bike is still all stock, nothing has been messed with. I bought it from a guy who was in the military and no longer wanted it due to health issues. I would love to keep it longer but I work all day and the wife hates it when im on it due to people not looking for bikers. (Cant Blame Her)

Anyways I just spent alot on the bike to have it all cleaned up, a major tune up and now its ready to ride. 

You will not be dissapointed. This bike is like new. And YES I do have a clean & clear title in my hand.

The Remington is in VERY good shape and has hardly been shot, it has been laying around mostly as 12 gauge home protection now. Here is what I know about it:

The Remington 870 Competition Trap was a single shot competition trap shotgun that is equipped with a special gas recoil reduction system. It was basically a hybrid of the 870 and 1100. However, only about 5500 were made between 1981-86. Since over 9,000,000 M870s have been made to date, the Comp Trap is a RARE variant. 

Mint ones can easily sell for over $600, although I've read reports of people picking them up for as low as $300 from unsuspecting sellers. 

That's the basics of it, I'm not ""unsuspecting"" so do not try to low ball me... I also have a brand new hard case and a near full box of shells to go with it and I will let it go for $450, remember this is one of only 5500 made in the early 80's and is in excellent condition.  I would also consider trading for a Smith & Wesson .380 Bodyguard!

I am currently looking to sell a custom-built AR-15 that is 100% Massachusetts Compliant. I purchased this gun from another private owner, and it is a beautifully built weapon. The previous owner built it himself, and put less than 200 rounds through it. I myself have put about 100 rounds through it. It handles incredibly well, and like I said, it is a beautifully built gun. I unfortunately am selling it because I do not want to get caught up in all the not-so-distant-future law changes coming down the line, and also because I am looking for a second gun similar to the 30-06 I already have. I own several other weapons, and am leaning more towards hunting rifles such as Remmingtons and Rugers than the AR's now. Anyways, here is what you would get if you decide to purchase the gun:

DPMS Upper, Black
Solid/Non-Collapsible Stock, Black
360-degree Picatinny Rail system, Black
MAGPUL MOE RUG Front Grip, Olive Greeb
MAGPUL MOE AR-15 Pistol Grip, Olive Green
DPMS Panther Arms AR-15 Lower (.223/5.56x45 CAL) ,Black # DM19468K
40 rounds of TulAmmo 55Grain FMJ .223 
80 Rounds of Independence 55Grain FMJ 5.56x45mm
1 package of A-Zoom .223Rem. Snap Caps Trainers (2pk)
1 10-round PMAG MAGPUL iNDUSTRIES MAGAZINE, FOR .223 AND/OR 5.56x45 ammo
(Approx $100 worth of ammo total)

I can meet you (the buyer) at a FFL/dealer store, but if it is over 30 miles from the Springfield area, I just ask that you pay for the transfer/paperwork fees. I believe it is is still $25. Please keep in mind, I am only selling to someone legal. As suprising as it may sound, I received several requests before from people asking me to seel to them so they can have a gun for ""when their LTC comes in...""...LEGAL SALES ONLY. Also, please, I am not looking for trades, just for payment on this sale. 

If you have any questions, please contact me at your earliest convenience. Thank you, I look forward to hearing from you!

This is slightly used Ruger Mini-14 Tactical rifle chambered for .223. For decades, Ruger Mini-14 rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities.

Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles. A Garand-Style Action with breechbolt locking system, a fixed-piston gas system and self-cleaning moving gas cylinder gives unparalleled reliability under harsh operating conditions.

The accurate sighting system has a ghost ring adjustable rear aperture sight and a protected, non-glare post front sight. This rifle features an adjustable, side folding stock and rubberized pistol grip.
