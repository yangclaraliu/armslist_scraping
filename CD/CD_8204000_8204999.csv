14,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8204014,For Sale:  Swedish M41b Sniper Rifle W/ Original 4x Ajack Scope,"Virginia, Virginia, United States","$ 1,450","Listed On: Saturday, April 7, 2018",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Here's a sniper rifle that is considered to have been perhaps the finest of its day. This is a Swedish M41B. Originally developed during WWII as the M41, the M41B is an upgraded version and like the M41 is based on the famous M96 Swedish Mauser. The sniper rifles were taken from existing stocks of M96 service rifles that were specially selected for superior accuracy. A special Jackenroll short rail scope base was then attached to the left side of the receiver to which a matching mount was hand fitted. This rifle carries the original WWII era German made AJACK 4x90 scope (Sweden remained neutral during WWII and continued some trade with Germany). The bolt handle is bent downward to avoid interference with the scope. Beginning in 1955 the M41 rifles were updated to M41B configuration which included a set screw added to the Jackenroll base to limit forward travel of the mount and the addition of a special M/55 dial type rear sight that was calibrated from 100 to 600 meters for the current service cartridge.This rifle is in very good overall condition. It was built using a Carl Gustaf M/96 originally manufactured in 1911. The receiver, barrel, bolt assembly, scope base & scope mount are correctly serial numbered to match. The buttplate is also matching however the stock is unnumbered and appears to be an excellent condition Swedish arsenal replacement. The handguard and bolt stop are non-matching which is fairly typical as most M41B rifles are found with only the matching components listed above (receiver/barrel/bolt/scope mount). The arsenal finish rates about 92-94% with some normal handling and storage wear but no rust or pitting. There is an import mark but it is stamped midway along the bottom of the barrel and is completely hidden until the action is pulled from the stock. The stock is in excellent condition and free of cracks, chips or repairs. The wood does not appear refinished but is free of any inspection stampings. This rifle is in excellent mechanical condition with everything working properly. The bore is very good with strong, bright rifling. The AJACK scope is in good working order and has bright, clear optics. The rifle comes with lens covers, a standard issue Swedish sling with quick release clip, front sight hood, and cleaning rod. This is a nice looking rifle that should be a lot of fun to shoot!Buyer pays $25.00 shipping."

58,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8204058,For Sale:  Swedish M41b Sniper Rifle W/ Original 4x Ajack Scope,"Virginia, Virginia, United States","$ 1,435","Listed On: Saturday, April 7, 2018",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"Here's a sniper rifle that is considered to have been perhaps the finest of its day. This is a Swedish M41B. Originally developed during WWII as the M41, the M41B is an upgraded version and like the M41 is based on the famous M96 Swedish Mauser. The sniper rifles were taken from existing stocks of M96 service rifles that were specially selected for superior accuracy. A special Jackenroll short rail scope base was then attached to the left side of the receiver to which a matching mount was hand fitted. This rifle carries the original WWII era German made AJACK 4x90 scope (Sweden remained neutral during WWII and continued some trade with Germany). The bolt handle is bent downward to avoid interference with the scope. Beginning in 1955 the M41 rifles were updated to M41B configuration which included a set screw added to the Jackenroll base to limit forward travel of the mount and the addition of a special M/55 dial type rear sight that was calibrated from 100 to 600 meters for the current service cartridge.This rifle is in very good overall condition. It was built using a Carl Gustaf M/96 originally manufactured in 1911. The receiver, barrel, bolt assembly, scope base & scope mount are correctly serial numbered to match. The buttplate is also matching however the stock is unnumbered and appears to be an excellent condition Swedish arsenal replacement. The handguard and bolt stop are non-matching which is fairly typical as most M41B rifles are found with only the matching components listed above (receiver/barrel/bolt/scope mount). The arsenal finish rates about 92-94% with some normal handling and storage wear but no rust or pitting. There is an import mark but it is stamped midway along the bottom of the barrel and is completely hidden until the action is pulled from the stock. The stock is in excellent condition and free of cracks, chips or repairs. The wood does not appear refinished but is free of any inspection stampings. This rifle is in excellent mechanical condition with everything working properly. The bore is very good with strong, bright rifling. The AJACK scope is in good working order and has bright, clear optics. The rifle comes with lens covers, a standard issue Swedish sling with quick release clip, front sight hood, and cleaning rod. This is a nice looking rifle that should be a lot of fun to shoot!Buyer pays $25.00 shipping."

This is a Swedish M41B. Originally developed during WWII as the M41, the M41B is an upgraded version and like the M41 is based on the famous M96 Swedish Mauser. The sniper rifles were taken from existing stocks of M96 service rifles that were specially selected for superior accuracy. A special Jackenroll short rail scope base was then attached to the left side of the receiver to which a matching mount was hand fitted. This rifle carries the original WWII era German made AJACK 4x90 scope (Sweden remained neutral during WWII and continued some trade with Germany). The bolt handle is bent downward to avoid interference with the scope. Beginning in 1955 the M41 rifles were updated to M41B configuration which included a set screw added to the Jackenroll base to limit forward travel of the mount and the addition of a special M/55 dial type rear sight that was calibrated from 100 to 600 meters for the current service cartridge.This rifle is in very good overall condition. It was built using a Carl Gustaf M/96 originally manufactured in 1911. The receiver, barrel, bolt assembly, scope base & scope mount are correctly serial numbered to match. The buttplate is also matching however the stock is unnumbered and appears to be an excellent condition Swedish arsenal replacement. The handguard and bolt stop are non-matching which is fairly typical as most M41B rifles are found with only the matching components listed above (receiver/barrel/bolt/scope mount). The arsenal finish rates about 92-94% with some normal handling and storage wear but no rust or pitting. There is an import mark but it is stamped midway along the bottom of the barrel and is completely hidden until the action is pulled from the stock. The stock is in excellent condition and free of cracks, chips or repairs. The wood does not appear refinished but is free of any inspection stampings. This rifle is in excellent mechanical condition with everything working properly. The bore is very good with strong, bright rifling. The AJACK scope is in good working order and has bright, clear optics. The rifle comes with lens covers, a standard issue Swedish sling with quick release clip, front sight hood, and cleaning rod. This is a nice looking rifle that should be a lot of fun to shoot!Buyer pays $25.00 shipping."

Please note that Although pretty long, the trigger pull itself is very smooth. If you're trigger sensative, this might not be the gun for you. Once mastered, it's a very accurate firearm. The P250 platform is unique in that the slide and frame can be swapped out to change both size, and caliber of the firearm. Caliber xchange kits can be purchased online and shipped to you (no ffl needed). Frames can also be bought in different colors and sizes. I am selling my P250 in the compact setup.

Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.
The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.”NIB. Thinning out my collection.

The ""mum"" on the receiver has been ground off, which indicates this was a surrendered rifle, not one picked up on the battlefield.  There are some kind of vise or wrench marks on the barrel shank and the front of the receiver, and the  stock may have been lightly scraped as it does not have the shiny Japanese lacquer finish seen on many of their rifles, but maybe very late rifles and/or this manufacturer and series didn't have that.  The rifle is all matching except possibly the safety knob (looks like the same number, but not real clear) but the firing pin tip is broken off, so I have replaced the firing pin with and intact and usable one - the original matching firing pin comes with the rifle too,  and should be sent to someone qualified to re-do the tip.  I will also include 6 rounds of original Japanese WW2 7.7mm ammo if I can remember where I put it.The price for the rifle alone, without the bayonet, is $250 FIRM + shipping.The bayonet is already SOLD PENDING FUNDS.The only forms  of payment I will accept are CASH and U.S. POSTAL MONEY ORDER.  NOTHING ELSE!I will ship at buyer's expense to C&R or 01 FFL. Private Party transfer can be done at Faith Armory in Temecula, or at The Shootist or Brass and Bass, which are both in Murrieta.Scammers, don't waste my time trying to cheat me out of money and/or this rifle, because it ain't gonna happen."

Literally. I went out and bought a set of dies to load cast bullets at 1800fps and my Lebel carbines are now a joy to shoot. Cheaper than 8mm Lebel ammo too. The carbine is typical of those made for WW1. First, this is NOT the M16 (or 1907/15)version you run into as well. During World War I, after complaints from combat troops regarding the limited capacity of the 3-round charger and mud ingress into the well opening, the Berthier's magazine was increased to hold a 5-round ""en bloc"" charger. (the extended mag you see on those) Furthermore, a hinged metal plate covering the bottom opening of the magazine well was added. The M16 versions also have a handguard on top. I have that one as well and most, if not all, have the cleaning rod channel filled (at the armory) and a stacking hook added. This M1892 has the original bayonet lug and the cleaning rod channel with no stacking hook. The 5 shot updated carbines entered WW1 late, but were used again in WW2 and in many police units until the 1960s. That makes these original M1892s less common, at least as far as I have seen over 20 years of buying them. This is also a good reason why the finish is so good as these were replaced with the updated versions beginning in 1915. This carbine was overhauled and refinished at least once in the War years and it was a Chatellerault armory made weapon. The writing on the receiver is faded, though the finish is extremely nice. You can see the armory name and Mle 1892 very clear but some other writing is not as clear but the finish is beautiful. Based on some light surface corrosion in some areas, and lack of wear anywhere, it does not look like anything recent but the finish was redone at some point in the past, likely very long ago. Since the bore is in such good condition and the bolt has little to no wear and the bolt face shows pretty much ZERO use, it is very conceivable that this beautiful finish dates back to the War years as these guns were replaced and never officially used again. This gun spent decades in storage and though I have had it just days, the lack of import marks tells me that this was brought over long ago. The previous owner had little info besides that it was in his family several decades at least. MARKINGS-- The serial number is E31399 and the E is the 5th block of numbers for the Chatellerault armory and the 2 inspector stamps are clear as well. B is the letter code for the head of the armory when the barrel was made and C was the final inspector. I did not look those up. The barrel has the MAC code (for the proper armory) and the manufacture date is very clear EXCEPT the last digit which is a 3 or 8 I believe. It was made in 1893 or 1898 and based on the E serial number block it has to be 8. The bolt head is not matched to the serial number though very few seem to be as the arsenal popped on new ones almost every rebuild or refinish. There is a beautiful cartouche just behind the trigger guard with a crown over it which I can not find. I did not take the stock off to see the other markings though it is just proof marks and dates. The bolt has a capital L in a circle in 2 locations...no clue. CONDITION-- This is an EXCEPTIONAL condition for shooting or collecting. If you are looking for all numbers matching and a museum piece, keep going and there are some sites with nice ones for $600 and up though almost all are M-16s or 1907-15s. The bore is excellent with sharp rifling (see pics) and smooth grooves. The chamber and the receiver behind it are superbly clean. The bolt, inside of the receiver, sear and bolt head are amazingly clean and the bolt and bolt head shows little to no use. The black coloring is not worn in many areas and the bolt head, which are easy to change and update, appears almost new. The rifle cocks, fires and operates smooth and slick as well as perfectly. I do NOT see the N stamp on top as almost all M16 and later ones that were still in use received the update in the 1930s, but since the 1892 carbines were no longer in use, many did not. These were long out of service when that update came about. As I shoot my reloaded ammo, it is meaningless. I would hesitate to shoot surplus ammo anyhow as the French made awesome weapons over the years but their ammo and storage of it left a lot to be desired. Most lots of surplus Lebel ammo I have are over 50% hangfires and duds. Scary stuff sometimes. I would check if the Prvi ammo made now is OK to use in non N marked guns. Possible, but check to be sure. The cleaning rod does not look original but it looks so good there, I left it. It was actually for popping out stuck cases rather than cleaning and nobody today uses them. If you want a proper modern version or original, it will cost you. Original bayonets are available on Ebay for $80 to $100. This gun may not have all of the clearest markings but the finish is superb. Not all matching, but few are. It is in fantastic condition with a great bore and if you want a superb looker and shooter, THIS IS IT. Outstanding blue-black finish with no fading or wear. The bolt also has a superb finish which is all original. It has been gone over and detailed here for you with loads of photos as well. SHIPPING-- This will ship as a 10 pound package by Fedex Ground or Priority (my choice depending on your location) for $36.00 Paypal is fine but contact me first as the address is different. Also, payment must be sent with NO FEES so use ""send money to family or friends"". Personal checks are fine and I will not hold it more than the couple of days it takes to deposit.

For optics I've just got a $60 unit I picked up at a gun show; nothing special, so I'd probably keep that, unless your mini 14 comes with something comparable.  This AR-556 is my first foray into the AR-15 platform/configuration, and I've decided it's just not for me; I guess I've just shot the more conventional platform more comparable to the mini-14 for too long.  I've only shot between 8 and 10 boxes (160 to 200 rounds) through it, and cleaned every time after use. I still have the original box, too.  Because it's an AR-15, I'm going to insist that any trade for this AR-556 go through an FFL, just to cover my butt.
So if you've got a Ruger mini-14 in your safe not getting used, and would like to discuss a trade, send me a description/photos of what you've got, and tell me about it and what you're thinking of for specifics of the trade. I'd love to do an even trade. Again, just seeing what's out there."

The factory in Herstal, Belgium has been converted and never again will these fabulous Hi-Powers be produced. Every gun person should have a H-P in their safe.

Probably 2000rnds on the lower less than 200 on the upper.Lower is an Anderson
Grip and stock are ATI, the ATI stock has the recoil pad lowered 1"" to get the pad more into your shoulder without having to hunch over the stock.Trigger is mil spec, polished and has an engagement adjusting grip screw installed. Weights in at about 5.5lbs with stock springs. With a light weight jp hammer spring installed pull is 3.5lbs.The upper started as a standard 5.56cal, PSA 20"" A4 style upper. I bought it because i wanted to try a fixed front sight and clam shell handguard.Turns out I don't like the fixed front sight or handguards. So I removed the guards and attachment parts and replaced them with a 12.5"" ventilated freefloat tube. I also lopped off the sight base from the gas block to make it low profile.Both the lower and upper are painted with FDE Cerama -coat. The stock,  grip, and freefloat tube are painted in krylon camo brown. The scope mount is FDE Cerama-coat as well, the scope on the other hand is done in Rust-Oleum satin paint which dosent quite match, but since you can't bake a scope, using cerama-coat wasn't an option.All the paint has some nicks and dings from use, but over all still looks good.The scope is a simmons whitetail extreme 3-9x42, which has VERY good glass. Comes with one color matched 20rnd PmagThe only trades I'd be interested in are .243 to .308  or similar hunting rifles, or large bore revolvers. 500oboCall/text 315-2000 with any questions.
