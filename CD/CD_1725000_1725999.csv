Not just for zombies anymore

While it would be a lot of fun for our marketing department to sell the Camp 10 as the ultimate zombie-whacking tool, the truth is, it actually has a lot of other uses that you just might find to be of a more immediate nature than zombie defense. Not that we’re ignoring to the coming Zombiepocalypse, mind you. We just think that the Camp 10 makes a pretty awesome camp knife and that it does a great job of whacking campsite or other outdoor chores down to size in very short order.

From clearing brush to making kindling, the Camp 10 is the ideal outdoor and survival tool. Cut, chop, slash, hack, split, scrape—just about any task you ask of it, the Camp 10 can handle. The full-tang Camp 10 is made of carbon tool steel for toughness and wear resistance. A basic black powdercoat protects the steel and makes maintenance easier.

You’ll like the secure, contoured grip of the Camp 10, too. The handle has a built-in hand guard and is drilled in both front and rear so you can attach a lanyard either place—or both—for carrying versatility. Of course, if a zombie does get up close and personal with you, then yeah, you’ll be pretty glad to have a Camp 10 in hand, too.
Technical Specifications
•Fixed Blade
The knife does not fold closed; usually stored in a sheath or blade protector.

Additional Features
•Full-tang

•Steel: 65Mn, powdercoat

32,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1725032,For Sale:  Big Eddy -- Designed by Russ Kommer,"WEST, Las Vegas, Nevada",$ 26,"Listed On: Wednesday, June 26, 2013",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"NIRK - Designed by Glenn Klecker  $26.22   These went fast 1 Left

Intelligent design advocate Michael Behe coined the term ""irreducible complexity,"" which means ""a single system composed of several well matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function of the system, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning."" It certainly describes this new folder by Glenn Klecker, award-winning knife and tool designer from Silverton, Oregon. He has named it after his son: Nathan's IRreducible complexity Knife, or NIRK™. There are just two well-thought-out pieces, plus a blade pivot screw. 

 The innovation is Glenn's use of a single sheet of stamped and folded stainless steel to serve as the folder frame, back spacer, spring and lock, resulting in a solid lockback folder. The geometry of the cutout areas is critical, carefully calculated to provide just the right spring action when the rear of the spine is pressed. 

 At the front of the frame, the lock tab mates with a notch in the blade to provide safe lockup. The tighter the grip on the handle, the tighter the lockup, making this an exceptionally safe design. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to accidentally release the lock, and it is very, very strong. 

 When the blade is closed, the same lock tab ramps over a rounded detent to hold the blade in the closed position. 

 The high-carbon stainless steel blade is a utilitarian drop point shape with a deep belly, high hollow ground for easy cutting, and with a swedged top edge to aid penetration. It is a hefty 0.131"" thick. The blade can be opened with either hand using the oval thumb hole. 

 The 5180 sport and work model has a high satin blade finish, brushed frame and Razor-Sharp cutting edge. 

 The NIRK has a stainless steel pocket/gear clip. 

 There you have it: a simple, flat, almost indestructible folder. All you need to do is oil and sharpen it occasionally and you have a friend for life. It is priced so you can afford several: one for the toolbox, one for the backpack, one for the truck, one for the boat, one for the survival kit. 

 In the knife world, it is a fine example of intelligent design.

RJ Martin’s blade design and grind gives you the piercing power of a tanto with just enough curve to the belly for slicing aptitude as well. The tanto point is even stronger than comparable tantos because Kershaw makes the tip thicker and gives it a tough flat grind. The result is an über-strong tip that takes on the toughest piercing tasks with no fear. But the RJ II isn’t done yet.

This knife offers a full range of cutting edges. The plain edge is ever so slightly curved, giving the RJ II slicing capability—something not all tanto blades offer. In addition, the blade is partially serrated to make cutting through tough or fibrous materials a breeze. The blade is made of 8Cr13MoV stainless steel that’s tough, wear resistant, and takes a keen edge. For a distinctive look and enhanced performance, the blade is coated with titanium carbo-nitride.

The RJ II also features 3-D machined G-10 handle scales and a secure stainless-steel locking liner. It opens with one-handed ease thanks to the SpeedSafe assisted opening system. Access it with the built-in flipper or thumbstud. The pocketclip is reversible for tip-up or tip-down carry. Tactical looks and a multifunctional blade combine in the RJ II—also available in a larger size as the RJ I.

 Technical Specifications
•2-Step Serration
Serrations assist in cutting through particularly tough or fibrous material, such as rope or cord. The Kershaw 2-step serration is a more aggressive style of serration.

•Flipper
May be used on either manual or assisted opening knives. The “flipper” is a protrusion on the back of the blade that the user can pull back on, or flip, in order to move the blade easily out of the handle.

•SpeedSafe®
Assists you to open any SpeedSafe® knife quickly and easily with a manual push on the thumbstud or pull back on the flipper; built into many Kershaw best sellers.

•Liner Lock
Locks the blade open during use; one side of the knife’s steel “liner,” the steel plate to which the handle scales are attached, moves into position behind the blade to securely lock it open.

•Reversible
Pre-drilled holes in the handle enable the user to change either the tip position or the side on which the knife carries.

I do not need to sell, I will just keep it for CCW if it doesn't sell. Also available in addition is 250 rds of 230gr target ammo, I haven't seen another box for sale since I bought them in January.

The price is firm and the exact price I paid + transfer. If you can find it cheaper do it and don't bother me.

Manufacturer info:
The SARARMS K2 Semi Auto Pistol is truly amazing. It is the first comfortable grip 14+1 DA/SA 45acp pistol. You may ask yourself if this pistol really holds 14+1 rds of 45acp? The K2 has a square barrel / slide lock up (for greater surface locking area), DA / SA trigger (for fast accurate shot to shot repeatability), locked and cocked carry safety system (for a simple and safe manual safety), auto firing pin block (for the added feature of a blocked firing pin unless the trigger is pulled), Low Barrel Axis (for reduced felt recoil),  All Steel construction (for a life time of reliability), Three Dot Sight System (for fast target acquisition), Integral Accessory Rail (for the ability to add accessories as desired) and a grip that is amazing considering the capacity."

The advantage of the LE6940P is unmatched. The LE6940P features an innovative Gas Piston operation system. Conventional Direct Impringement systems allow hot gasses and particulate materials in to the interior of the receiver, decreasing reliability and necessitating frequent cleaning. Colt's articulating link piston system runs cleaner and cooler, providing significantly improved reliability and decreasing time spent cleaning, meaning more time at the range. The 16"" barrel on this rifle has a 1:7"" twist rate to stabilize the heaviest rounds and is free-floated from the quad rail handguard. The barrel is chrome-lined for exceptional longevity and Magnetic Particle Inspected to ensure flawlessness.

The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, an adjustable and removable backup sight and a folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight, and offers unmatched rigidity and repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. An A2 style pistol grip and adjustable Rogers Super Stock are equipped, and two 20 round magazines are included.

At the end of the 1982 Israel-Lebanon War arose an understanding that the modern battlefield had changed. One of the conclusions from the war, particularly relevant to the small arms industry, was that the battle had moved from open field conflicts to close-quarters engagements – and there was a need for a seamless transition from daylight to nighttime capability on a single mission. Out of this understanding, and after more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts. The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

I've owned this car the last 5+ years. I bought it with 88,000 miles and it now has 116,xxx miles. Everything works exactly as it should. (Yes, the AC is cold and works flawless) I converted the brake system to a more performance oriented Mustang Cobra system. While converting the brakes, I converted the lug pattern to the Mustang pattern as well. (Now 5 x 4.5, before it was 5 x 4.25....this opened up far more options for wheels to be changed)  The wheels are 17x10 Cobra R style with real Shelby licensed center caps.  I also added a 2.5"" catback exhaust system with Flowmaster mufflers. (It has a nice rumble, but isn't overly loud or obnoxious.....I also still have the factory exhaust if wanted) Has new Interstate Battery, new tires with less than 500 miles on them, fresh alignment, and the windows were tinted about 2 years ago.  It has a professionally installed and functional remote starter.  In the last year I have also replaced upper and lower control arms, upper and lower ball joints, and Tie rods. The only spot that has a dent is the passengers rear, just in front of the tire.  The previous owner took a corner at the airport to sharp and clipped a high curb.  It left a dent about the size of a baseball right behind the molding.  I'm only selling this vehicle as my new job is going to require massive amounts of driving, and in order to afford the travel I'm going to have to get something with high fuel economy. This car gets about 17-18mpg in town, and on the interstate you can expect 26-28+ MPG. It has the 290 horsepower 4.6L DOHC motor, just like the one the Mustang cobra had between 1999-2003 except the Mustang had a forged crank, and the lincoln has a cast crank.  I also installed an inline FM modulater with a 3.5mm input jack for playing an MP3 player or Iphone/Ipod.  Email with any questions or to come see the car. $4500

 For AR-15 / M16 type rifles, optical sights provide superior performance at longer ranges, but iron sights can be more effective for close-range engagements. However, attaching an optical sight either prevents the use of iron sights or results in a setup that produces a front sight ""shadow"" on the optical image, and/or results in problematic transitions from optical to backup iron sights. Not anymore. Dueck Defense Rapid Transition Sights (RTS) provide shooters with the quickest possible transition between longer- and closer-range target acquisition, greatly increasing their efficiency and effectiveness in battle and competition. Designed by Barry Dueck Director of SureFire's Suppressor Division and a top 3-Gun shooter these sights mount directly to a weapon's Picatinny rail, offset from center by approximately 45°. This unique offset position makes transitioning from optical to iron sights simply a matter of quickly canting the weapon with your wrists and locking on to the target. There's no removing a hand from the weapon or making a manual adjustment, and no cluttered field of vision or iron sights blocking the optical sight. Just smooth, quick transitions that could mean the difference between winning or losing a competition, or more importantly a gunfight."

This thing is lean and mean and made for using... If you want one to ""pimp"" out, Look at, and store in a safe- Buy a Colt... you're not going to shoot it anyway???

But if you want one to shoot your backyard deer, plug a Zombie between the eyes, or just scare the neighbors with a 30 round salute in the middle of the night... then this is it. 

The Ugly Truths:

*A True 14.5 inch barrel with pinned front to make it Legal (a hair over 16 inches)- Can be Un-Pinned and Flash hidden

*Ejection Port Cover
*Forward Assist
*M4 Feed ramps
*Chrome Lined
*M203 Grenade Launcher Cut-out
*Fixed Carry Handle

*** ""MPI"" FULL-AUTO BCG *** (Carrier and Bolt- the extra weight makes it close super solid plus it's one step closer to ""Rockin' and Rollin') 

*Brand New (the BCG)
*Titanium firing pin/ Titanium Bolt ""rings""
*Phosphate Coated (Bolt and Carrier)
*Proper Staking of the gas key screws

*6 Position Stock- Commercial Spec (Com-Spec is a little beefier than Mil-Spec)
*Carbine Length Hand Guard 
*Bottom Rail (room for grip, lights, and Lasers- but who needs those??? IT'S AN ASSAULT RIFLE!! for heaven's sake)
*Vertical Grip

*SightMark .223/5.56 Laser Bore Sighter IS included- Rifle is already dialed in though..
*2 30 round and 1 10 round (original BM Magazine) The 2 30's will be Full so you get 60 rounds on me...
*Original BM case made by KolPin

882,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1725882,For Sale/Trade:  1966 Ford Thunderbird,"Oro Valley, Tucson, Arizona","$ 8,000","Listed On: Thursday, October 17, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm selling/trading my awesome 1966 Ford Thunderbird. My awesome wife just gave me permission to trade it for equal value in guns. If you've got a collection youd like to trade, let me know what you have!

This cruiser is all original with the exception of tires, and a set of ball joints. It's rides very nice, and very strong, and a little low. ( It will be needing the radiator and coolant reservoir replaced, the heat down here is just too much for the originals) 

Some stats on it the car for this year and model:

In 1966, there were 3 engines available, a 390-2bbl, 390-4bbl, and of course the ""Q-code"" 428-4bbl. There were only about 70,000 f the 66's made, and the fact that this car is a factory original, ""Survivor"" makes it very rare. Air conditioning, and a swing away steering wheel were available in 66.  

About this specific car-
The Good:
-I'm the 3rd Owner
-Paint is Original
-Engine is an unmolested 390 big block with a 4 barrel carb. 

-It's believed that the mileage is approximately 113000. The previous owner couldn't swear by it, but the odometer only has 5 digits, and he said he owned it when it was in the 90,000 mark, and watched the odometer roll back to 00000 for it's first time. If you care to come see the car, It looks like that may be the truth.

-It has been a Reno, NV car most f it's life, now as of April, it's an AZ car, it has no rust, no dents, no bondo ANYWHERE. The paint is starting to go, but it's still strong, and shows well. 

-It runs VERY strong, I drove it all winter in Reno, and then drove it the 860 miles to Tucson in April. This car has been my daily driver since January. I'm only selling it because I bought a CJ5, and part of the agreement with my wife, is I had to sell the car to repay our savings that I went into for the Jeep. 

-Has a powered drivers seat, Power Windows and Power Door Locks
-The sequential rear turn signals which are notorious for not working on most of the originals function just fine. 
-Interior is all original
-Set up for A/C just needs a compressor which owner 2, said owner 1 removed and lost. 

The Bad: 
-As it says above, the 1st owner removed and lost the A/C compressor. The car is still 100% A/C ready, just needs the compressor.

- The power steering pump will need to be replaced or rebuilt, I'd imagine within a year, but it still functions 

-The passenger side power window decided to stop functioning,

-The headliner is in good shape, but needs to be re-stretched.

- The drivers seat needs to be re-stitched

- The 2nd owner cut a hole in the passenger side dash to put a cd player in. It was removed before the sale, but the hole is still there. The original AM Radio is still in the car and works pretty well. 

The high retail value through NADA is $17,850 Average is $12,825 if the A/C is restored, with the 390 engine. http://www.nadaguides.com/Classic-Cars/1966/Ford/Thunderbird/2-Door-Hardtop/Values

Anyways take a look at the pics and feel free to email me with any questions, or offers. I'm open to discussion, and will allow test drives to potential buyers with cash in hand. I'd be willing to meet those interested in the Phoenix area in Casa Grande, and anybody in the Sierra Vista Area in Benson/Sonoita."
