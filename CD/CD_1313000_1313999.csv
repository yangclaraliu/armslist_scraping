Originally designed for the bolt-action Mosin–Nagant rifle, it was used during the late Tsarist era and throughout the Soviet period to the present day. The cartridge remains one of the few standard issue rimmed cartridges still in military use and has the longest service life of all military issued cartridges in the world.[4]

The American Winchester Model 1895 was also chambered for this cartridge per a contract with the Russian government. The 7.62×54mmR is still in use by the Russian military in the Dragunov and other sniper rifles, as well as some modern machine guns like the PKM. Originally, the round was designated as ""Трехлинейный патрон образца 1891 года"" - (Three-line cartridge model of 1891). It then became widely known under the designation ""7,62мм винтовочный патрон"" (7,62mm rifle cartridge). The round has erroneously come to be known as the ""7.62mm Russian"" (and is still often referred to as such colloquially), but, according to new standards, the ""R"" in the modern official C.I.P. designation (7.62 × 54 R) stands for Rimmed, in line with standard C.I.P. designations. The name is sometimes confused with the ""7.62 Soviet"" round, which refers to the 7.62×39mm cartridge used in the SKS and AK-based (AK-47) rifles.

Chambered in .45ACP, the P220 Carry Elite Stainless features the new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The new SRT was designed by SIG SAUER® to deliver the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset 60% shorter than the standard DA/SA. This short reset provides for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting making it ideal for competitive shooting. With its enhanced ergonomic features of a beavertail grip, front strap checkering and front cocking serrations, the P220 Carry Elite is an excellent choice as a big bore carry pistol. Its beavertail grip allows the shooter to obtain his or her grip quickly and with confidence even under stress. Each P220 Carry Elite Stainless comes equipped with SIGLITE® Night Sights and the all-stainless construction provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long.

This is a brand new never fired gun.  I bought it with the intention of keeping it forever but I'd rather have other toys.  this is a rare high end gun that is amazing to shoot.  I have shot others just like it and it's one of the most accurate .45 I have ever shot.

I have a UTG red/green dot sight on top. A decently bright led flashlight on the right rail. Forgot lumens but was bright enough to light up my neighbors house across street. The left rail has a very powerful green laser with a custom touch pad mounted in the rail groove so while holding the forward grip, you can activate the laser or flashlight with that one hand. Have fired a couple hundred rounds in a day without any sights leaving their mark. I have a pair of bonded magazines that work flawlessly and clears all when both loaded and used. I also have one more steel mag and 3 un used tapco magazines from GAT guns. I have about 250 rounds of ammunition included. I have a lot of time and money into this one so my price is higher .

Comes with 5 magazines. 3 Wilson Combat and 2 Kimber Kim-Pro. Comes with 500 rounds of 230gr FMJ and a custom Triple K holster.

I have other guns to practice with, so, this firearm been sitting for about 3 months in the case, I bought it about 6 months ago, fired no more than 500-700 rds, very accurate from 50 yards w/o scope, HKs are known for its reliability and accuracy. Much better than GSG522 which is very hard to disassemble and to clean. 

Nowadays, it's very expensive to shoot with 223 or 7.62, where you pay almost $1 per round, so, enjoy 4-5 cents a round on a range :) I have another 22lr rifle, where I put 200-300 rounds each visit w/o hurting my wallet. 

What you will get: 
H&K MP5A5 semiauto - $550+tax 
2 10 rd magazine - $50+tax (http://www.hkparts.net/shop/pc/Magazine-10-Round-Umarex-HK-MP5-22LR-312p2427.htm) - 1 was included, 1 I bought from hk site

UTG Bipod, SWAT/Combat Profile $30 value 
Deluxe Ergonomic Foregrip - $20 value

MFI HK Low Profile Scope Mount - $99 value (http://www.hkparts.net/shop/pc/HK-MP5-22-Scope-Mount-Walther-Umarex-312p2389.htm) 

All together I spent over $1,100 for this rifle. I want a portion of what I spent - $800 or best reasonable offer. 
How I came up with the price, I just did a little research on what people are asking for the similar rifle which is nowadays almost impossible to find because of its tactical look: 
http://www.armslist.com/posts/973202/florida-rifles-for-sale--hk-mp5-a5 - $750

and all these guns don't have modifications I have (over $600 value)

I bought it about 2 months ago from my private dealer, I've got other M&P's and I noticed there is a shortage of these so I am opting to sell it to someone who's in the market and wants to purchase one. I didn't originally plan to sell this, so I cleaned and lubricated it for storage, but that's the only thing that's been done to it. Most sellers are selling well north of $600 for these guns, the price I'm selling at is basically what I purchased it for. 

The 9mm M&P is ideal because it's the same size as all the others, but it's much cheaper to shoot. That's why I bought it, the cost of ammo is a huge factor in this day and age. 

Comes with two 17 round magazines, box, all paperwork, and packaging/case

Synthetic stock. Also has the hard to find adjustable muzzle break. You can turn this muzzle break so that it is ported .360 degrees around the last 3 inches of the barrel or you can close it. The barrel on this model is also thicker than regular, not a full bull barrel but very close. I do have a Leupold VX-1 3-9x40 currently mounted on it. I am wiling to negotiate if you do not want the optic. No BS I have shot less then 20 rounds through this gun. I used around 10 shells to sight the gun in and since then have shot I think 2 deer with it plus a few shells at the range for fun. I love this gun and caliber I just have too many guns right now and like to sell and trade for new ones.  This gun I will only take cash for though. I do some light gunsmith work on the side and have completely stripped this gun down and cleaned it. It wasn't very dirty anyways because I clean after every time I shoot, but when I sell a gun like it to be in perfect clean condition. I have shot the cheaper models of Savage and have been impressed, but was really impressed when I spent the money on this gun and how accurate it really was for a Savage firearm. Please feel free to email me back for any questions/ more pics. I live in LaCrosse Wi, but I do drive up to the cities in Minnetonka Mn quiet often. Anywhere between here and there could work for me to meet. Thanks for looking.

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine is slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length and fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. $175 New in Package."

It was made in the Radom factory in 1976.  This gun is in great condition.  The bluing is nearly perfect and this gun is as accurate as you can find in a short barreled automatic. I put about 200 rounds through her.  It would make a GREAT concealed carry piece as it is light (for a steel framed gun) slim, and DA/SA with a safety decocker. This pistol is chambered in 9x18mm Makarov. (Which just so happens to be cheap and still available.)  I have the original grips that came with it, as well as the custom made walnut grips pictured on it (paid 60 bucks for em) and also the original, and a 22lb recoil spring and the stock main spring.  I changed out both to make her shoot a bit better. Last but not least she comes with 1, 6 round magazine. Please do not text or email me asking if I will take a certain price for the gun. My response will be ""I do not negotiate prices via txt or email.""  If interested or have any questions other than pricing please reply to ad, or txt Ray at 619-794-3*7*7*5. Serious offers are never made sight unseen so please don't try to haggle with me through an email or txt message.  Haggling price is a fun game, and I like to play it face to face ;-). As you would expect price is not set in stone and is somewhat  negotiable. I have a few more pictures available upon request. The rest wouldn't fit on the posting."

I have other guns to practice with, so, this firearm been sitting for about 3 months in the case, I bought it about 6 months ago, fired no more than 500-700 rds, very accurate from 50 yards w/o scope, HKs are known for its reliability and accuracy. Much better than GSG522 which is very hard to disassemble and to clean. 

Nowadays, it's very expensive to shoot with 223 or 7.62, where you pay almost $1 per round, so, enjoy 4-5 cents a round on a range :) I have another 22lr rifle, where I put 200-300 rounds each visit w/o hurting my wallet. 

What you will get: 
H&K MP5A5 semiauto - $550+tax 
1 10 rd magazine 
HK MP5 22lr Tri-rail Tactical Forearm - $120+tax value (http://www.hkparts.net/shop/pc/HK-MP5-22-Tri-Rail-Tactical-Forend-Umarex-312p2208.htm) - will include original Forearm as I won't need it anyway 
UTG Bipod, SWAT/Combat Profile $30 value 
Deluxe Ergonomic Foregrip - $20 value 
AR15 scope with red laser - $200 value 
MFI HK Low Profile Scope Mount - $99 value (http://www.hkparts.net/shop/pc/HK-MP5-22-Scope-Mount-Walther-Umarex-312p2389.htm) 

All together I spent over $1,100 for this rifle. I want a portion of what I spent - $800 or best reasonable offer. 
How I came up with the price, I just did a little research on what people are asking for the similar rifle which is nowadays almost impossible to find because of its tactical look: 
http://www.armslist.com/posts/973202/florida-rifles-for-sale--hk-mp5-a5 - $750 
http://www.armslist.com/posts/1237176/southbend-indiana-rifles-for-sale-trade--h-k-mp5-rimfire - $750

and all these guns don't have modifications I have (over $600 value) 

Will meet you at Big5 Sporting Goods in Concord (Clayton Rd, near Concord Bart Station) to legally transfer this firearm, don't offer me higher $$$ to do it illegally. 
I accept only CASH inside of Big5 store, no checks, no money orders, no money transfers, etc. And no shippings, only local deal.

PS: silencer is fake, but a lot of people believe its a real one since 22lr doesn't shoot loud :)

Magazine - Black,"CENTRAL, Springfield, Illinois",$ 120,"Listed On: Wednesday, March 27, 2013",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a Ruger BX-25 X2 10/22 50rd. Magazine. Ruger came up with an innovative design to couple two magazines together. It comes with a rubber dust cover to prevent the intrusion of dirt and debris for the on deck magazine. Once the first 25rds. are used, all you have to do is remove the dust cover and flip the mag. over. As reliable as the standard BX-1 10-round Ruger rotary magazine. Stainless steel feed lips are designed to present cartridges into the action at a 30 degree angle for better feed reliability. Stainless steel, constant force spring provides feed consistency round after round. Anti-tilt follower is injection molded from a high lubricity polyacetal for consistent reliability. BX-25 X2 magazines will work with any factory original Ruger 10/22 Rifle, SR-22 Rifle, 22 Charger Pistol and 77/22 Rifle. The BX-25 will run reliably with a wide variety of ammunition. However, you may experience malfunctions (“jams”) when using subsonic ammunition or ammunition with heavy coatings of bullet lube. In some instances, cleaning the magazine may improve reliability, but in other cases you may need to switch to a different type or brand of ammunition to get the full use and enjoyment from your BX-25 X2 magazine. Please also be aware that some .22 LR magazine loaders are prone to damaging cartridges. If you experience stoppages while using magazines that were loaded using a magazine loader, please try loading the magazines by hand and determine if reliability improves. The BX-25 X2 magazine requires no lubrication. If it becomes necessary to clean the magazine, loosen the screws on the right and left side of the magazine with a 3/32’’ hex tool. Next, separate the two halves, lifting the right side from the left side, and then lift out the spring, throat and follower from the left side. To reassemble the magazine, reverse the order of the disassembly instructions.

High Capacity Magazine Restrictions: High capacity magazines are legal in some areas of the U.S. Please be aware of your local laws before ordering. We will not ship magazines to the State of New York. We will not ship magazines with a capacity above 10 rounds to California. We will not ship magazines with a capacity above 20 rounds to City of Denver, Colorado. It's up to the customer to comply with all laws regarding these items."
