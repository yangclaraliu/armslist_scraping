I will turn this into a silent auction and will sell to the highest bidder unless I find a bike trade.

For trade I have several guns. I apologize if this type of post isn't allowed on armslist. I am looking for a motorcycle with low miles, preferably a dual sport bike or sport touring of some type that is less than ten years old. Nothing older. I will entertain cash offers as well as other gun trades, but please be realistic. For serious inquirers, email me for pictures. I will not trade with you if you are out of state. I will not trade with you or sell to you if you even *imply* that you're a felon. I will not ship my guns to you. Face to face transactions only at my FFL. I will cover FFL paperwork costs. I am not interested in vehicles that do not have a title. Nothing that is not street legal. Not interested in any bike with more than 20k miles. Not interested in any vehicle with more than 100k miles. I'm not interested in shotguns. I'm not interested in hunting guns. The only guns I would be interested in are saiga, arsenal, vepr, and very high end air rifles. All of my guns are 922r compliant and I have done all of the pistol grip conversion work on the saigas myself. I am willing to sell, so make an offer, but realize there's lots of other people making offers too.

First, I have a Saiga 5.45 with a pistol grip and bullet guide conversion. barrel has been threaded 14x1Lh to accept brakes. Currently has a conical krink brake. Includes 5.45 ammo, an ammo box, mako folding stock, and four magazines. The trigger is a tapco G2 with a CSS retainer plate. 

Next I have a saiga 12 with almost too many upgrades to list. It has a four position gas plug, t6 ar-15 style stock, tromix trigger guard, tromix shark muzzle brake, 20 round drum, two ten round stick mags, a twelve round stick mag, twister puck, surefire tri rail, plenty of S&B buckshot to boot in plano dry boxes. The trigger is a G2 modified to function on a saiga 12 and has a CSS retainer plate. this gun is a beast and is tons of fun at the range. 

Next I have an Ar-15 that I built. Para Ordnance lower, rguns upper, magpul handguard, magpul stock, spare spring kit, four or five magpul pmags, and ammo inclusion is negotiable. It has a dual illuminated trijicon RMR sitting on it that is less than two years old that i will include for the right price.

I have a Gen 3 Glock 34 with a kkm precision stainless threaded barrel with a muzzle brake, weighted magwell, and two mags. Possibly one of the easiest and fastest shooting handguns I have ever shot. I bought and customized it hoping to get in to competitive handgun shooting but ammo got too darn high and scarce so i'm going to give it up. I still have the original barrel which I will include as well as the original box. 

I have a german 9x18 makarov in very good to great shape. 1 mag. no frills. about 200 rounds of ammo to boot. 

Russian Baikal makarov 380. adjustable target sights. No ammo included. Practically brand new."

About Arno Bernard Knives


Just outside of the beatiful Eastern Free State town of Bethlehem, situated in South Africa, lays the Arno Bernard Knives workshop. It is here where Arno Bernard Jr founded the Arno Bernard Knives company in October 2005. His wife, Zine Bernard, and brother, Franco Bernard, joined his company in 2007. Since then - following in the footsteps of their well known knife maker father, Arno Bernard Sr - the two brothers are actively involved in the designing, manufacturing and selling of the knives, while Zine is responsible for customer relations and administration.

True to their vision - Arno Bernard Knives are handmade knives of outstanding quality and manufactured from premium materials at affordable prices. The simple designs are both practical and aesthetical and therefore these knives are suitable for either collecting or everyday use. Accordingly an Arno Bernard knife is an excellant companion, gift and heirloom.

At Arno Bernard Knives we believe that the quality of a knife lies in the type of steel, the type of grind, the handle material and finally the finishing of the knife. We take great care to only manufacture knives of the highest quality in accordance with the above."

P. Sauer & Sohn, then based in Suhl, Germany. The ""H"" in the model number denotes ""hammerless""—the pistol uses an internal hammer. Marked as 7.65 cal. It was produced between 1939–45. The model 38H was used by German armed forces such as the Luftwaffe, as well as police forces in numbers nearly equal to the Walther PPK. THIS PISTOL HAS THE German Wehrmacht MARKS (MILITARY) !The Sauer 38H was produced for military, police, and the commercial market. I believe it to be the third variation according to the serial number. It is a nice piece of NAZI history from WW2. It is a used pistol that is around 74 years old. The finish is not great but the bore is in excellent shape. The grips are not correct but they sell repros on ebay for $34.00.....  I have not fired this pistol yet but it seems to properly function...........................I am looking for a nice modern pistol or revolver to trade even for.  Just let me know........reply with trade offers ............................or $275.00 . Must be an Ohio resident 21 or older legally able to purchase a handgun.

 The BL-22 is perfect for both new and seasoned shooters. Newbies will appreciate features like confidence-building accuracy, a short 33° lever throw for fast cycling and a trigger that travels with the lever to prevent finger pinch. Experienced types will love the easy handling, light weight and quality construction. Whatever the reason, a BL-22 is a must have for every gun collection.

A beautiful 20'', blued steel barrel and gloss American walnut stock finish make the BL-22 Grade II .22 LR Rifle stand apart from other 22s. The rifle’s tubular 15 + 1 magazine, gold-colored trigger, and adjustable sights round out this quality gun. Grooved receiver for scope mounts

The BL-22 is an American favorite for great rimfire accuracy and firing speed. A flick of the wrist is all it takes to eject the spent cartridge and load a new one in the chamber. It possess excellent accuracy with overall precision and rifling quality in the exact same class as what you get with a Browning X-Bolt centerfire or BLR lever-action. The tubular magazine is extra easy and fast to load, especially with the magazine tube lock that securely snaps the tube in place. The three position hammer operation is time tested and operates exactly as you expect, and are used to, on the best lever-actions."

PS : please dont e-mail me youre opinion or legal advise . they ARE legal . if you dont believe me call Beikricks and ask. and also idc what you have to say . but anyone interested in this offer please feel free to contact me thanx"

 500 pcs each of, 9mm, .40 S&W and .45ACP = 1500 pcs and would ship for 12.65.

 If you reload several sizes, than you will do well here, You can mix your numbers any way you want.

 Payment: I prefer PAY-PAL, but I have a store front business and take credit card orders over the phone every day but Sunday and if need be will take a money order. If you prefer a personal check that is fine also, but it will delay your shipment till it clears the bank.

It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

The model 44 offers up 6 rounds of full power .44 Magnum loads. Hammer forged for tough performance and confidence-boosting accuracy, these decision-makers come with hand-fitted actions, and clean, crisp triggers right out of the box. New innovations include ported barrels that reduce muzzle flip and felt recoil. Taurus life time warranty, Could be converted to a great hunting revolver. Successfully engaged a target at 200 yds with the iron sights. The gun shoots very accurately. You could use this as a back up revolver it has plenty of power to take down ANY mammal on the legal to hunt anywhere in the world or even the North American continent. After a few rounds out of my S&W 500, 50 cal. revolver, this gun feels as if I am shooting a .22 calibre revolver and do really prefer to carry this (44 Magnum) rather than the 50 with me. Easier to shoot and will not hurt my hands like the recoil of the S&W does and CAN cause me to flinch and pull my shot to the side. Not good when one's life may depend on that accuracy. This gun has 5 more round after the 1st shot (6 Shooter) the 50 has only 4 more... its a 5 round revolver. Needless to say, only one from the 50 cal needs to connect any part of the target and the threat will be gone. Same applies here with the 44 Magnum.
As they used to say in the military, there are no problems, that can not be solved with the use of high explosives. And it is always good to have something left in reserve. More bullets is the way I would prefer to go. No point running out of ammo... before the threat is eliminated. 
I would prefer not be found dead after an animal attack with bullets still left in my gun."

But I've found another AR that I like even more and can't justify having two. This 5.56 Carbine has a 16"" barrel and picatinny rails. It comes with a 10-round PMAG with a built-in Bullet Button tool, owner's manual, a gun lock, and plastic case. I bought it on 5/10/13 for $999.99 (with sales tax and fees: $ 1,126.97), but will let it go for $875 or best offer. CASH ONLY PLEASE. I require a face-to-face transfer, preferably at Turner's Outdoorsman in Reseda in the San Fernando Valley. Buyer pays transfer fee which I think is around $30, as well as any other fees. Act fast as California will ban the sale of these rifles after Jan. 1st. Serious buyers only."

Due to the ""Cal.5.56x45"" and the ""178"" stamping by H&K, this H&K 93 rifle was one of the few that were imported into this country prior to the 1989 ban. The ""Cal.5.56x45"" stamping is significant to show that this rifle has a 5.56mm NATO chamber, and the ""178"" is significant to show this rifle has a 1 in 7"" twist rate in the barrel, meaning that it can fire lightweight to the heavier 77 grain 5.56 NATO (or .223) ammunition. Other features of this rifle are: *H&K Full Auto Bolt Carrier Group. *H&K Bayonet Attachment. *H&K Wide Forearm. When I purchased this rifle, the prior owner shared with me that he was the 3rd owner, and, to his knowledge, this particular rifle was unfired; after I received it from my dealer, I did fire approximately 20 rounds of factory PMC 5.56mm 55 grain ammunition thru it at the range for function testing, of which it excelled. Included with this rifle are: One (1) 40 round H&K aluminum magazine (looks to be new), One (1) H&K green web sling (new in wrap), and One (1) red H&K operators manual (in very good condition). I do not have the original box for this rifle. Buyer to pay a flat rate of $ 30.00 for shipping via UPS or FedEx Ground, within continental US. Postal money orders, cashier's checks/certified funds, and personal checks accepted for payment.
