Quote from www.AK47world.com ""Which brings us to WHY STILL in 2011 - imported Chinese MAK-90 AK-47's like the Milled Receiver MAK-90 or Stamped-Receiver NHM-90 Rifles or stamped-receiver Chinese MAK-90 rifles offer the BEST Values in AK-47's - as Chinese MAK-90 Rifles offer 'Double-hook Trigger & Hammer Groups and 50% thicker 1.5mm receivers than the thinner 1mm receivers used on Romanian AK-47's that only have 'Single-Hook' trigger groups - as Chinese triggers feel much better when shooting - due to the 'Double-Hook' hammers also used in Milled Bulgarian AK-47's - like the SA-93, SLR-95, SLR-96, SLR-100H, SA-M7 & SAS-7 Rifles.""

Unless someone just wants to WASTE $$$ on a bayonet lug or flash-hider - the best Semi-Auto AK-47 variants ever imported into the U.S. are these foreign arsenal built AK-47's:

1. Bulgarian SA-93, SLR-95, and SLR-96
2. Chinese Norinco MAK-90/NHM-90/NHM-91/MAK-91
3. The Hungarian SA-85M

ALL of which represent a MUCH BETTER VALUE than a lesser-quality Romanian WASR-10, Century Arms GP-75, Century Yugo M70AB, Saiga or VEPR Russian-made AK-47 Rifles!

Bushnell Elite 3200 Tactical Rifle Scope 10x 40mm 1/10 Mil Adjustments Mil-Dot Reticle Matte

Product Information
Bushnell #: 321040T UPC #: REDACTED45
Bushnell Elite 3200 Rifle Scopes feature resettable fingertip adjustments for windage and elevation with repeatable audible clicks. They also feature 1-piece hammer forged aluminum titanium alloy tubes and multi-coated lenses that have been treated with Bushnell's Rainguard coating. This scope features 1/10 milliradian (MIL) windage and elevation turrets and a Mil-dot reticle; this is also known as MIL/MIL. The combination of these two features enables the shooter to make quick and precise corrections. By using the Mil-dot reticle to measure how far off the shot is in MILs, each dot is 1 MIL apart, the shooter does not need to convert milliradians to minutes of angle in order to correct the point of aim. With traditional 1/4 MOA turrets, if the point of impact is measured to be 1.5 MILs low the shooter needs to convert the MILs to MOA and then adjust the turrets which can be confusing. With a MIL/MIL rifle scope if the shot is 1.5 mils low then the shooter simply turns the turret 1.5 mils or 15 clicks. The mil-dot reticle can also be used to determine how far away an object of known size is. Bushnell Elite 3200 Rifle Scopes are waterproof, fogproof and shockproof and covered by the Bushnell limited lifetime warranty.

This rifle is pristine and 98%. The 39A has been in continuous production longer than any other rifle in America and is often referred to as the cadillac of 22 rifles. This Is a beautiful pre Remington model which exhibits the original Marlin craftsmanship. The Marlin lever action’s swift pointing characteristics, lightning-fast follow-ups, reliability and inherent accuracy have made it America’s favorite. And what started with the invention of the first flat-top, side-eject receiver in 1889 has led Marlin to pioneer every major advancement in the lever-action category since. The Golden 39A is still considered one of the finest examples of a lever .22 rifle, and one of the most accurate .22 rifles ever produced. It is also the best-selling lever rimfire in U.S. history. The 39A and the AS are the same rifles, the AS designation the S was added in 1988 because Marlin added a hammer block safety and a rebounding hammer.

The MVP is new from Mossberg and has been highly reviewed, has a lot of nice custom features for a mid-range rifle. Comes in original box with paperwork and 1 ten round magazine. I also have 2 (30) round MSAR poly mags to go with it and 132 loose rounds of ammo which is a mixture of wolf and Lake City 55 GR boatail FMJ. I have a bipod attached also. What makes this rifle unique is its ability to take any standard AR mag. Mossberg is the only one who offers this. Leupold scope and rings is not included with sale.

Up for sale is a Taurus Raging Bull chambered in .454 Casull. It has the 8 3/8"" barrel and a satin stainless finish. I've put around 70 rounds through it and it fires great. The .454 packs a bit of a punch, but with the ported barrel and cushioned grip it's pretty fun to shoot, and if you're firing .45 LC out of it you'll barely notice it. I'm only selling it to fund another AR build, and I really don't get out to shoot it a whole lot. Ammo isn't the cheapest but it's a lot easier to find in stock than most other rounds these days. 

It will come with a total of 147 rounds of ammo: 
10 rounds of Buffalo Bore 360 grain lead nose .454
27 rounds of Winchester Super X 250 grain JHP .454

Here are the package details: 
- Walther P22 Platinum Pink edition
- Kydex adjustable under-the-steering column holster
- 2 extra magazines
- 100 rounds of CII Stinger 22 LR ammo

The gun does have minor wear marks (on the slide - visible in picture) from the kydex holster, but nothing major. It functions great and fires smooth; it is a tad picky in particular with Federal bulk ammo that I've noticed, so it might require more breaking in before it will eat that particular ammo. Other than that, it's a great little shooter; I have no complaints.

I would really like to sell this for $375.00 cash, but would settle for a partial trade of cash and ammo. The ammo I'd accept: 22LR and 9mm priced fair. I will respond to all offers, and if I feel your asking value for the ammo is too high, I will let you know.

Its a great piece. Good shape. The lower has no cracks or anything.  Maybe 50 rounds through it. Clean fun. Has gun ware on just from age.
This Firearm is considered a Machine pistol. It has no locking mechanism for the bolt. Its a Lock and load immediately. Kinda like a Machine gun, or a automatic firearm, but it fires from the closed bolt position. Thats what made these guns to valuable. 

This is a Pre Clinton ban gun, so it has value. Especially in the condition this is in. This price is based on what ive seen all over the internet. I would say this was manufactured in 1993 based on the serial #.
The only others I've seen on armslist are selling anywhere from 375$-700$ but only over in the east and in the south side of the country. 
Its a RARE handgun, thats still classified as a Pistol. 
 according to pooshka.com this firearm would be in the 410$ range.

While this is one fantastic pistol, especially with the all-abidextrous controls and 4 different backstraps, I am a die-hard Sig Sauer fan for 20 years now, and the FNX just operates a bit differently with its safety lever, and I'm concerned about putting it into rotation and forgetting to disengage the safety if a crisis were to arise!

It is in very good condition, timing and lockup are like-new. Very clean and shoots true. It has a ramp front sight and the low profile rear sight is adjustable for elevation and windage. The factory grips are a little worn and have a small crack around one of the screws, but they hold tight and look nice. I also have a set of finger groove aftermarket grips that go with it. I put a bunch of .22 short, Federal buld .22LR, and a few CCI Stingers through it. It was 100% reliable, did not shave any lead, and it's very accurate for a 3"" wheelgun. Total round count unknown, but barrel looks great and it runs well. I put about 100 rounds through it myself. Very fun plinker.

This is an older model, back when Charter Arms made a good name for themselves. $300 FTF in York, Hanover, or Gettysburg areas and it must be transferred at an FFL of course.
