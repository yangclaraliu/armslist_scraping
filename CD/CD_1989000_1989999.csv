 I have received several emails with the question of round count here is the answer. There is a scorch on the top strap, but no apparent signs of flame cutting.  Lockup is tighter than some of the new production Smiths.  Looking at these signs, combined with the sub 200 rounds I have personally put through the gun.  I would say this revolver has seen several hundred rounds, but no more than 1000.  My brand new Ruger revolver has more wear on the top strap than this and it has only seen about 200 rounds thus far.

I check my e-mail often.  If listing is still showing gun is still available.

The VENOM quickly and easily mounts by simply twisting out the existing cylinder pin and twist in the new LaserLyte integrated laser and cylinder pin configuration. The VENOM integrated laser holds the tiny 4x377 batteries, the switch and laser all in one compact package (less than two inches). The VENOM adds very little bulk to the gun, yet provides the user with the gained confidence of aiming accuracy. No sighting in is required with the VENOM due to the fixed-point-of-aim provided at the LaserLyte factory.

The minuscule circuitry within the LaserLyte VENOM laser holds a programmable laser with: constant on, pulse mode and an auto-off after 6 minutes. The battery life is five hours* in constant on and ten hours* in the pulse mode.

*Normal usage is defined as one minute on and one minute off. This test mimics actual usage where the unit is turned on and off and the battery is given time to automatically regenerate.

Condition: New

Product Details:
Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty. The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached.

When designing the polymer frame for the Duty, the decision was made to retain the basic grip shape (circumference, angle, etc.) so popular in the CZ 75 family of handguns. The polymer frame platform eliminated the need for the grip panels that are used on most steel and alloy-framed autos. The absence of the grips resulted in some available space that was used to increase the magazine capacity by 2 rounds. The results speak for themselves -- the flush-fitting magazine of the P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full-sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both 9mm and .40 S&W.

The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change.

It was tested and marked as passing sniper accuracy but was never drilled and scoped to be a sniper rifle (No plugged holes).  You can clearly see a ""C"" stamped over the top point of the Tula star but can only see the left vertical of the ""H or N.""   These marks mean that it passed accuracy testing to be a sniper.   Some other interesting markings on the barrel shank and on the high-wall part of the receiver.  The bore is very good and not counter-bored.  I have never fired this rifle..  Post war stock with cool toe-splice.  It is force-matched.  If my research is correct the cleaning rod is Romanian. It comes with a non-matching bayonet that is very snug and hard to mount. It is a really good example of a Tula made rifle built at the height of the Great Patriotic war.  The finish is much better than the current crop of refurbished rifles coming these days (IMO).  Beware, when you buy one they tend to multiply!

Looking to sell or trade my SCAR 16 Black with a Branham Rail installed for a KAC Sr15 E3 Mod 1 rifle.  (I have the factory rails that the Branham replaced and they are included)  SCAR is like new.  Less than 150 rounds. KAC must have the lower receiver with the swivel cups and include everything that came with the rifle when new. I have 2 HK 30rd Maritime Magazines that can go with the SCAR as well. I would need a little extra cash or trade items to make up the difference in price between the two rifles unless you have any extra's that come with the trade.  

I will sell the rifle for 2300.00 including the Branham Rail, but would prefer a trade.

One is brand new and never used.  Just loaded it and threw it into the safe.

This is a single/double action with an aluminium (coated) frame, manual ambi. safety. 

With the gun if you want it, I have 470 rounds available at $ .025 per round.  100 Speer Lawman 155gr, 100 Blazer Brass (not reloads), 50 Winchester, etc.   I have to know if you want the ammo and how much BEFORE you come over since some is locked up in a different location.

Bought new in 2009 from Adventure Outdoors, flawless gun performance wise, only thing wrong is surface rust in some of the the bluing, mostly where it rubs against the holster.  I usually clean and oil 1-2x a month, but, I work outside.  Easy to disassemble for cleaning..

So ... I decided to go with another gun in stainless steel and different caliber, which is why I do not need the ammo any more. I have the case and  manual too.

Shot between 600-1000 rounds.  Comes with a nice hard nylon type holster that not only protects the gun, it retains the gun nicely with the strap/snap (I hate velcro - you can hear it 100 feet away) for concealed carry, but, it is still fairly fast to draw.

Will make a nice CCW weapon for someone.

=================================

Sold to first person that shows up. I will not hold or wait for your wife to okay your purchase on your next pay day sometime in the future. 

Terms: You have to have a GFL (Georgia concealed carry permit) that is current. We do a bill of sale, GFL to GFL. No exceptions, period.

DHS is buying up 1.6+ billion rounds (750 million .40 S&W) using our tax dollars borrowed from China, enough for a 100 year war in Afghanistan. Which is causing this shortage, along with insane gun restrictions. So ... before we even talk or shake hands you have to say:

""I didn't vote for Obama because he sucks."". No exceptions. PERIOD.

Otherwise you can go back home. I don't want your money.

If you are a criminal and thinking about something stupid, don't bother. I live between two police stations and you have to pass one to get here.

It has a black on black Zev Tech fulcrum trigger installed with a 6 lb. trigger spring, and a polished trigger bar. It also has a new ejector housing. It is set up for a self defense carry gun with a crisp 3.5 lb. trigger pull, but can be adjusted to 2lbs. All the way up to 6lbs. I left some pre travel in it, but the pre travel and over travel can be adjusted, and the trigger reset is 50% less than factory. It also has a match grade KKM Precision match fit barrel installed. It has a tungsten double spring recoil assembly installed that is 5x heavier than the factory recoil spring assembly, and 2x heavier than a stainless recoil assembly. It has a Zev Tech V4 Race connector installed, and I have a 3.5 lb. ghost Evo connector for it as well. It has a Zev Tech polished skeletonized striker installed with a 4 lb. striker spring. I also have a 5lb. And 6 lb. striker spring for it. It has a Zev Tech polished titanium safety plunger with reduced power spring. I also have a lightning strike polished titanium safety plunger for it. It has Trijicon night sights installed, and I have the factory sights with a front sight tool. All mags have a +1 Pearce grip extension on them, and it has a black aluminum back plate. I just installed Vickers Tactical mag release, and slide stop for it as well. It comes with an I-Tac right hand paddle holster that goes with it. It has tons of upgrades, and I've put some money in it. If you are not sure what these parts cost please look them up before you offer anything. This is not your factory Glock. I can send more pics if interested, and I have all the factory parts to go with it."

FTF cash sale in Fridley or Burnsville. 

Not interested in any trades of any kind at this time.   I will consider shipping with payment by USPS money order only (shipping charge and FFL Fees, when applicable, are additional). All firearm sales will require a MN ID and PTC/PTP. Overkill yes, but that's how I roll.

Be sure to check my other listings as I am clearing out a bunch of interesting things lately.


Armslist is a very different marketplace, so I treat it accordingly. If you send me a message with a lowball offer or insist on being a nuisance, I simply will not reply. I don't have the time or desire to play keyboard commando games with anyone.

Cheers,

Actually the reason I have not used it and am looking to sell it is 2 fold, #1 I am a disabled vet and I am going to be having a 2nd operation on my back after having my first full cage spinal fusion. 2nd, it honestly has been nothing more than a coat rack and it sucks that it has never been used so I need to get rid of it and try to get some of the money back that I spent on it. Please take the time and visit Powertec's web site and read the specs on this unit. It is the Black and Yellow one and it comes with the Preacher curl attachment as well as the leg lift. I also have the crunch straps to be used when you position the chair for crunches. These were extra's that I ordered thinking that I would one day become the Schwarzenegger I would never achieve. Anyhow, this unit cost me $1800 delivered to the house and I will tell you right now, this is in no way a ""Weider"" type gym. This is full square tube construction and you will find this kind of equipment and name brand in your high end private gyms. This unit is also Free Weight and will require you to have Olympic Weights to be used on this. The buyer will also need to have a open bed truck for transportation. I will help in taking the unit apart as it can be taken apart in 3 major sections. I will also be able to assist in helping you load it into your truck as well. The unit is in perfect condition and has zero wear on the machine as it has not been used. I still have thee original manual and I even have the warranty which I never even filled out so I would imagine that the buyer could take advantage of that. Anyhow, please call me at REDACTED and if no one answers, just leave me a message. I will work with you as best I can as for a time for you to come and look at it to make sure you want it etc...My location is close to Highway 69 exits 214 Lapel or 219 Anderson if your wondering where I am located. The price I am asking is firm but I may take a partial trade for a 1911 .45, Springfield XD .45 etc  and some cash.............. We can talk if that is an interest."

This is an original condition, authentic, model 1816 type III Harper's Ferry musket; manufactured in 1831. This one has been in the same family for 50 years, Above Average Condition and Original conver.

Overall length; 55in.

The Model 1816 was originally designed as a flintlock muzzleloader, iron buttplate is straight against the shoulder, iron strap opposite the lock, iron trigger guard, no rear sight, one iron barrel band, one strap hook, and forward sight. Original wooden ramrod in place below the barrel. The butt stock features a very low comb, which is the graceful curve between the butt and the wrist of the stock. Manufactured by Harpers Ferry Armory, Harpers Ferry Virginia (now WV) from 1816 through 1844. Most were converted to percussion in the 1850's, this one by the ""Belgian cone"" method, this alteration was performed at the Arsenal. The flintlock pan was milled flat to the lock, the void filled with brass and the top milled flush with the lock, the flintlock hole was plugged, a nipple lug was placed on top of the barrel slightly to the side of lock, and a new hammer was placed to achieve the correct alignment. Lock is marked ""HARPERS / FERRY / 1831"" behind the hammer, with eagle head and ""US"" in front. Round barrel length 40in. This is an authentic Harpers Ferry Model 1816, NOT a reproduction. Above Average Arsenal Version.

I have for sale 2 new/never used stainless steel parkerizing tanks with lids and ½” drain valves. I bought these thinking I was going to learn how to parkerize guns but never got around to it so these have just been sitting collecting dust. Also included with this is 1 gallon of Zinc Phosphate Parkerizing Solution and 1 gallon of Post Treatment Solution, both new and unopened. Each gallon of chemical is concentrated and gets mixed with 4 gallons of water for 5 total gallons of each, which is the capacity of each tank.

Here is the description of the tanks from the manufacturer:

6""x6""x40"", pure 304 Stainless Steel. Tank, cover, and Stainless Steel ball valve are included. 

We are proud to offer the very best Parkerizing Tanks in the industry. They are cut and formed out of pure 304 stainless steel. Handles are formed right into the ends. All edges of these tanks are hemmed, so there are no exposed sharp edges. Feel free to handle these tank with your bare hands! 

The tanks are TIG welded using supreme skill and elaborate tooling. The outside of the welds are treated and polished to reveal the beauty of the stainless steel and show the excellence of the weld. We maintain complete passivation inside the weld during manufacturing. Please look at the last picture taken of the inside of the weld, you will see that it remains brilliant and shiny. If you see a weld in stainless steel that is black or rust colored inside this means that proper provisions were not taken and rust and breakdown will start immediately when your liquid is applied."

The original magazine had issues sliding, so Kimber sent me a new one.  I purchased night sights (roughly $100 value) but have not gone to the gun smith to have them installed (cost $30 at Top Gun).
