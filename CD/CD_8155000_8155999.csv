This is a genuine high security vault that would cost closer $15,000 to replace. The interior currently has three completely adjustable shelves that can be moved to any height with set screws or removed completely for one large open space. I'm only selling because I no longer collect firearms and do not have anything of value to justify a vault like this. When I purchased it roughly 3 years ago I had the combination reset as well as the lock and bolt work inspected and serviced by a vault technician. Everything was lubricated and given a clean bill of health. The combination can easily be reset again at the buyer's discretion for around $100. Additionally, I do have a door security system that was installed on the safe and linked to a phone line to alert police if the door was opened. I've never installed this system myself as I have additional security measures in place, but it will go with the safe to the buyer.Buyer is responsible for moving and any movers you hire must be insured.

It features significant recoil reduction over other .50 BMG rifles through intelligent modifications to the internal mechanism. The rifle was designed to be compact, lightweight, accurate, portable and easily deployable for immediate use. Most rifles chambered in .50 BMG are heavy, long, bulky and operate much slower using bolt action.        In the bullpup configuration, most of the weight is distributed to the rear of the rifle allowing for the possibility of off hand firing. This is nearly impossible with most other .50 BMG rifles as the length and forward weight make this more difficult. Utilizing unique barrel recoil technology, the rifle's recoil is  noticeably less than the other rifles in the same category.       This design also allows the rifle to be transported at a length of only 36"". It operates with standard .50 BMG rounds intended for semi-auto rifles. Each GM6 Lynx is given a match grade Lothar Walther barrel which is capable of sub-MOA accuracy with match ammunition. What's in the Pelican Rifle Case: (2) 5 Round magazines  (2) 34mm .50 BMG scope rings (scope not included)   (1) Spare barrel spring (1) Bi-pod  (1) Cleaning kit  (1) Operators Manual           Additional Options:   Custom green finish: $500  Spare Magazine: $375  Spare/Replacement Barrel: $1650              Features  Durable mil-spec design and construction Unique barrel recoil technology dissipates most recoil energy Semi automatic design Magazine fed for ease of reloading Bullpup design for compact size and optimum weight distribution Sub-MOA with match grade ammunitionSpecifications:   Caliber: .50 BMG  Effective Range: 4921 ft  Magazine Capacity: 5  Method of Operation: Long Recoil Action Operating Length: 44.35""  Transportation Length: 36"" Barrel Length: 28.75""  Weight, Empty: 25lbs  *Special Order Item*   This rifle is made to order with a 6 month delivery time on average.

This new breed of AR-15 pistol packs a biggest punch in a compact package.   The Model 1P's functions as all AR pistols and rifles normally do while in SAFE and SEMI--AUTO mode. However, the Model 1P Pistol features the Digitrigger 1.2 which offers a feather-touch 1 pound trigger pull while in SR MODE and an increased rate of fire while in PR MODE. While in PR MODE (Pull and Release) one round is fired with each pull of the trigger and one round is fired when the trigger is released.    - SA & PR digital modes have a 1lb. trigger with mechanical feedback completely eliminated (mil-spec break in order to fire the weapon is still present, but is simply not felt by the shooter when the DigiTrigger is enabled).- Mechanical mode has a single stage trigger with mil-spec trigger pull weight (at least 5.5 lbs. and not exceeding 8.5 lbs.).– Digital mode requires one 9Volt battery (1000+ shots after break in period).– DigiTrigger electronic components are rated for at least 1 million firing cycles.– DigiTrigger complements the mechanical trigger group; it DOES NOT replace it with one that requires a battery. Semi-Auto functions as normal.– DigiTrigger 1.2 is for recreational/commercial use only and is not intended for military/defense applications (these and LE versions coming soon).– DigiTrigger was engineered, manufactured and assembled in the USA. A high performance 7.5-inch Ballistic Advantage 5.56 NATO (.223) Hanson barrel with a 1:7 twist and full auto rated Ballistic Advantage BCG ensures optimal high speed performance. The urban chain handguard and Gamma VG6 muzzle device complete this rugged powerhouse.  Our model 1P AR-15 is fitted with the SB Tactical PDW forearm brace and a DOLOS barrel takedown system which allows for safe and compact storage while transporting in the smallest package possible.  Want something custom? Each pistol is made to order so let us customize it for you.

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV). CZ75 CZ SP01"
