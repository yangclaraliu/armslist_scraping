New, never used. Complete, All original parts in original packaging.Lightly Used.  EETIK - EVO ELITE INSTALLATION KIT
Fits ALL Glock Models GEN 1-5 (except Glock 42 & 43).  Everything in kit will work on Gen 5 with the exception of the trigger spring.The EVO has the lightest feeling trigger press due to the smoothness and stage free 3.5lb design.
All the parts necessary for a do it yourself installation of the EVO ELITE 3.5 LB and to give you best self-defense or the lightest target trigger pull possible.
The Kit includes:  -  Trigger Connector  -  Complete Spring Kit  -  Installation tools (punch and fitting plate)
Minor Fitting of the Connector may be required.
EVO 3.5 KEEPS YOU ON TARGETThe EVO 3.5 is the best self-defense connector made and by changing a few springs you can also have the best sport or enhanced self-defense trigger connector!
This is a complete drop in trigger kit is designed to help you fine tune and improve your trigger pull, and function in competition pistols, and for Self defense Carry or Hunting pistols.
The EVO 3.5 fixes the Glock bump or glitch, this is the pre-travel resistance you feel and must overcome when the trigger bar bumps into the connector. This bump causes you to apply excessive force and will move the pistol off target.
Included in the kit are 4 Drop in Springs:   -  4lb Reduced Power Striker Spring- to only be used for a strictly target or competition set up.   -  6lb Extra Power Striker Spring- use this to increase the strike power and makes for a faster reset.   -  Reduced Power Safety Block Plunger Spring- smooth out the bump as the safety plunger is engaged.   -  6lb Extra Power Trigger Spring (Extra power reduces the pull weight)- The heavier weight offsets the added weight of the striker. This is an assisting spring and lightens up the trigger press. This spring is not used in Gen 5 Glock pistols.
The Ghost Complete Drop in Spring Kit gives your Glock a smooth, crisp, lightened Trigger pull that helps promote consistent, match-grade accuracy. You can change specific springs to improve a particular aspect of the trigger pull, or do a complete upgrade.Accurately calibrated spring weights deliver consistent force through the entire compression and release cycle to give you a light, refined trigger pull without sacrificing the reliability of your pistols Safe Action system.
Trigger Spring has nearly 30% more power than factory spring, which actually reduces pull by as much as 1 lb. for improved control. This produces faster trigger reset for quicker follow up shots. Reduced power Safety Spring reduces friction caused by the firing pin safety, further smoothing the pull. Striker Spring is designed for improved consistency and durability over factory spring.You can choose the Competition Lighter Striker Spring or the Heavier Self Defense Striker spring.

As with all members of the EVOLUTION family, the EVOLUTION 45 stands head and shoulders above the ""competition"" because it incorporates the A.S.A.P. System. Essentially a ""product-perfected"" Nielsen device, the A.S.A.P. System enables traditionally recalcitrant Browning inspired handgun designs to function reliably by temporarily relieving the host firearm of the weight-burden of the suppressor. When an EVOLUTION 45 equipped weapon is discharged, high-pressure gasses enter the suppressor body and propel it forward against the tension of the A.S.A.P. System driving spring. While the majority of the suppressor's mass is in this ""floating"" condition, the host weapon's firing cycle is able to proceed unhampered. The driving spring within the A.S.A.P. System returns the suppressor to it's unfired state, ready for subsequent shots. This sequence of events takes place so quickly, the shooter is unaware it has occurred.Technical InformationCaliber .45 ACPO.A. Length 7.6 in (193mm) Diameter 1.38 in (35mm)Weight 10 oz (283g)Degree of Suppression -23dB (Dry) -37dB (5ml of H20 or light oil)Construction Materials Stainless Steel and AluminumStandard Finish Flat Black0.578x28 threadingPurchased new in 2010, and approx. 500 rounds fired. Never failed to cycle, even with hand-loaded, sub-sonic ammo. No factory disassembly tool included, but a pair of snap-ring pliers will easily remove the end cap for cleaning.Transferable on BATFE Form 4. $200 for the federal tax stamp. 3-6 month wait for approval, depending on BATFE activity.Additional pistons are available to fit your pistol are available online ($50-$80, depending on caliber)."

KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

It boasts the same superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make larger XD(M)®’s easy and intuitive to use in a slightly abbreviated package. And you’ll be amazed at how fun it is to shoot. The XD(M)® 3.8” Compact .45ACP Bi-Tone has a 3.8 inch barrel mated with a shortened compact frame. When combined with the versatility of XD(M) Gear® X-Tension™ magazines, the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact .45 is ready for daily carry or a day on the range. Put in an X-Tension™ magazine, and you have a 13 round full-sized .45ACP pistol. Use the flush-fitting 9 round magazine, and you have a Compact. Like all XD(M)®’s, the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact Bi-Tone comes with three interchangeable backstraps, dovetail sights, mega-lock frame texturing, an ambidextrous magazine release, a multi-position frame rail, and a match grade barrel. You’ll also find all the safety features that make the XD(M)® a safe pistol in responsible hands. Your total XD(M)® experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. The rugged Multi-Use Carrying Case is as durable as the XD(M)® it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M)® pistols. Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M)®, you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.  (M)ould-Tru Backstraps: With the interchangeable backstraps, Springfield has added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit. (M)ulti-Adjust Rail System™: A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter’s hand position. (M)elonite®: Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. (M)atch Grade Barrel: Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry.

*I also have the high quality SBT Folding Stock (SB Tactical SBT SCORPION EVO SIDE FOLDING Pistol Stabilizing Brace, BLACK, COMPLETE ASSEMBLY, INCLUDES CZ ADAPTER) which goes for $250. This is the sturdiest and most reliable stock for the Scorpion, in my opinion.
 
SBT Brace is hard to find in stock and I will not sell alone/until the Scorpion sells.
 
 
 
In addition, there are x3 *30 round mags (unused) & x2 *20 round mags.
 
 
 
If an offer is less than posted price, the SBT Brace and mags may be removed from the deal and sold seperately, depending on interest.

SBT Brace info:The SBT-EVO Pistol Stabilizing Brace was designed to provide increased stability and improved accuracy while firing with one hand. The skeletonized design is thinner and lighter than the original SB15 brace while still providing the same functionality. The polymer construction firmly contours to your forearm and while the adjustable nylon stabilizing strap wraps around your arm reducing fatigue while firing one handed.

It is built on a Compact frame, which is mated to a 5” barrel and full-size slide. The Compact frame will allow this pistol to be carried more discreetly than a gun with a full-size frame. However, throw in an X-Tension™ magazine, and the XD® 5” Compact takes on the feel of a full- size pistol. The XD® 5” Compact has all the same features found in the standard XD® line. The longer barrel and slide result in a longer sight radius and faster recoil recovery. The Compact frame will help keep the pistol concealed when it’s carried with flush-fitting magazines. If you need more capacity, X-Tension™ magazines let you go from 10+1 to 13+1 rounds of .45 ACP with a simple magazine change. The XD® 5” Compact includes everything that makes Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block give you the safety and usability that you expect in a Springfield Armory® XD®. If you’re looking for a concealed carry .45 ACP pistol that delivers a little bit more, try the XD® 5” Compact. You will be surprised at how easily it carries, you will enjoy how it handles and you’ll appreciate the firepower it offers.

You can't beat the adjustable grip design HK went with for this gun. It's an incredibly comfortable shooter, and pretty darn accurate too. I'm sure I'll add another to my collection at some point but for now, it's time to try something new. The gun also comes with a custom molded Dara Holster's AIWB kydex rig and Volund Gearworks tactical belt (size large), hence the slightly higher price. I'm happy to send pics upon request.

Meaning there is simply no tolerance for parts that do not perform as if someone’s life depends on them. Using the powerful .357 Magnum ammo this quick-draw revolver has plenty of muscle to back it up. Features include fixed sights, crisp single-double action trigger and a transfer bar for added safety.     Taurus Security System (TSS)rsTaurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun’s manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with most guns). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol’s manual safety in the “safe” position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.        Transfer BarThe transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

The new Walther SOFTCOIL ™ gas-delayed blowback technology works to make the CCP an excellent concealed carry firearm. With an overall length of just 6.41 inches, the Walther CCP is a sleek solution to concealed carry protection. The new model’s barrel length is 3.54 inches and its width is only 1.18 inches making it easily carried in a purse or inside-the-pant holster. This CCP comes in stylish Cerakote® black with a tungsten grey frame, and provides all the features that have become a signature of Walther’s line of pistols. It has a smooth 5.5 pound trigger pull, interchangeable front sight with white dot, adjustable rear sight, and reversible magazine release for left- or right-handed operation. This new single-stack semi-automatic has a magazine capacity of 8 rounds. For maximum safety, the CCP comes equipped with a slim manual thumb safety and one internal safety that acts as a firing pin block. As with all Walther firearms, the CCP has an ergonomic grip with a unique non-slip surface. Other key attributes of the firearm include an easy access slide stop, loaded chamber indicator for added safety, and serrations (front, rear and trigger guard) for additional safety and control of its easily manipulated slide.  Features Front Sight with White Dot Picatinny Rail Smooth Trigger Reversible Magazine Release  The CCP’s SOFTCOIL™ gas-delayed blowback system uses gas pressure from the ignited cartridge by directing it through a small port in the barrel in front of the chamber to slow down and delay the rearward motion of the slide. This is accomplished by means of a piston contained inside of a cylinder located under the barrel that opposes the rearward motion of the slide until the gas pressure has declined after the bullet has left the barrel. This allows the slide to end its rearward motion, opening the breech, and ejecting the empty cartridge case."

Ruger® designed the M77® Hawkeye® All Weather Bolt-Action Rifle with 2 principles in mind: simplicity and strength. At the core of the M77 Hawkeye is an ultra-reliable action based on the Mauser® 98—considered one of the strongest and most dependable firearm designs for over 100 years. The M77 Hawkeye action utilizes a controlled feed mechanism with a large claw extractor that takes a solid hold on the cartridge's rim as it is being fed into the chamber. The controlled round feeding, plus a sturdy fixed blade ejector and a 1-piece stainless steel bolt make the M77 Hawkeye a top choice for serious big game hunting anywhere in the world. Integral scope mounts are machined directly on the steel receiver to accept Ruger scope rings (included), eliminating any chance of screwed-on bases coming loose in the field. A steel trigger guard protects the trigger in the case of a fall, and a hinged, all-steel floorplate allows hunters to unload the rifle safely without cycling cartridges through the chamber. The Ruger M77 Hawkeye features the LC6™ trigger that comes from the factory smooth and crisp with an optimized pull weight for hunting. A 3-position safety allows the shooter to load or unload the rifle with the safety engaged in the middle position. In the rearward position, the bolt is locked where it is extremely unlikely to get bumped or knock off safe, making it an ideal safety for hunters who have to navigate rugged terrain. The Ruger M77 Hawkeye All Weather Bolt-Action Rifle comes with stainless steel barrel and bottom metal; and an ergonomic, synthetic stock that's impervious to inclement weather. A rubber butt pad softens felt recoil and keeps the butt-stock from slipping on the shooter's shoulder. Sling swivel studs provide for the quick attachment of a hunting sling. The Ruger M77 Hawkeye All Weather Bolt-Action Rifle is a rugged, reliable hunting rifle that will give generations of hard use. Made in USA.

Magazine .223/5.56 Accuracy, Reliability & Quality  Testing and Accuracy CORE Rifle Systems continued research and development comes by no surprise. Genuine CORE Rifle System Barrels begin with raw bar stock cut to length. We then drill the bar stock and button rifle the bar stock. In the end, after all processes and procedures are met, we test our product. In our pursuit of excellence we invested in the Bill Wiseman Accuracy Test fixture. During the test phase, we mount completed uppers onto the test fixture and lock it in just as you would on a complete lower. We then insert a typical magazine and fire for effect. The Test Fixture employs a pneumatic firing process which means no human error on manipulating the trigger. It fires the complete upper the same each and every time. By doing this, we look for initial groupings down range. We look for consistent three-hole groups on the target. Our most important goal is to achieve a tight three shot group on the target consistently. This also works extremely well on zeroing optics to the upper. The results with our CORE Rifle Systems barrels have been amazing. It gives you immediate feedback on accuracy and consistency. We use the Bill Wiseman Accuracy fixture on both .223/5.56 and .308 platforms manufactured by CORE Rifle Systems."

The Taurus 800 Series is equipped with “Strike Two” capabilities. If you have a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 series sense this and automatically gives you instant “Strike Two” capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike.
