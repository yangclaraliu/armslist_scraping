I prefer 147 gr ammo in it ( FMJ and Gold Dots) but 115 gr shoots well, too.  Comes with original Sig Import box and 2 P-6 8-round magazines.  Fully loaded weighs about 32 oz.  Good German Steel ! :)  This has been my carry 9mm, but will be replaced by the P-239 for that role. Some holster wear on bluing, but an attractive and great pistol.

NIGHTFORCE MODEL: C237
The top choice for law enforcement snipers. A large objective lens increases resolution and exit pupil size for rapid target acquisition and optimal light performance in twilight conditions…an especially useful configuration for tactical teams that may not have dedicated night vision. This superior optical design also benefits hunters and sport shooters who want to maximize their success in low-light environments. A large field of view, 110 MOA of adjustment and a practical magnification range make this an ideal riflescope for both snipers and sportsmen. ***The 3.5-15x56NXS is being discontinued and currently has limited availability

For sale for $2,000 obo. That is what I have in it. Here is a description of the gun:

Red Jacket Firearms in Baton Rouge, LA used an unfired, Yugoslavian M92 parts kit and a no dak spud receiver to make this impressive firearm.

Please note, this gun is used but in immaculate condition. It has 2 full magazines down the barrel. That means that this gun has had 60 rounds through it since Red Jacket built it.

One of the things that makes this firearm so incredibly unique is the fact that the original Yugoslavian military issue barrel was utilized. The United States Department of Defense no longer allows the import of functioning barrels to be included with parts kits imported into the U.S. Barrels made in the U.S. are offered and often included with parts kits like these - the trouble is that the U.S. made barrels pale in comparison to a military-issue quality barrel.

Since the factory barrel was used, Red Jacket pinned their inert silencer onto the muzzle of the firearm, thus making it NFA compliant. Due to that, this gun can transfer to a regular FFL and no $200 tax stamp is needed as it is not considered an SBR (short barrel rifle).

This is from my personal collection, and does not require doing paperwork as long as you have a valid Texas Drivers license. I will also write a bill of sale to you for your records.

Also, I just wanted to add that this gun has very little kick to it. I was really surprised it was so comfortable to shoot.

Don't miss your opportunity to own this M92 krink built by Red Jacket Firearms."

PPS43-C Pistol

HISTORIC TREASURES

The history...

The PPS43 (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev submachine gun) was born as an answer for the need of a weapon that would be more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, which was in use then by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews, mobile recon groups and paratroopers. In late 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new, more compact SMG. Designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942 and it was adopted under the designation of PPS42. Next year he refined the design and this final model was designated as PPS43. This SMG was manufactured in significant numbers, with nearly 2 million PPS43 weapons manufactured between 1943 and 1946. The PPS43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world and widely copied.

The PPS43 was license-produced in Poland starting in 1946.

Today…

Pioneer Arms together with, I.O. Inc., has redesigned this historical firearm to shoot from a closed bolt position. The safety is located at the front of the trigger guard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters distance. The front sight is a fixed blade. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded closed position.

This pistol is manufactured at the famed Radom Plant in Poland by Pioneer Arms. All parts and components are Polish made. The PPS43-C pistol comes with a curved box magazine which holds up to 35 rounds.

These are the best of the best. Don't waste your money on knock off's or cmmg's mags. They will jam and mis feed and cause mis fires. Believe me I've spent a lot of time running through .22 lr shells. If you ever plan on getting a dedicated .22 lr upper or ever plan on getting a .22 lr conversion kit, you WILL want these mags. I've ran close to 2500 rounds through one of my mags already - flawlessly. These are HIGHLY reliable feeding in both semi-auto and full-auto mode(per Black Dogs website). I have used the SlideFire buttstock system with success on rapid fire. Made in the USA, and come with a Lifetime Warranty from Black Dog. These mags are brand new and they have the STAINLESS STEEL feed lips, not the nylon feed lips. $25 a piece. The ONLY thing I would consider trading would be Federal .22 LR ammo. 573-3five3-31five4.

Here's what KAC has to say:
The Stoner Rifle 15 series are semi-automatic rifles featuring a 16"" chrome chamber barrel, a URX free floating barrel system, an ambidextrous control system, a two-stage trigger, an improved multi-lug E3 bolt and integral front sight and sling mounts.

This is the Carry SAS Gen 2 nitron, with 7 mags and all the original goodies.  I am interested in getting a G21, only the Gen 4. Now for those of you who think Glocks are worth $700, please, no need to reply.  My local Scheels gets Glocks in on a regular basis and they sell them for $579.  My Sig 220 sells for $1049.  The 6 extra mags cost about $50 each, so add $300 to that. If your Glock is worth $700, then my Sig is worth $1400, so I would need 2 Glocks for it.  I'm not trying to sound like a dick, I'm just a little bitter about all the greed that I've been seeing on AL the past few months.  Now being reasonable, I'd put a value of $1000 on my Sig package, and a generous $600 for a G21.

This rifle is perfectly functional and has had no problems,  no Failures to fire, no failure to cycle, load or eject. I did one time encounter a bad cartridge and had a bullet lodge about 3/4"" inside the barrel. I pushed it backwards with my cleaning rod and it came right out. I shot most my rounds after this with no problems. It operates just as perfect as my 54 Tula, but I am looking to add something different.

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

824,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1484824,For Sale:  Mongolian recurve bow,"Saint Paul (Midway), Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota",$ 150,"Listed On: Friday, April 19, 2013",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have for sale my Mongolian traditional recurve bow handcrafted by famous bowmaker Toth Zoltan in Hungary. I had it made in 2011. The draw length is 28 inches. Not sure what the draw weight is but it is very easy to shoot. I've shot targets from over 30 yards and it is a very comfortable bow. Springtime is here and there are FREE outdoor archery ranges in the Twin Cities! This is a great opportunity for those who want a practical and reliable, truly traditional & instinctive shooting bow away from the techy modern bows that most people use today.

Bow Description:
The Mongolian style is a more than 1000 year-old-style. The Mongolian bows are always symmetric bows. They have ""string-pads"" for stopping the string rapidly after the shot. Thus the arrow earns a higher impulse, and a higher starting velocity than at the other bows, which have no string-pads.

The bows are composite bows. They consist of 3 main parts:
The 2 end-parts, which are made out of wood (normally ash, cherry and pear) the hilt and the reflex-curves, which are made out of fiberglass covered by cow-leather.

The string is made out of ""Dacron""-which is a stretchable plastic, and ""Kevlar"" for the string bandage. At the hilt, they have a wooden plate, to make the bow's surface smoother for the arrow.


I will include for FREE:
1. Thumb ring
2. Forearm guard
3. Archery glove
2. Mongolian style leather quiver with whatever wooden arrows that are left (most have been broken or lost)

$150 cash. Price is firm. Pick up in Saint Paul."

Can be a quick and easy fix for the right person, I just never bothered to attempt to fix it. It still shoots if the metal rail is aligned back in place before racking the slide to load.
