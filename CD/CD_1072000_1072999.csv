Union Army soldiers relied on many different types of sidearms for short
range and close quarters combat. The revolver was unique in that it had the
ability to fire several rounds per minute before having to reload.
Revolvers were typically issued to officers and mounted soldiers, however
some were purchased privately or found on the battlefield by infantrymen.
istinguished by its octagon barrel and lever style loader, the 1851 helped
to begin both the expansion of the West and the Civil War. The 1851 Navy is
commonly considered to be one of gunfighter  Wild Bill  Hickok s favorite
handguns. The British government licensed the manufacturing rights and
produced what is commonly known as the London Model.
his model features a 7.5 octagonal Old Silver barrel, Old Silver frame,
nickel guard, and walnut grip. It is available in .44 caliber, weighs 2.75
lbs., and is 13"" in length.

Shipping the rifle itself to an FFL holder in the CONUS is $50, because this is a solid, well built, and heavy rifle (or send me a pre-paid shipping label if you can have it shipped at a better rate and that would work too). Shipping the 12 magazines to your house, office, etc. is $10. Please be sure the dealer will accept rifle shipments from an individual. If they don't, plenty of other dealers will, especially smaller gun shops, pawn shops, and certain hardware stores, etc.

Experienced seller for over 13 years on GunBroker, Auction Arms, Gunsamerica, and eBay with nothing but A+ ratings on each of them throughout my history. Nevertheless, if you are uncomfortable purchasing this directly from me in cases where shipping would be involved, we can set this up as an auction through Gunbroker or one of the other sites if that is what you prefer.

It is up to you, the buyer, to make sure this is legal in your area, and if it is we are an approved seller to the state of California and are more than happy to serve you.

This item is new, we are a licensed gun shop and we received it from the manufacturer or a distributor. It has never been fired and since our shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are not open to the public. This usually means you will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened.

Hello and thank you for checking out our auctions. Up for auction is a brand new Barrett model 98B in .338 lapua magnum. This rifle is brand new in box and comes with a harris bipod. The USO scope and rings have been sold and are no longer available.

Carved from years of hard-earned insight, the Model 98B is entirely in a league of its own. Designed to adapt to a user’s every need, this revolutionary precision rifle offers long-range performance that others can only dream of.

Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it’s not a descendant of anything. This .338 Lapua Magnum rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting.

Thanks to its modular layout, this rifle can be adapted to fit each user’s exact needs. Its straight-line design, running from the muzzle to the shooter’s shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip. This allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a fresh round into the chamber as the bolt silently glides through a polymer guide.

The Model 98B rifle’s aluminum upper receiver boasts an 18-inch M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions.

This impressive long-range weapon isn’t all work. Equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod, it’s also a pleasure to shoot. From its highly efficient muzzle brake to its shooter-adaptable design and unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action.

It has never been fired and since our shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are not open to the public. This usually means you will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened.

Hello and thank you for checking out our auctions. Up for auction is a brand new Barrett model 98B in .338 lapua magnum. This rifle is brand new in box and comes with a harris bipod.

Carved from years of hard-earned insight, the Model 98B is entirely in a league of its own. Designed to adapt to a user’s every need, this revolutionary precision rifle offers long-range performance that others can only dream of.

Even the casual observer can see that the Model 98B is not a descendant of the bolt action sporting rifle. In fact, it’s not a descendant of anything. This .338 Lapua Magnum rifle was developed to be a completely unique, purpose-built platform for precise long-range shooting.

Thanks to its modular layout, this rifle can be adapted to fit each user’s exact needs. Its straight-line design, running from the muzzle to the shooter’s shoulder, tames recoil. It also allows for faster, more accurate follow-up shots fed from the 10-round detachable magazine. The ergonomic pistol grip reduces muscle fatigue and provides total control over the fully adjustable trigger. An intuitive, thumb-operated safety can be accessed without compromising the firing grip. This allows the shooter to maintain a solid weld to the adjustable cheek piece. The oversized bolt handle can be easily manipulated, feeding a fresh round into the chamber as the bolt silently glides through a polymer guide.

The Model 98B rifle’s aluminum upper receiver boasts an 18-inch M1913 optics rail, offering plenty of space to mount substantial optics as well as a night vision device or other accessories. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions.

This impressive long-range weapon isn’t all work. Equipped with a rear monopod and forward bipod, it’s also a pleasure to shoot. From its highly efficient muzzle brake to its shooter-adaptable design and unprecedented performance, the 98B is ingenuity in action.

Built to bridge the gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets, this carbine features a 16' light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with Picatinny Rail, heat dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible, six-position Pardus buttstock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs. The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice on the Picatinny Rail. The 16"" barrel, although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. The Pardus stock makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter.Additional InformationManufacturer DPMSSKU GAG_DPRFA3-OCConditionNew in BoxAction Type Semi-automaticCaliber 5.56 NATO OR .223Model OracleManufacturer Part Number RFA3OCAccessories Fwd Assist, Dst CvrFinish Per Color BlackCapacity 30 rounds  1450 for the gun or comes with a new burris ar-536 5x scope with ballistic reticle for 1600.

Online rumors about a big government munitions purchase are TRUE.

The Homeland Security Department wants to buy more than 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition in the next four or five years. It says it needs them -- roughly the equivalent of five bullets for every person in the United States. 

Alex Jones spoke of an ""arms race against the American people"" and said the government was ""gearing up for total collapse, they're gearing up for huge wars."" 

Federal solicitations to buy the bullets are known as ""strategic sourcing contracts,"" which help the government get a low price for a big purchase. Homeland Security Department use as many as 15 million rounds every year, mostly on shooting ranges and in training exercises. 

One of the contracts would allow Homeland Security to buy up to 750 million rounds of ammunition over the next five years for its training facilities. The rounds are used for basic and advanced law enforcement training for federal law enforcement agencies under the department's umbrella. The facilities also offer firearms training to tens of thousands of federal law enforcement officers. More than 90 federal agencies and 70,000 agents and officers used the department's training center last year. 

The rest of the 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition would be purchased by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal government's second largest criminal investigative agency. 

ICE's ammunition requests for 2012 included: 

--450 million rounds of .40-caliber duty ammunition 

--40 million rounds of rifle ammunition a year for as many as five years, for a total bullet-buy of 200 million rounds 

--176,000 rifle rounds on a separate contract 

--25,000 blank rounds 

Last year the Social Security Administration posted a notice that it was buying 174,000 hollow point bullets."

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons.
I will sell them for $40 each.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. Made in U.S.A."

She has twin 350 Crusader engines that have been maintained in great condition.  The engines were replaced new around '99, or 2000.  They are 225 HP each and are very dependable.  She has two 92 gallon fuel tanks and a 30 gallon water tank...all in very good condition. The fiberglass hull is very sound. Electronics are older, but still function very well.  The boat has no mechanical issues and is very sound.  Cosmetically, she needs some work.  She sits on a mooring (free anchorage) in Beaufort, NC, but is currently in a slip in Beaufort for the winter months.  I live 4 hours from Beaufort and life just doesn't afford me the time to get to the coast often enough to keep her up, or use her...she needs a new owner who can appreciate her.  Very dependable fishing/cruising/liveaboard.  She needs interior and exterior cosmetics but is totally usable as she sits.  I haven't had her pulled from the water and bottom-painted in a couple of years so that needs to be done before long.  Pics are of the last time it was out of the water.  The curtains  are a bit worn, but still usable....couple of zippers need replacing.  Recent upgrades to electrical system which include a solar charging system which keeps the 3 batteries at full capacity at all times.  I sometimes don't get down for many months at a time, and she ALWAYS starts and runs well...just needs some cosmetic TLC and someone who can use and appreciate her. She has a working head, running water, and will sleep 4-5 people. 10 years ago she appraised for $25,000.00 and is in better mechanical condition now....just not as cosmetically aesthetic."

Online rumors about a big government munitions purchase are TRUE.

The Homeland Security Department wants to buy more than 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition in the next four or five years. It says it needs them -- roughly the equivalent of five bullets for every person in the United States.

Alex Jones spoke of an ""arms race against the American people"" and said the government was ""gearing up for total collapse, they're gearing up for huge wars.""

Federal solicitations to buy the bullets are known as ""strategic sourcing contracts,"" which help the government get a low price for a big purchase. Homeland Security Department use as many as 15 million rounds every year, mostly on shooting ranges and in training exercises.

One of the contracts would allow Homeland Security to buy up to 750 million rounds of ammunition over the next five years for its training facilities. The rounds are used for basic and advanced law enforcement training for federal law enforcement agencies under the department's umbrella. The facilities also offer firearms training to tens of thousands of federal law enforcement officers. More than 90 federal agencies and 70,000 agents and officers used the department's training center last year.

The rest of the 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition would be purchased by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal government's second largest criminal investigative agency.

ICE's ammunition requests for 2012 included:

--450 million rounds of .40-caliber duty ammunition

--40 million rounds of rifle ammunition a year for as many as five years, for a total bullet-buy of 200 million rounds

--176,000 rifle rounds on a separate contract

--25,000 blank rounds

Last year the Social Security Administration posted a notice that it was buying 174,000 hollow point bullets."

EOtech's website describes it as -

Shortest model sight yet! This sight is smaller and lighter than the other HWS sights and runs on a single 123 battery. With the new single battery configuration, the XPS allows more rail space than ever, leaving more room for rear iron sights, magnifiers or NV mount.  Smaller, lighter and always fast; the XPS series is a great compact option for your platform.

■Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
■Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space
■Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved
■Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 600 hours

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date.
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and
interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.
3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Magazine: High capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free, even when empty, when the magazine button is depressed. Standard flush magazines may be complemented with optional extended magazines that increase the capacity by 3 rounds (1 round for .45 Auto caliber).
9. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use.
10. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
11. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
