Chambered for 8mm (7.92x57mm) caliber. Scope is a 350mm 2-7x zoom, Long Eye Relief (scout) with rings and a semi-custom base that mounts to the original rear sight base (no holes drilled). Trench mag is a repro, I've had no issues with it. Loads from the top and can be removed for cleaning. I will also include the original magazine floorplate and original rear sight (rear sight has some damage but does work). Action is very smooth and the gun works great. Cycles perfectly and seems pretty accurate. Works with a variety of ammo including surplus and modern manufacture. The only ammo it doesn't seem to like is Romanian surplus. Asking $325 obo for the entire package. If you want to buy just the rifle it would be $200 without the scope, trench mag, or bipod.Can meet at my work during business hours.

Take-down of the P-10 will be familiar to most fans of striker-fired guns, and even more pleasing will be holster compatibility with some of the most common guns on the market."

Equipped with our newly designed low-profile sights, its rear sight has four different aperture sizes for everything from close quarters to way out there. The sights ride on an 11” Picatinny rail perfect for mounting optics.Simple and reliable, the Scorpion not only has ambidextrous controls, its non-reciprocating charging handle is swappable and reach to the trigger is adjustable.Our favorite accessory for the Scorpion pistol is our new arm brace adapter, which quickly and easily adds an AR-style pistol buffer tube to the rear of the action, enabling the use of an arm brace for added stability.The CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol is legally classified by the ATF as a pistol, and is intended by CZ-USA to be used as a pistol. Under current federal law and ATF policy attaching a stock to this pistol – or attaching a device which is then used as a stock or intended to be used as a stock – constitutes the making of a short-barreled rifle which requires registration with ATF and the payment of the applicable tax. Users of the CZ Scorpion EVO 3 S1 Pistol bear the sole responsibility for ensuring their use of the firearm complies with all local, state, and federal firearms laws."

This beauty is a 1952 Ruger standard model 22 automatic. This old girl shoots like a dream and is smooth and accurate. I'm not sure how to determine finish percentages but the deep blue black factory bluing on this one is nearly all intact except for some wear on the blackstrap area and a very small amount on the front strap. This old gun is much better than its age would lead you to expect. Unfortunately the original box and manual were both long gone before it came to me, however, it still has two factory chrome base 9 round magazines and they both function perfectly. Ordinarily when these old pistols are found for sale, only one of the magazines remain if any at all. For something more durable, holding 10 rounds, widely available factory MKII magazines fit and function perfectly by switching the load assist button to the left side. This gem would make a fine shooter I'm sure will last another lifetime and beyond. If you're a collector on a budget, this will make an addition to your collection you can be proud of. NO TRADES PLEASE cash only $275 or MAKE ME AN OFFER."

NRA instructor, RSO, and/or coach certifications also accepted. I'm as Pro-2A as I can be, but I've been contacted by more shady characters than usual lately, and I need some kind of filter to protect myself and potentially others.I am offering two Glock pistols for a two-for-one trade. The first is a Gen 3 G30 .45ACP, 2011 production. 3-dot Tritium night sights and a 3.5 lb Glock connector have been installed, giving the gun a more ""normal"" sight picture and a lighter trigger pull for better accuracy. This is a very pleasant and fun gun to shoot and I have enjoyed it immensely. Never carried, the exterior finish is still in near perfect shape. The original sights and the 5.5 lb connector will go with the gun.
The 2nd is a Gen 4 G23 .40 S&W, 2017 production. It's only about 5 months old and is stock from the factory with zero modifications. My uncle bought one a couple of years ago and I liked it so much that I eventually bought one of my own, but I'm ready to get away from the .40 caliber altogether. Gun is in like-new conditon.Value for both guns is set at $900. Lowball offers and down-value trades will be ignored. Both come with all of the accessories included from the factory. I'm in my 40's, an NRA certified pistol instructor, and I'm well-versed in proper use and maintenance of my guns. I'm looking for quality trades like American-made 1911's in most any size or chambering, H&K, CZ, or Sig Legion pistols in .45ACP, or maybe even another Glock MOS pistol with a quality reflex sight. An M1 Garand in usable condition would be at the top of my list. If you have something interesting and of equal value, let me know. As I mentioned, I'm done with the .40 S&W caliber, and I'm pretty well stocked on anything in 9mm Luger, AR pattern, and bolt-action rifles."

The dealer who’s FFL was used has stated at their website that fraud such as this has been ongoing and they require an authorization form in order to accept a transfer, they have no,idea who this guy is. Finally he provided me an ID that was poorly faked (military ID no less).  His scam is that the check is a paycheck, and that I was to deposit it and when funds show up, to send the gun and send his change through Walmart lmao."

But even essential tools can be refined and improved.
That’s the principle behind the new XD-E™: the best elements of the world-renowned XD® Series, condensed into a weapon so intuitive, comfortable and accurate, you can’t imagine being without it.
The XD-E™ sculpts unmatched Point And Shoot Ergonomics™ into a sleek frame just an inch wide, for hand and holster fit so satisfying you’ll take it everywhere. The low-effort slide practically racks itself, so handling’s a pleasure. The exposed hammer clearly shows gun mode, and the single/double action trigger shows respect for your shooting style, unlike other compacts.
Then there’s the grip: GripZone® provides active texture that matches your grasp like a handshake, improves stability, and feels incredible. Three magazine options let you personalize concealability and capacity. Impeccable feel, weight and balance launch the XD-E™ from invisible to impactful in an instant, for go-anywhere confidence unlike any you’ve felt.
New shooter or skilled gunner, wrap your mitt around the new XD-E™ and you’ll know. This is more than a hammer. It redefines what your hammer should be.
The hammer – the most important tool in the toolbox."

Finally took it to the range a couple of weeks ago. This gun is an absolute dream to shoot. Extremely accurate straight out of the box. I fired approximately 50 or 60 rounds of Winchester Ranger LE 230gr Bonded JHP and was very impressed with it. Not a single FTF or Misfeed, it went bang every single time. When I got back home, I completely tore it down and cleaned, oiled and greased it after polishing the feed ramp, and all internals. Has an excellent smooth trigger. The gun is a series 80 design with a bushingless 4 inch barrel, looks like a bull barrel. Single Action only as are all 1911's. Has Dove-Tail 3-dot white sights that are actually very nice (I had no trouble at all getting on target with my 55 year old eyes). Stainless frame, slide and barrel. Ambidextrious Safety. Very tight tolerances. Beautiful Checkered Wood Grips. Feels and handles great while shooting! Again, this thing in impressive all around.Comes with everything from the factory; Nice storage case, (3) 8-round Mec-Gar magazines, Gun Lock, Cleaning Brushes and Rod, Gun Oil And even a Cleaning Rag. I have also added 28 rounds of Winchester Ranger LE Ammo, 230 Gr Bonded JHP as this is what I used that day at the range.You won't be disappointed with this little gem of a gun. I also carry a Kimber Custom Shop Compact Ultra CDP II and this gun shot every bit as accurate as my Kimber!I'm only selling because I have decided I have too many 1911's and am venturing into other types of handguns.Asking $500 Cash - Just trying to get my money back out of it. You don't have to pay transfer fees or sales tax or shipping with this deal.Due to the increasing number of deadbeats I have encountered, you will need to come to me as I am not willing to drive. I live in Spring, close to Highway 99 and Kuykendahl and usually get home by 4PM thru the week.I have plenty of good HD pictures I am happy to text to anyone interested so please send me a text.
