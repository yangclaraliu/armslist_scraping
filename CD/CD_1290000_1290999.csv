The History... 
The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG). The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42. The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43. This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946). The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied. 

Today... 
I.O. Inc. redesigned this historical firearm to shoot from a closed bolt position. The safety is located at the front of the triggerguard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake.

I purchased this new less than one month ago and it has only been out of the box to check its condition. I also fitted one of the grip extenders onto the back to see how it changed the firearm's profile, but once again, this handgun has never been fired. Everything is sealed in its original packaging (aside from the grip extenders, as I obviously had to open the package to try one) and there is not a single scratch or blemish on anything. 

The reason I purchased this was to have access to a 9mm handgun to teach my girlfriend how to shoot with, since the ammunition was considerably cheaper up until a couple of months ago. Now I can't even afford to shoot what little 9mm ammo I can find, so there isn't any real reason for me to keep this. 

One quick note on the price: yes, it is high, and no, I am not price-gouging. I purchased this handgun new for far more than I should have paid, and I am simply trying to recoup my losses as I am not planning to keep the gun. I am willing to discuss a lower price, but I am not willing to get any less than I paid for it. If it isn't worth it for me to sell, I will simply keep the firearm.

PSO 4X24-1 w/illuminated reticle, shown w/Saiga type clamp

This is a slightly modified version of the original PSO-1 4x24mm issued with the SVD sniper rifle. It features a lighted cross-hair reticle, weatherized electrical assembly, AA size battery adapter, rubber eyeshield, and extremely user friendly target type adjusting turrets. Elevation adjustments are marked off in 100's of meters. The scope is issued with a side mounting bracket/clamp assembly for use on either a standard SVD side plate, or the ""Saiga"" type clamp for fit on the universal plate of the AK/Saiga rifle. The ""Saiga"" clamp will fit all forms of AK side plates, but provides reduced head room/eye relief on most applications. This application works best on Saiga rifles with the original, longer type stocks. Optical glass is fully coated and crystal clear. Comes with a vinyl carrying case with lens filter, tool, cleaning cloth, and manual. Finished in dark grey military hammer paint."

Used to remove the crimp in military style primer pockets prior to reloading.  This item  has swager rods for both large and small primer pockets.  The Dillon solution is a simple device that bolts to your bench and allows you to swage the primer pockets with speed and ease. The case is supported from the inside, so you won't be tearing the rims off the brass. A tool steel, hardened swage rod (easy to change from large to small primers) simply pushes  the crimp away.  The Super Swage 600 comes complete with large and small swage rods.  Sells from Dillon for  $100, I will sell it complete for $65.

For technical specifics, check out Surefire’s website at http://www.surefire.com/mag5-60.html.

 I acquired 4 of these, all with the same assembly date.  I was confident with these magazines being that they were assembled just 4 months ago and I know Surefire has addressed and fixed the problems they were having with their first production runs of these magazines.  I’ve sold 2 to a friends and kept one for myself.  I’ve fired 4 full loads out of mine using Federal 5.56 and did not have any issue or malfunctions.  My friends have not have any issues with theirs either.  This fourth one has NOT been taken out of its sealed wrapper for testing.  With that being said, I will not guarantee anything.  I do know that Surefire stands behind all their products.

I’m selling this for a firm $140 in a FTF sale in the metro Minneapolis area, or for an additional $13 shipped USPS Priority Mail to anywhere in the continental USA where hi-cap magazines are still legal.  I’m not in a hurry to sell it so I’m not going to negotiate on the price.  Looking at the others that are selling here in Armslist, mine is the best value for this hard-to-find magazine.

I looked over and over for this exact pistol all over the net, auction sites, retail site, you name it; no one has this for sale!

We can make a deal on this one, have no paper trail, no tax, no FFL fee’s, have it in your hand today or you can buy online (if you can find one), pay all the extra bs, wait for it to ship, and have paper trail! It’s your call. I’m not into playing games or taking 2 hours to discuss details, tell me your offer, I will respond, if we agree I will set time that works in a safe public place, we show up, you identify yourself with OH DL (CCW is a +++), if you like you buy!

Im just trying to help. Sorry to trick you into opening this but I think its worth the read (BTW, that is what a new Cots msrp is):

Let me first say I shoot in competitions around the country with my guns. I have been buying guns and ammo for over 20 years and have seen this before. I am a Marine and have been buying guns for a long time but this is the worst I have seen it. If you paid more than 1400 for an AR15 unless its an LWRC you paid too much and will see your gun sell for half in six months. I have a reason to have an ar15 but why do you own one...Are you worried that the government will roll down your street and try to take them away. Not going to happen. If you are worried about not ever being able to buy an AR you can buy the lower for 150 to 250 and put it away until you want or need to build one. The lower has the serial # and is essentially the gun.

Gun stores- I wont forget you guys that are taking advantage of this hype and frenzy. Dawsonville Gun and Pawn started out fair but now is whoring out their stuff just like the rest of the gun stores. As an example, they had Magpul Pmags on the shelf and were selling them for 25 plus tax. These cost the dealer less than 8 bucks and msrp is 12. They have an M93 machine pistol that used to sell for $500, then 750 and not they want 999 for it. Sham on you guys. Many of us wont forget! . There are two very fair gun stores in Gainsville I found, you can find them pretty easy and they are right next to each other. 

The other thing that will change is the attitude of the NOT so sales people. These guys used to be nice but now they act like they are doing you a favor. Scott at the Dawsonville Gun and Pawn store is the poster child for dicks that work at gun stores. Avoid this arrogent minimum wage punk at all costs. It will just ruin your fun experience. I promise that when this settles down you will be first to go. This guy needs some ptsd counseling or something.

Now think about all that inventory that is sitting in the hands of gun owners who either dont shoot, purchased on speculation that they could flip the gun or ammo like you flip a house, and the best are those that put 2000 ar rifles on their credit cards. Those bills are now coming in and some cant pay. You dont need an AR 15 to protect yourself. The best home protection is an 870 or Mossbert pump shotgun with a light on it for under $500. Read about home protection on the web.

Its only a matter of time before a ton of inventory hits the street. Dealers will have lots of supply and so will joe consumer. With all that on the market, how much do you think your black rifle will be worth or the 30000 rounds you are sitting on.....Just a thought. Do you remember business school...supply and demand. Dawson Gun and Pawn is already getting calls from people asking if they will buy back the guns they bought.

Dont get caught with that 2000 rifle thats really going to be worth 600 because of the simple law of supply and demand. Youe wont be able to give that rifle away when the factories dump all their orders in the next six months.

What I look forward to is seeing the smug looks of gun dealers being wiped off their faces and their sales staff cut down to one and the owner.

Its going to be a fun ride for AR-15 owners or hoarders of .223 ammo and people paying 30 to $50 for magpul mags that are worth $12.

Good luck"

This handsome rimfire rifle sports an AR-style look and is modeled after the legendary original Colt M4. A ""Tactical Rimfire"" rifle, the M4 Ops is an upgraded version of the .22 M4 Carbine. Instead of the standard forearm found on the carbine, the Ops has an RIS, or Rail Interface System, that provides tactical railing on four sides allowing for you to mount a variety of available accessories.

Additionally, the carry handle that's on the carbine is also replaced by a detachable rear sight making the M4 Ops an ideal optic-ready rimfire rifle.

This was purchased as the base for a custom build precision rifle. The Polytechs are often prefered by custom builders over the Springfields for many reasons. The Polys feature a heat treated forged receiver while the Springfields use a cast receiver that is of lesser quality. The Polys are also closer to original GI specs and feature a chrome lined barrel which makes them able to handle crappy surplus loads better. I know that these statements infuriate the die hard Springfield guys but the custom build guys happen to side with me on the issue. Please no hate mail attempting to educate me. I have had one of the more well known guns smiths in Lexington tell me that this is one of the nicest M14s he has ever seen. I trust his 20+ years of experience when it comes to these matters. The rifle shoots great as is but I have already begun the process of building this into a nail driver by purchasing a National Match spring guide by Sadlak and a recoil buffer. With some TLC and more precision parts this Polytech will shoot as good as if not better than a National Match rifle. If you are up to the task then make me an offer. I dont need to sell so please no BS offers.

I’m asking $750 or VERY BEST offer (not because I’m gouging, but because this 4” XD45 Compact in FDE BNIB is very hard to get ahold of, period)! I looked over and over for this exact pistol all over the net, auction sites, retail site, you name it; no one has this for sale! However I did manage to find one or two with the 5” full size slide on the Compact FDE frame (looks like poop Imo) and they are listed for $650+! If you are lucky enough to even find another at a better price, JUMP ON IT! I’m not into the “well this place has this, or this place has that” if that’s the case, buy it! We can make a deal on this one, have no paper trail, no tax, no FFL fee’s, have it in your hand today or you can buy online (if you can find one), pay all the extra bs, wait for it to ship, and have paper trail! It’s your call. I’m not into playing games or taking 2 hours to discuss details, tell me your offer, I will respond, if we agree I will set time that works in a safe public place, we show up, you identify yourself with OH DL (CCW is a +++), if you like you buy!

If you ever use your ""pepper spay"" in self-defense, send me a copy of the police report and you'll get free re-fills.
=================
About Pepper Spray:

This spray has an Ultra-Violet Light Identifying Dye (which helps to ID these Ass-holes) includes both a clip (to easily attach it to your clothes while walking) and a key ring.

PEPPER SPRAY FACTS: Pepper spray enables you to defend yourself while keeping a safe distance from an attacker. Pepper sprays induce an almost immediate burning sensation of the skin and a burning, tearing, and swelling of the eyes. If spray is inhaled, the respiratory tract becomes inflamed resulting in a swelling of the mucous membranes lining the breathing passages and temporarily restricting breathing to short, shallow breaths. A one second burst to the face will cause temporary blindness, choking, coughing, and nausea-disabling your attacker giving you time to escape.

The active ingredient in this spray is Oleoresin Capsicum (O.C.), commonly referred to as red pepper. It is a natural, oily, resin-like substance derived from hot peppers, the same peppers used to make spicy foods hot.

When considering which pepper spray is most effective, one must consider the percentage of pepper being used and the heat rating of that pepper (measured in Scoville Heat Units or S.H.U.). A good pepper sprays has a rating of 2 million S.H.U. or higher...

**Don't be fooled by the claims ""Hottest allowed by law"" and ""Hottest in the industry"" that are made by some on the web. This gives people a false sense of security.**

FYI...Capsaicinoid Concentration is the determination of active components in Oleoresin Capsicum. Capsaicinoids
are the group of compounds that cause the burning sensation. There are the three main compounds that make
up about 95% of the Capsaicinoids: Capsaicin, Dihydrocapsaicin, and Nordihydrocapsaicin. The Capsaicinoid
Concentration is the amount of these compounds in a certain solution. Therefore, by measuring the amount
of capsaicinoids, an accurate level of pungency can be determined for the solution. This is the unit of
measurement that is the most consistent and best representation throughout all grades of Oleoresin Capsicum.
In essence, it is the equaling factor between SHU’s and % OC.

While the strength of the selected peppers may vary from year to year or between seasons, the measurement
of capsaicinoids is consistent in determining that hotness. A 0.2% Capsaicinoid Concentration will yield the
same amount of hotness, regardless of the batch of peppers or their location of cultivation. For this reason, it
is the only accurate method of determining the pungency of peppers. The current detection method for this
analysis is by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography, HPLC.4 Therefore, by establishing quality control
monitoring the capsaicinoid concentration, a consistent strength or pungency can be easily obtained and
verified by this analysis.

**Federal law does not allow carrying any type of pepper spray on airplanes or in the security areas of an airport. They are also prohibited on aircraft because the drop in air pressure can cause the pepper spray canisters to explode. For the same reason, pepper spray cannot be shipped by air. **If you're flying, I'll tell/show you how to make your spray ""airplane safe"". Just e-mail me.

Always remember that you assume all risk and liability for owning and using pepper spray. Even if you use it correctly, there is no guarantee that it will always be effective at hindering an attack, and there is always the possibility that it may be used against you instead.

**Consult the laws of your state and/or local agency. Understand and Obey them before owning pepper spray.**
