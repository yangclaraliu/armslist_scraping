Original vetterli rifles shot a 10mm black powder rimfire round. In WW1 the Italians converted most of these to 6.5 Carcano. This rifle is in need of serious cleaning if a person plans to shoot it. Has what looks to be dried up cosmoline on the reciever that makes the action sticky. Cleaned up and ready to shoot would be asking 400. In current condition price is 200 cash. I'm selling this for a friend who has been widowed for some time so I do not know anymore of the history of this rifle. No trades. Thanks.

For a bullpup, this thing has a great trigger....blows the Tavor out of the water! I have also upgraded to an enhanced bolt sleeve, and a Manticore Arms Switchback charging handle.....because if you’re like me, the “HK-Chop” is life. My particular model has the “mud” stock, and 16” fluted barrel. I added the fixed Daniel Defense sights. This is the longest-reigning rifle in my safe, but my collection has evolved, and I need to clear up some capitol. There’s something to be said about a weapons platform that has been around since the 70’s, and is still widely used in military services all over the world....that isn’t an AK or AR. Adopt this beauty to your collection today....before I change my mind! $1,350"

When I bought this gun, used, it just had a new barrel and barrel bushing put in by Springfield. I unfortunately don't know where the paper work for that is now, so take it how you want. Since owning the gun I have run roughly 2500 rounds thru the gun. So the negatives of the gun. The rear Trijicon sights have lost the tritium tubes, so they are no longer night sights.
