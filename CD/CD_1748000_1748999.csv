With the addition of the Px4 Compact in 2010, Beretta completed the Px4 family of pistols. Heralded by many as the ultimate in balance, feel and proportion, the Compact is well suited for concealed carry yet perfectly at home in a duty holster. Its compact and controllable design accommodates plainclothes operations, home defense, or a day at the range. 

The Px4 Compact offers a full grip for most shooters, providing incredible controllability in an easy to carry package.The 16 round capacity (15+1 in 9mm) provides for true combat effectiveness, while still remaining compact. Equipped with an accessory rail, new ambidextrous slide stop and new integral/retractable lanyard loop, the Px4 Compact is highly flexible and mission ready. 

With a cold hammer forged barrel, for precision and the Px4 family’s rotary barrel system to reduce recoil for faster follow up shots, the Compact is fast and accurate. Technology, precision, and a smaller profile make the Px4 Compact the ultimate in concealable, duty ready pistols.

Sightmark’s Ultra Shot Z Series reflex sight features a wide field of view and infinite eye relief, making it useful for close-quarter combat to midrange target shooting. The illuminated, four-pattern, green-colored reticle has a protective hood and quick-detach mount, readying you for any situation. A side-mounted Weaver rail, located on the protective hood, allows you to mount accessories for a beefed-up arsenal. With five brightness settings located on a rotary switch and aircraft-grade aluminum construction, the Ultra Shot Z Series is ideal for any lighting condition and durable enough to withstand high recoil so you never have to worry about poor performance when a quick reaction is needed. Put it back on the rail and it will still hold zero. Matte-black finish eliminates reflections, and the 3-volt power supply runs for 25 hours (on high) on one CR1632 battery (included). Comes with adjustment tools.

Up for sale is a nice little MKII in stainless with the 5.5"" bull barrel. This pistol needs no introduction as far as accuracy and popularity.

I will include 4 genuine Ruger 10rd magazines along with a rail for mounting your optical accessories. Unfortunately, the pistol does not include a rear sight. However, they can be purchased directly from Ruger for $25. Note that the rail cost $40 new so I feel that by including it makes up for the lack of rear-sight.

If you would like the Leapers red dot shown in the pictures I will sell it for $10.

Call or text me at REDACTED. I work late but will do my best to respond ASAP.

Groups are likely to be even tighter with match ammo.  I have used minimags, RWS subsonic, interceptors, and a few federals.  No function problems of any kind.  Due to the target chamber, no stinger ammo should be used (Ruger's manual also states that stingers should not be used).

description quoted from SigSauer.com:
""Designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards, the P220® Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron® finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights.""

2nd owner, Limited run beaver tail frame made in Germany, SRT trigger and short reach trigger has no grit and is very smooth. Very accurate gun. The slide has been refinished in od green by CCRefinishing using their special Cera-Hide coating as well as the external area of the barrel in black Cera-Hide (internal barrel was not coated as both ends were plugged to retain original hard chrome rifling.) It's a much more durable finish than Sig's Nitron finish which is known to show wear very quickly on the barrel top and ejection opening. It doesn't affect function but may bother some if you care about aesthetics. Very wear resistant from showing smileys on top of barrel and is a deeper black. It will include Steve Bedair stainless steel full guide rod. I have the original tan grips and will include with the Hogue D-mascus G-10 checkered od green grips as shown in the pics. It probably has a little over 1k rds down the pipe and it eats any ammo with no ftf or fte. Front strap is checkered. It comes with the original box, lock, manual.

The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), U.S. Patent 6651371, is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M16. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position.
Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease.
The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.

Made in U.S.A.
Features
Mounts on durable Entry-Length Receiver Extension tube (included) to accommodate the common M4 carbine buffer and spring
7-Position LOP adjustability with customizable preset system for fast access to preferred length
Adjustment lever requires only gross motor movement to operate yet the entire stock remains streamlined and anti-snag
Solid ""fixed stock"" lockup and consistent cheek weld in all positions
Enhanced lock mechanism w/ internal impact buffer increases drop strength and shock resistance
Multi-shell construction provides solid foundation and shields critical operating parts from penetration damage
Sloping cheek weld combines a slim profile with user comfort
Stout construction provides counterbalance weight for improved weapon balance and handling
Storage compartment in tail of stock is removable and the door is reversible for user preference
Removable 0.30"" Rubber Butt-Pad offers an anti-slip surface and increased impact protection
Sling Mounts
Front/Rear - Reversible QD swivel sling mounts fit up to 1.5"" push-button swivels (swivel not included)
Bottom - 1.25"" sling loop"

It is a ""RRA Mid-length A4 LAR-15"" to be exact. It is in awesome condition, only about 100 rounds through it, and cleaned after every range trip. These are very, very hard to find right now due to the gun craze, and most places that sell these are back-ordered for 3-12 months or more!

  It has a 16"" barrel with a mid-length gas system, which gives better accuracy and lower recoil than the short-length gas systems. The barrel is chrome-moly and has a 1:9 twist. As you can see I am including a Red (or Green) Dot Sight that has 8 different reticle options. I am also including a flip-up MBUS (back up site) which is co-witnessed with the red-dot (meaning either or both could be used, they both point to my zero at 50 yards), its a really great setup for some closer-range tactical shooting. If you wanted to put a scope on it its pretty easy to do as well, just attach it to the rail system on top (Note: There is no scope included in this package). It has a 6 position adjustable stock. The accuracy is up to 1 MOA (meaning with a shooting rest, high quality ammo, and a good shooter, you can put 5 rounds within a 1"" circle at 100 yards).
 I am also including the tactical sling (partially seen to the left of the stock) as well as 5 - 30 round polymer magazines, 4 of which have a handy window to see how much ammo is remaining. I will include these LOADED at 29 each (can fit 30 but its not very good for the mags and can cause problems) for 145 rounds! [NOTE: NOT SELLING ACCESSORIES/AMMO SEPARATE for this package] The ammo is 55 grain brass cased, not aluminum or steel cased garbage you see nowadays in the current craze. I am able to sell some additional ammunition for additional $.
 I will also toss in some Paper targets so you have something to shoot at. 

This has everything you need to start tactical target shooting or even survive the zombie apocalypse!

List of everything included: Firearm, tactical sling, 5 LOADED magazines (29 x 5 = 145 rounds in magazines), red/green dot sight (Truglo, will include a back up battery too), back up sight, some paper targets, and the original RRA case.

I am NOT looking to trade, looking to sell only. Must be able to meet in Eau Claire, face to face, and have CASH. Will not ship. I can have additional pics and/or information on request. CCW a plus, Wisconsin ID a must."

Not just for zombies anymore

While it would be a lot of fun for our marketing department to sell the Camp 10 as the ultimate zombie-whacking tool, the truth is, it actually has a lot of other uses that you just might find to be of a more immediate nature than zombie defense. Not that we’re ignoring to the coming Zombiepocalypse, mind you. We just think that the Camp 10 makes a pretty awesome camp knife and that it does a great job of whacking campsite or other outdoor chores down to size in very short order.

From clearing brush to making kindling, the Camp 10 is the ideal outdoor and survival tool. Cut, chop, slash, hack, split, scrape—just about any task you ask of it, the Camp 10 can handle. The full-tang Camp 10 is made of carbon tool steel for toughness and wear resistance. A basic black powdercoat protects the steel and makes maintenance easier.

You’ll like the secure, contoured grip of the Camp 10, too. The handle has a built-in hand guard and is drilled in both front and rear so you can attach a lanyard either place—or both—for carrying versatility. Of course, if a zombie does get up close and personal with you, then yeah, you’ll be pretty glad to have a Camp 10 in hand, too.

It is a ""RRA Mid-length A4 LAR-15"" to be exact. It is in awesome condition, only about 100 rounds through it, and cleaned after every range trip. These are very, very hard to find right now due to the gun craze, and most places that sell these are back-ordered for 3-12 months or more!
 It has a 16"" barrel with a mid-length gas system, which gives better accuracy and lower recoil than the short-length gas systems. The barrel is chrome-moly and has a 1:9 twist. As you can see I am including a Red (or Green) Dot Sight that has 8 different reticle options. I am also including a flip-up MBUS (back up site) which is co-witnessed with the red-dot (meaning either or both could be used, they both point to my zero at 50 yards), its a really great setup for some closer-range tactical shooting. If you wanted to put a scope on it its pretty easy to do as well (Note: There is no scope included in this package). It has a 6 position adjustable stock. The accuracy is up to 1 MOA (meaning with a shooting rest, high quality ammo, and a good shooter, you can put 5 rounds within a 1"" circle at 100 yards).
 I am also including the tactical sling (partially seen to the left of the stock) as well as 5 - 30 round polymer magazines, 4 of which have a handy window to see how much ammo is remaining. I will include these LOADED at 29 each (can fit 30 but its not very good for the mags and can cause problems) for 145 rounds! [NOTE: NOT SELLING ACCESSORIES/AMMO SEPARATE for this package] The ammo is 55 grain brass cased, not aluminum or steel cased garbage you see nowadays in the current craze. I am able to sell some additional ammunition for additional $.
 Will toss in some Paper targets so you have something to shoot at. 

This has everything you need to start tactical target shooting or even survive the zombie apocalypse!

List of everything included: Firearm, tactical sling, 5 LOADED magazines (29 x 5 = 145 rounds in magazines), red/green dot sight (Truglo, will include a back up battery too), back up sight, some paper targets, and the original RRA case.

I am NOT looking to trade, looking to sell only. Must be able to meet in Eau Claire, face to face, and have CASH. Will not ship. I can have additional pics and/or information on request. CCW a plus, Wisconsin ID a must."

I can't stand the recoil the 7.62x54r round is brutal. I'm just looking to find something more modern or without so much punch to my shoulder. I'll take cash as well.

I did notice their wasn't matching numbers on bolt, receiver, or barrel. I paid 300 for it so I'm just looking for a fair deal. Thanks"

THIS IS A MODEL 1916 Spanish Mauser, known as a Short Rifle. THE RIFLE WAS MANUFACTURED DURING WAR TIME.  THIS IS BECOMING RARE, STILL ORIGINAL CALIBER, GOOD to Very Good CONDITION HISTORIC FIREARM is as pictured.  It has been in our Family for more than Six Decades & possibly more as my Grandfather left it to me 45+ years ago. Always kept in a controlled non smoking environment. It has never left my home until recently when I made peace to part with it for someone like you that will preserve the heritage. THE highly desirable ORIGINAL CAL. 7x57 in addition to the Hard to Find Sight Wings, still in tack, in addition to the Side Sling Mounts as so many were ground off make those features original.  It has an original Sling along with the Cleaning Rod making this very collectible.  Many unfortunately have been modified from a Collectors value, THIS ONE IS 'Unmolested'. THE BORE IS Good to Very Good.  THE STOCK IS IN GOOD to Very Good Condition (additional pictures available upon request), NO SANDING MARKS. THE METAL FINISH IS IN GOOD To Very Good CONDITION WITH GOOD to Very Good FINISH REMAINING. NO IMPORT MARKS which makes it more valuable. I have had many tell me it will sell at even a higher price with its condition which is rare for a HISTORICAL PIECE! Own proudly a piece of History as we have, it is nearly a Century 100 years old!

The pistol has between 200-250 rounds through it. I bought it a a CCW weapon but it ended up spending most of its time in the nightstand. Included with the sale is the factory case, paperwork, 2-10 round mags with finger extensions, 1-13 round mag, 1leather outside the waistband holster, and one inside the waistband holster. Neither holster shows any wear since I didn't carry the pistol much. The pistol has a polished barrel, extended slide release and extended slide lock, Meprolight fiber optic sights, and a wolf spring kit. All original parts are included in the sale as well.

I'm pretty firm on the price. I'm not gouging and I know what a fair price is. I'm meticulous about maintaining my firearms and once you see the pistol you can tell it was not abused. This isn't something I NEED to sell but I figure it could go to a good home and I could buy something closer to what I'm looking for in a carry pistol. I do not ship so all transactions are FTF with ID required and you agree to sign a bill of sale. While this is not a legal requirement it is a requirement by me and there are no exceptions. CCW holders jump to the front of the line and I only accept cash. If this posting is still up then the pistol is still available. Please contact me through Armslist if you have any questions or would like additional pics. Than you for your time."

This combo is ideal for AR-15's, but it of course would work with other rifles with an intended max range of around 400m. The scope has a red illuminated reticle, 1/2 MOA adjustments, and a 30mm tube. If you mount it to your AR-15, it will be very close to a 50m zero. The mount is a one piece construction that provides a solid mounting platform that will hold the scope rock steady. They have been spray painted by the previous owner with a light tan coating. 

I picked this up in a trade and have not shot it, so the low price reflects my desire to quickly get rid of it and the spray paint coating that is wearing off in a few places; it's being sold in as-is condition. A nice duracoat or cerakote job would make it look brand new! This setup costs right at $300 from Optics Planet, so this is a steal for anybody in the market for such glass. You can reach me at (865-7sixsix-7555). Text is preferred and will be much quicker. Please NO EMAILS!! Yahoo interprets them as spam so I typically do not get them. Feel free to text me for more pics or questions. I will gladly ship if you cannot meet locally. Thanks for looking and God bless!"

* The Flex 500 Hunting series is a Modular System of shotguns based on the legendary model 500 with the LTS (Tool-Less Locking System). This system consists of three convenient connecting technologies, that come together to bring another level of flexibility to your hunting and sport shooting endeavors. One locking pen is for the stock, one for the forend, and one for the recoil pad. The Hunting series is set up for any of your shotgun's hunting needs but easily allows you to change the stock, forend, or recoil pad for a specific need. All Hunting Series features ported barrel or ported choke, Camo stock and forend, and camo, OD Green, or tan finish on the barrel and receiver. They also have Adjustable Fiber Optic Sights, and the two models with 24"" barrels have LPA (Lightning Pump Action Triggers).
