Then the U.S. Navy needed a rescue knife they came directly to us. The SARK knife was designed specifically for emergency use situations where safety and effectiveness are equally important. This is an official issue rescue knife to the elite U.S. Navy Rescue Teams. It was designed according to their parameters, field tested in actual emergency conditions, and chosen just as you see it here. Built with a safety tip, curved blade, and Dragon’s Teeth™ serrations, it is bulldog strong, razor sharp, and also features the patented “wave shaped feature” for lightening fast opening. This knife is the first hard-use knife ever built for EMT, Paramedic and Rescue use. It is what these professionals needed and they chose Emerson to design and build it. It is an essential tool for anyone who travels off the beaten path."

If you're unsure what exactly that means you'll have to watch a YouTube video on it because it's hard to explain with just words. I picked the gun up new at the beginning of February. It's a great gun but I just got a performance center shield that I carry. This model has the real deal tritium night sights. Some models have the glow paint, which in my opinion aren't true night sights. I also have a +1 pinky extender that I had to order extra and that cost me around 30 bucks. This model with tritium sights on Grabagun is around 650 which is very cheap. In gun  shops they usually charge well over 700. I'm really looking for a fair trade but I'd prob take 550 cash. Guns I'm interested in are...chiappa rhino 200 or 300ds.sig 229,226, 220, arex zero 1. Really I'd be open to any modern guns that aren't true subcompacts. Mainly 9mm but would consider 45 possibly. Not into rifles at the moment or 40 cal. Not too big into revolvers either anyone interested can text me anytime. REDACTED"

We offer two blade types to give you a choice of which profile will suit your needs best. This knife is offered in both stone washed and black, and with plain or partially serrated edges. Find out why everyone is loving the Emerson Sheepdog. The Birth of the Sheepdog “The Emerson Sheepdog is the first Emerson flipper knife which also features the new bearing system. Lt. Colonel David Grossman is an icon in the Military and Tactical world. A former Airborne Ranger and West Point Instructor, he is the world’s leading authority on the effects of stress and combat and how they affect an individual when faced with life and death decisions in that environment. He is the author of two groundbreaking books, “On Killing” and “On Combat” which are now regarded as required reading for anyone who must go into harm’s way. Needless to say, I was both humbled and honored when Colonel Grossman approached me in regard to making an official knife for him and his company, “Sheepdog Knife and Gun.” So off I went and what came of this meeting was the Emerson Sheepdog Knife. A medium size folder with some important features that are entirely new to Emerson Knives. Knowing that this knife is specifically designed for both police and military use, these two blade styles make the most sense for a utility/defensive knife. We are extremely pleased with the results and I know you will be too. “"

Right now it accepts Beretta px4 magazines. It has one magazine. It no longer has the bullet button, but the grip has been wrapped to make it feature less and CA compliant.  It currently doesn't fit in the case because of the grip wrap and I would have to cut the plastic located in the case to make it fit.  I figured I would let the buyer do that if they choose to. This is a hard rifle to find in CA. All sales must be 100% legal and buyer pays transfer fees.

Please click link below to purchase.https://blackwolfsupply.com/index.php/product/emerson-knives-mini-roadhouse-black-plain-blade-mrdhsbt/ The Emerson Mini Roadhouse is the tough little brother of our standard Roadhouse model. Big enough to be badass on its own, it offers discretion in your pocket. With everything that made the classic Roadhouse a favorite- just on a scaled down size. The Mini Roadhouse offers a more pocket friendly profile and portability so you have a reliable knife on your side while at work, or on the go. Featuring a curved belly that concludes with a piercing tanto point. It has our Emerson conventional V-Grind along with our standard razor sharp chisel edge. Available in both stonewashed and black. “Think whiskey, think choppers, think Rock ‘n’ Roll and you’ll know what the Roadhouse is all about, and the moment you pick it up, you’ll know why it lives up to its name. The more that I handle this knife, the more I’m thinking this is one of my best designs. Just like a chopped Harley, this knife is low slung and ready to roar. It feels like you’ve just dropped the clutch and it’s trying to jump out of your hand. And just like a Harley, you’ve got to have a Rock ‘n’ Roll, Outlaw’s soul to carry a Roadhouse. If a chopper could be a knife it would be the Roadhouse. This is a bad to the bone fighter with a rebel’s soul and a Rock ‘n’ Roll attitude that cannot be tamed. Pick it up and you can just about smell the Jack Daniel’s. This knife is destined to be an Emerson classic.”"

I’ve had this rifle since the beginning of 2017 and have only put around 75 rounds of 22lr through it. This rifle will accept 22lr and 22 mag. I still have the original packaging and the rifle still looks like new. The chrome finish is stunning and this would be a great rifle to plink with or put up on your wall. I still have the scope rail as well. I was debating how how much I wanted for this rifle since when I bought it last year I had paid almost $600 for it. Since then I have taken to comparing prices online and $400 seems more than a fair value for this rifle. Sure, it’s a 22 cal, but this rifle is for someone who respects the history and amazing craftsmanship that has gone into it. I personally love this gun. It has dead on accuracy straight out of the box with the iron sights up too 150 yds and the look and feel of it is just something you don’t see today.like I said, I’m looking to get $400 for this rifle or trade it for something with similar value. I’m open to any and all offers, but I am mainly looking for a Mosin Negant or an SKS. I will also accept handgun offers... I live close to Knoxville and can meet with you in a public place to make the transaction and I can take a photo of your drivers license/ carry permit for my records. If you are interested in this rifle then please contact me via email or text me at (865) 333-8301. Please don’t call me first because I might be at work and I don’t want my pants vibrating off."

This rifle also comes with a 6-9"" adjustable Caldwell bipod.It has never been used outside of two precision rifle classes, and has not been used for hunting. This rifle has seen exactly 400 rounds through it, and is in outstanding condition. The only ""blemish"" is a little bit of tap residue on the cheek weld from where the previous owner had a BB taped under some duck tape do he knew exactly where to rest his cheek. The receiver, stock, and barrel are in excellent condition, and the bore and bolt are very shiny and clean. We do not have the original box or paperwork for this rifle. Originally, this did come packaged with a Nikko-Sterling scope, but the previous owner traded that away when he picked it up, as he had a Vortex Viper he used instead.The Howa 1500 Axiom is an excellent rifle for both hunting and precision work. I witnessed it consistently hit at 1100 yards during a precision rifle class, the Knoxx stock just ate up the recoil. The only reason that he is selling it is because he purchased a 6mm Creedmoor Ruger Precision Rifle, and no longer uses this one for matches."

Winchester or Beretta fit this shotgun, which is a nice feature. #6 loads will stop a hassenfeffer dead in his tracks. The 20"" barrel on my Outback swings fast. Great for rabbit or hogs, but I tend to miss birds. I recommend the longer barrel for birds or clays.

With 12 meals per case, at this price, it is only $6.25 a meal for food that you can take anywhere with no refrigeration and still have a hot meal with loads of accessories such as crackers/bread, cheese/jelly spread, coffee, sugar, creamer, gum, Tabasco sauce, matches, and even toilet paper! These come with a water-activated heater for the entree, and detailed directions on how to use it (basically, just pour water into the bag and wait a few minutes). I also have spare heaters that I can provide so that you can heat up accessories as well. The dates on the boxes are the Inspection Date, not the expiration date.Here is a guide to the date codes on the cases:  The first line is the date it was manufactured. The number before the dash is a combination of the last digit of the year of manufacture and the Julian date of that year.  The number after the dash is the lot number of that date that the case belongs to.  So for the case in the picture, it was manufactured in 2015 on June 4th, and was part of the first lot produced that day.  The second line is the Inspect/Test date.  The number before the dash is the last two digits of the year, and the number after the dash is the month after which it is supposed to be tested/inspected before being consumed.  For the case in the picture, the inspect/test date is June of 2018 (three years after manufacture).  You can check this for yourself here: http://www.mreinfo.com/mres/mre-date-converter/As you can see in the pictures, these cases haven't even reached their first inspection date yet!THESE ARE LEGAL TO OWN, so please don't be an internet lawyer and try to enforce a law that doesn't exist."

I'd be willing to sell individual parts (uppers/scopes/lowers)  Please feel free to ask any questions and thanks for your interest...have a great day.Gun 1(top)
