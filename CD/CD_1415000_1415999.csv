A nice Dan Wesson snub with adjustable sights. This is a Monson-made gun with an earlier 5-digit serial number. It wears Pachmayr grips. The 2.5"" barrel shroud shows some evidence of pitting that someone (not me!) attempted to remove by brushing. The surface is smooth but some of the blueing was removed. It still looks very nice. No box or tools, just a nice pistol that shoots 38's or 357's.

This thing is awesome. It is powered by solar panel or a single aa battery. The dot is brightness adjustable and is 1.75 moa so it doesn't cover up the whole target at longer distances. It is built tough and meant to last. Only installed never fired with. The box is packed away in my pod right now I can ship it when I unload it if it sells before Thursday , 18

SRS01: Sealed Reflex Sight 1.75 MOA Red Dot with Colt-Style Flattop Mount. The Trijicon SRS (Sealed Reflex Sight) represents the highest level of performance from a sealed reflex-style sight. Because of its innovative design, the SRS takes up less rail space while maintaining the durability expected from Trijicon. The shorter housing eliminates the tube-effect typical of other sealed reflex sights. Featuring a large 28mm aperture, the Trijicon SRS provides a massive field of view for quicker target engagements. The 1.75 MOA dot is small enough for precision and with 10 brightness settings it can be bright enough for any speed. Finally, the Trijicon SRS features dual power sources — an innovative solar cell assisted by a single AA battery.

This is excellent quality for Russian steel-cased ammo.  I have never had a single failure to feed or extract or any kind of a jam with this ammo.  I have been shooting this ammo for years in both AK type and SKS rifles.  The hollow points make a big difference in making sure that the rounds expend their energy in the target, rather than just passing through.  They are excellent for both hunting and defense.

It did come with a wood stock, but swapped it for the synthetic hogue on my other rifle. Also upgraded the barely usable factory sights, still have the originals. Rear sight screws down where rear of scope rail would have. I have a cut down rail on the front mounting point, had a red dot on it. Still have the small screws for the holes. It comes with 5 25 rd hot lips mags. Very little use, bought for my older rifle but the tight match chamber didn't like being fed that fast.

I have talked to many ex-military personnel that carried them as late as the 1980s, as you can see these pistols played a significant part of our history. To this day the Victory model is a very enjoyable shooting collectible, mainly due to its inexpensive cost, light recoil, and good accuracy. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Victory model was so named for the ""V"" prefix which was placed before the serial number and represented ""Victory"" against the Axis powers in World War II. 

Serial numbers for the .38 special Victory model began at about V1 in early 1942 and ran until VS811119 with a date of late August of 1945 (end of production). V1 to approximately V39,999 were predominately .38 S&W Caliber (I have observed revolvers in the 1-40000 range in .38 special caliber).  Serial numbers are located on Inside right grip, frame butt, Cylinder, extractor star, and bottom of barrel. Crane and crane recess are also serial numbered to each other, but this is a different number then the revolvers serial number as is correct for Victory model revolvers. 

The Victory Revolver was produced during World War II, it is a variation of the Military & Police Model of 1905, fourth change and had the following characteristics between 1942 and 1945:

Barrel: 2, 4, 5, or 6 inch. (4 inch common in .38 special, 5 inch common in 38/200 or .38 S&W)
Sights: Fixed
Finish: Early sandblast blue, sandblast mid-night black (appears grayish black). And finally a parkerized finish. Hammer and Trigger are case hardened.
Grips: Checkered walnut with medallion until early 1942, post February of 1942 they are smooth American Walnut with out medallions.

These are the best alternative sights if you dont want to drop $500+ on a gucci real steel grade sight. 

They will fit on any standard 20mm/Picatinny/Weaver Rail. Body of the sight is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Comes with, padded box cleaning pad, double sided rubber dust covers, quick attach locking level or quick thumb screw, and 2x AA batteries. 

Reticle has 2 colors, red and green, 10 levels of brightness and is easily bright enough for the sunniest of days. 

Dont settle for the lower quality cheapo Chinese sights, they have terrible ghosting (shown in green) 

These have the clearest reticle on the market when it comes to replica sights. 
Please note that this is not a Eotech or a true holographic sight, but a red dot sight with reflex style internals.

These were designed and built to withstand recoil of real guns (.223/5.56 in mind), but will work on all airsoft guns with 20mm rails.

I have sold over 250 of these sights without any unit failures. 
Comes with 30 day warranty from manufacturer defects

FAQ:

Q: How long do the batteries last?
A: The included AA batteries should last at least ~120 hours

Q: Will this fit on my .......
A: Does it have standard 20mm rails? If so then yes.

Q: Is it full metal?
A: Yes. The body is full metal with the exception of the battery cap.

Q: Can it REALLY take recoil?
A: 2500 rounds and counting on an AK. If that doesn't answer the question, what will?

Q: What if it breaks? 
A: 30 day warranty covers all problems including external defects and electronic failures. 
It does not cover obvious abuse (IE throwing it, baking it in the oven, microwaving, using as campfire fuel or a driveway speedbump)
If your sight does fail, send me a message.

Yes that's right, a Smith & Wesson shotgun! You don't see many of these critters anymore! I purchased from a member awhile back and now find myself in need of car repairs, so on to the next home. I wrote S&W regarding this Military & Police 12 gauge and all they could tell me was that they were made for a few years in the early 1980's and the parkerized version was the rarest of them all. This beauty was made to compete with the Remington 870 and/or the Winchester 1200/1300 series of shotguns. Comes with Factory S&W synthetic furniture. Metal/parkerizing is in  great shape other than a couple storage scratches. Selling this as a rare collectors piece more than anything as reflected in the price. Whether a true blue S&W fan or not, the quality and shootibility of this shotgun wll make it a fine addition to any collection or the start of one!

From the Manufacturer:
The M951 KIT02 is the M951XM07 Millennium Universal Weapon Light plus an FM63 infrared filter. The M951XM07 Millennium Universal Weapon Light is a 6-volt (two-battery) Weapon Light that attaches by means of an integral dual thumbscrew clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail.

The cylinder is filled to 3000 psi by means of either a hand pump or a SCUBA tank.  I think the velocity is over 900 fps, but can be adjusted to your preference.  This one is in .22, and they're also available in .177 and .25.

This one, although used, is in excellent shape.  I took it on a trade from a chainsaw customer, but only to get the cash that was owed me out of it.  I've shot it enough to know it's very accurate.  These have more than enough power for squirrel hunting and I've heard enough people claim that they killed a groundhog with one that I can't just call them all liars.  Definitely not the type of air rifle I had as a kid...  

You'll get the rifle itself, which has a Leapers 4-16 x 50mm air rifle scope with red/green illuminated mil-dot reticle and adjustable objective mounted on it.  You'll also get the 10-round rotary magazine and the single-shot adapter, as well as some Benjamin literature and a SCUBA tank adapter.  I also have an Air Force brand 3000 psi hand pump to go with it, and a couple partial tins of .22 pellets.  In short, everything you need to start shooting it is here.

I had to look up pricing before I accepted this as a trade, so here's what this equipment goes for new:

Rifle - About $475
Scope - About $120
Pump - Right at $200
Scope Rings and Pellets - Just along for the ride as part of the deal.

This stuff adds up to around $800 new.  I allowed $600 trade value for it, and I can tell you that with the exception of a couple marks on the scope, it's all in excellent shape.  I've shot it enough that I can show you how it works.  Get into a complete PCP air rifle setup for hundreds less than if you bought new.

This setup is for sale locally only.  I've been contacted by many people asking about shipping it, but honestly it isn't worth the hassle to me.  I don't need the money this minute and am willing to wait for a local sale.  (If you'd like, you're welcome to have a friend of yours that lives near here buy it for you, and they can then ship it to you.)"

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will.... The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .357SIG, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

The Norma brass is a mix between never fired, once and twice fired, all marked. The Federal brass is once fired in a different rifle. The Caldwell measures about 26"" when fully extended for sitting shots. I will also send the load data that I came up with. The Lee Deluxe die set has two bullet seating stems. One for your common bullet and one for the long VLD bullets. The rifle came with a 5-shot under 1"" at 100 yards guarantee from Sako. It obviously does this. I included a target that was shot at 100 yards. The scope was professionally installed with lapped rings. Everything was purchased a couple of months ago brand new. Total rounds through the rifle are less than 50. I did some load development and sighted it in and hunted with it just a couple of times. I have too many rifles. Just trying to clean my cabinet out and finance a custom build long range rig. I have the box and all paper work for the rifle and scope. This rifle will shoot groups the size of a dime with 50 grain Sierra Blitzkings #1450 and .50"" or better with 60 grain Nosler Partition bullets #16316. The barrel has a twist rate of 1:14"" and stabilizes the 60 grain Nosler Partition very well. You can shoot anything up to whitetail with this. The Partition bullet is a very good penetrating bullet. The whole rifle weighs around only 7 pounds with scope, very lightweight. Flat rate shipping of $40 for everything."
