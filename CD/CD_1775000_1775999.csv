Explanation from the Mega Staff, As To Why They Are Ideal For Longer Barrel Applications And Why They Lack A Forward Assist Hole:

""We made the SBU and co-branded through Alexander Arms for sole reason of bench shooting and long range purposes.  For this reason we undersized the front bore by .001” under mill spec to work as a nonslip fit which needs to be heated for installation.  This creates a very tight fit and more accurate weapon.  The no forward assist or deflector was to make it slick sided which if you gas the system correctly, you don’t need them."" 

NO FORM WORK NEEDED FOR UPPER RECEIVERS. THOUGH WA STATE RESIDENTS MUST STILL PAY WA SALES TAX ON PURCHASE PRICE. APPOINTMENT MUST BE MADE FOR ALL LOCAL PICK UP.

OUT OF STATE BUYERS MUST STILL BE AWARE AS TO WHAT IS LEGAL IN THEIR AREA REGARDING WEAPONS AND WEAPON PARTS. OUT OF STATE BUYERS WILL PAY $7 for SHIPPING COSTS TO YOUR DOOR."

This is probably the most accurate pistol I own.  Chambered in 45 acp this is a much sought after firearm.  When I got it, it was all stock, but I bought it to shoot it.  So I took it to my gunsmith and asked for top of the line 1911 internals.  So with that, my gunsmith put in all Wilson Combat extras.  The Wilson Combat parts on this gun are an adjustable ghost trigger, ghost hammer, 1 piece guide rod and safety.  This gun is amazing in all areas except 1 that I do not like.  Someone tried to paint the sights and did a horrible job of it.  (You can take some fingernail polish remover and remove the paint though, it didn't bother me THAT much).  It comes with 1 magazine but will take most standard 1911 government model magazines.  I'm asking 990 ... and no, I'm not in need of money or have just lost my job and I need to sell the gun today the rent, so lowball offers will be ignored.  I work many hours a week and I work 2nd shift, so I don't have a lot of time to run all over Ohio... I ask that you please, make arrangements to meet within about 30 minutes of my area."

138,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1775138,For Sale:  TAURUS PRO TITANIUM .380 ACP ULTRA LITE REVOLVER!!!,"McKinney area, Dallas, Texas",$ 400,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 18, 2013",Handguns,Taurus                                                                                ,no type,Double Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"This is a Taurus Pro Titanium M.380 ACP Ultra Lite revolver (5-shot). Again, it shoots .380 ACP and NOT 38 SPECIALS. This is a very rare revolver, as I am unaware of any other revolver on the market today that shoots the .380 caliber. It's an incredible handgun and shoots flawlessly. It is also extremely light, very thin/streamlined, and the perfect gun for anyone wanting to wear a revolver and keep it concealed easily.  I actually bought this gun new for my wife back in February but she wants to sell it to buy a subcompact semi auto.  I took the gun to the range for the first time last weekend and only put 10 rounds through it.  I loved the gun so much I want it for myself but as I already have 3 other handguns I carry, rifles, a tactical shotgun, etc. she wants me to sell it.  The ONLY reason she wants to sell it is because after I shot that 10th round through the gun, a cease fire was called at the range.  A range officer came by and I asked him about CHL classes at their location and he noticed the revolver.  He reminded me that if you qualify for your CHL license with a revolver, then you are only licensed to carry a revolver.  You have to qualify with a semi-auto to be able to carry any handgun.  Once I told my wife, she decided she wanted a semi-auto of her own.  

I just HATE selling this gun as it is so rare and I believe will only go up in value.  In addition, I just love the size (easily concealable), the weight (Ultralight Titanium), the accuracy (even though the barrel is only 1.75"") and the recoil is not nearly as bad as I expected since the gun weighs so little.  I have the original box and all original paperwork and manuals that came with the gun new.  Again, it's only had 10 shots fired since I bought it new and I cleaned it thoroughly before and after my trip to the range. So basically you are getting a NEW gun.

The price is $399.99 for the handgun itself, all original manuals/paperwork, the original box, the special key that activates/deactivates the ""Taurus Security System"" (see below for additional details on this system). and FIVE brand new auto loaders that work fantastic with this gun!!!  The first person to contact me and pay the $399.99 will get all of the above.  See note below regarding shipping of this firearm.

This revolver has numerous, fantastic features that I have not seen in other revolvers or at least they don't seem to work as well in other revolvers.  A few of these features are:

1) Adjustable hammer tension - this is great for those who are not used to the trigger pull on a double action firearm.  It also allows the gun owner to adjust this to his/her preference.
2) Adjustable Trigger Stop - the trigger stop can be adjusted in or out to the owner's preference.
3) Adjustable Front and rear sights - sights can be adjusted ""permanently"" to sight the gun in or adjusted for windage or both.  A very easy turn of the screw with a small screw drivers is all that is required.
4) The ""Taurus Security System"" - this handgun is equipped with the exclusive Taurus Security System.  The system is designed to preclude the use of the revolver when the mechanism is engaged.  It consists of an integral mechanism located on the back of the hammer.  When properly engaged by the use of the included key, it prevents the firing of the revolver completely.  The engagement of the mechanism can only be done utilizing the special (and included) key that fits the activation pin.  Engaging and disengaging this system is extremely easy and simply requires the insertion of the key into the activation pin and a turn clockwise to engage it (Secure) and a counterclockwise turn to disengage it (Ready to Fire).  This is a fantastic security feature and replaces the need for a trigger guard for safety.  However, I do have a trigger guard for this handgun and will also include it with the sale, if requested.
5) The Taurus Titanium revolvers are designed to withstand the regular use of +P jacketed ammunition.

NOTE ON DELIVERY OF THIS HANDGUN:

Local buyers - all buyers within 30 miles of my home, I will gladly agree to meet halfway.  Local buyers that live over 30 miles away are welcome to drive to a mutually agreed upon place (no further than 15 miles from my home) and we can handle the sale there.  In addition, I can ship to buyers in Texas not wanting to make the drive.

NON-LOCAL buyers - I have a very reliable FFL licensed location from which I can ship your handgun.  

SHIPPING/HANDLING CHARGES - the person I use to ship all handguns only charges $10 plus actual shipping expenses.  Most FFL dealers charge between $20-30 for this service.  All handguns are shipping on Tuesday - Thursdays only and the buyer is responsible for all shipping and handling charges.  I will do my best to ensure that the shipping, handling (and insurance charges) are minimized for you.  In addition, postal insurance on the package for the full value of the firearm is required.

This will be hard to find on searches because they made so few of them in the mid 80's. It was the shotgun used in between the Wingmaster and the 870 which makes it pretty unique in that its essentially an 870 body with the Wingmasters internals. The gun has some scratches on the stock and slight blueing wear between the pump arm and the receiver and I can send more photos upon request.  This would make one heck of a skeet or bird gun I just don't have the use for it I thought I would.

This gun is for trade only, that doesn't mean trade for cash because thats called selling.  So don't waste anyone's time asking how much cash I want for it because I don't want cash.

Springfield Armory XDS9339B XD(S) 3.3"" Slim 9mm 3.3"" 7+1 Syn Grips Black Finish

Introducing the XD-S. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers
all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand.
At only 1""  wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry
strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. Prepare to be impressed with
the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy
reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic
front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on
your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator, two mags, double mag
pouch, holster all in a hard case. In addition, the XD-S offers a
top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and
usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S,
the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol.
Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be
inserted into the pistol.

This T3 was built by one smith, Jeff Phillips. If you don't know who he is, he was one of the owners of Nighthawk that left Wilson Combat. He was an amazing gunsmith, I say was because he sold his portion of Nighthawk and is now doing Missionary work. Google his name a read about all the people who love his builds. The fit and finish of his guns are comparable to a Wilson Supergrade, said by a guy who owns both and was looking at them side by side. Supergrades go for $6,000 plus and some have hit $9,000. This gun has exactly 200rds through it and it functioned flawlessly with both ball and hollow points. They say to put 500 rds through it for complete break in, so 300 more to go. 

SORRY NO TRADES!!! Will ship FFL to FFL for $40 or FTF with CCW and signed bill of sale. 

It's my opinion that any 1911 built by Jeff Phillips will appreciate in value as time goes on. He's considered to be one of the best smiths that Wilson Combat and Nighthawk has ever had."

 The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube).

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

 The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

  The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

 Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

 The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
 The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

Bolts are made of 4`140 chrome-moly steel, hardened to 42-44 Rc. The use of dissimilar steels for the bolt and receiver minimizes or eliminates the possibility of galling. Receiver and bolt squareness, receiver straightness, receiver bore uniformity and more are held to tolerances of 0.0003” or less.

From the Sig site:

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy."

3. Firearms Instructor's Manual: Simplified Course Outlines [Plastic Comb], ISBN-10: REDACTED. $25 shipped 

From Amazon, ""This manual has been written with the Law Enforcement Firearms Instructor in mind. It is an attempt to save the instructor time by furnishing already prepared outlines that cover most of the subject currently taught by and to law enforcement personnel. The purpose of the manual is twofold: First, it can be used by current firearms instructors as a handy reference guide and also as a way of keeping all of the firearms outlines in one simple format. By preparing the manual in this fashion, all of an instructor¹s outlines are easily accessible should an instructor¹s class be challenged by the legal system. Secondly, this manual can be used as the text for firearms instructor initial certification classes. Once the new instructor completes the basic certification course, he or she will have a complete set of outlines that can be used for teaching their classes. The first four outlines in this manual (The Role of the Firearms Instructor, Safety Responsibilities, Record Keeping, and Discipline) are generally used during instructor development classes. The rest of the outlines, while also used in instructor development classes, are also appropriate for basic recruit classes as well as classes that are designed for in-service personnel. The Appendix contains material that can be used as class handouts or made into overheads for class presentations. Some of the courses can be used for general firearms qualification, while others are used for training a specific skill, such as linear and lateral movement or multiple attackers. The manual has been written to take the pain out of the ³office work² part of being a firearms instructor and to give the instructor more time to teach.""

The class lasts about 7 hours total, includes a written and range test, basic handgun safety, handgun cleaning, handgun knowledge, handgun marksmanship, and qualifies you to apply for a CCDW license in KY. Students should bring a modern functioning handgun with 50 rounds of factory new ammunition and appropriate cleaning supplies for the firearm. Don’t have a handgun, ammo, or supplies? No worries! Get in touch with me and we can work out the details. There is also a $60 fee divided between the state and local police that is normally paid 2-3 weeks after the completion of the course. A criminal background check will be done by the Kentucky State Police after the completion of the course. Due to high volume, it is currently taking up to 5 months after the class for the actual license to be issued by the Kentucky State Police. Feel free to contact me, and thanks for your consideration!"
