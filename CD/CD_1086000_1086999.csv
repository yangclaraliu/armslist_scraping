With two screws you can change both barrel length and caliber. The Monolithic Rail Platform (MRP) rifle is different from all other AR-15s in that it removes 13 moving parts from the upper receiver greatly increasing reliability. The upper is cut from one solid piece of metal to provide one of the strongest platforms to be had. This rifle is NEW in box and is 100% assembled from the factory.

South African manufactured 308 Winchester ammo. 

The description is in the pictures taken directly from the packages. This ammo was made in 1981. See the pictures and read all information included in the pictures. If you have any questions please ask. This ammo is non-magnetic, brass cased. I will not ship this ammo, this is a face to face transaction only, in the Jacksonville, NC area. There is one full, sealed battle pack remaining, containing 140 rounds, which is 7 boxes of 20, see the pics to view a box, 140 rounds, and one opened battle pack, containing 96 rounds, for a total of 236 rounds . I will not break open the sealed battle pack.
 These rounds have been stored in a temp. controlled environment since the day I bought them. I have fired some of these rounds in my firearms with no problems at all. I have also sold some of these rounds previously, and have had no complaints from the buyers that fired them from their firearms.

I am pricing these rounds at a dollar a round. Feel free to make me an offer of cash, (I prefer cash) or trade, worst I can say is no. This isn't my first rodeo with ammo in the current market climate, so don't try to make an offer that is ridiculously low, or a trade that isn't worth it, just go look for ammo elsewhere. Sorry for being rude, but I needed to put that out there, I don't have time for shenanigans.

Recently painted with a Duplicolor standard color so matching in the future will be easy.

You won't find a more reliable machine in this price range. This bike is perfect for a beginner or a seasoned rider. 

What I have is a Suzuki SV 650, S model. 25k miles (runs, sounds, and rides like new) This bike has upgraded front suspension, a Penske rear shock, Scotts steering dampener, K&N air filter (freshly charged), hard wired headlights (better than cheap HID and retain stock controls), braided front brake lines, mirrors with blinkers, KG cycles fairings, frame sliders, new pro grips, full (cut) Akrapovic exhaust, upgraded RR from newer bike, swingarm spools, 12v accessory outlet.. and a bunch of stuff I'm leaving out (Im sure) I have some spare parts that I will throw in. I have stock mirrors, stock shock, blinkers, chain guard, etc.

This bike runs excellent, easily starts and warms up, then idles nicely. NO CARB ISSUES! Always stored with Stabil and started in the Spring with sea-foam.

I'm running Dunlop Q2s and the front is brand new (has only been scrubbed in, 40 miles).. The rear is 70%. If you see this ad, I still have it. I have also recovered the seats with a marine grade (grey material).. same color as the pictures, just brand new.

Will consider partial firearm trades, but we prefer cash. No test rides without a M endorsement and cash in my hand. Thanks for understanding.

REDACTED Call, text, email... All comes direct. I have a clean TN title in my name, ready for transfer.

The mirrors aren't installed in these pictures, but I do have the stock set and a set with blinkers that will be installed before pickup."

INFO: The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is not only the best example of the semiautomatic sidearm concept, but it is also a perfect manifestation of advanced technology and aesthetics. The Px4 Storm lines have been conceived to compliment the power, ease of handling, performance and reliability of the pistol matched with an original and sought-after design. Manufactured in many calibers, the new Px4 Storm adopts the locked-breech locking system with a rotating barrel, which has been revised and considerably improved by Beretta.The overall dimensions are significantly reduced, considering its major firepower.
The light yet resistant pistol frame has been created applying the most modern thermoplastic technology, using reinforced fiberglass technopolymer.
Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts place the Px4 Storm among the leading pistols for personal defense as well as law-enforcement use."

For some reason they are marked 5.56 (.223 Rem) on the box, but they are .223 Rem cartridges (product code matches other American Eagle .223 Rem, and cartridges themselves are headstamped .223 Rem). Product code is AE223.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $3-$5 per box).

These will work in any .223 Remington or 5.56 firearm.

I currently have 19 boxes left (380 rounds total). Price is $16/box FIRM. 15 boxes are the tan box shown in the first 2 pics, 4 boxes are the red box shown in the last pic. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush. Price is pretty reasonable considering others are asking $1/round + for similar ammo.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't delay. I was just looking at .223 bullets for reloading the other day, and some of them are already backordered to NOVEMBER!

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN SCAR MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Made in U.S.A.

Picture with my iPhone shows size (phone not included). Dark photo shows front sight against early morning light looking out window.  It is set up to match my carry pistol, so it has an improved trigger (part installed by glock armorer, I have original part if you want to go back to the factory trigger pull) and a front tritium night sight (I find that works best for me in low light, not worrying about rear dots glowing).  I test fired it with a variety of ammo, and it ran perfectly.  Also very comfortable to shoot.  After setting it up and testing it, it just went in the safe, so I figure I should get rid of it.

Dear Congressperson,

I am sending this email, as part of a Colorado Congress-wide email, to encourage you to ardently oppose any legislation that would infringe on the inalienable rights of the citizens that you are supposed to be representing. Everyone in the United States has these rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution as well as the Constitutions of each state. However, these documents do not give us, the People, these rights; they merely protect these rights (and others that are not enumerated in the documents) from government infringement. These protections are extended to all rights of all people, but they are not subject to regulation (read infringement) due to the fear or other emotional impact they may have on other citizens.

Article II Section 13 of the Colorado Constitution is VERY clear when it states “[t]hat the right of no person to keep and bear arms in defense of his home, person and property, or in aid of the civil power when thereto legally summoned, shall be called into question; but nothing herein shall be construed to justify the practice of carrying concealed weapons.” This, in and of itself, shows that there are no restrictions stating that each person who keeps and bears arms can only have weaker, less effective weaponry than their adversaries.

By limiting magazine capacity, we will only see more law abiding citizens put into harms way. Criminals, by definition, commit crimes and have no regard for laws. In truth, this is a simple fact that is ignored by those who wish to use propaganda, fear tactics, skewed statistics and any other questionable means to further their agenda. Only law abiding citizens abide by the law. They respect the system and revere laws as necessary restrictions on society in order to maintain peace, civility and ensure the rights of all people. Murder, as an example, is a crime. As is carrying a loaded weapon onto K-12 property. And yet, neither of those laws stopped Adam Lanza (Sandy Hook Elementary - Newtown, Connecticut - 2012), Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris (Columbine High School - Columbine, Colorado - 1999), or Kip Kinkel (Thurston High School - Springfield, Oregon - 1998) from committing these atrocities. It should also be noted that the Columbine shooting and the Thurston shooting took place during the national Assault Weapons Ban which restricted firearms and magazines. Furthermore, Seung-Hui Cho used a ten round and other reduced capacity magazine with his weapons of choice for the Virginia Tech shooting.

Instead of solutions that would limit law abiding citizens ability to protect themselves, real answers to the issues we've seen recently will likely come in the form of making it easier for people to protect themselves. If restrictions are placed on people's ability to protect themselves, through arbitrary magazine restrictions, concealed carry bans, increased ""fees"" for obtaining weapons and even just the inconvenience of forcing transfers to take place through a licensed dealer to ensure a background check is run, there will almost certainly be more violence as a result. Chicago, Washington DC, New York City, Los Angeles, all have bans or other draconian restrictions on firearms and they all enjoy a much higher crime rate PER CAPITA than we do, here in Colorado or any city within our state.

Common sense would dictate that the goal of these regulations is to stop violent crime in some way. Save lives. Reduce injuries to innocent people. However, no data exists to back up that what is being proposed will actually do anything it is supposed to. In fact, the United Kingdom has seen a spike in violent crime since they eliminated their citizens ability to protect themselves (in their home or elsewhere). If the actual goal of this legislation is to STOP or REDUCE violent crime, then the only logical, ethical and sane action to take would be to allow more freedom in protecting ourselves.

Some real options would be to ENFORCE current laws, make concealed carry more accessible, increase education about firearms, and ensure compliance with NICS. Already, the current, flawed and inefficient system has stopped MILLIONS of people who should not be in possession of firearms from purchasing them. Another way to reduce gun violence would be to instate hefty minimum sentences for crimes in which a gun was used. Instead of a sentence being three (3) to five (5) years when committed, why not triple the sentence if it is committed with a gun?

I will continue to write, every day, until this legislation is seen for the unconstitutional drivel that it is and forced out of congress. This is the first Congress-wide email I am sending and therefore will be the longest. Nevertheless, all future letters will reiterate the facts stated here to some degree. I thank you for your time and hope that you will make the right decision (opposition) when voting on bills that would further restrict the rights of Coloradans and endanger lives.

Again, thank you for your time and attention, I trust you will oppose these bills and ensure the freedom and safety of all current and future Coloradans.

Sincerely,
Zachary M. Lujan."

$1,500 for rifle only. This is the nicest FN-FAL you’ll ever see, nearly $2k into the gun:

1.	New receiver, Type 2. DCI. Conventional metric cover. 
2.	It has the 7 compliance parts, all new. This is a legal gun. 
3.	It has refinished wood. German rear with ferrule, L1A1 front. Wood fore ends don't heat up with shooting. 
4.	Tactical carry sling. 
5.	Folding L1A1 rear sight. 
6.	Bolt carrier is an L1A1 with slotted sand cuts. It is bright chromed, but that doesn't show in the photo. 
7.	L1A1 extended safety. 
8.	STG-58 vertical receiver latch that doesn't bugger up your shooing hand. 
9.	Barrel cut to 18"". Pinned (not welded) muzzle brake. 
10.	STG gas plug. 
11.	New pistol grip, HK-91 style. 
12.	New carry handle from DSA. 
13.	Folding charging handle. 
14.	Extended L1A1 magazine release.
15.	Freshly phosphated. 
16.	Professionally built and headspaced. I didn't fix this gun up, Century Gun Works did, and there are discrete confirmatory marks on the receiver for that at the bottom of the receiver bridge.

Some FN-FAL features look cool, such as the R1A1 horizontal latch, but actually are pretty non-functional. The pistol grip is the best angle, the mag release is awesome, etc. If you're looking for a working gun, rather than a Belgian safe queen, I think this is the nicest FAL ever put together.

I have some repair parts that I wouldn't need anymore, and will throw those in free. 

I also have magazines and some ammunition that I can sell.

$1,500 for the gun, firm. Includes sling, some repair parts I don't need, two brand new STG-58 magazines.

Also available, $15 per magazine if you buy them all; mixture of brand new and worn finish, all fully functional. I believe I have 9. 

Ammunition (face to face) is .55/round. NATO milsurp, Brass, berdan primed, in 200 round battle packs."

To Whom It May Concern,
There is no doubt that the people in your company have heard, and likely had, debates about the gun control proposals that are circulating throughout the United States. Coming from Colorado, this is particularly important and hits very close to home for me as there have been several reasons why this legislation is being looked at in my state alone. Nevertheless, I am emailing you today, not to discuss gun control and asinine legislation, but to ask for your support.
While many people are going through a knee-jerk reaction to the tragedies that our country has faced recently, this legislation is playing on the fear and anger of citizens. Almost immediately after the Sandy Hook massacre, many politicians and public figures came out of the woodwork to speak against the private ownership, sale and carry of firearms. This proves that American politicians and popular figures in the media are more concerned with furthering agendas than they are with actually supporting citizens, moms, dads, children. So, for not reacting in a knee-jerk fashion (as Dick’s, Cheaper Than Dirt, and others have), I would like to thank you.
Next, we, as consumers and American citizens need the support of manufacturers such as yours. While we can call and write and bug and annoy all of our representatives and senators, the fact remains that we are easy to shrug off. Already, sheriffs all across the Nation have started to take a stand against tyrannical government, draconian laws and unfounded proposals that would, in any way, further restrict the rights of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms in defense of themselves, their loved ones, property and the general public against all evils. This has proven to myself and many others that, not only the general public, but many involved in the government at some level, are at the end of the rope in regards to allowing our government to infringe on our rights.
I would like you to stand with your customers and with sheriffs. Please refuse to send arms that would be illegal for everyone else to own to government agencies. If citizens aren’t allowed to own them and are restricted to arbitrary magazine capacities, why shouldn’t the offending agencies be so restricted? How can, in good conscience, any company support a tyrannical government?

Thank you for your continued customer service, your stance for freedom and your future opposition to tyranny.

Sincerely,
Zachary M. Lujan.

Dear Senators and Representatives,

I am sending this email, as part of a Colorado Congress-wide email, to encourage you to ardently oppose any legislation that would infringe on the inalienable rights of the citizens that you are supposed to be representing. Everyone in the United States has these rights guaranteed by the United States Constitution as well as the Constitutions of each state. However, these documents do not give us, the People, these rights; they merely protect these rights (and others that are not enumerated in the documents) from government infringement. These protections are extended to all rights of all people, but they are not subject to regulation (read infringement) due to the fear or other emotional impact they may have on other citizens.

Article II Section 13 of the Colorado Constitution is VERY clear when it states “[t]hat the right of no person to keep and bear arms in defense of his home, person and property, or in aid of the civil power when thereto legally summoned, shall be called into question; but nothing herein shall be construed to justify the practice of carrying concealed weapons.” This, in and of itself, shows that there are no restrictions stating that each person who keeps and bears arms can only have weaker, less effective weaponry than their adversaries.

By limiting magazine capacity, we will only see more law abiding citizens put into harms way. Criminals, by definition, commit crimes and have no regard for laws. In truth, this is a simple fact that is ignored by those who wish to use propaganda, fear tactics, skewed statistics and any other questionable means to further their agenda. Only law abiding citizens abide by the law. They respect the system and revere laws as necessary restrictions on society in order to maintain peace, civility and ensure the rights of all people. Murder, as an example, is a crime. As is carrying a loaded weapon onto K-12 property. And yet, neither of those laws stopped Adam Lanza (Sandy Hook Elementary - Newtown, Connecticut - 2012), Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris (Columbine High School - Columbine, Colorado - 1999), or Kip Kinkel (Thurston High School - Springfield, Oregon - 1998) from committing these atrocities. It should also be noted that the Columbine shooting and the Thurston shooting took place during the national Assault Weapons Ban which restricted firearms and magazines. Furthermore, Seung-Hui Cho used a ten round and other reduced capacity magazine with his weapons of choice for the Virginia Tech shooting.

Instead of solutions that would limit law abiding citizens ability to protect themselves, real answers to the issues we've seen recently will likely come in the form of making it easier for people to protect themselves. If restrictions are placed on people's ability to protect themselves, through arbitrary magazine restrictions, concealed carry bans, increased ""fees"" for obtaining weapons and even just the inconvenience of forcing transfers to take place through a licensed dealer to ensure a background check is run, there will almost certainly be more violence as a result. Chicago, Washington DC, New York City, Los Angeles, all have bans or other draconian restrictions on firearms and they all enjoy a much higher crime rate PER CAPITA than we do, here in Colorado or any city within our state.

Common sense would dictate that the goal of these regulations is to stop violent crime in some way. Save lives. Reduce injuries to innocent people. However, no data exists to back up that what is being proposed will actually do anything it is supposed to. In fact, the United Kingdom has seen a spike in violent crime since they eliminated their citizens ability to protect themselves (in their home or elsewhere). If the actual goal of this legislation is to STOP or REDUCE violent crime, then the only logical, ethical and sane action to take would be to allow more freedom in protecting ourselves.

Some real options would be to ENFORCE current laws, make concealed carry more accessible, increase education about firearms, and ensure compliance with NICS. Already, the current, flawed and inefficient system has stopped MILLIONS of people who should not be in possession of firearms from purchasing them. Another way to reduce gun violence would be to instate hefty minimum sentences for crimes in which a gun was used. Instead of a sentence being three (3) to five (5) years when committed, why not triple the sentence if it is committed with a gun?

I will continue to write, every day, until this legislation is seen for the unconstitutional drivel that it is and forced out of congress. This is the first Congress-wide email I am sending and therefore will be the longest. Nevertheless, all future letters will reiterate the facts stated here to some degree. I thank you for your time and hope that you will make the right decision (opposition) when voting on bills that would further restrict the rights of Coloradans and endanger lives.

Again, thank you for your time and attention, I trust you will oppose these bills and ensure the freedom and safety of all current and future Coloradans.

Sincerely,"

I have an antique production Winchester Model 1873 Saddle Ring Carbine, manufactured in 1892. Chambered in .44-40, 20” barrel, checkered oval finger grip dust cover, lever lock & of course a saddle ring. The rear is an adjustable flip up carbine sight with markings. It has not been “over cleaned” or tampered with & has that great vintage gun look. The stocks are walnut & are solid with no cracks or repairs. The condition is incredible especially considering the age. They are easy on the handling marks & fit the metal tight, a factory fit. The butt plate is the steel curved carbine style. Mechanically sound with a smooth tight crisp action, holds cock & half cock, loads, cycles, fires & ejects just fine with no issues. The bore has strong pronounced rifling with no rust or pitting issues, very nice. It appears to be correct & original. The Model 1873 is “the gun that won the west”; here is your chance to own a nice usable early Winchester and a piece of American history. I am asking $3999.99 obo, anyone that knows Winchester, knows these are hard to come by. I might be interested in a partial gun/weapon trade but mostly looking for cash. Let me know what you have. Thanks for looking & please see let me know if you are looking for something rare or not so rare. I may just have it here. 

Please no calls before 8AM or after 11PM on weekends unless you have cash in hand. On weekdays no calls before 8AM or after 10PM. You can text me if you need too. If I do not get back to you it is because I am busy but I will return your call or text very soon."

A LEGENDARY FIREARMS

The most tested and trusted personal defense weapon in history.
The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrote them.

The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. 


. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may easily ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. Sure, Firm Grip: The front and back of the grip are grooved on the 92FS and M9, while the M9A1 and 90-Two feature checkering. The grip frame is flared slightly at the base to enhance pointability and control. 
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm. This INOX is presented with 2 - 15rd mags. Additional factory mags available as in stocd,

• The average durability of M9 frames is over 30,000 rounds. The average durability of M9 locking blocks is 22,000 rounds. 

This awesome sidearm comes in the original box with the outer sleeve as well. Is presented exactly as it was when purchased new. It has had approx. 400rds downrange however, be sure that it is functioning perfectly. It has been cleaned to as new condition. There is not one single mar or scratch on this side arm anywhere. Looks and operates as brand new. All paper work included in presentation case. Additional factory mags are available for $60 ea as long as they are in my inventory.

Rt 66 Gunsmith (Danny) blueprinted the chamber (go/no go with spec torque to seat barrel in receiver @ proper index).  Prior to this the rifle could barely shoot 6 MOA with a Simmons White Tail 2.5 - 8X scope on a custom fit B-Square no-rezero side mount; now it shoots 2MOA or better- about the same as an so called ""acurized Mini"".  Rifle will be tested today with a brand new Nikon P223 scope.

Perks and accessories include a threaded barrel with standard AR-15 flashhider and aperture tip on front sight for ranging 75 - 200 yds. Addtional Butler Creek stock with spring loaded butt pad extender to enhance shouldered bump fire.  Custom trigger group with bearing smooth takeu and crisp linear release. B-Square scope sidemount with custom drilled receiver pockets for perfect no-rezero.  B-Square Bipod adapter. Adjustable sling, one 40 magazine and one 30 shot magazine.

This is a 184 series rifle with the improved pre-2006 barrel.  These newer barrels were manufactured to retain consistency through a broader heat range.  That said, I will include a heavy stainless steel muzzle ""bob"" for even better nail accuracy.  It requires removing the flash hider and sight.  it slides over the end of the barrel and then srcews onto the muzzle.  This ""trick"" has long been the key to cutting Mini-14 groups in half."
