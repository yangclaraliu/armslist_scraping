The pistol has been properly cared. It functions perfectly and has no cosmetic flaws. The pistol model has revived rave reviews by the many serious gun reviewers who write for websites and magazines. Note that S&W provided a transferable lifetime warranty so this gun is under warranty since no modifications have been made to it.Included with the sale of the gun are a total of three magazines. Each holds 16 9mm rounds. That allows for reduced reloading when at the range as well as all the capacity a person might want in a self defense situation. A Galloway Precision Kydex holster is part of the sale. The holster is se to be RH IWB, but the retention clip can be changed to convert it to LH IWB. In that LH configuration the holster can be used as a RH OWB holster. It has a Ulticlip that allows for belt or attachment thus making it Ok for attachment without a belt. A nylon belt mounted magazine pouch is also included for carrying the two extra magazines. 2 box’s of 115 grain FMJ, magazine speed loader, and gun sick also included. I can meet at any mutually convenient FFL in SE PA. I am located zip 19060(Garnet Valley, PA). I have an FFL 3 miles from me for a PA transaction. There is a DE FFL about 6 miles from me. The new product value of all the items included is $390. That makes my price a substantial savings. And the gun is broken in so you will not have to fire a few hundred rounds to get if working smoothly."

The McMillan tactical series are a combination of benchrest accuracy, battlefield ruggedness, superior ergonomics and specialized design. There is indeed a difference between professional equipment and look-alike equipment. When that difference matters to your job performance, demand McMillan. The A-4 tactical sniper stock was originally designed for the USMC and that's how we configure it as standard (the small difference in price is due to the extra flush-cups for varying your carrying hard-points.) The optional adjustable saddle type cheekpiece is comfortable and efficient.Will consider a trade for McMillan HTG or M40A1 stock or ?"
