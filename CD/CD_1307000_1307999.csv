I have other guns to practice with, so, this firearm been sitting for about 3 months in the case, I bought it about 6 months ago, fired no more than 500-700 rds, very accurate from 50 yards w/o scope, HKs are known for its reliability and accuracy. Much better than GSG522 which is very hard to disassemble and to clean. 

Nowadays, it's very expensive to shoot with 223 or 7.62, where you pay almost $1 per round, so, enjoy 4-5 cents a round on a range :) I have another 22lr rifle, where I put 200-300 rounds each visit w/o hurting my wallet.

All together I spent over $1,100 for this rifle. I want a portion of what I spent - $800 or best reasonable offer. 
How I came up with the price, I just did a little research on what people are asking for the similar rifle which is nowadays almost impossible to find because of its tactical look:

They are both in near condition, with nothing wrong at all.
If you aren’t familiar with the Storm platform, they are both excellent Beretta products. The Italians wanted a robust carbine that could share ammo/magazines with a pistol, with both weapons being friendly to left and right handed shooters. So Beretta started developing a carbine/pistol to meet those requirements, and they did a spectacular job at it!
So here’s what you will be getting. Both a pistol and rifle chambered in 9MM, with (5) 17 round magazines, they are both very reliable, accurate, and absolutely bulletproof.
About the PX4 Storm Pistol - It’s a full size 9MM pistol, with a proven rotating barrel design that is extremely accurate. It has a safety/decocker mounted on the slide (like a Beretta 92) and has a reversible magazine release for fully ambidextrous manipulation. It’s in near mint condition, with just the common usage wear marks. The bore is bright and shiny, and is in perfect mechanical working condition.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_Px4_Storm
About the CX4 Storm Carbine - It’s also chambered in 9MM, and comes with a full rail on top for optics, and 3 forward rails, for lights/foregrips. It has a very good EOTech clone on it that works well, holds a zero, is non-parallax. The charging handle, and ejection port, and mag release are reversible for fully ambidextrous manipulation. This is a very smooth shooting, super reliable, and extremely accurate carbine capable of, 200+ yard engagement with iron sights as seen in this video.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjYYrCzmCRA
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_Cx4_Storm
You get everything you see in the pictures. That’s a PX4 9MM pistol, CX4 9MM carbine, (6) 17 round magazines etc. First one with $1800.00 cash OBO takes them. If you are looking for the ultimate pistol/carbine combination, this is it. I don’t know of any other guns by any other maker that offers this kind of flexibility, versatility, reliability, or ambidextrous manipulation to this level!

Pricing for this gun was difficult b/c it's a very unique item.  I have seen some people asking for over 2000 on these guns, and that's crazy.   This also isn't your run of the mill AR build that everyone and their brother want 1400+ for b/c of Obama.  I feel like 1000 is a fair price for the whole package, but if you don't agree, please feel free to send me a reasonable offer.  I've also listed some trade items I'd be interested in.

I prefer to deal withing a 50 mile radius of St. Louis and I prefer to deal with other CCW holders.  Thank you."

SKS GENERAL DESCRIPTION

The SKS is a Soviet semi-automatic rifle chambered for the 7.62x39mm round, designed in 1943 by Sergei Gavrilovich Simonov. Its complete designation, SKS-45, is an initialism for Samozaryadnyj Karabin sistemy Simonova, 1945 (Russian: ???????????? ??????? ??????? ????????, 1945; Self-loading Carbine of (the) Simonov system, 1945), or SKS 45. In the early 1950s, the Soviets took the SKS carbine out of front-line service and replaced it with the AK-47; however, the SKS remained in second-line service for decades. It is still used as a ceremonial arm today. The SKS was widely exported, and was also produced by some former Eastern Bloc nations as well as China, where it was designated the ""Type 56"", East Germany as the Karabiner S and in North Korea as the ""Type 63"". The SKS is currently popular on the civilian surplus market in many countries, including the United States and Canada. It was one of the first weapons chambered for the 7.62x39mm M43 round, which was also used later in the AK-47.

This rifle is in excellent condition and has only been fired 350 times using Black Hills Mk 262. Shot it slow with a scope only. Never got it hot. It was well taken care of and shows only very light marks on the rail in a couple of places. For a short time I had a Magpul sling using a RSA mount up front, but that sling/mount combo was causing the front sling hook to rub the rail, so I got rid of it. You can see where it rubbed lightly in the pics. The lower was upgraded to a Gen. 2 chainsaw lower. I have no idea why it's chainsaw because there is no blemish I can see.

Cleaning was done with KG1, 2, and 3, and tetra gun oil as per the Noveske recommendations using a Dewey rod and JP cleaning rod guide.

The 457 is chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. The 457 is a traditional double-action pistol, meaning that the first shot is fired in double-action mode and the following shots are fired in single-action mode. The 457 has a 3.75-inch barrel and 7-round magazine capacity. It is available in either black alloy or stainless steel.

SMITH & WESSON M457 NO. 104804 .45 ACP, $711
GUN TESTS GRADE: B
The controls of this gun may be unnecessarily complicated, but so much is right with the way it fits the hand. 
After pressing the decocker, the lever remained in its down position, deactivating the trigger. The lever had to be pushed upward to its 9 o'clock position to re-engage the trigger for first-shot double-action fire.
The Model 457 is one of the oldest remaining products in the Smith & Wesson catalog. Also available with a matte stainless finish (model number 457S), this design is closely related to the ""Second Generation"" pistols that were popular with law enforcement when semi-automatics first replaced the revolver. What we liked best about the 457 was the way it lined up in our hands. The distance between the face of the trigger and the rear of the grip was just right, even when the trigger was in its rearward position for single-action fire. The plastic grip looked and felt like it was part of the aluminum frame. The seven round magazines included a basepad with a pinky rest, so even those shooters with the largest hands were satisfied.
The stealth black finish turned out to be very durable, and it remained unmarred throughout our tests. The right side of the gun was devoid of graphics and levers. We did however spy an externally mounted extractor flush fit with the slide, which also featured cocking serrations to the rear only. The left side showed off-white-colored lettering, a slide stop, and a decocker/safety lever mounted on the slide. The decocking lever was used to drop the hammer safely over a chambered round. After pressing the decocker, the lever would remain in its downward position deactivating the trigger. To return to safe-off, first shot double action required that the shooter manually push the lever upwards. The hammer on the 457 was without a tang or spur, and after decocking remained nearly flush with the back of the slide. An additional safety was the magazine release. With the magazine removed or simply ajar, the trigger was once again disconnected.
Sights were a low-mount snag-free design mounted via dovetails in the slide at both the front and rear. Sight acquisition was aided by white dots on the front blade and the rear notch.
Firing single action only from support, we established two benchmarks of note. The measurement of our five-shot groups averaged 1.7 inches firing both the Hornady and Winchester WinClean ammunition and 2.0 inches across shooting the Winchester Silvertips. The length of the 457's barrel was measured to be slightly less than 3.75 inches and the Glock's barrel measured slightly more than 3.75 inches. Overall average velocities for both pistols were about the same. But in terms of recoil control, we felt that the Smith & Wesson far outstripped the Glock. Naturally, the metallic frame of the 457 furnished more weight than either of our polymer pistols, but we think the larger contributing factor was the superior grip of the Smith & Wesson that we felt provided a more natural angle than the Glock.
In our 557 test, the Smith & Wesson was the top performer, even though our shooters were challenged with a transition from double to single action after the first shot of every group. Group size averaged about 3.75 inches across. What distinguished these groups from those fired by its competitors was that they were centered on the point of aim. The consensus of our staff was that of the three test guns, the Smith & Wesson offered the least variation in feel from the moment the trigger was acquired to the point of dissipation of recoil, and that the transition from double to single action forced only minimal adjustment upon the shooter. What we did argue about was the additional step presented by the combination decocker/safety lever. For example, during a training exercise, once the gun is taken off target, the command is, ""Finger off the trigger, outside the trigger guard. Safety on if you have one; decock if you have decocker."" The 457 design offered two choices here. They were to decock and raise the lever manually for next shot double action, or to press the decocker and leave the safety on.
For members of our staff favoring today's double-action-only pistols, the extra step seemed unnecessary. The intention of this design was to add an extra layer of safety. So was the magazine release, which disconnected the trigger. This feature has been used to foil gun grabs. Rather than prolong a fight for the weapon, the gun could be rendered useless by hitting the magazine release while the officer goes on to acquire an alternate weapon. Operators that would rather have the ability to fire an emergency shot in the middle of a reload should, however, be comforted by the fact that we thought the Smith & Wesson 457 was the most controllable when fired offhand.
The compact design of the pistol makes it ideal for concealed carry. There is no spur on the hammer, thereby reducing the risk of being caught on clothing during unholstering.

746,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1307746,For Sale:  XCR - Robinson Armament better than an AR and AK,"Holland, Grand Rapids, Michigan","$ 2,500","Listed On: Thursday, March 21, 2013",Rifles,Robinson Armament                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I'm selling my Robinson Armament XCR chambered in 5.56 NATO. It’s in great working, mechanical and operating condition, with only minor wear/handling marks. I've only taken out of the safe to be shot 5-6 times, with no more than 200-300 rounds through it, it’s near mint condition.
I’ve only used new production/high quality non corrosive non lacquer coated/steel cased ammo. It’s super accurate, very gentle recoil and an absolute blast to shoot. I’ll include (2) 30 round PMags by MagPul.
The XCR isn’t well known, so I’ll give you a short list of improvements/benefits over that of an AK or AR platform.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Armament_XCR
Robust long stroke piston driven gas system like that of an AK. Shoot hundreds of rounds, clean the barrel and you are done. No more cleaning a filthy dirty receiver like on an AR.
5 position gas selector. No matter what kind of ammo, how hard you run the gun, with 5 settings you can be sure the gun will always cycle.
One piece aluminum extruded upper. It’s strong, light weight, full length quad rails, and very well built.
Ambidextrous bolt release. Release the bolt (last shot hold open) with your trigger finger with ease.
Non reciprocating left side charging handle. Manipulate the rifle without ever losing your sight picture.
Multi cal. With a simple allen wrench, you can change the gun to shoot a wide range of ammo in under a minute! You can currently shoot .223/5.56X45 NATO, 6.5 Grendel, 6.8 Rem, 300 Blackout and the ever popular and cost effective 7.62X39 rounds!
Folding stock. Because the recoil spring is inside the piston (like an AK) the stock is foldable, that’s impossible for an AR to accomplish.
Free floated barrel. Because of the one piece extruded aluminum upper, the barrel is 100% free floated for superb accuracy.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:En-XCR_stripped.PNG
This is a very simple, robust, and well designed 12st century battle rifle, capable of adapting to various calibers as needed. 
I also have a 7.62X39 caliber conversion kit available for sale for an additional $600.00, and that come with (2) 30 round magazines as well.
Before all the craziness these were selling for $2500.00 all day long. So I’m going to ask for $2500.00 OBO.
You can email, call or text. sixonesixeighteight6one52three.

STRONG STEEL BODY: 12 GAUGE STEEL
Strong 12 gauge steel makes the Sporter safe heavier and tougher to move, is more time consuming to cut or drill through and flexes less when heated for better protection in a fire.

1-INCH FORMED DOOR:
The 1-inch formed door is engineered with a rugged steel face, back, and reinforcement panels to provide excellent strength and attack protection compared to the competition.

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM:
The Force Deflector Locking System (patent pending) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

LOCKING BOLTS: 1-INCH CHROME
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. Bigger bolts, and more of them, provide greater security.

 REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES:
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degree for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX HALF PANEL:
The DPX Half Panel combines fast access long gun storage on the back of the door with pockets and pouches for your small valuables and gear.

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use .5-inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by .5-inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING: 1200F/45 MIN. FIRE PROTECTION
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.

S&G MECHANICAL DIAL LOCK STANDARD

S&G ELECTRONIC LOCK UPGRADE AVAILABLE*
The S&G Electronic Lock is an advanced security system manufactured by the leader in the lock industry. Includes many technical security features. Standard on NRA.

STRONG STEEL BODY: 12 GAUGE STEEL
Strong 12 gauge steel makes the Sporter safe heavier and tougher to move, is more time consuming to cut or drill through and flexes less when heated for better protection in a fire.

1-INCH FORMED DOOR:
The 1-inch formed door is engineered with a rugged steel face, back, and reinforcement panels to provide excellent strength and attack protection compared to the competition.

FORCE DEFLECTOR LOCKING SYSTEM:
The Force Deflector Locking System (patent pending) prevents bolt or handle forces from reaching the lock by using a rotating cam device. It prevents energy transfer to the lock better than most systems used in the safe industry.

LOCKING BOLTS: 1-INCH CHROME
The rugged steel pieces that move behind the door frame to actually hold the safe door locked and closed. Bigger bolts, and more of them, provide greater security.

 REINFORCED DOOR FRAME:
The door opening of the safe, strengthened by U-shaped steel channels, is welded around the entire perimeter to create added pry and attack resistance.

180 DEGREE HEAVY DUTY HINGES:
Rugged hinges are machined from solid steel bar stock for strength. The hinges allow the door to swing open 180 degree for unhindered access to the safe interior. Hinge-side locking bolts maintain full security even if the hinges are cut off. The door is removable to simplify moving of the safe.

DPX HALF PANEL:
The DPX Half Panel combines fast access long gun storage on the back of the door with pockets and pouches for your small valuables and gear.

UL SECURITY CONTAINER RATING:
The industry standard test and rating for home/personal safes. Requires minimum construction specifications and passing a laboratory attack test. Premium Browning ProSteel safes far exceed the minimum requirements for the UL Residential Security (Tool Attack) listing.

LAYERS OF INSULATION:
The most important factor in fire protection is the total thickness of the insulation in the safe. More insulation means more protection from fire. Browning ProSteel safes use .5-inch thick gypsum panels, so the number of layers multiplied by .5-inch shows the total insulation thickness in inches.

FIRE RATING: 1200F/45 MIN. FIRE PROTECTION
A laboratory measurement of time and temperature (in Fahrenheit) used to compare the relative amount of fire resistance provided by a safe. A Browning ProSteel safe with a longer fire rating time provides more fire protection than a safe with a shorter time.
