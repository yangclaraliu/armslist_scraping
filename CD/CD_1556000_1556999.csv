FEATURES:

Polymer Tip
The polymer tip increases the ballistic coefficient and also initiates dramatic expansion upon impact – even at velocities as low as 1600 fps.

Higher Ballistic Coefficient
Hornady® combines the sharp, pointed polymer tip with the most aerodynamic profile for a high ballistic coefficient. The V-MAX™ profile also provides the maximum bearing surface for added in-flight stability.

Swaged Lead Core
The swaging process allows for precise formation of the core up and around the tip, with a cavity under the tip's stem. This allows the tip to build up energy before smashing into the core, causing dramatic fragmentation of the core and jacket.

Precise Boattail & Flatbase Designs
Utilizing the proper base design provides incredible in-flight stability for long-range shooting."

Aimpoint PRO: Patrol Rifle Optics:

P/N: 12841

A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints. Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

• Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD). 
• Front and rear flip covers keep lenses clean.

• Battery and adjustment cap retainer straps means you will never lose your pieces. 
• Modular mount set up for use on flat-top AR15, M4 Carbine and M16 rifles. (Adapter available for carry handle mounting)

The rifle is kept clean and comes with two 20-round magazines and a shoulder sling. I've installed a Buffertech recoil buffer also. It works well at shaving down target acquisition time on follow-up shots.

This rifle is a good shooter. The gas system of the FAL is fitted with a regulator so it can be easily adjusted for various conditions, or cut off entirely. I usually find having to slightly adjust it for different ammo manufacturers.

I like my battle rifle and I hate having to sell it but I need cash for other things. I’ll probably regret selling this since our government is headed toward tyranny. We all might need some of these pretty soon.

I will not entertain any offer of trades. Price is reduced from $900.

It's a great gun for pocket carry but I happened to find a Sig P938 which suits me better than the LCP. I put 13 rounds through the Ruger and decided it was more than accurate enough (and I was low on ammo at the time), and I haven't shot it since I got the Sig. So this LCP is basically brand new. 

This is the stainless steel version and it does not have a laser. 

It comes with an extended 7 round Ruger magazine, the original 6 round Ruger magazine and a 6 round promag magazine. All mags have an extended butt plate, and there is a flat butt plate in the box that you can switch out. I added a Hogue grip to the handle that can be taken off if you prefer, but it gives the gun a much nicer feel. Also comes with the original Ruger softcase and padlock. Additionally, there is a lifetime warranty on this gun through Davidson's."

This Rossi Overland in the .410 has the 26 inch full/full barrels, beautiful walnut stock and fore end and the Exposed Rebounding Hammers that do NOT rest on the firing pins. Nice safety feature you don't see any more. This model has long been out of production.
This one has NEVER BEEN FIRED and was put together for the first time when I shot these pictures. I had an Uncle who used to see something he liked and would just buy it on a whim. He was in a wheelchair and rarely got out to shoot, never even put this one together. He passed some years ago and his sister (my Mom) ended up with most of his things. This was passed on to me to give to my little guy so he could start bird hunting with me but it's just TOO NICE to even think about taking it afield. 
Don't know how many others you'll find like it but the last one I saw on one of the gun auction sites brought over $600 and had been fired, was noted at ""98%"" and didn't include the box and paperwork. 
Would prefer to deal with someone local to avoid all the shipping and such but am open to interested parties as long as they're in the USA and NOT in CALIF, COLO, CONN or any other gun hating state. Of course if it goes out of NV it'll have to go to a FFL, etc. NV FTF will require you to provide a copy of a valid NV DL. I'll do the same if any trade + cash is involved.
Would consider partial trade of a NIB or ""Like New"" Henry AR-7 Survival Rifle + $300 CASH or something similar. Already have a single shot 20 gauge lined up for the little guy but might consider something like that and some amount of CASH too... Let me know what you might be thinking.

•A Port Buffer (Keeps your brass from flying 30+ Feet and you brass from getting damaged$
•Recently Refinished wood Stock and Handgaurd in Red Mahogany
•Claw Mount Rail (So you can Mount a Scope)
•Primary Arms 30mm Red-Dot Sight with High-Cantilever Mount (High Mount allows you to use a magnifier with this red dot)

405,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1556405,For Sale/Trade:  140 rounds .223 Tula Steel cased,"Valrico/Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 60,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 14, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"(7) 20 Round boxes .223	TulAmmo	 FMJ Asking $9 per box

Would like to get $60 for all seven boxes.

*NOTE* The steel used in steel cases is harder than brass, but it is softer than the materials your AR are made of. When a case is fired, it expands to fill the chamber, then it contracts and ejects. With brass, it expands more, and contracts more than steel. What does this mean? With steel, it will allow more gas to pass the case into chamber, and it means the case is slightly larger when it ejects.

OK, so that is the technical aspect, but what does it mean to you right? Most importantly, it means that steel case ammo will not damage your AR. There are a few things to beware of however. If you have a ""tight"" chamber, you are more likely to have a stuck case. You also will have to clean a little more frequently, especially cleaning the chamber with a chamber brush, and you need to keep the BCG and chamber wet (I suggest this anyways). You also need to consider that most of what people think of when talking steel case ammo is the cheaper import stuff like Wolf or Tula, and that type of ammo tends to be lower powered and often not as consistent as premium domestic brass ammo. Lower powered ammo in an AR could lead to cycling issues depending on your rifle.

Bottom line: steel case ammo won't hurt your AR, and if you find it works reliably in your setup, there is no reason to avoid it, at least for range use. Keep your chamber clean and lubed."

This Rossi Overland in the .410 has the 26 inch full/full barrels, beautiful walnut stock and fore end and the Exposed Rebounding Hammers that do NOT rest on the firing pins. Nice safety feature you don't see any more. This model has long been out of production.
This one has NEVER BEEN FIRED and was put together for the first time when I shot these pictures. I had an Uncle who used to see something he liked and would just buy it on a whim. He was in a wheelchair and rarely got out to shoot, never even put this one together. He passed some years ago and his sister (my Mom) ended up with most of his things. This was passed on to me to give to my little guy so he could start bird hunting with me but it's just TOO NICE to even think about taking it afield. 
Don't know how many others you'll find like it but the last one I saw on one of the gun auction sites brought over $600 and had been fired, was noted at ""98%"" and didn't include the box and paperwork. 
Would prefer to deal with someone local to avoid all the shipping and such but am open to interested parties as long as they're in the USA and NOT in CALIF, COLO, CONN or any other gun hating state. Of course if it goes out of NV it'll have to go the a FFL, etc. NV FTF will require you to provide a copy of a valid NV DL. I'll do the same if any trade + cash is involved.
Would consider partial trade of a Henry AR-7 + $250 CASH or something similar. Already have a single shot 20 gauge lined up for the little guy but might consider something like that and some CASH too... Let me know what you might be thinking.

The great thing about the GEN 4 GLOCK 30 is the flexibility. In GEN3 you have the 30 and 30SF for a smaller grip. The GEN 4 has the straps so you can have either. No strap is the same size as the 30SF and the medium strap makes it the same as the 30 (GEN 3)

See if I can get it to work with just one pic. Pictures available upon request of course. 
Just like taking the ""Way-Back-Machine"" and getting this Cowboy Action Shooter, Collectible Shotgun off the shelf. 
This Rossi Overland in the .410 has the 26 inch full/full barrels, beautiful walnut stock and fore end and the Exposed Rebounding Hammers that do NOT rest on the firing pins. Nice safety feature you don't see any more. This model has long been out of production.
This one has NEVER BEEN FIRED and was put together for the first time when I shot these pictures. I had an Uncle who used to see something he liked and would just buy it on a whim. He was in a wheelchair and rarely got out to shoot, never even put this one together. He passed some years ago and his sister (my Mom) ended up with most of his things. This was passed on to me to give to my little guy so he could start bird hunting with me but it's just TOO NICE to even think about taking it afield. 
Don't know how many others you'll find like it but the last one I saw on one of the gun auction sites brought over $600 and had been fired, was noted at ""98%"" and didn't include the box and paperwork. 
Would prefer to deal with someone local to avoid all the shipping and such but am open to interested parties as long as they're in the USA and NOT in CALIF, COLO, CONN or any other gun hating state. Of course if it goes out of NV it'll have to go the a FFL, etc. NV FTF will require you to provide a copy of a valid NV DL. I'll do the same if any trade + cash is involved.
Would consider partial trade of a Henry AR-7 + $250 CASH or something similar. Already have a single shot 20 gauge lined up for the little guy but might consider something like that and some CASH too... Let me know what you might be thinking.

 Barrels are particle tested, air gauged, concentrically cut and muzzle threaded � -28 R.H. twist to accept flash hiders/suppressors, stressed relieved, turned on center to prevent accuracy robbing distortion when the barrel heats up, and hardened to 26-33 Rc giving the barrel a long life.  

 Each barrel has an eleven degree crown, polished chamber and lapped bore, as well as a pulled-button rifling,  producing a superbly accurate bore diameter with uniform rate of twist. Fluted models feature unique fluting designs to improve rigidity and aid in barrel cooling.

Just like taking the ""Way-Back-Machine"" and getting this Cowboy Action Shooter, Collectible Shotgun off the shelf. 
This Rossi Overland in the .410 has the 26 inch full/full barrels, beautiful walnut stock and fore end and the Exposed Rebounding Hammers that do NOT rest on the firing pins. Nice safety feature you don't see any more. This model has long been out of production.
This one has NEVER BEEN FIRED and was put together for the first time when I shot these pictures. I had an Uncle who used to see something he liked and would just buy it on a whim. He was in a wheelchair and rarely got out to shoot, never even put this one together. He passed some years ago and his sister (my Mom) ended up with most of his things. This was passed on to me to give to my little guy so he could start bird hunting with me but it's just TOO NICE to even think about taking it afield. 
Don't know how many others you'll find like it but the last one I saw on one of the gun auction sites brought over $600 and had been fired, was noted at ""98%"" and didn't include the box and paperwork. 
Would prefer to deal with someone local to avoid all the shipping and such but am open to interested parties as long as they're in the USA and NOT in CALIF, COLO, CONN or any other gun hating state. Of course if it goes out of NV it'll have to go the a FFL, etc. NV FTF will require you to provide a copy of a valid NV DL. I'll do the same if any trade + cash is involved.
Would consider partial trade of a Henry AR-7 + $300 CASH or something similar. Already have a single shot 20 gauge lined up for the little guy but might consider something like that and some CASH too... Let me know what you might be thinking.

The long barrel makes it a very accurate tool for bringing home the supper.  I had one similar to this and it brought home the meat for my family.
I have gotten old now and my wrists are not strong enough to keep on target, can't see how shooting in the foot is very promising.  So best let someone else have my favorite.
This gun is complete in the case with all of the little bells and whistles that comes with it.
Before I purchased this I contacted the company that made it and enquired whether it would handle a hollow point bullet, the answer is yes.  So I pass that info to you, you may use a long rifle, a magnum, and a hollow point, there are two cylinders and are clearly marked.  There is a locking device in the hand grip and keys are in the case.  There is also a plastic device to lock the gun, as well as the instruction manuals."

The Exposed Rebounding Hammers do NOT rest on the firing pins. Nice safety feature. This model has long been out of production.
This one has NEVER BEEN FIRED and was put together for the first time when I shot pictures. My Uncle used to see something he liked and would just buy it on a whim. He was in a wheelchair and rarely got out to shoot, never even put this one together. He passed some years ago and his sister (my Mom) ended up with most of his things. This was passed on to me to give to my little guy so he could start bird hunting with me but it's just TOO NICE to even think about taking it afield. 
Don't know how many others you'll find like it but the last one I saw on one of the gun auction sites brought over $600 and had been fired, was noted at ""98%"" and didn't include the box and paperwork. 
Would prefer to deal with someone local to avoid all the shipping and such but am open to interested parties as long as they're in the USA and NOT in CALIF, COLO, CONN or any other gun hating state. Of course if it goes out of NV it'll have to go the a FFL, etc. NV FTF will require you to provide a copy of a valid NV DL. I'll do the same if any trade + cash is involved.
Would consider partial trade of a Henry AR-7 + $300 CASH or something similar. Already have a .22/20 gauge lined up for the little guy but might consider something like that and some CASH too... Let me know what you might be thinking.

I'm convinced there are people on this website who wouldn't know which way to point a gun and pull the trigger if their lives depended on it, but are selling ammunition & guns at inflated prices.

For example:
Someone is selling two S&W 9mm shield mags for $140 when you can simply go to smith-wesson.com and buy them for $38 each! 
Someone else is trying to sell a S&W shield for $625 when you can ""buy it now"" on gunbroker.com for $519, shipped.
If you're lazy, you'll get punished on the price tag.
There may be a liberal plot to control ammo or just unemployed slugs buying ammo; who knows? I suggest TRADING ammo if you're legit, and not buying the line about someone ""finding it in his gun cabinet"" and that's why he's selling it. I know goddamn well EXACTLY what's in my gun cabinet at ALL times, and I'm sure you do, too!

It is in great condition. It has the original wooden stock and works like a charm. I have been babying it for several years now but I feel it is time to move on (especially considering I have 3 of them). The rifle does not have the bayonet and does have the original cleaning rod. Since many SKS's are known to have problems with the gas chamber I went ahead and replaced it along with the hand guard. Everything works very smoothly and I will throw in MANY stripper clips along with the rifle. I have been working with SKS's for over 10 years now and make sure they are all well cared for.

The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines."

I think we all are tired of the ""Patriots"" buying guns to protect America's values when  they can't fire the gun safely let alone accurately fire them and two are the biggest cowards that buy guns. You are the first to run and surrender dont kid yourself. If you really wanted to be in the military, elist. If you cant cause your fat and in poor health or a felon, well you shouldnt have a gun."

Pictures dont do it justice. Would have to be CSI to find any blemishes if any.  Only thing is some grease spots from my oily skin lol. I dont have anything right now to clean  the couple spots with. I dont dare use paper towels or anything to wipe off the guitar as I dont want to create blemishes or effect the paint.
