Mosin Nagants (already got 3 and only like the carbines, hate those pole vaulting ones)
Any tube fed or lever action guns

***I know the list thing is annoying I just want to save us both time, Im more of a collector of military type guns.  Some guns I want are worth more than the 4-500 Fender and amp set so that's why I offered the Type 53 and Ammo, but for lesser value guns you can add money or something we agree on.  I as well, may let go of other things for the right AR or AK. SKS are 3-400 to me, Judge 3-400, CZ-52 2-300, polish pps 3-400, ect just to give you idea of what they really sell person to person for..My asking prices can be verified in Ebay under the sold listings so Im sure Im being fair Ive got around-$750 real moneys worth!

Offered is a German carbon folded steel slide and an aluminum frame Sig, triple serial numbered, proofed in Germany...fondled but never fired.  I have owned hundreds of firearms, and the Sig P228 is in my top 5 favorites, so much that I own 5 at the moment.  Sig experts will tell you the early to mid 90's Sig pistols were the best ever produced, and I agree with that, the pistols I have are top of the line.  The best balanced pistol ever built...awesome!

I will trade this pistol for a HIGH END shotgun, I am looking for an outstanding condition/as new HIGH END auto 12 ga 3"" magnum.  I know this is a very specific trade request, but this is what it will take for me to trade.  I actually have two of these P228's one in Blue and one in the K Kote finish, with everything that was shipped from the factory; outside cardboard box, dark gray plastic case, mag, hang tags, manual & test target, your choice.  Like I said above, I want a pristine and HIGH END shotgun to make this trade...ONLY."

The barrel is 1/11 twist, marked 6.8 spc, but according to Bushmaster the 1/11 barrels are the newer ones and can also handle spec 2 ammo. This weapon has bad 20 down the pipe and was a pleasure to shoot and very accurate. The 6.8 spc was designed for military use for longer range engagements and is a very fine long range cartridge. Sometimes called the "" 270 lite "" it is a great hunting round as well for AR platform rifles. I'm including a pic that shows the difference between the 6.8 and the 5.6

505,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1222505,For Sale:  NEBO PROTEC ELITE HP190LS Tac Light/Laser Combo,"Richmond Heights, St. Louis, Missouri",$ 30,"Listed On: Saturday, March 9, 2013",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"**Please read full description to the end so you understand why I'm letting this go cheap**

NEBO PROTEC ELITE HP190LS combines a brilliant white light with a bright red aiming laser. It uses a highly efficient CREE® Q5 LED to generate 190 lumens of intense white light with a 5-milliwatt, 650 nanometer laser sight, located below the light. Light of this magnitude is enough to dominate an aggressor’s night adapted vision, ideal for military, law enforcement, and self-defense. The reflector lens focuses the beam for long distance lighting while also producing enough light to support the user’s peripheral vision. The HP190LS’ batteries will produce 3 hours of continuous illumination. The compact body of the HP190LS is constructed of aircraft grade anodized aluminum making it a lightweight, yet powerful light source. The HP190LS is also O-ring and gasket sealed to be completely weatherproof. The HP190LS features an ambidextrous momentary/steady On-Off switch to provide one-finger operation. This switch allows you to select 100% white light or defensive strobe.  A separate switch on the bottom is used to control the laser. Laser travels over 450 yards.


Features
•One high-power CREE® Q5 LED bulb outputs 190 lumens of light (bulbs rated for 110,000+ hours of life)
•High-visibility 5mW / 650 nm red aiming laser
•Anodized aircraft grade aluminum weather-proof compact body design
•3 hours of continuous light
•Ambidextrous On-Off switch allows for momentary or steady activation
•No tools required
•3 lighting modes – 100% white light (230 lumens), or 100% white light in strobe mode
•One CR123A battery included for light and three AG5 Button Cell Batteries included for laser

Because I hate to buy something and feel ripped off, and would hate to do that to you, I am disclosing the following. The laser adjusts by means of two small screws that act against a spring system within the housing. The spring is underpowered and does not allow for enough elevation or windage adjustment to be accurate beyond 15 yards, which is dissapointing for anything but a shotgun.

The laser and housing are removable, leaving you with the NEBO Protec Tac Light only, which is fine, but two of the four screws are stripped. This is easily resolved by drilling-out the heads. 

This item retails for $70. The factory flaw is why I'm letting it go for $30.

The batteries have been used a total of less than 8 minutes, which will leave you with plenty of use for a blindingly bright LED Tac Light."

BEWARE OF THE COOK COUNTY SHERIFF

I had a rifle on armslist that I was looking to dump, nothing important. When I received a email from a buyer telling me they wanted to purchase the rifle. We exchanged phone numbers. I received a text last friday asking me to meet the buyer. I was working, but wasn't busy.

They wanted to meet in Oak Park, I said NO WAY.

They recommended a different spot. I agreed, the Portillos on Roosevelt and DesPlanes. There is a gun range a couple of blocks from there that I thought would be a better place but, it was Friday and I was more afraid of rush hour then I was of the location.

Long story short, it smelled and looked wrong. the car was a pick up with black windows. I'm thinking gangbanger. When I pull up two guys get out of the car, but they are both older white guys. They didn't match the car. They look over the rifle, but when it comes time to sign the paper work, the guy doesn't have a FOID card. He tells me he has a domestic arrest.

I tell him I can't sell him the rifle, he offers more money, I reject his offer. He keeps try. I keep saying NO.

Next thing I know, there are 50 cops surrounding me, they are searching my car, and handcuffing me and toss me in the back of a car.

Within 15 minutes I'm in the Maywood sheriff station. They are asking where I live, how many guns do I own, how many I've sold. The experience was rough and distressing. I didn't want to answer any questions.
All I can think is that I'm in handcuffs for some reason, did I break a law I wasn't aware of. If I answer a question wrong I end up in a jump suit.

Turns out, I didn't break any laws. They want me to give them information that I didn't have. I almost had a heart attack. I walked out an hour later with my rifle.

What the bloody hell was that. Is this how we threat citizens when political fortunes are on the line. It took me a week before I had the nerve to post on this site. I use be mad at people who refused to sell to cook county residents. Now I understand, its not worth it.

I had the same dilemma but I found the solution; an Olympic Arms 300 ACC Blackout carbine rifle. Why you ask? Take the time to look at the ballistics of a .300acc compared with the 308 and 7.62X39.  Plus the rounds are available and compatible with the standard 5.56 magazines.  

This 2012 purchased rifle was never fired!  So, let’s call it new.  The forged lower receiver is multi-caliber which can be used on one of more than 20 different caliber uppers. 

It has original collapsible stock, two metal magazines and a standard sling.  As the picture shows it has a fixed carry handle with windage/elevation wheels.  Additionally, it comes with a detachable optics rail for the carry handle.

The 16” bull button barrel (6 lands – 6 grooves) is made of 416 stainless steel with black oxide finish and a 1:9 twist.  Plus a bayonet lug when you need it. The flash suppressor is removable for different “cages” or a sound suppressor (not included)

Includes 60 rounds, 20 of which are sub-sonic and the owners manual.

Current production is 8 to 10 months backlogged according to the Olympic Arms website.  So here it is now, ready for you.  My loss, your gain.  $1,750 and it’s yours.  Hurry before our Socialist leaning Federal Government decides a firearms purchase is a threat to their agenda.  Please call Herman @ REDACTED for the quickest response."

 I really have no use for it anymore. I am lookng to trade but may take cash if the offer is right. Let me know what you have. I am interested in a rifle or tactical shotgun but will also consider handguns too. I also have $$ to include in a trade if needed. 

It will include a padded case and cleaning tools, maybe some ammo too if the deal is right.

GOTO walmart.com a couple times a day. Search for a store close to you by entering you zip code. GOTO sports and out doors and search for (ammo) or (winchester, or remington, or federal, or cci)(look for the ammo you want and click on it. If it shows your selected store is out of stock then click (find another store) a list of store's within a 50 mile radius will come up. scroll down to search for availability. After doing this a few time you will get the hang of it. keep in mind that a few items like winchester 50ct 22lr are showing in stock on east washington st. but they claim the don't have them. if you look several times a day and it shows out of stock, then later says in stock, I can promise you they have been check in the store and are in the back. some stores put them out at night and some put them out first thing in the morning. as long as people keep paying stupid price's to scalpers it will continue to be hard to track down. Yesterday I saw a guy in noblesville post two boxes of 2 tula brass maxx 50ct. box .223($15/box @WM and 1 box of Federal 100ct. value pk. ($35/box@WM) Post on arms list for $170.

Q4364 is genuine government contract overrun ammo made for the FBI. This is top quality ammo normally not available to the public. The absolute best you can buy in case you need to use your gun in a self defense situation. It is legal for civilian ownership, and many people including myself think that the best way to avoid complications in the event of having to use a firearm in self defense is to use the same ammo as the police would.

This is the closest thing available on the market, and Cabela's ammo doesn't have bonded bullets.

This rifle is a 340D chambered in .222 Remington which from the 50's through the 70's was the cartridge of choice for benchrest competitors.  To this day records are still held by rifles chambered in .222 Remington.  This caliber although not as popular as it once was in the US, is still available in most gun shops and on line from places like The Sportsmans Guide (The same can not be said for .223 Remington witch was the cartridge developed from it and is now sold out everywhere).  The .222 Remington will still be around for many years because it is widely used in other countries like Italy where there is a ban on all military calibers.  .222 Remington even has it's own web site trippledeuce.net.  This gun has a 24 inch barrel with brass bead front sight and sharp rifling.  It will easily shoot 1MOA if you can hold it steady.  There is no rust on the gun and the bluing is still like new.  The wood stock is ding free with white line spacers and an oil finish.  This gun comes with a Weaver K4 60-B scope witch is 4X power and has a 1"" all steel tube body that is rust free and a fine crosshair reticle, the glass is clear and bright.  The scope mount is a Weaver detachable side mount and both the scope and mount are period correct for this gun.  Other items I am selling with the gun are 125 rounds of mixed factory ammo, 55 rounds of spent brass, a LEE hand loader reloading set, a spare box mag that is still new in the plastic and caps for the scope.

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

Cash only - I'm not interested in trading unless it's for a Colt 9mm AR - Nothing else.
The Sig and the Colt are considered the best AR-15s you can buy, hands down.
This AR shoots both 5.56mm NATO as well as the typical .223 rounds. It has a 1 in 7 inch rifling instead of the typical 1 in 9 inch. The 1 in 7 leads to better accuracy and is military spec. That's part of the enhanced version of this gun. It has the rear flip up sights and it comes with an unopened MAGPUL 30 round magazine.

 Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

 Comes compete with 5 round magazine as shipped from factory.
