 For AR-15 / M16 type rifles, optical sights provide superior performance at longer ranges, but iron sights can be more effective for close-range engagements. However, attaching an optical sight either prevents the use of iron sights or results in a setup that produces a front sight ""shadow"" on the optical image, and/or results in problematic transitions from optical to backup iron sights. Not anymore. Dueck Defense Rapid Transition Sights (RTS) provide shooters with the quickest possible transition between longer- and closer-range target acquisition, greatly increasing their efficiency and effectiveness in battle and competition. Designed by Barry Dueck Director of SureFire's Suppressor Division and a top 3-Gun shooter these sights mount directly to a weapon's Picatinny rail, offset from center by approximately 45°. This unique offset position makes transitioning from optical to iron sights simply a matter of quickly canting the weapon with your wrists and locking on to the target. There's no removing a hand from the weapon or making a manual adjustment, and no cluttered field of vision or iron sights blocking the optical sight. Just smooth, quick transitions that could mean the difference between winning or losing a competition, or more importantly a gunfight."

Burris Speed Bead.

The radical SpeedBead System handles many of the factors that make wingshooters miss, and turns poor shooters into good shooters and good shooters into great ones. With the SpeedBead System, both the target and the red dot remain in focus. The optics and their position on the sight plane eliminate the need for perfect left/right, up/down head position for an accurate shot. The innovative mount puts the center of the optic directly in line with the ventilated rib, so altering your shooting style is not necessary. And with 3-1/2 inches to 4-1/2 inches of eye relief, there is absolutely no worry about your eyebrow running into the sight nor any interference with your hand gripping the shotgun. Should the common CR-2032 five year battery ever fail, you can revert to your front bead without visual obstruction. For a better view on rising targets, there are 1/8 and 1/4 risers available.

I'm thinking of going with a lever action chambered in a pistol round like the 357/38 since I  have another 30/30 lever action.
This riffle is in pristine condition with the brass accents and golden spike commemorative coin in the butt stock and was issued in 1969 to commemorative the driving of the golden spike that finished the railroad across this great nation of ours. It also has a custom made Winchester sleeve to carry or store it in.I have put maybe 30 rds thru it and to be honest the 30/30 round is pretty much the same as a 765 AK round and the recoil is a little hash on my shoulder since having rotator cuff surgery. So I'm looking for a riffle just as nice but in a lower caliber.
I'm looking to trade only and want a riffle just as gorgeous as this one.... that narrows it down to either Henry Golden boy or a Uberti 1866 Yellowboy Carbine."

I have a P226 Elite that I would like to sell or trade.

PRICE:
$1000 for the whole packages listed below.
Pistol will come with 5 OEM 15 round Sig mags, 2 MecGar 18 round mags (new never fired any rounds out of them), Night Sights (not sure what brand but still bright) and a Serpa Retention holster.

$850 for pistol and 2 OEM 15 round mags and will throw in a Blackhawk Serpa Retention holster.

Extra mags are available for sale but ONLY after the pistol sells.
3 15 rd OEM mags: $35/each
2 18 rd MecGar mags: $28/each (how much I paid before shipping)

It is the Enhanced model with a ""beaver"" tail and SRT trigger. The grips are not factory as I bought it used and they are the Hogue aluminum grips. Not sure of the round count but I have many trouble free rounds through it. There is a bit of a scratch on the Hogue grip but the gun itself is very clean. I would say 98% condition.

Only thing I am interested in trading for are the following:

Glock 26/19 - Gen 3 + 450 in cash, Gen 4 + 400 in cash.

Will need to do a Bill of Sale and you must be okay with me recording your CPL and WA DL information on the bill of sale. FTF in Seattle area preferred but can travel 30 minutes each way for a meet up. NO SHIPPING."

Cold Steel - Trench Hawk. This was a birthday gift in April. Has never been taken outside of the living room or used in any way. I added 25 feet of black mil spec 550 para cord wrapped around the entire length of the handle for extra grip and tactical uses. Still has the factory oil protection on the blade. 
Selling for $60.00. It is listed on the Cold Steel Web Sites for $65.99 plus shipping but they are on back order.
I am selling it because I received another tomahawk that suits my needs better and I do not need two. The Trench Hawk is considered one of the best all around tomahawks and most sites and blogs rate it very high. 
I do not have any pics, so I posted the factory pics from Cold Steel. Serious buyers only. Price is non negotiable. I will meet you around the Canton area.

Comes with 1 factory and 3 extra 30 round magazines. All mags have been checked for issues on my AK-74s and feed perfectly. Also comes with SKS style cleaning kit, cleaning rod, oil jug, trigger lock, all original paper work and manuals, and box. Also includes 180 rounds of 5.45 x 30 ammo. These guns are perfect ladies and young shooters, very little recoil. About the same as a .223. I have put these rounds through native lumber 4x4s, plenty of power. Rounds leave the muzzle at 2970 fps with 0 drop at 100 yards. I have 2 more of these, or I should say my wife has 1 and I keep 1 for my great nephews and nieces to shoot. I'm selling this 1 because I'm still kinda partial to my 47 and don't really need it. By answering this post you are certifying that you are lawfully able to purchase a firearm in Colorado. Will not sell inside Denver city limits. I will want to see a drivers license or CCW befire I turn the gun over, and will provide a bill of sale. Buyer will sign a transfer document . Might be willing to trade a high end hand gun, maybe 9mm or .40 cal. plus cash. Let me know what you have. I need at least $700.00 cash with a reasonable trade to cut this gun loose."

REDACTED

Lee Perfect Powder Measure is best for reloading rifle cases, can also be used for pistol cases. Can be used on the included bench mounted stand, or used in conjunction with the Universal Charging Die on the Load Master.

Best for reloading rifle cases.
Throws charges from 2 to over 100 grains. Eliminates Cut Powder and Jerky Action. A soft elastomer wiper strikes off the metering chamber rather than cut the powder. You'll be surprised at how smoothly the rotor operates. More importantly, you will enjoy the most uniform of charges.

Meaningful Calibration 
A micrometer adjuster that reads directly in cubic centimeters. Just multiply the charge in grains by the cc for one grain and you have the setting. So very much better than a meaningless setting as most supply.

Versatile
The metering chamber is the proper size for large rifle charges and the strike off opening small enough to work well with pistol size charges. The Lee Perfect Powder Measure works fine for charges from two grains to over 100 grains.

This is hands down the best playing strat (for my personal taste) that i've ever used...among americans and mexicans alike. lets face it, the price difference between USA and MIM is inflated, come play this thing and tell me that you can feel the difference with your eyes closed. 

The reason i'm selling/trading it is because I like more bulky guitars. plain and simple. I want this to go to a good home. 

Its not selling for 300 because its not coming without that case, and its not a 2009 with fret wire sticking out of the edges. this is a nice guitar. 

here is a few videos of me playing it!!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsLtMOU02u8

This gun is very accurate as well. It weighs 19 ounces unloaded, 22 ounces loaded.
This gun also has the safety trigger like the Glock triggers. Also it contains an internal lock that you can lock/unlock with a key (comes with 2 sets), and the key also contains a tool for adjusting your sights. 
The PT709 is also 0.97"" wide. Just under 1 inch! And at it's widest spot, the safety, it's width is 1.08"". Everything on this gun is made to it doesn't snag when pulling out of your holster, sights, safety, slide lock etc. Nothing will get in the way of you drawing this gun in times of need or practice.

I have had 0 jams, 0 fails to fire, 0 stovepipes, etc. I have had 0 problems with this gun whatsoever. It's really awesome, has barely any noticeable recoil, and is very easy to conceal due to it's size, and yet it isn't too small. Great for serious owners or first time buyers looking for something compact with barely any recoil at all.

Overall this is a great 9mm handgun especially if you're interested in concealed carry or home defense.

I'm interested in trading for a different compact or full size (No Ruger LCP or LC9's, or hi-points). 
I'm very interested in trading straight across for any of these:

Taurus 24/7 G2 .40 or 9mm
Taurus PT111 G2 9mm or .40
Taurus Millennium Pro 9mm or .40 
Smith & Wesson M&P (Shield or the 9mm compact or .40 compact). 
Glock .40 cal

Email me if you're interested and we'll go from there. If you have something a little more expensive than this such as an M&P or glock I'll throw in some 9mm ammo and iwb or owb holster."

These are fairly rare, Doing some research online, National Ordnance has a mixed reputation. Some love them, Some hate them, some say they've had them for years with no problems. My Uncle in Idaho has one, and he shot it three times a month for 10 years. With no problems ever. Some people say its junk. Personally, I think they're fine. I've shot it twice now, (30 rnds) with no problems.

Well this one seems to be in really good condition. I purchased at an estate sale. Serial #5027XXX.  Condition is good to very good.  Test-fired at rifle range, twice.   30 rounds, no problems.  In perfect working order.   Sights dead-on.   Everything looks correct, and functions correctly.   Bolt is tight in receiver.  I've included pictures of some markings on the stock.   I have no idea what any of them mean, but feel free to clue-me-in.   According to some research, it was probably made after 1968.

This is a nice, working, vintage rifle, that just needs a good home.

 AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

COLT has only ever made 10,000 1971 COLT commanders and most of them are in the 45. cal this one is in the 38 super cal. if you do not know what a 30 super is, it is a bullet probably right between a 9mm and a 40. its a great round to shoot and they are still around. it has beautiful wood grips with the classic Colt on them. It comes with 3 ten round mags one is a COLT mag and the other two are older made in the USA mags and they all work flawlessly. Also it comes in the original box with papers showing the gun model and telling about it. these guns are super rare and irreplaceable.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Introducing the latest high quality AK part manufactured by Arsenal, Inc.

The AK-47 type Compensator for 7.62x39 caliber rifles carries the Arsenal Inc logo and the “US” marking as a testament to its uncompromising quality. The new compensator combines a slick design with detailed attention to perfect functionality and workmanship.

This compensator is made in one piece and incorporates the ever popular cresset design. The one-piece design creates a perfectly symmetric compensator, resulting in an equal amount of excess gas escape and uniform recoil reduction with no negative effect on accuracy.

Utilizing precision cutting machines, Arsenal Inc. ensured that the unit is coaxial, with the threads and the two concentric circular openings being centered and perpendicular to the cylindrical body of the compensator.

The combination of high grade tool steel and sophisticated heat treating process in vacuum furnaces result in a compensator that maintains its perfectly cylindrical shape, free of any warping, deformation, collapse, or surface contaminants.

The consistent and precision cut 24x1.5mm right-hand threads eliminate the wobbly effect common with other units. The compensator remains rock solid even if the incorrectly cut threads on your front sight block do not allow it to screw on flush with the wall of the block."

Offered is a very lightly used CA compliant DSA FAL. I am the third owner and I believe less then 300 rounds have been run through it total. It has some great upgrades to include: DSA FAL Rail Interface fore end, with the DSA Extreme Duty Scope Mount, Extended model on the receiver (so that there is no gap between the receiver and the railed fore end; it is one continuous rail), a Specter CQB sling, Magpul VHG, original military STG-58 flash hider, and PRK bullet button. It will come with four 10/20 round mags and two 5 rounders. The 10/20 mags have been blocked and the base plates were epoxied. Also included is 160 loose rounds of British Radway Green NATO surplus .308 ammo with the ammo can. 

Possibly interested in a partial trade for handguns and C&R rifles/shotguns."

The line between main production and the Performance Center, the Smith & Wesson Pro Series represents the next step from standard models. These firearms are offered with a variety of enhancements yet still remain true to ""stock."" Bringing competition specifications and features to factory models, the Pro Series offer that ready-to-go package while still maintaining production line integrity. It has adjustable sights.

The flat barrel is a beautiful look - and really makes it stand out above the entire revolver crowd. Additional extras:
•	2 speed loaders ~$15/ea
•	Custom S&W wood grip ~$55
•	Custom aftermarket grip - amazing @ over $100
•	Great Leather padded holster ~$75

It has been very well kept and is ready to be your daily carry pistol.  Crossbreed holsters makes an IWB holster for this pistol with the Laser Guard.  I never got around to getting one.

At this price you're essentially getting the rifle for 300 with 150 in extras. I got this rifle in an auction at a great price, with the intent to do a custom build, but I just got a .308 tactical that I've decided to use. Please no lowballers if the price isn't what you like I'm sure you'll find something Chinese made that'll throw the same bullets. Open to trades on anything in .45 or anything that shoots shells(2 3/4, 3, 3 1/2)

These are original Chinese ""Easy-Load"" type drums that fit all AK47/Mac90 type 7.62 caliber rifles that use double stack magazines. These drums attaches to the rifle exactly like a normal magazine would. No alterations to the rifle are necessary. Simply drop in all 100 rounds of ammo, close the cover, wind up the spring, and you are ready to fire. A wind-up drum is a great way to store a loaded magazine long-term without the worry of a compressed spring loosing its ability to deliver enough push to empty a magazine.  With the drum, you don't wind up the spring until you are ready to use the drum. Both of these drums are in very good to excelent condition, no damage whatsoever. I acquired them in a trade several (5+) years ago, used them once and have been in storage since. I guess my loss could end up being your gain, for the right price of course. These guys are rare (pre-ban) so please only serious offers will be considered and when these are gone, you'll have a hard time finding any more. Make sure you can own these in your state before bidding. I can be reached via text at 8three0-five9one-eight8zerotwo to answer any questions that you may have ... Asking $550 for both, $275 for one, OBO ... FTF Cash Sale in the San Antonio area or could ship on your dime!!  Free shipping if you buy both or $20 for one ...
