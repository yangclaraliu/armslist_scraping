As new...even though it is almost as old as me. This 586 No Dash has no ""M"" stamp (preferred by most collectors). It also has nice target grips with footballs and has a presentation box, but no liner in the box. Similar revolvers condition wise to mine sell on GB between $1025 and $1100 with no presentation case at all, and $1200 plus with.  Will I ship? Sure...my FFL to yours at your expense.  Price is firm. Will I consider trade? I am downsizing my gun collection and putting the money in my children's college fund.  My oldest has 3 years before college...so no rush. This revolver would be a show piece in most collections and is a must see for any true Smith and Wesson collectors.  You won't see one of these in this condition under $1250.  I suppose if you buy and sell guns for profit there is room here to make 15-20% pretty easily.The second photo is a screenshot of the a similar revolver in ALMOST as good of condition with no presentation box that recently sold on GB. This is the lowest one comparable has sold in the last year for reference only."

Contracted by the Russian government and never honored do to the new politics after the Russian Revolution leaving Remington and Westinghouse on the hook over several million rifles and millions of dollars. These two rifles were actually delivered and issued. One is manufactured by Remington Armory (1917) and the other is New England Westinghouse (1915). Both are in good shape for their age and still in their original m1891 configuration. I have fired them and they still function well.The Reminton is a post WW1 arsenal refurb that has been refinished and action renumbered to the bolt. The Remington stamp is weak from the refurb process, but still legible. No import marks or any other stamps that don't belong. Finish is very nice minus some freckling and light handling wear. Displays very well. Bore is strong with good rifling, but a little dark. Two main issues are the missing cleaning rod and rear sight leaf spring is damaged. Both parts are still widely available online.The Westinghouse still retains it's original GI finish and walnut stock. It was later captured by Finland and has their ""SA"" stamp along with the renumbered sight graduations and sling swivels. It is fully intact and functions well for being 103 years old. It's a typical Finn mixmaster, but has all pre-1928 parts. Rifle is counterbored about 1/4 inch with strong rifling. Has an 80's era CAI import stamp on the bbl. Great piece of history and has the charachter to show it.Selling both as a package deal for $800. May consider trades of equal value or partial with cash."

The original buttplate has been replaced with a soft rubber one to reduce the kick from the recoil. There are numerous scratches and scrapes, as well as some minor chipping and minor cracks throughout the wood stock. There is also a hairline crack in the top of the stock where it meets the receiver. Despite this wear/tear, the stock is beautifully carved, and features a pair of swivel rings and a leather carry strap. This rifle features a bolt-action, with a safety switch set directly behind it, as well as a load indicator on the rear of the bolt to let you know when a round is in the rifle's chamber, and ready to fire. The rifle's chamber is in good shape, with only minor scratching, and little to no signs of rusting, or pitting. The barrel DOES show some minor pitting, and has a front sight at the end.

The trigger has an integrated safety, and the pull is short, light, and crisp. An easily engaged thumb safety backs up the trigger safety, and a visual inspection port allows you to see if the chamber is loaded at a glance. A magazine disconnect prevents the gun from firing without a magazine fully inserted in the frame. A checkered, glass-filled nylon grip frame, finished in turquoise, contains an aluminum insert, which the slide rides on. The slide is made from hardened alloy steel. The LC9s semi-automatic pistol has a sleek design with rounded edges and corners, enabling it to conceal well, while minimizing the chances of catching on clothing, holsters, or purses when drawing the weapon. Low profile, 3-dot, steel front and rear sights are dovetailed to the slide; the rear sight is drift adjustable. All standard LC9 accessories, including holsters and laser sights, are compatible with the LC9s.

This was made by Providence Tool Co in Providence, Rhode island. Most likely in 1871 (the very last ones were made in 1871). The serial number is 112657. If you do some research, you will find that there was a book written in 1978 that listed the highest serial number at that time ever recorded. It is about 40 numbers LOWER than this one. Here is the best part. This is one of 350 of these carbines shipped to the South Carolina militia in 1877. South Carolina started lettering the butt plates of the carbines in 1881. The ones that were still in service. So how many ACTUALLY remain today? I'm betting less than half the original number. Thus the S.C. marking on the top part of the butt plate. I have seen 3 others and the markings are identical. This carbine is 100% correct and original! Has some initials carved into the stock, looks like C.T. Rand to me. Could be the soldier who it was issued to. I figure I'll leave that geneology search to the buyer. If you can make some brass and reload some rounds for this, it is definitely still very shootable. Not sure if Buffalo Bore has ammo available for it or brass. One of these carbines sold at James D. Julia's auction in 2004 for $1,495. That's 14 years ago! $1,100 plus actual shipping or state tax in VT. Email me at REDACTED or call Shawn at REDACTED. ANTIQUE, SO NO FFL (EXCEPT WHERE REQUIRED). I DO REQUIRE A COPY OF YOUR ID.

This Rifle comes in Good, Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It has minor signs of wear/tear only, which can be attributed to the fact that it was well taken care of, and only used/fired infrequently. This Winchester Model 70 is free of all major flaws/defects, such as severe scratches, scrapes, chips, cracks, bends, breaks, dents, dings, nicks, cuts, rips, tears, staining, or discoloration. This rifle features a soft rubber butt with the Winchester brand name stamped onto it. The rifle also features a black synthetic stock, which shows only a very small handful of minor scratches and scrapes. The receiver and barrel are also in good shape, with no scratches, scrapes, rusting, pitting, or staining either on the outside, or inside (of both the receiver AND the barrel!). This rifle DOES NOT have any iron sights, however, it has been fitted with rails that allow a scope to be easily attached. It also has a safety switch, and load indicator set in the rear of the receiver/bolt. This is a fantastic rifle that would make a great addition to anybody's collection.
