Also has a new Hogue grip not the stock grip that is in the picture.  I would say this rifle is in over all good shape, the only flaw is it has an older barrel that is showing its age.  It still shoots fine.  This would make a nice first AR15 or even a good back up for someone that wants to have an extra around.

The Huldra Mark IV Tactical EVO features the Samson Evolution Series Free Float forearm that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block. Two accessory rails come standard with the rifle and can be reconfigured easily to adapt the hand guard to your needs and can also be mounted at 45 degree offsets. The ergonomics of this rail set a new standard. The anti-rotational tabs make this handguard all the more impressive by virtually eliminating the possibility of the rail losing alignment even under hard use. And the QD sling mount that is included just makes this package that much more outstanding. 

The Adams Arms piston system is one piece and is accessible from the front of the piston block. Iron sight optics (not included) are designed to be affixed to the sturdy piston block which is attached to the barrel, as opposed to attaching front sights to our ;ompetitor's inherently flexible rails that have to be frequently removed and reattached. The Adams Arms patented piston system will run cleaner, cooler, and longer. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process making them incredibly hard. 

The Magpul CTR butt stock is designed for light, fast action. The CTR features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability and an ambidextrous QD sling mount. A standard rubber butt pad provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage, even with body armor or modular gear. The Ergo Grip is solid and comfortable. 

The Melonited corrosive resistant Chrome/Molly/Vanadium 41/50 barrel provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receiver is machined from high quality mil-spec 70/75-T6 aluminum forgings and hard coat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 70/75-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed Chevrons for improved control. 

What really sets this rifle apart is the size of the barrel. It is 14.5 inches. We have permanently affixed an elongated flash hider to give you the benefits of a shorter barrel, without the expense and hassle of obtaining an ATF tax stamp. Not only that, our flash hider is “reduced radius”, allowing a gunsmith or armorer to remove the piston block for servicing the weapon. The elongated, reduced radius, permanently attached muzzle device gives you the legally required overall barrel length."

I'd probably value the rifle with 2 mags at $650 
The ammo at $120.00
3 Mags at $60.00 Maybe $75.00
The quad rail $50.00
Grip Pod knock off $30-35.00

Zombie ammo can- $10.00
Sling- $5-10.00
So that comes up to around $950.00

I am asking $1250.00 because of supply and demand.  Ammo is back ordered to freaking June at least and who is to say if it'll go back down in price, mags doubled in price, and who knows if you'll be able to own this in a month?  That was a rhetorical question.  Now I might be price gouging, but not as bad as Mr. Wise-ass passing off a $700.00 Bushmaster for a $1700.00 Black Rain Ordinance AR15 in terms of price.  My rant is over. Back to business.  

Package price is $1250.00 I do not want to split it up.  

If I can't sell it or trade it, I'm going to do a crappy camo paint job on it and sell it on gun broker for $1400.00

I will try and give fair value for trades, but consider this.  ""Assault"" styled weapons and high cap ""evil"" pistols went up in price.  You're average smith and 1911 hasn't been affected very much and you will still be able to buy those in the near future.  That can't be said about my AK."

To make the first 20 gauge 1100's, they actually made them using the 12 gauge frame and receiver. This resulted in an unusually heavy(for a 20 gauge), but impeccably balanced gun. Skeet shooters, regardless of age, experience, and budget love this gun for the resulting small amount of recoil (which makes it fantastic on doubles) and legendary balance. If you do any skeet shooting and/or dove  hunting, like a low recoil gun, or want a low recoil platform on which to teach your wife and/or kids, you can't go wrong with this beautiful and rare gun. Carry soft case included.

Being a skeet gun, it's got a fixed skeet choke. On paper, the barrel is supposed to be 26 inches, but it actually measures 25.75 inches. I've shot quail, trap and skeet and never felt the need for a different barrel as long as the proper load is used. 

Impeccably cared for by my father since the 70's, and I learned to shoot on it in the 90's., but it really hasn't seen much action since. I recently did a complete tear down and found that it only needed a new o-ring, which I replaced. It has no rust at all, the finish is remarkable for its age, and has no noticeable dings or scratches."

It now has the intended fixed blade rear sight. The finish on the frame isnt great, and the finish on the slide is very good. All the springs have been replaced with fresh East German spares or upgraded Wolff springs when available. The recoil spring is stronger than stock to protect the frame and reduce felt recoil. This is not the fanciest Mak in the world, but its a hard worker, and a good choice as a carry piece so that nicer collectible Maks can stay home in the safe. When I got it a couple years ago, I replaced any worn working parts inside, and it has had less than 300 rounds through it since then. Comes with 1 magazine, but I will sell you more for $25 each if you'd like. Online and at gunshows, they are $30.

The 22 conversion kit is awesome. Its one of the Bulgarian imports that came through Makarov.com. Its a barrel sleeve insert with retention nut, a light aluminum slide, and a light recoil spring. Comes with 2 magazines. The magazine finish was never very nice, but it runs well. The black paint on the slide has a couple scuffs, but overall is in good shape. These kits are really nice for saving money and having fun, but also important for teaching folks of all ages to use handguns. The reduced noise and recoil train the hand not to fear live ammo, and by changing the gun back over to 9x18, the new shooter experiences only a slight increase in felt recoil and noise from the same gun they have already become familiar with."

This is brand new in the box.  Don't let the name fool you, this is not a mini, it is a full size folding knife.  I carried a mini reflex on patrol every day for over 15 years, I used it and abused it and finally broke the blade trying to force it through some thick dried bamboo (overly confident and stupid).  I sent it in to Benchmade and they replaced it with this brand new knife, same model, the only difference between this one and my old one is a safety lock you can use (or not), which I actually like.  I LOVE this knife but I want to put the money toward a handgun and I figure the best time to sell it is while it is still new in the box.  The combo blade is awesome, the serrated edge is wicked and will stay sharp (trust me).  IF you are eligible to buy an automatic knife from Benchmade you will find this is priced below their retail of $210.00  

Check out the specs at http://www.benchmade.com/products/2550

Pictured is this model knife from an internet source.  If you are interested and want I will be glad to take pictures of my actual knife and send them to you before you buy.

Colt carbines are the absolute benchmark for patrol and service rifles, with some of the tightest tolerances and best accuracy in the industry. These guns are some of the most durable, reliable and sought after AR rifles on the market. DO NOT buy that bottom-shelf DPMS or parts-bin frankenstein gun for more money before considering the industry standard, factory built rifle.

Perfect in every way, new and unfired. ZERO visible wear, no imperfections whatsoever. Comes with original box, original unopened Colt accessory pack and 1 new Magpul 30rd pmag.

Price is $2200 with everything, $1850 without the EOTech.

Face to face deal anywhere near Fort Collins, no paper, no waiting, no drama. You must be a CO resident and legal to possess firearms. No criminals or thugs please. Buy it face to face while you still can.

I would like to sell this FTF with Missouri residents only with a valid drivers license. I might ship to an FFL if buyer pays all shipping fee's and supplies me with FFL information. I will be filling out a bill of sale that we will both sign and have copies of. I will keep it for one year, then I will dispose of it.

The Spin may be the runt in Spyderco's Little Big Knife line of folders but scores points by combining compact size and workhorse attitude. Eric Glesser of Spyderco's engineering department created the Spin to be the smallest possible folder with the largest possible cutting performance and it had to be stylish. Its 1-13/16"" (46mm) blade is high-carbon VG-10 stainless steel with a Wharncliffe profile. This shape offers a utilitarian long PlainEdge cutting surface and slightly rounded tip that works well when cutting with detail or even cleaning fingernails. The blade folds into a flat stainless steel acid etched handle that dresses it up while adding textured resistance for top-notch grip. On the back of the handle is an Integral Lock®®. This LinerLock design modification was created by custom knifemaker Chris Reeve, using the handle scale as the lock's liner. With the back portion of the handle doubling as both handle and lock, the need for internal liners is eliminated and the knife can be manufactured incredibly slim yet strong. The Spin comes with a three-screwed stainless clothing clip that positions the knife tip-down in a pocket and also offers a way to money-clip your cash or attach to a necktie."

It has great night sights, 2 magazines, Hogue grips, a very nice soft case, and 150 rounds of 124gr ammo (which is impossible to find or hugely inflated at the moment) to get you started. Unlike the P95, this is made of metal, not plastic. This is by far the easiest gun to do Mozambique drills that I have ever shot, the weight and balance reduce the recoil to virtually nothing. Since the introduction of the P95, and even more so, the SR9, fans have been scooping these up since it was the last to be designed under Bill Ruger with his his ideology of design and overengineering. If you're looking for an affordable, well balanced 9mm, and don't want to have to go ammo hunting, this is your gun."

This rifle is set up by a Gunsmith, not a hack, all screws are in great condition. Glass is in Excellent condition, and the round count so far is 12 Rounds, so it hasn't been broken in well. You may want to use the rest of the ammo to break it in and get a feel for the rifle.
Scope has been leveled and rings trued on the action. Everything was assembled with a Torque Wrench so it is exactly how it supposed to be for long range varmint hunting or target shooting. 

Photos below are to show condition of the screws and close up of the Matte finish

817,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1009817,For Sale:  SR-25 MK11 Mod 0,"NWOKC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma","$ 13,000","Listed On: Sunday, February 24, 2013",Rifles,Knights Armament                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"The SR 25 rifle (Stoner Rifle, model 25) was developed by Reed Knight (owner of Knights Armament Co) and Eugene Stoner (designer of M16 and Stoner 63 rifles among other things) during early 1990s. In essence, the SR 25 was the AR-15 rifle scaled up to shoot 7,62x51 / .308 Win ammunition, with up to 60% of parts of new rifle being interchangeable with standard AR-15 components. This rifle sold well among civilian shooters who needed an accurate semi-automatic rifle in 7,62 / .308 caliber for hunting or target shooting. This rifle also found a favor among US Military - during early 1990s it was adopted by US Navy SEAL groups, as Mark 11 Model 0 sniper rifle system; use of Mk.11 Mod.0 rifle was later extended to US Marine Corps. Mark 11 Model 0 rifle system included the semi-automatic SR-25 rifle, a quick-detachable sound suppressor, also developed by Knights Armament Co, Leupold Vari-X Mil-dot telescope sight, Harris bipod, 20-round magazines and other necessary accessories. In 2005, a modified version of the SR-25 / Mk.11 rifle won US Army Semi-Automatic Sniper Rifle (XM110 SASR) competition, and today it is being issued to US Army snipers, in attempt to replace venerable M24 Sniper Weapon System. A certain controversy exists about this replacement, as some experts doubt that Knight's semi-automatic XM110 rifle could equal long-range accuracy of the bolt-action M24. However, Knights Armament Co claims that SR-25 is capable of 0.5 MOA accuracy with match ammo, and in the field Mk.11 or XM110 rifle can proved accurate and rapid fire out to 600 meters or even more, depending on particular circumstances and proficiency of operator. Use of quick-detachable silencer / sound moderator also has several benefits, the most obvious being concealment of the operator's position, as silencer decreases the sound of gunshot and completely eliminates muzzle flash. Another, less obvious benefit is that silencer also acts as an effective muzzle brake, decreasing recoil and thus permitting faster follow-up shots.

All rifles built on SR-25 platform share same basic action, which is based on AR-15 / M16 system. This is a gas-operated system with direct-impingement gas drive, which has no gas piston. Instead, powder gases are fed from the barrel and through a stainless-steel tube back into the receiver, and then into the cavity inside bolt carrier through the gas key. Inside the bolt carrier, powder gases push it back against the bolt, thus first causing the bolt to rotate and unlock from the barrel, and then to cycle the action. The rotary bolt has 7 radial lugs and improved extractor. Both upper and lower receiver halves are made from aircraft grade aluminum alloy, and connected by cross-pins. There is no ""forward assist"" button on the SR-25 rifles; the brass defelector is present. Barrels are of match class quality, and enclosed into free-floated forearm, fitted with Knights-made and designed Picatiny rails system. Because of AR-15-style recoil buffer, which extends rearwards fro the receiver, SR-15 cannot be fitted with folding buttstock; most rifles are fitted with fixed butt, while SR-25 carbines are fitted with telescoping buttstock. Trigger is also of match grade, fully adjustable.

Military versions of the SR-25, known as Mk.11 Mod.0 (USN / USMC) and XM110 (US Army) have some differences from civilian rifles. First of all, these rifles are fitted with proprietary sound moderator / silencer quick mount, located on the barrel just in front of the gas block. These rifles also finished to military specifications, and equipped with back-up iron sights (marked up to 600 meters and installed on folding bases). XM110 rifle also features a different buttstock, which is adjustable for length of pull, as well as different style forend rail system and a flash hider on the barrel. Military rifles are usually issued along with Harris bipod, Leupold variable-power 3,5-10X sniper scope, and a number of other accessories, including soft and hard carrying case.

I am offering a complete AR Package.   This package has basically everything you could want/need and is turn-key ready to go (as you will read).

Colt’s rifles are the only rifles available to sportsmen, hunters and other shooters that are manufactured in the Colt factory and based on the same military standards and specifications as the United States issue Colt M16 rifle and M4 carbine. Colt customers want the best, and none of Colt’s competitors can match the quality, reliability, accuracy and performance built into every Colt rifle.

Throughout the world today, Colt’s reliability, performance, and accuracy provide our Armed Forces the confidence required to accomplish any mission. Colt’s new LE6920MP-B shares many features of its combat proven brother, the Colt M4. The heart of this new carbine is its 16.1” chrome lined barrel.  With a 1 in 7” twist, ammunition selection is virtually unlimited. Colt teamed up with Magpul Industries to outfit this carbine with the most highly sought after accessories. Magpul MOE handguards, MOE carbine stock, MOE pistol grip (with storage compartment), MOE vertical grip and a Magpul Back-up Sight all come as standard equipment on this exceptional carbine.

Includes: (1) NIB, never fired Colt LE6920MP-B with 16"" 1:7 twist barrel, (1) 30rd magazine, cleaning kit, sling, and manual.

Accessories Included:   400 rounds of ammunition, (2) additional 30rd magazines, (1) Vortex Diamondback 3-9x40 Dead-hold BDC scope, Butler Creek flip-open caps, Burris R.E.P.R quick detach mount, 2-piece quad rail for the Colt AR, rail covers, rail mount fore end grip with storage, and a tactical gun case.   All items are brand new except the case but it’s in perfect, like new condition.

The scope has been pre sighted on my personal AR using a bore sighter at 100yards.   The scope will need minor final sighting on the Colt with live ammo but should be within a couple inches.   The included 100 rounds of match ammo should help you with this.   Ammo is hard to get at a reasonable price right now.   I figured bore sighting should help you conserve your ammo so you can use it for a better purpose.

The Burris mount allows the rear flip up sight to remain in place, and the front sight is not visible at 3 or 9 power.   I included a picture of that.   If you want to drop the scope there are two latches to remove the scope/base in seconds without tools.    It includes both smooth and picatinny rail ring tops and the Burris forever warranty.

Included is a quad rail for mounting lights or what ever accessories you desire....    The 2-piece rail is sized for the Colt AR.   I included (3) rail covers and a fore end grip –all new in their packages.

I'm asking for $2,500.00 Price is firm and am not looking for trades and i can ship to anywhere so Far you have FFL  Thanks for looking"
