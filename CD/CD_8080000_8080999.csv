Like the S3G, the SD-3G has a shortened pull length and a lightning-quick reset to give it a unique, hybrid trigger pull that is a cross between a traditional two-stage and single-stage trigger while still retaining the safety and robustness of a two-stage combat trigger. The SD-3G’s flat trigger bow further enhances the trigger’s performance by reducing the perceived pull weight and improving the trigger’s tactile feedback to the operator making it ideally suited for 3 Gun competition shooting."

This is a World War 2 Italian Carcano M38 rifle. This gun was originally 6.5mm but was sent to Finland with a batch that was re-arsenaled and changed to 7.36 x 51mm. This is the only rifle ever made that uses this caliber so it is very rare and hard to find ammo or parts/accessories for. Included are two of the original stripper clips and two 20 round boxes of new production, non corrosive, soft tipped ammo. This is an excellent specimen of a very rare rifle with unfindable, ""deemed obsolete"" ammo. This rifle shoots excellent and I have gotten 4 inch groups at 1000 yards using the iron sights with this gun. A great deal at $400.00. Call Spencer at 540-871-7736"

No functional or cosmetic issues Semi-AutoRound Count: +/- 1,200Caliber: .223 / 5.56 NATO16"" Barrel (Melonite Coated) with 1:7 twistLength: 32"" Stock Collapsed, 35"" Stock ExtendedWeight: 6.45lbsAnodized 7075-T6 Aluminum Upper & Lower ReceiversChrome plated Bolt Feed: Standard AR Magazine (Steel, Pmag, Hexmag, etc..)My opinion:This weapon system is excellent for individuals new to the AR world looking to buy a quality rifle. This is not a ""flashy""rifle. It is a no-nonsense quality rifle with great functionality, as well as every necesssary feature.  The accuracy is hands down the most impressive aspect of this rifle (I have deployed it from as close as 7 yards back to the 200 yard range with no deviations in accuracy. Adjustible stock allows for easy manipulation and aquisition of target. In regards to reliability, the ONLY feeding issues i have expierenced were operator-induced during training revolutions / drills. Personally, I give this rifle a 5/5 rating. Its ergonomic, accurate, durable, and reliable as hell.  It is manufactured by second largest manufacturer in America.   Saying it performs is an understatement.  Design and Price Point targeted towards entry-level customers. On that note;There is no dust cover or forward assist. These are unnecessary features that allow for an affordable price point.Picatinny top rail is optic ready. I have removed the optic I was running (Nikon M-223, will include for additional $200.00).I have had this rifle in the rain, dirt, and mud. I've deployed it at the range, as well as hour long manhunts while navigating various terrain. Flawless functionality every time. I have no real need to sell this rifle. I have just switched to Supressed SBR as my primary system, so this one will be seeing alot of time in the safe. I'd much rather see someone get some use out of it. Cash Talks. No holds."
