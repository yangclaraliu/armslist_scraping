Instead of me repeating everything in the reviews about this rifle, I've included several links to well respected reviews and videos.
IF YOU LIVE IN NEVADA, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PRIVATE SALE AND AVOID THE $50 BACKGROUND AND TRANSFER FEES.

Here's the design's history:
-ZM Weapons in VT is the original designer and seller from 2000-2007. 
-Para USA (formerly Para-Ordinance) bought the license and sold them from 2008-2011.
-ZM took it back from Para and is gearing up production again. It will be back in production in 2-3 months as the ZM LR-300, as it was originally called when ZM sold it:
http://www.zmweapons.com/lr_rifles.htm 

-I've talked with ZM twice to make sure that nothing is changing and parts will all remain the same and available. Only the name will change back to the LR 300. 

Yankee Hill makes the stock for these rifles. There are no sights on this gun.

Great gun for the range and overall very very fun to own. If you want to get one before the supposed ban happens here's your chance. I see very few AR pistols and I have personally never seen any of these pistols in person other than my own. The last two pictures are the actual gun just send me a message and I can get more pics over to you if you need them. Being that these are very hard to find please send me a message asap if you're interested.

Best way to contact me is via email REDACTED or text my cell REDACTED.

I also have extra ammo and accessories that are available for purchase separately, let me know if you're interested.

They look good with standard forged uppers also. The price is ADCORs MSRP not due to gouging by them or us. They spent a lot of effort setting up the tooling to do billet lowers and spent a lot of labor overtime to get them out and they were expensive to produce.

I've got an CAI Romanian GP WASR 10/63. Comes with 7 30 round steel mags, 260 rounds, original sling, bayonet, and case. 
This thing has straight sights, many a watermelon and beer bottles can attest to that fact...if they weren't put out of their misery.

BAD- Previous owner decided that it was cool to chisel some custom art into the buttstock and hand guard...nothing that affects the rifle (except in asthetics) but it's there. I think it looks cool, but then again...I don't care cuz it's a Romanian WASR that was meant to be beat up. If you don't like it, then replace the stocks with a different set.

I'll let the market dictate the price.
Best offer or trade! 
Comes with everything seen in the pics.

Front sight post adjuster, 4 mag bag, ammo, rifle, bayonet, case, magazines, and sling. I'll even throw in an extra Tapco mag.

Payments- Cashiers Check, Money Order, or gun hating paypal.

Will only ship to FFL if outside of WA, if you live in western Washington, you can pick up or I can drop off...if you have a current CPL/CWP or a way to prove you are not a felon."

Although the ammo is available, these rifles are not. Very hard to find a complete S&W. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. Please just compare apples to apples. Complete M&P15R to complete M&P15R, that is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of their rare discontinued status these will continue to climb in value even after the market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson is pleased to announce the M&P15R Rifle (along with the new Upper Receiver Assembly). This new rifle is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifles come with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.

This is a BRAND NEW IN BOX Gun that has NEVER been fired, and the reason I'm selling is because I've decided to invest in a higher end piston AR which is considerably more expensive so I'm letting this go to the first $1,400

5.45x39 ammo is still available. And yes they make non corrosive ammo for slightly more for those who do not clean their guns like they should. I am including some with this sale. I included some Hornady non corrosive with this deal.

Although the ammo is available, these rifles are not. Very hard to find a complete S&W. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. Please just compare apples to apples. Complete M&P15R to complete M&P15R, that is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of their rare discontinued status these will continue to climb in value even after the market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson is pleased to announce the M&P15R Rifle (along with the new Upper Receiver Assembly). This new rifle is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifles come with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.

Per Sig's Website: The SIG516 Patrol OD comes with a Magpul MOE stock, MOE pistol grip and a Pmag in Olive Drab. As with all SIG516 Patrol rifles, the OD Green uses the SIG SAUER innovative short-stroke gas pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and allows the rifle to run cleaner and cooler. This system, along with the SIG SAUER proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of the only rifles to pass NATO’s “Over the Beach” test. A 16” chrome-lined barrel is chambered in 5.56mm NATO and is surrounded by a free-floating M1913 quad rail. The top rail is optic-ready and includes SIG SAUER flip-up iron sights."

She likes the s&w 9mm, the beretta px4 storm, beretta m9 or 92fs and that's all I know for sure. But every gun she gravitates towards is always the bi tone other than the m9.

It's a great starter gun for kids, and women, heck even grown men. It has most of the controls of a normal AR-15 rifle. I hate to let it go, but I already have a Ruger 10/22 with the BX25 mags. I not looking for trades, I think that letting this go for $700 is a fair price. You can't find it out there anymore. 

Again here are some overall specs:
It has a 16"" barrel, that's NOT threaded. The M&P has a polymer quad rails to add accessories that you can use for any AR-15 platform. It has an adjustable stock. Removable front and rear sights. You can change them to your preferences. It comes with the original box, Standard 25 round mag, manuals, and gun lock cable.

This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.

Colt's M4 Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection.
- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components
- Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm)
- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance

Also have 1000 Winchester Small pistol magnum primers, 1000 Winchester small rifle primers, 3000 CCI Large Rifle primers and 1000 CCI Large rifle magnum primers and lastly a box of 1000   45 cal. 185 FMJ bullets.  Oh, and also a Lyman vibratory case tumbler.   I am still digging for more stuff.  Would love to trade this whole package deal for a pistol or rifle of comparable value.  I added up the new price for all the bigger reloading equipment pieces($539), retail price for primers when I bought them($240-not the gouging prices people are trying to get now) and the box of bullets($185) and the total was $964.  The components should hold their origonal value, while understandably the equipment is worth something less than new.  I guess to sum it up if I were to value the equipment at 50% of new and the components at 100% of new I would be in the ball park of $694 value for trading.  Cash always talks so I can negotiate.  Right now I would really prefer to trade for a pistol or rifle as a package deal and not separate.

Up for auction is a very nice Browning Model 71 lever action in .50 Alaskan, These rifles were originally chambered in .348 Winchester. Gunsmiths wanted the Browning 71 due to its durability and strength when converting rifles to 50 Alaskan. This rifle has a half octagon half round barrel measuring at 34"", an all steal Schnabel forend, the sights have not been clipped and the engraving on the barrel and action are beautiful. the stock also has a hidden compartment for holding 4 rounds. The .50 Alaskan is a wildcat cartridge developed by Harold Johnson and Harold Fuller of the Kenai Peninsula of Alaska in the 1950s. Johnson based the cartridge on the .348 Winchester in order to create a rifle capable of handling the large bears in Alaska. Design: Harold Johnson necked out the .348 Winchester case to accept a .510"" diameter bullet, and Harold Fuller developed the barrel, marrying a .50 caliber barrel to an old Winchester Model 1886 rifle. Since the rifle was designed for use on Alaska’s great bears, Johnson cut 720-grain (47 g) boat-tail .50 BMG bullets in half, seating the 450-grain (29 g) rear half upside down in the fireformed .50-caliber case. It didn’t take Johnson long to find out that the 450-grain truncated shaped “solid” would shoot through a big brown bear from any direction, claiming in 1988, “I never recovered a slug from a bear or moose, no matter what angle the animal was shot at. Harold’s favorite load in the .50 Alaskan was 51.5 grains (3.34 g) of IMR-4198 with a Barnes 400-grain (26 g) flatnose ,jacketed bullet for about 2,100 ft/s (640 m/s) and just under 4,000 ft·lbf (5,400 J)of muzzle energy Shipping/handling is going to be $55 and insurance will be added at 1.75% of the item's value to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping. The price is for $2900 therefore, this item will still be subject to shipping and insurance charges. Because of additional paperwork and time to process the shipment,"
