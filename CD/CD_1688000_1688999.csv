This past Memorial Day, as I shed my tears for my fallen brothers, I decided that I was going to build a memorial to them at my home here in Belfair. 

I am looking for any riffles that I can use for this purpose. They can be old, non functioning riffles too. I'm never going to shoot them. They are just going to be encases outside in a very peaceful and beautiful spot of honor to them. If you might have a riffle or two you could donate, I'd be very appreciative. I know it's a long shot.

One last thing though: I can't drive or really leave my house. My disabilities make me pretty much home bound. I know it's a lot to ask for donated riffles, then ask for delivery too, but like I said, I know it's a long shot. 

I don't ever want to forget my fellow Marines who died or who have been wounded in service to our country.

The PMAG 30 AR/M4 GEN M2 MOE Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M4 compatible magazine that offers a cost competitive upgrade from the aluminum USGI. It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.

In addition, durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine.

 For AR-15 / M16 type rifles, optical sights provide superior performance at longer ranges, but iron sights can be more effective for close-range engagements. However, attaching an optical sight either prevents the use of iron sights or results in a setup that produces a front sight ""shadow"" on the optical image, and/or results in problematic transitions from optical to backup iron sights. Not anymore. Dueck Defense Rapid Transition Sights (RTS) provide shooters with the quickest possible transition between longer- and closer-range target acquisition, greatly increasing their efficiency and effectiveness in battle and competition. Designed by Barry Dueck Director of SureFire's Suppressor Division and a top 3-Gun shooter these sights mount directly to a weapon's Picatinny rail, offset from center by approximately 45°. This unique offset position makes transitioning from optical to iron sights simply a matter of quickly canting the weapon with your wrists and locking on to the target. There's no removing a hand from the weapon or making a manual adjustment, and no cluttered field of vision or iron sights blocking the optical sight. Just smooth, quick transitions that could mean the difference between winning or losing a competition, or more importantly a gunfight."

I have fired only 14 rounds and cleaned it.

NOTE: In any email please include your name and your phone number. If I cannot verify you, I will not respond to your email and will immediately delete it. The reason I do business in this fashion is to not waste time in dealing with anyone seeking to con others. You must be in Arkansas and must come to Mayflower. Here are the details of this shotgun:

This has a factory pistol grip, so it could be converted by a Class II manufacturer into an even shorter package with only a $5 tax stamp as an AOW. In the past, in my experience, factory pisyol grips in 870 were very difficult to find in this configuration, and Sports Academy had one, and I grabbed it. 

Decided to spend funds on some other priorities so I will sell it for $419. FTF. A copy of your DL must be exhibited to me at the time of sale: good guys only.

Have you been lucky enough to find the ammo type you need, only to be told you are limited to 1, 2, or if lucky 3 boxes.

I might have your AMMO solution, in quantity, one stop.

I also have other brands, types and calibers available, so it doesn't hurt to ask if you don't see it listed."

Please don't make any trade offers or half trade half cash offers. Bill of Sale IS required for my personal records. Please have a Valid State ID/DL to purchase this handgun.

I am selling my 5"" Kimber Warrior. I've had it for a few months and it's just collecting dust. I never have time to go to the range and I own 100 acres so whenever I have time, I just shoot my 22's (none of which are for sale). 

It's .45ACP, cleaned after every time I've finished firing it. They MSRP for $1,512 on Kimber's Site but I purchased mine from Vance's for $1,415 + Tax = $1,510.51. I've fired MAYBE 500 rounds through it. Kimber is an AMAZING handgun manufacturer and their Quality is unparalleled, if you can't afford a Wilson.

My asking Price is $1400 BECAUSE it comes with, in addition to all the stock items, 5 additional mags. Three 7+1's, One 10+1, and one 8+1. Not to mention it also comes with an open carry holster. The brand name of the holster escapes me, but it's VERY good. The grips are VZ Grips and are amazing, I put them on myself and I love them.

This is a package deal, so everything must be purchased. Seeing that each mag is roughly $25 and the Holster was $40, that brings my used Kimber's value at $1,235 which is actually a very good price for a Kimber Warrior in this condition.

Anyone who purchases this, can also purchase .45ACP target ammo from me. I have boxes of 50 and depends on how many boxes you want to buy, there are discounts involved. I have 750 rounds, so I have plenty upon request for sale.

Thank you."

I'd be selling this scope for at least $100, except for two reasons:  First, the tripod and mounting foot is not included.  Second, while at the range last year, another shooter's spent casing from his mini-14 struck the scope, and make a crack that appears from about the 9 o'clock to the 11 o'clock position in the view.  That crack is completely inconsequential to the function of the scope, and I continued using it at the range as recently as last week.

Unfortunately, as this scope does not meet my needs for shooting beyond 200 yards, I bought another spotting scope, and no longer need this one.

The bottom photo shows the crack as well as the shoreline of an island about 1 mile away.

This scope has served me well, and for the shooter who shoots 200 yards and under, the scope will save a lot of walking back and forth to and from the target to see your bullet holes."

It works with any SR22 base plate and reuses your stock magazine spring. Zero feed issues just more bullets per mag at the same size. The only drawback is you loose your side tab on the body of the mag, (which locks the slide back on the last round) but it will lock back on the follower on the last round to let you know it's empty, on most pistols, some ammo brands will not allow this due to slide speed. The upside is the new material is slicker than stock and you won't need the tab to aid in loading anymore.

The 300 AAC Blackout (7.62x35mm) squeezes 30 caliber firepower into the traditional AR-15 envelope, and is available in either subsonic or supersonic ammunition varieties to serve a multitude of purposes. All that is needed to harness the enhanced performance of the 300 Blackout is a simple barrel swap; the bolt, carrier, magazine and all other components remain the same as those used in a traditional 223 Rem/5.56 NATO rifle. 

Flat shipping is $17.00. If you are interested I will send PayPal invoice.

This 16"" Stainless Steel Barrel features a lightweight external contour and 5/8""-24 threaded muzzle for easy installation of your preferred flash hider, muzzle brake and/or sound suppressor. The barrel's Carbine Length Gas Port position offers the best compromise for most shooters since it is compatible with the majority of supersonic and subsonic ammunition in suppressed or unsuppressed rifles. Cycling issues can occur when shooting some subsonic ammunition without a sound suppressor in place due to a lack of gas port pressure. Barrel extension and locator pin are both included and factory installed. The gas block area is contoured to fit 1"" low profile gas blocks, and will not work with the longer 2"" gas blocks.

Made in USA
With 50 rounds of .22 ammo.
Call REDACTED
The PT22 is a .22LR semi-automatic pistol produced by Taurus and features an 8+1 round capacity magazine. The PT22 is often viewed as a Taurus copy of the Beretta 21 Bobcat due to having a similar ""tip up"" barrel. In fact this small pistol is very different in design and function from the Beretta. The PT22 is a cast steel frame and slide, manufactured in Florida, USA. It has a spur-less hammer, and a long but smooth double action only (DAO) trigger. The ""tip up"" barrel is useful in that the first round may be chambered directly into the barrel, and the operator does not have to ""pull back"" or ""rack"" the slide. Retracting the slide is difficult due to the heavy spring required in this blow-back action. The grip feel of the PT22 is ""fat"", and fills a normal-sized hand. This width may make the PT22 difficult for some smaller handed people to hold comfortably. The function and reliability of the PT22 is passable, with occasional failures to feed (but fewer than most Beretta 21s). The Taurus PT22 is able to fire most .22LR cartridges, including CCI Stingers."

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1688998,For Sale:  2009 Hoyt Katera XL,"NW, Wichita, Kansas",$ 400,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 29, 2013",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am selling my Hoyt Katera XL. This bow is a 27.5"" draw and adjustable between 60-70 lbs. I bought this bow new in 2009 and it has been awesome. New Winner's Choice strings and cables from Diamond Archery this year. No cam lean. This bow is rated at 330 fps and shoots like a dream. It Is An Absolute Tack Driver!

This  bow draws a tad long.  I am really a 29"" draw and this one pulls more like a 28.25"".  I usually prefer a little shorter draw for stability.  The current set up would be perfect for a person drawing 28"" - 28.5"".  This cam is non adjustable which is part of the reason the Z3 cam is one of Hoyt's all time best.  A new upper cam can be purchased for $50-75 online for any draw length.

The price listed includes the bow, stabilizer, peep, quick quiver (three arrow) and string silencers.

I have a spot-hogg Hunter sight (pre wrap) on it now, which I bought for $200. This sight is top of the line as it is virtually indestructable and micro adjustable including 3rd axis adjustments. It hasn't slipped from zero once. I would include this for $50

The bow also has a QAD ultra rest - hd pro series rest. I just added this rest before last deer season ($140). It is the most accurate, quietest rest on the market and if it goes with the bow, I'll just have to buy the same one for my next bow. I'll include this rest for $80 if you want it. Otherwise I am more than happy to keep it.

This bow is much better than all of the mid line bows you can buy at Cabelas or Gander right now for a similar price. It is just as fast, quieter, more accurate and will last longer."
