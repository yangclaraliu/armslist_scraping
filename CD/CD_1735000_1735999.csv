I inherited this great revolver from my uncle who bought is new in the early '70's.

It is a High Standard W-105 Durango 9 shot western style .22 revolver. These are double action pistols that have a swing cylinder and have the appearance of a single action.

The High Standard, 22 lr caliber ""Durango"" is somewhat scarce with a 4 inch barrel, brass plated grip frame and the rest of the gun is blue. The blue is in good shape, it doesn't show much brass, and the wood is really nice.
The durango doesn't come up for sale often and in this shape sells on-line for $350 or more. At a collector auction a really nice example in box went for over $1000!.

I am including 100 rounds of .22 LR and asking $275."

THE FIREARM PICTURED IS NOT FOR SALE ONLY THE CONVERSION KIT

You will not find a brand new kit like this anywhere - there is not a scratch, scuff, mark, or flaw on anything.  Quickly convert your rifle into a VERY FUN and head turning custom piece.

The Shroud:  It fits on the stock Barrel to replace the screw-cap to give even an original stock AR-7 a very aggressive, attractive look and is functional as a heat shield.  This shroud is made of outstanding steel construction and head-and shoulders better than the ones you can currently buy that have the round vent holes...this is NOT a steel pipe with threaded end and holed srilled into it, this is a well made and gunsmith quality item.  

The Stock:  A very solid constructed fully adjustable stock with pistol grip that attaches to the AR-7 action (Henry and previous models) with the enclosed screw and washer.  Converts in seconds!  It is not only very fun and functional, but is a great item to have if you are using your firearm for home defense, it allows you to keep the rifle assembled yet keeps it compact in size for your safe/closet.  You will not find this stock anywhere in brand new condition like this one.  It has Marshall Arms, Inc. on the stock.  The ergonomics are perfect and provide superior comfort and accuracy - beyond the factory stock by lightyears!

The Paperwork: The original paperwork/instruction are included - very rare to have this.

I will consider selling the items separate:  $50 for shroud and $150 for stock and paperwork.

I cannot attach more photos due to the file size limit on here but email me and i will gladly send more to you if you are interested.

You are basically operating a business with no license, no FFL from the BATF, and you aren't paying state or local taxes on your sales.
You may get away with it a few times, but if you do it on a regular basis and attract too much attention, the IRS and BATFE just might catch on.

Besides the legality aspects, you are being assholes to the legal, legitimate businesses (especially the small local gun stores). They can't even get any sizable inventory to sell because it disappears from the larger stores that get the priority shipments, and it's all on the private individual market.
If you want to sell ammo do it the right way and get the proper licensing and certification like legitimate business owners do.
Otherwise get a 2nd job (or a job period) if you're that greedy.
It's pretty sad to imagine what it would be like if the shortage was food or gas instead of ammo.

For sale is my Springfield Loaded Stainless Steel Ultra Compact 1911 .45ACP. I purchased this gun new from Welcher's Gun Shop in Tacoma in 2009. This gun has been a great addition to my collection ever since. This gun has had about 500 rounds down the pipe and with the exception of a few rounds during the first mag fired it has functioned flawlessly. The gun is in great shape, does have some very light wear on it but its overall 98-99% condition. It has VZ Aztec grips on it, along with the orginals. This has factory night sights marked 09, the finish has rubbed off the sights a bit but not bad. I have the factory box and all of the goodies that come with it. I am asking $850 obo for this gun, I've heard that these are no longer being made but I haven't verified with SA to know for sure. There is only 1 other gun on this site that's similar and that's it. Get this while you can.

The body well long story short I have been through 3 trucks to make this one, so not all the panels are the same color, the tail gate closes and will stay shut, it needs a new handle mechanism. Doors shut and open properly and lock, same with quarter windows, it has a sliding rear window that has a new gasket.

While it would be a lot of fun to sell the Camp 10 as the ultimate zombie-whacking tool, the truth is, it actually has a lot of other uses that you just might find to be of a more immediate nature than zombie defense. Not that we’re ignoring to the coming Zombiepocalypse, mind you. We just think that the Camp 10 makes a pretty awesome camp knife and that it does a great job of whacking campsite or other outdoor chores down to size in very short order.

From clearing brush to making kindling, the Camp 10 is the ideal outdoor and survival tool. Cut, chop, slash, hack, split, scrape—just about any task you ask of it, the Camp 10 can handle. The full-tang Camp 10 is made of carbon tool steel for toughness and wear resistance. A basic black powdercoat protects the steel and makes maintenance easier.

You’ll like the secure, contoured grip of the Camp 10, too. The handle has a built-in hand guard and is drilled in both front and rear so you can attach a lanyard either place—or both—for carrying versatility. Of course, if a zombie does get up close and personal with you, then yeah, you’ll be pretty glad to have a Camp 10 in hand, too.

I know there’s at least one other like it as it gave me the idea to make this one – but aside from these two, you may never find another.

I started with an older model 10/22 with the desirable cast trigger group housing. I added a Volquartsen hammer / sear kit, a bolt hold-open plate and an extended magazine release lever.

Then came the Butler Creek folding stock in blue.

Finally, the Butler Creek Packer forearm and barrel was added. These are nowhere to be found, production discontinued years ago. I used the forearm assembly / barrel clamp, which bolts to the receiver. I cut off the nose of the folding stock to accommodate the packer forearm. I then shaped the Packer forearm as best I could to the contours of the folding stock. I admit this is a bit amateurish, but the Packer stock is a different plastic, almost a rubber-like plastic and I never could get it scratch free or matte to match the folding stock.

The barrel came from the Packer stock set. It is unfired, made by Butler Creek and the one intended to be used with this stock forearm. It has the same rubbery plastic cover with steel liner.

I added a high scope mount, Burris 1” Quick Detachable rings and a new Nikon Rimfire 3x9 scope.

All folded up, the reciver and stock and scope is about 12” long *(13” overall with scope mounted). The barrel is 16.5 inches.  Total weight is around 6 pounds.

If you could even find the Butler Creek Packer stock kit (you can’t) it would cost you the absurd amount of $900 or so to reproduce this.

Everything locks up very tight. It's not super easy to break it down, but you sure don't want a loose sloppy barrel fit either.

I will knock off $150 from the price if you do not want the scope.

I can ship to your FFL or directly to another Texas resident for $25.00. I'll need some form of ID.

People will say more than ""hello to your little friend"" when they see this one! There's no fooling around, This gun is a mobile cannon. ""What are you going to shot with that!?"" the answer is: Anything you want . This is one of the best grizzly defense guns out there. Don't just scare a bear away, Stop it dead in it's tracks. The only thing this wont stop in one shot is a tank! ( two usually does it ). If you Want REAL power from a carry gun this is the one. The 4"" model is the hardest one to find in the 500s&w guns. This is a new never owned gun from a FFL shop and in this kind of caliber new is the way to buy. 

Here is what smith & Wesson has to say.

• Most Powerful Production Revolver in the World Today
• Massive .500 S&W Magnum® Cartridge 2600 ft/lb. Muzzle Energy
• A Hunting Handgun For Any Game Animal Walking
• Recoil Tamed with Effective Muzzle Compensator
• Internal Lock
• Ultimate Defensive Carry and Dangerous Game Backup Handgun
• Easily Removeable Muzzle Compensator for Different Recoil Reduction Effects and to Accomodate Different Types of Ammunition
• Comes with 2 Compensators; 1 for Lead Bullet and 1 for Jacketed Bullet Ammunition
• Muzzle Energy Capability in Excess of 2000 ft/lb. in a 56 oz. Package

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun

It cost me $40 for 3 rifles and 2 pistols (for good measure). I was told my barrels were in excellent shape except for one. I had purchased a RRA .308 (which was suppose to low round count, custom this and that etc) in Dec. off this website from a fellow in the upstate, who proceeded to call me every name in the book after I told hi
 I was ripped off.

I told him i hadnt had it long and only had shot it but twice and only then around 30 rounds in total.

I bought this fine shotgun in Feb 2009. I am selling this gun to buy a semi-auto 12 ga.  This gun shoots phenomenal and comes with original case, papers, and three chokes.  This gun is in great shape and hopefully the new owner will take great care of it.  I have shot it less than 2000 rounds and the action is still tight.

I have very detailed photos that were scrutinized by those critiqueing this piece & can forward them to you. I have not had the $$ to have S&W's ""Roy Jinks"" send the letter on it. I know that the original grips would have been plain diamond top w/ no S&W medalian. It also was cut into a snubby at some point in it's life. It for sure has the original target sights intact. It is solid & locks up tight every time. Great condition for being about 100 years old. If this is for sure a very early or maybe the earliest serial number for a Target model in a square butt it is probobly worth a bunch, but it will take the letter. Take a gamble on a piece of S&W history. It's still a solid shooter!..$550"

Do your groups suck? 
Be honest lol. 
It might not be your fault, the damaged or worn out crown on your barrel could be responsible.
All of the pressure behind every fired round must exit the barrel evenly around the back of the bullet or it will send it wobbling or tumbling creating bad groups especially at longer distances.

Check out the before and after groups in the picture that where done with just a re-crown and no other mods or scope adjustments. I know it looks rigged but its not lol.

I don't sell anything but I can do modifications such as 90 degree target crowns, 11 degree recessed crowns, lighten triggers, modify feed ramps, barrel shorten and re-crown, barrel threading that allows for attachments such as flash hiders, legal sound suppressors, compensators and muzzle brakes that reduce felt recoil and muzzle climb etc...

My uncle bought this gun new in the early ‘70’s and passed it on to me. 
This is a W-105 “Durango” model High Standard 9 shot western style .22 revolver. This is a double action pistol with a swing out cylinder and the appearance of a classic single action.
The High Standard  .22 Durango is somewhat scarce with a 4” barrel, brass plated grip frame, and the rest of the gun in blue. The blue I in good shape, not much brass plate shows, and the wood is very nice. 
The Durango doesn’t come up for sale very often and in this shape sells at the on-line sites for $300 to $350 plus all the additional FFL and shipping charges.  One really nice example went at a collector’s auction for over $1000!

Mossberg International brings an AR-style platform shooting that has never been more fun and affordable. 
Mossberg International’s new lightweight Tactical .22 combines the look and feel of today’s AR-style platforms with Mossberg International’s reliable and affordable .22 autoloader. Taking cues from the proven 702 autoloader, the Tactical .22 matches an 18” barrel to a quad-rail forend, giving any shooter the opportunity to easily customize the Tactical .22 with lights, lasers or any number of AR accessories currently in the marketplace. The Tactical .22 is a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4” – 14.5” LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights. Other features included with the Tactical .22 are sling mounts and a 25 round magazine.

I am selling my Converted Saiga 7.62x39 Rifle, it accepts standard AK magazines and will include 5 Polymer Tapco Ak47 Magazines and 2 Steel Ak47 magazines (7 Magazines Total). Also included will be 39 boxes (780 rounds) of ammo for the gun. I will not separate the mags or ammo from the gun. The Round Count on the gun is around 250 with no failures of any kind.

To Do The Math on what I paid for things (the gun and everything was purchased before the cost of imported AK’s went through the roof, I am told what I paid is now close to dealer cost): 
$899 + Tax and Background check for the gun (2 steel mags included)
$12 Per Tapco Mag x 5 mags= $60
7.00 Per Box of Ammo x 39 Boxes=$273
Total: $1232 so after tax we will round to $1250 being conservative

I am asking $1050 for the package which I believe is fair for both parties involved. I am not the type of person to try and take advantage of my fellow gun owners because of the current price gouging, so I expect my price to be respected by not low balling me with offers.
I will not ship the gun, the transaction will be conducted face to face at a gunshop of my choosing so that both parties are comfortable with the purchasing process.
Feel Free to e-mail me with any questions, concerns or offers,

Rifle in FDE, comes with MAID grip (all accessories), Grip Pod (real not knock off), front QD attachment on rail, Magpul STR buttstock w/mil spec tube, MBUIS on rifle and Larue trigger snap sling.  

Also will include your choice of (3) black or FDE ""ladder"" rail covers and (3) Magpul generation 3 Pmags (non window) with the rifle.

All of the above for $1775 which includes shipping from either myself or my FFL direct to your FFL.

Price of $1775 does NOT include the brand new Aimpoint Micro T-1 (w/iO micro cover as shown in the second and third picture) with Larue QD 100% co-witness mount (LT751).  I will include the Micro T-1 with cover and Larue mount (also have the lower/LT661 and higher/LT660 mount I can add to the optic as well if you prefer, brand new as well) for an additional $635 (just came in after a 3 month wait).  

I prefer USPS money orders, but will take personal checks, but personal checks will be given ample time to clear before the rifle ships. 

Round count is approaching 400 rounds.

The $635 price for the T-1 micro (as mentioned, brand new) with cover and your choice of Larue mount (LT751/LT660/LT661) is ONLY if you buy the gun.

I'm somewhat familiar with the XCR platform, so if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask (first simple step in knowing if you're looking at a older XCR model perhaps without any of the newest upgrades is the trigger guard and rail system on the rifle, as if you look, you will notice differences).

Please know the gun laws in your state.  As mentioned, the rifle will be shipped directly to your FFL.  I use two different FFL's (local ""brick and mortar"" gun shops) and have no qualms with giving you their information to verify I am who I say.

Sincere thanks for looking."

Product Information
RCBS Case Trimmers are designed to be user friendly and provide very accurate results, the Trim Pro Power Case Trimmer Kit is no different. The low RPM motor delivers plenty of torque and the spring fed cutter requires no pushing or feeding pressure so ,em>cases are trimmed accurately and squarely. The spring fed cutter also allows reloaders to have their hands free while trimming so they can deburr cases or do other tasks helping to speed up the reloading process. Trimmer works with standard pilots and features a micrometer fine adjustment bushing calibrated for setting exact trim length. The positive locking handle and integral power switch make this unit simple and safe to use. One of the other great features of the Trim Pro is that RCBS has eliminated the need for the reloader to purchase different shellplates, the trimmer will hold cases with rim diameters of .250″ to .625″.

The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact-resistant polymer construction, a pop-off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floor plate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. 

This latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips, and the Impact/Dust Cover can now be snapped onto the floor plate when not in use to prevent possible loss. 


Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer
Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes.

The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines.

The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate."

p30

A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.

Variants with a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. Variants with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification* (LEM) trigger have no external decocking controls.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification (LEM) trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation—one that reduces the chance of unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third squeeze of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the pistol. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp trigger of a single action pistol.

P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode and with HK’s enhanced double action only Law Enforcement Modification trigger

A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.

Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.

    Special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates

The PMAG is a lightweight 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) AR15/M16 compatible magazine. It features an advanced impact-resistant polymer construction, a pop-off Impact/Dust Cover for storage, and an easy to disassemble design with a flared floor plate for positive magazine extraction from pouches. The PMAG 30 utilizes a resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability. 

This latest revision has been updated with a new body ribbing design which allows for better compatibility with aftermarket mag couplers, a new follower which gives even smoother loading with military stripper clips, and the Impact/Dust Cover can now be snapped onto the floor plate when not in use to prevent possible loss. 


Troy® Industries CBIR™ (Chemical, Biological, and Impact Resistant) polymer
Battlemags™. Feed lips and anti-tilt follower are reinforced for strength. A bolstered floor plate is set flush so that it will not catch on other magazines when pulled from a pouch. The Troy magazine is as sleek as it is strong. Operators will save crucial seconds when executing magazine changes.

The specially designed spine eliminates the possibility of over insertion that is common with other polymer magazines.

The Troy BattleMag is engineered to function flawlessly with all M4, M16/AR15, HK416®and FN Scar® rifles and carbines. It comes with flush and shock absorbing extended floor plate."

This scope has an adjustable objective, target turrets (¼ MOA clicks, not the current ⅛ MOA click style), matte finish and a fine crosshair reticle. This fixed 16x40mm scope works great, there are no ring marks or dents, and the lens are clean and clear. The windage and elevation adjustments track properly and hold their setting, the adjustable objective focuses out any parallax error, and the eyepiece produces sharp images. There have been NO problems with this scope. This T-16 is NOT one of the old, steel tubed scopes made in El Paso; it’s the modern version currently made in Japan.  It comes in the original box with the extra, oversize target turrets, screw-in metal lens caps, and the sunshade.
