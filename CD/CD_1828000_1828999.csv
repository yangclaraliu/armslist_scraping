This is a nice one!
I purchased this rifle from a man who found it in a relatives closet.
It had not been fired or touch in years.  
When I found it, it still had a layer of cosmoline on it.

I personally took down this rifle and boiled every single part to remove the old cosmoline then followed it up with a very good oiling of the every piece. Cleaned up the stock as well.

Manufacturer - ROF Maltby
Metal - Great condition
Bore - Great condition, like a mirror.
Action - Very smooth, very tight.
Mag release - very tight.
Wood - Very good condition, minor wear marks, original finish.

This rifle has ALL matching serial numbers including the following...
Action, barrel, bolt, two serial #'s on the stock.  (can be seen in photos)
Loaded with acceptance proofs and military markings including a very nice crown cartouche on the stock!

This is an import rifle, but the importer did it correctly.
The import stamp is tiny and on the action.  They didn't ruin it by placing an ugly stamp on the barrel.

I have not fired this rifle yet, but after having it completely apart, there is no reason why it would not function properly.  

This will make a great addition to someone's collection, or an awesome recreational shooter.  I am a C & R holder and will require your information (name and address) at time of purchase.

Willing to trade for firearm as well.

The Rem 870 when using the pisol grip style stocks is a much better design than the Moss 500 because the Rem 870 has a CROSS BOLT safety that you can engage without moving your hands away from the trigger assembly. The Moss 500""s or like style shotguns that have the SAFETY on the reciever and when set up with pistol grips make you move you hand away from the ready fire position to engage the safety switch on top of reciever. So for a Home ""D"" style pistol grip shotgun the Rem 870 is a wise choose. Remember seconds count in a emergency. Enough with my rant and about this gun...

The 1907s were used in WWI by the Royal Flying Corps, French aviators (aerial observers) and by the US 1st Aero Squadron in support of General Pershing's troops in the Punitive Expedition. In the 1920's and 30's the M1907 was used by Police and Gangsters like Bonnie and Clyde and John Dillinger.
This particular rifle was the rare Police version with the larger mag release, front sling swivel and unique ""finger grip"" charging plunger. The non-Police versions have a round plunger end. You can see on the right side of the stock where the Police ID was removed.
The Rifle fires the powerful .351 Winchester round(still available on the internernet and through Buffaloarms.com. I have six or seven rounds with the rifle. It fires flawlessly from a factory 10 or two factory 5 round mags that come with the rifle.
To go along with this rifle's long history of Military, Police and Gangster use, I moded the rifle into a gangster carbine, as follows:
The Police identifiers on the stock were long ago removed, so I decided to create a Gangster version, which in fact actually existed. I skillfully removed 2"" of the stock, which was ridiculously long from the factory! I removed three inches from the 19"" barrel, professionally threaded and crowned it and added a Thompson muzzle compensator.
I then had a special forend made so that I could introduce a Thompson foregrip inside the forend. I matched the forend with the stock perfectly!. The grip, does not match perfectly by design...they never did or would match as they were a Gangster mod. Has a period Thompson canvas sling.  The overall length is 35"". The original bluing is about 98% and is much brighter than my pics indicate. Where it looks worn is glare. This gun will make a great Gangster Wars period showpiece or re-enactor gun. The case is a beautiful period hardwood piece in excellent condition.It rifle fires like the day it was made! It is a Beast! The .351 is equivilent to a .357 mag. ballistically.

First up is a Remora IWB Size 8CH (ambidextrous). It fits J-Frame revolvers up to 2 1/8"" barrel. This is SUPER COMFORTABLE holster and worked great for my J-Frame when I owned it. I sold the revolver shortly after I bought this holster so it looks brand new. I'm asking $25 for this holster.

Next up is a Remora IWB size 6ART (ambidextrous). It fits large framed semi-autos up to 3 1/2” barrel (S&W CS45, 3913TSW, SPRINGFIELD XD-S, H&K USP COMPACT, RUGER SR 22/9C, SIG P250SC, WALTHER PPS, etc...

Next is a Don Hume Leather IWB Clip-On (Open Top) Right-Handed holster. I used it for my Kel-Tec PF9 and it worked great. It would probably work for most small framed, single stacked semi-autos. Very comfortable. It is in excellent LNIB condition. I'm asking $25 for this holster.

The Beretta Nano is the ultimate evolution of the micro compact concealed carry pistol. Utilizing a removable serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

A Gander exclusive, this Mossberg 535 Tactical features an adjustable black synthetic stock that holds 5 shells, ghost ring sights, and a 20"" barrel with a fixed-cylinder choke. The 535 marks a new era for Mossberg pump-action shotguns. Influenced by the success of the 3"" chambered 500 and the 3-1/2"" chambered 835, this shotgun brings the best attributes of both models, delivering outstanding versatility without compromising on performance. It's chambered to handle 12-gauge, 2-3/4"", 3"", and even 3-1/2"" magnum loads, for maximum stopping power. Rugged and reliable, the 535 is the ultimate pump gun, loaded with features usually found on shotguns costing much more, all built into a lightweight design that's easy to carry.

The original box will be included. Will have to meet FTF in Greenwood. I would need to see a Indiana drivers license and will fill out a bill of sale to complete the transaction.

I just bought this rifle used about a week ago with intentions of turning it into a suppressor host but a bolt-action rifle has caught my eye for the same job. I have not shot this yet. The serial number puts it at a production year of 1998. It has an aluminum trigger group housing and hammer forged .920"" bull target barrel with spiral finish. The rifle appears to be stock. There are some handling marks on the stock and two tiny blemishes on the barrel but overall the rifle is really nice and looks great. The trigger group and receiver show no marks. I really hate to part with this but I need to in order to buy the bolt gun.

The rifle will include:
- One of the scopes in the photos (I don't care which one)
- The rings shown on the rifle (not next to the loose scope)
- One factory Ruger 10-round magazine
- The bipod is NOT included

Scope 1 (Black one): Pine Ridge (older Cabela's brand) 2.5-7x32. Please note one of the adjustment caps is dented and the scope body does have scratches but the glass seems good and the scope functions.

Scope 2 (Silver one): Simmons 8-Point 3-9x40. Please note the body has some scratches and the trim ring around the eyepiece is missing but it functions and the glass seems good.

I am pretty firm on the price for now but might consider reasonable cash offers. Sorry but I am not interested in trading for your MREs, communist bloc surplus ammo, or other random items you have laying around.

I really prefer to keep this transaction local. If you really want it shipped my FFL charges $85 to do so.

They have been openly pro-gun control on numerous occasions and have made millions ($185,000,000 in 2013 projected revenue) off of the backs of our wounded soldiers. All under the guise of them being ""a helping hand"". I've known people who have asked for help and after 9 months of ""review"" they were given the cold shoulder. It has been said by their own employed associates that less than .30 of every dollar actually goes to any service member! While the top officials there collect $300,000 a year (+bonuses and incentives) salaries! Boycott these scumbags! It's hard enough to come back and try to regain control of a country which feels as though it left us behind. It doesn't help one but to know that there are people making vast sums of cash off of us while lying about where it is really going!

Nightforce ATACR Description: 
What’s in a name? In this case, everything. Our all-new ATACR™—Advanced Tactical Riflescope—builds upon the long and successful history of our NXS™ series. The result is a riflescope of unprecedented long-range capability and image quality. The 34mm tube allows 120 MOA/34.9 Mils of elevation adjustment—20% more than our most capable NXS™. Fully multi-coated ED glass results in light transmission values of over 90%, brilliant images and exceptional color contrast. A magnification range of 5x to 25x, and a wider field of view as a result of its unique optical prescription (17.96 feet at 5x) will cover virtually any situation a shooter could encounter. All this power comes in a compact package, too, measuring just 14.3"" in length. Our patented ZeroStop® is standard, and the ATACR™ is offered with two of our most sophisticated reticles, leaving nothing to chance. The ATACR™ redefines the ""long"" in long range for serious shooters and hunters, pushing the envelope of precision…and possiblity.

The Beretta comes with a Strong brand leather shoulder holster and three Beretta made 15 round magazines. Also available for purchase are about 19 more 15 round magazines. Mostly Checkmates (most are post 12/05 manufacture) and Beretta USA mags, a few PVD sand resistant magazines are in the mix as well.

686 4""
Some sort of revolver in .357/.38
Ruger MkII or III

...or anything else really. Anything with extra accessories or ammo is great.

Not looking for any .380 handguns or shotguns. Text or email me. 317-292-65four5. If you need more pics let know and I'll text some to you."
