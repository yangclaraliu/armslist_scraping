During the process the pistol is shortened, edges rounded and smooth, hammer bobbed, the triggerguard trimmed on the right side and the sights replaced with a one-piece ""Guttersnipe"" sighting plane. The grips are simulated black horn with transparent windows which match up with cutouts in the magazine to permit assessment of remaining ammunition. This particular ASP is part of the ""Quest for Excellence"" limited series, 100 pistols total with a special series marking on the left side of the slide (this one numbered ""052"" of the set) as well as a set of three high-visibility night sight dots integrated into the Guttersnipe plane; in conditions too dark to use the Guttersnipe, the dots generate a sight picture comparable to more conventional blade and notch night sights. A plethora of accessories are included with the pistol. First is a leather-bound book style case, titled ""Quest for Excellence"" by Norman, which holds the pistol, an enamel-finished ""Death Watch"" pin, a matching numbered holdout knife (7"" OAL, 3"" double edged spear point blade, skeleton grip, nicely balanced) and up to two extra magazines.

Springfield Armory’s® Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details.
Features:
Fiber Optic Front Sight
Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots.
Adjustable Rear Sight
Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination.
Lightening Cut. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used.

I bought it new a few years ago and have put approximately 250 rounds through it without one issue.  This is a Hungarian model manufactured by FEG and imported by TGI.  It has the following upgrades that make it a very smooth shooter: factory installed Tapco trigger, AMD65tech.com's bolt buffer, cheek riser, sling attachment, hogue grip, viking tactics sling, ultimak forend rail, and bolt hold open safety lever.  I'm asking $850 for this excellent rifle.  The only issue the rifle has is the rather thin firearm coating has worn off in some places.  This is typical of this model and most people cerakote or rattle can spray these AMD65s to their liking.  It's simply a minor cosmetic thing but she looks good to me.  I am also selling my AK 47 magazines and ammunition.  I have seven 20 round mags and four 30 round magazines.  All are tapco brand polymer magazines.  I'm selling those for $10 a piece and I also have 800 rounds of 7.62x39 ammunition still in original 20 round boxes.  8 boxes of Tulammo and 32 boxes of golden tiger.  I also have approximately 250 rounds of the same brand ammo but loose and without packaging.  All of the ammunition has been properly stored inside my air-conditioned home.  The ammo is going for .20/round.  All of it for $200.  With the magazines $250.  I am unfortunately converting my mancave into a nursery as my house is not big enough for my second child that is due in June.  So, hopefully I can find a good home for her (the gun and not my daughter).  Please text, call, or email if you're interested.  Also, please look at my other items for sale.  Thank you for looking.  REDACTED"

Klimovsk Proof-House 2013 export stamp and imported by PW Arms (Not a PW Reproduction).Bore and bluing is excellent, wood has some finish wear mostly behind the bold handle and on the forend. Small mark on scope and magazine. 
 
I have a manual that I have to find, and other papers from Tul'skey which may be a certificate, but its in Russian, so I am not sure what it is.Sling is reproduction I believe, did not come with the rifle.

They ring true and have a light amount of bluing left on the patina finish. There are two light dings in the barrels within 8” of the muzzle. The bores show light to moderate pitting.The receiver, hammers, and dogleg top lever still have strong engraving. The side plates have light case color visible. The stock and forend are solid without cracks; original checkering is worn smooth but quite visible. There is a ½” long repaired area in the butt plate of some type of filler material. The wood does have small nicks and dings one would expect of a gun of this ilk, but nothing significant. The action locks up very tight without any hint of wiggle or loose fit. This is superb example of an honest side-by-side shotgun with character."
