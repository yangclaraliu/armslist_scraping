I'm asking 500, it has absolutely no wear marks, like I said it's practically new. Comes with three 13 round magazines, and everything that originally comes in the box. Originally comes with 2 mags, I purchased an extra one for $35 when I picked it up. I bought this gun for 600 after tax, again I have the receipts for proof of everything. So this is a deal in my opinion. I hate to let it go, it was my first hand gun as I just turned 21, but I have to have the money.

Caliber is 7mm which is stamped on the left side of the barrel, could be called 7 X 57, 7 X 57-Mauser or, 7mm Spanish Mauser all of which are the same, just depends on where you live as to what you call it.  It is a carbine as the barrel is only 21” long.  The front sight appears to have been re-sweated back on.  Has some rust and the wood is a bit rough.  It was most likely built between 1891 and 1917, no way to know for sure.  The barrel band does not appear to be original, however, I have never seen one of these in a carbine and have nothing to compare it to.

The Sig Sauer 556R, 7.62 x 39, is as reliable as Russian's AK-47 but is much more accurate at 100-200 yards.  Sig Sauer's 556R is based on a combined technology of a dependable AK, coupled with the ease and MilSpec, upper/lower concept, similar of a U.S. AR-15 M4 system.  It is the combination of the these two exceptional features that allowed the Sig Sauer 556R to deliver the deadly 7.62 x 39 rounds with the accurate comparable to an AR-15.  Additionally, the adjustable gas system will allow you to shoot subsonic bullets, with proper cycling & chamber, so you can shoot quietly, especially with a suppressor or silencer.

The Tactical and Home Defense Package rifle comes with 1 30-rounds factory magazine but the Sig Sauer 556R takes just about every AK magazine on the market, Russian, Chinese, Romanian, Polish... etc.  The rifle will also comes with a Sig sauer Red Dot Scope System, a Sniper Red Laser with remote trigger, and a Tactical Led Light.  All mounted on a UTG Deluxe See-Thru Riser with Picatinny Tri-Rail Mount and STANAG Dimension. This complete package is all that you will need for close quarter combat and home defense, while the laser and the red dot scope would allow you to shoot accurately at 100-200 yards.

I understand the frustration some of you feel as your lack of planning, foresight, action, or whatever has increased the costs of your hobby.  I'm in the same boat.  If you must vent your spleen in an email to me, please try to keep your frustrations humorous."

benelli Just when everyone thought that the pump action shotgun couldn't be improved, Benelli unveiled the Nova Pump. Completely original and innovative, the Nova Pump incorporates its polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics, such as distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and fore-end in place of conventional checkering, complement the Nova's innovative engineering. With dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, the Nova will handle anything from target loads to 3-1/2"" magnums. To help dampen the recoil of today's super-heavy magnum loads, the Nova 12-gauge is specially designed to accept a Benelli recoil reducer. 28"" barrel,3 1/2"" mag, 4 plus 1, 3 chokes

Manufacturer Description and Information:

Extremely rugged. LaserMax internal guide rods for GLOCK meet or exceed both Mil-Spec and Homeland Security durability test standards (drop tests, blowing sand, temperature and humidity extremes, salt water fog, deep water immersion, 20,000+ rounds live fire).

Installation takes minutes. If you can field-strip your gun, you can install your LaserMax sight—No gunsmithing required. 

Hi-Vis Pulsating Beam. Pulsating gives effortless awareness of muzzle direction, transcends language barriers. Can be used outdoors from dusk till dawn, or indoors round-the-clock. IR versions optimized for NVG characteristics.

Alignment. The Internal Guide Rod lasers come permanently aligned from the factory* for center-of-mass accuracy at 20 yards. It will never drift out of alignment. There is no need to re-zero after changing batteries.

Accuracy. As close to the bore of the GLOCK as possible, positioning allows for the closest and most consistent relationship between your point of aim and point of impact (POA/POI) over all shooting distances. Especially useful for moving targets.

Turn it on! Ambidextrous switch in custom take-down lever closely resembles the factory GLOCK take-down lever. Deliberate on/off activation—highly desirable in a tactical or personal defense situation!

Battery Model: LMS-3x393 (readily available silver oxide batteries commonly used in watches)

Accuracy (20 Yards): ±2"" POA

Laser Operating Temperature: 15°-120° F

Wavelength: 635nm (red-orange)

Power Output: 5mW (brightest available - blinks for highest visibility)

Spot size: at 7 yds 5/16”, spot size at 25 yds 3/4”.
If any firearm has been ported, fluted or compensated either by the original manufacturer or by a gunsmith, LaserMax will NOT guarantee alignment. Custom alignment quotes for firearms may be obtained by calling LaserMax.

Please Note: 1. Expect to change your batteries once a year with typical usage.
2. Battery operating temperature is 15°F-120°F

678,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1232678,For Sale:  Lee Pro 1000 45 ACP PROGRESSIVE PRESS *NEW* WILL SET UP FOR YOU *READ DESCRIPTION*,"WILMINGTON, Wilmington, North Carolina",$ 400,"Listed On: Sunday, March 10, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This press in brand new in the box. Also included is a new case collator (see pictures) that will turn all of the brass right side up when dropping into the feeding tubes. You need nothing else to start reloading 45 ACP!!!  I have been reloading with Lee presses for over 30 years. In my opinion they are the best reloaders on the market, and when you bring in the price it is hands down. The Lee pro 1000 is an un-real press; I currently own 3 and switch out calibers on all of them, doing almost 12 calibers on these presses. I attached a some pictures of one of my reloading setups just to show my experience with the presses and possibly some ideas on how to set yours up (these are the last pictures). The Lee pro 1000 will come with literally everything you need to start reloading 45 ACP; all you will need is brass, bullets, primers, and powders. With the price of .45 ACP ammo going through the roof with no stop in sight, this is a great way to save money and assure yourself you will always have ammunition. Also keep in mind this press will do all other pistol calibers, all you need to do is get the 3 die set for which ever caliber you desire. I also have these just message me on which caliber you would like. Switching from one caliber to another is very easy with this press, taking 5 minutes or less!

What I have chosen to do for my customers that will make this the easy press setup possible is to tune all of the dies so the press is literally ready to go right out of the box. I take the the turret (the turret is what holds the three dies) and the 3 dies out of the box and put on one of my presses and set all of the dies EXACTLY to where they should be set. This is by far the most important factor in getting this press working great and reloading top quality ammunition. So when you get this press installed it is literally ready to start reloading and you don’t have to deal with the hassle of setting up each die which can be challenging for a first time reloader or even an experienced one. I have chosen to do this just because I feel like it makes the whole process of getting into reloading that much easier, IF FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU DO NOT WANT ME TO GO AHEAD AND SET YOUR DIES UP JUST LET ME KNOW IN A MESSAGE AND I WILL NOT MESS WITH THEM AT ALL!!

My experience with Lee customer service has been a truly great experience from day one; they have  some of the best customer service representatives and are VERY knowledgeable especially on the Lee Pro 1000. If you ever have any types of problems or just have general reloading questions you can always get through to a representative at Lee, unlike many other companies you may be on hold for an hour. Also they have great how to videos on their website, they are short clips that show you how to do everything imaginable on this Lee Pro 1000 from changing calibers, setting up dies, cleaning the press, changing the shellplate (if desired), literally everything. I WILL ALSO BE HAPPY TO HELP AS I FEEL I AM AS KNOWLEDGABLE ON THESE PRESSES THAN ANYONE ELSE, THEY ARE MY PASSION, I SERIOUSLY LOVE THEM!!

THESE PRESSES ARE NOT ""FACTORY RECONDITIONED"" LIKE OTHERS ON HERE. EVERYTHING IS BRAND NEW IN BOX WITH A 2 YEAR WARRANTY NO QUESTIONS ASKED
Everthing you will receive is new in the box, the press and collator, I will only take the turret and the dies out of the box to set them up saving you time. Again if you would like to do this yourself or just dont want me to for whatever reasin feel free to let me know. Below is some information on the press from the manufaturer, feel free to ask me any questions at all. 

Thanks Matthew, please ask any questions you would like :)

Product Information
The Lee Pro 1000 Progressive Press is a great press for beginning reloaders or seasoned veterans. Just add a bullet and load a cartridge with each pull of the lever - all other operations are automatic. For added safety, primers and powder are fed only if a case is present. For fine adjustments or for experimenting, an alternate loading sequence allows for loading only one case at a time. Makes learning easy for the first time user. Turrets sold separately.

You are worse than all the liberal east coast assholes attempting to influence Western gun policy.  You are scum.  I hope you enjoy the extra $30 a box.  I wish upon you endless flat tires, blown up motors, asshole bosses/co-workers on a daily basis, and bed bugs to constantly gnaw on your DEMOCRATIC ASS."

Brand New Vulcan M4 carbine, 5.56mm, 20"" Barrel, polymer lower, A3 flat top upper, Bayonet lug, flash hider, Three High Cap Magazines

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 20"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports rifle contour and length handguards with full heat shields, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of HBar contour (.750 under the front sight base) The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9"" twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights."
