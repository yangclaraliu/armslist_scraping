These rifles are getting harder to find all the time so price is firm cash only unless the trade clearly works in my favor (wouldn't mind an AR).  I have bills to pay and I will most likely end up re-selling any trade I get so it must work in my favor if there is a trade."

Bought this two weeks ago from gun store. Had intentions of buying a sr556 but seen this little shorty AR so i bought it. I noticed it had a stamp that says used on the box. Thought it was new, I personally havent shot it. It looks unfired though. Have box papers warranty card and one mag.  I have two other regual ARs and want a gas piston one, so im selling or trading this one. I see the prices of these models on here. Im not a gouger. 850 CASH and its yours or trade no wiggle room, all the other ones like this are $1000 and up

The Sig Sauer P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military and law enforcement professionals around the world. The innovative design of the removable steel frame housed in a polymer grip module allows agencies and units to change caliber, pistol size (subcompact, compact and full), trigger length and grip size without changing the issued serial number. The steel frame controls the rearward motion of the slide- not the polymer grip, as in other pistols. The result is both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality even with laser/light accessories mounted to the polymer grip's accessory rail.

The 90-Two represents the continuing evolution of a legendary pistol. It introduces new improvements to form, fit and function, while maintaining the integrity and reputation of its predecessor, the world famous 92FS. Although the 90-Two offers more individualized performance, the operating controls are identical to those of the 92FS/M9/M9A1, making it completely familiar to those already trained in the use of the older pistols. Many of the internal components, as well as the magazines, are completely interchangeable with those of the previous generation 92 series.

 Here are the new features: 

A. Slide Serrations: Increased surface area for better grip during slide retraction.

B. Updated Styling: Beretta once again partnered with the world-famous Giugiaro Design industrial design firm to enhance the appeal and ergonomics of the 90-Two.

C. Weight Reduction: The skeletonizedframe of the 90-Two grip design has resulted in a lighter pistol.

D. Removable Front Sight: Allows user toreplace existing sights with accessory sight systems or replace damaged sight.

E. Internal Recoil Buffer: Increases servicelife by reducing stress on the receiver createdby the more powerful .40 S&W ammunition.

F. Individual Size Grips: Single-piece, wraparound,technopolymer grip is user replaceable with an optional smaller grip. Allowsuser to select most comfortable size, while reducing the part count by thirteen.

G. Magazine Capacity: Increased to holdup to 17 rounds in 9mm and 12 rounds in.40 S&W. Magazines from standard 92 series models are completely interchangeable withthose of the 90-Two

Pistol was designed by Erma Werkes (Germany). However, American Arms produced the frames here in the US, and then imported the slide, barrel and magazines from Erma. It's nearly identical to the Erma EP522 as well as to the Iver Johnson TP-22. All three pistols use the the same 7 round magazines made by Erma.

Pistol is double & single action, and uses a 7 round magazine. It has a hammer block safety so it can be carried with a round in the chamber giving it an eight round total capacity. It is in excellent condition. It's also very concealable and is easily hidden by my open hand.

Pistol comes with it's original instruction manual (no box), a brand new spare finger rest magazine, and a new never used Bianchi belt clip holster.

352,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1842352,For Sale:  Remington model 51 380 cal. semi auto,"Manassas, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 600,"Listed On: Thursday, July 4, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The history of the Model 51

The Remington Model 51 was designed by John D. Pedersen prior to the First World War. The first patent application on the gun was filed in 1915. In 1920, seven patents were issued for the weapon. Six went to John Pedersen, and one went to Crawford C. Loomis, both employees of the Remington Arms Company. Between 1921 and 1926, an additional 25 patents were granted for various aspects of the gun’s mechanism, most to Pedersen. Many of the patented mechanisms were never utilized in a production gun.

One has only to hold the Remington 51 to feel its quality. The first thing you notice is how well the grip fits your hand--the result of extensive testing with hand molds to determine the correct size and shape for the average hand. Similar effort went into calculating the correct grip angle to allow the gun to point naturally. Very few guns feel so much like an extension of the hand as does the Remington 51. W.H. B. Smith says: “With the sole exception of the Luger, and the new German Walther P38, the Walther PPK, Sauer-38 and Mauser HSc (all foreign developments) this Remington 51 is probably the best-balanced, most-instinctive-pointing pistol ever made.” Some of the Remington advertising went so far as to describe the pistol as “self aiming.” R.K. Wilson says the Remington 51 is “...in the opinion of many authorities, the best pocket self-loading pistol ever designed...”

The gun has three safeties: a thumb-operated safety, a grip safety, and a magazine safety. The grip safety locks the disconnector, locks the sear in the hammer notch, locks the slide, and serves two additional functions. Since the grip safety does not pop out unless the gun is cocked, it acts as a cocked weapon indicator. It also serves as a lock open device for the slide if it is engaged when the slide is retracted. Squeezing the grip safety with the slide locked open will cause the slide to close and, if a full magazine has been previously inserted, a round will be chambered. The thumb safety cannot be engaged unless the hammer is cocked, and when in the safe position it locks the grip safety so it cannot be disengaged.

General G. Patton was known to have carried a Mode1 51 as his back-up piece. He fired a friend's Model 51 and was so impressed he called Remington to order one for himself. However, the pistol had been out of production for many years but Remington broke out the old tools and specially built a Model 51 for the General. This pistol is, unfortunately not that piece.

Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.

I bought it earlier this year, and the manufacture date on the box is March 2012. I have never carried it. Besides going to the range, it has just sat in its box. 

I also have a SIG brand .22 conversion kit for it (comes with one magazine). The .22 kit has run flawlessly, with no malfunctions. If you want the kit I'll throw it in for $250. 

I also have 1 extra SIG brand magazine, (2) 18 round Mec-Gar mags, (1) 20 round Mec-Gar mag, and a Bianchi paddle holster. For anybody unfamiliar with Mec-Gar, they manufacture SIG Sauer's magazines, so they are quality magazines. 

I've put over $1,400 into all these items, and my asking price is $1,200 for everything.

I'm pretty firm on the price because I'm reluctant to part with the gun. It's just a bit big and heavy for what I need, but I can't justify buying another gun in addition to the SIG. Let me know if you want to see any additional pictures, or want to shoot it a local range!"

It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.
The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. Just like the original, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

I also mounted the green laser on top to show it has that rail mount  

comes with Case, ALL paperwork including the warranty card! and Lens Pen, Manual. 

this is the information off the Trijicon site about the ACOG 

The military’s need for a magnified, self-luminous tactical sight that enhances target identification and increases hit probability on extended-range shots has given rise to the new Trijicon ACOG 6x48. Powered by Trijicon’s patented fiber optics and tritium-based technology, the new TA648RMR-50 ACOG reticle features a Green chevron aiming point. It also incorporates a bullet drop compensator (BDC) with additional aiming points estimated for trajectory of the .50BMG round out to 1800 meters. To further improve target acquisition and hit potential, the new ACOG 6x48 incorporates Trijicon’s Bindon Aiming Concept™ (BAC) – a revolutionary both-eyes-open method of aiming. Like other members of the Trijicon ACOG line, the new ACOG 6x48 is battery free and waterproof to 500 feet. This model of the 6x48 ACOG features an 6.5 MOA RMR®. 

The TA648RMR-50 also includes: 
 1 6.5 MOA RMR® Sight (RM02-33) 
 1 Picatinny Rail Adapter (TA75) 
 1 LENSPEN® (TA56) 
 1 Manual 
 1 Warranty Card 


 From Trijicon it is $3451.00 the cheapest on line I have found is $2,299.99 +S&H 
I will sell it for $1500.00 Firm cash or will consider part cash part trade 

looking for 
.50BMG ammo will even consider military Blue/red/black tip in link chain/belts,
 also looking for quality .50BMG ammo 
I'm also looking for a nice AR10 .308 
.50 Beowulf upper 
AR15 pistol upper 
1800's 44/40 Henry rifle 
or? 
so depending on what is offered will be how much cash needs to be added with any trade 
but I'm pretty firm at $1,500.00 cash and around $1700 in trade value even at that price it is over 1/2 of what your going to pay for this ACOG anywhere else.

will take cash (best way), paypal at 3% same with postal money order, and if using either of the last 2, will only ship scope after payment 100% clears, This Is a $3500 Scope and not willing to give it away.

If you know rifles, you know this is a sweet deal with all the upgraded gear on this carbine. If you're looking at an AR15 for the first time, check out AR15 dot com and read reviews on their barrels and rifles. They are much, much, much nicer than entry level RRA or DPMS, Bushmaster etc.
