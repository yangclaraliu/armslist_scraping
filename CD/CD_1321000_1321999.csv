 The Sig Sauer P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military and law enforcement professionals around the world. The innovative design of the removable steel frame housed in a polymer grip module allows agencies and units to change caliber, pistol size (subcompact, compact and full), trigger length and grip size without changing the issued serial number. The steel frame controls the rearward motion of the slide- not the polymer grip, as in other pistols. The result is both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality even with laser/light accessories mounted to the polymer grip's accessory rail.

 The Sig Sauer P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military and law enforcement professionals around the world. The innovative design of the removable steel frame housed in a polymer grip module allows agencies and units to change caliber, pistol size (subcompact, compact and full), trigger length and grip size without changing the issued serial number. The steel frame controls the rearward motion of the slide- not the polymer grip, as in other pistols. The result is both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality even with laser/light accessories mounted to the polymer grip's accessory rail.

Big time zoom, mil-dot reticle, adjustable objective lens, super clear glass... this is a great scope. Has Vortex unconditional, unlimited, lifetime, transferrable warranty. That means that Vortex doesn't care if you bought it second hand, you're still covered. Simply owning the scope is their warranty. No paperwork or registration involved. If you run into any problems, they've got you covered.

Scope is in like-new shape. I used it for a couple seasons on my hunting rifle, then decided to go a different direction on optics. longest kill with it was 200 yards, and it was cake on zoom level 6. You can definitely reach out and touch something with this scope!  I'm asking $120 for the scope by itself. Comes with cleaning cloth,  dust caps, and 4"" sun shade, but I also have a set of Leupold medium 1"" rings, and a YHM flat-top riser that I'll throw in for an extra $30. The rings alone cost over $45 new. 

Vortex no longer makes this version scope. I believe all the new crossfires are illuminated. This one is non-illuminated, straight black mil-dot reticle. I like not relying on batteries for my primary optics. Keeps it simpler. 

I'm including a photo of it mounted on my 18"" AR with rifle length rail. Sunshade is installed, and the rings shown are the ones for sale. The gun is not for sale! Just the scope and rings.

I have had a couple questions and am providing all answers here for those of you contemplating buying this very nice piece of America's military history.

The barrel is an Underwood.  NPM did not make their own barrels and was part of the free barrel program. The stock and hand guard are birch, and I can't find any maker marks or rebuild marks. Other major parts are:
Trigger housing: Inland
Bolt: Inland
Slide: Inland

It seems to be your standard USGI carbine that has been updated and/or rebuilt during the 70 plus years since it was built and used in WWII.

I will provide the original CMP certificate of authenticity to the buyer. I do have extra ammo and 15- and 30-round magazines I would sell with the rifle at a reasonble price.  I am not currently considering lower offers since I just listed today, if it doesn't sell in a few days, I may consider lower offers.

The pistol is mechanically sound, minus the Sear Spring, which costs about $30 to replace.  Numrich makes them and I'm going to have that replaced in the next few weeks.  Pistol comes with about 1200 rounds of ammo, three stripper clips (which you pretty much need for reloading) and an extra firing pin and spring.

I have completely worked this gun over with the full fluff-n-buff job on the barrel, frame, and trigger.  I have reshaped the feed ramp by removing the factory hump which tends to drag on 147 grain ammo and polished it to a full shine.  I beveled the mag well, and removed all the molding flash on the grip and frame.  Trigger registers right around 7 lbs, down from the factory 11, and is very smooth and non-stacking.  (I added an over travel trigger stop behind the trigger that is instantly removed.  It is covered by grip tape in the picture.  It cut my group size by more than half.)  I made the slide lock much easier to release by filing and polishing the necessary areas.  I polished the magazine followers and polished the internals of the magazines and springs for even more reliable function.  I have carried this gun many times and it has always worked flawlessly after I put some elbow grease and loving care into it.  It does have a few tiny light scratches on the slide from being carried, but this gun isn't about being a mantle piece.  It's a save your ass gun that needs to work!

You get a good, ready to carry firearm made great, with all of the hard reliability upgrade work already done!

If not I am fine with paying reasonable shipping charges for Fedex or UPS, whichever is cheaper.

Please know that I am aware of the current situation regarding ammo so comments about my requests are not what I am interested in and any sent my way will be blocked permanently.  On that note, the above prices are negotiable but not by much so do not come to me if you want to sell .223 for a $1.00 a piece and .308 for $1.50 and so on.  I am interested in prices that are not reflective of the industry's greed and are more reflective of people's desire to help provide one another with proper and adequate protection and materials to hunt with.

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

I prefer my G20 so I don't have much use for this. 

The gun comes as you see it with box and paperwork. I have some ammo I could sell with it for what I paid ($40/50 rounds american eagle at dicks) but I have a Marlin 44 lever gun as well so I don't need to or want to sell it.

I will sell for $600 FIRM and I'm not interested in any trades. That's what I paid for it and considering Ruger revolvers are sold out everywhere it is more than fair.

I really don't know much about revolver internals so I am passing this project along.
It will/does require work. Will cock back and fire single action, but then won't move cylinder and won't work double action. All parts look intact, I could be as simple as me not getting each one where need be before putting plate back on...I'm frustrated...

Features

SureFire flashlights are known around the world as the lighting system for any and every tactical scenario. In 1969 their original product line consisted of laser sighting systems for firearms. After many years of intense research and development, the SureFire Weapon Light was born and low light law enforcement & military operations changed forever. SureFire then went on to establish themselves as the leading manufacturer of rugged, powerful and compact illumination tools for tactical applications; from weapon-mounted lights and laser sights, shield lights, baton lights & hand-held lights powerful and bright enough to qualify as force-multiplier tools that could temporarily blind, unbalance, and disorient a threat. 

The M951 Kit02 Millennium Universal WeaponLight is designed for Mil-Std 1913 Picatinny rail interface equipped shoulder-fired weapons. The included thumbscrew mount ensures quick attachment or removal during high stress conditions. 

This WeaponLight features a shock-isolated modular system and components, for rapid conversions in the field to meet mission-specific requirements. The bezel, lamp, and tail cap are interchangeable with SureFire's Special Operations Series hand-held flashlights. 

The Millennium Universal (MU) WeaponLights are designed and constructed to endure and perform under harsh battlefield conditions. They're finished with a durable Mil-Spec hard anodizing (Mil-A-8625 Type III Class 2), and the rugged CNC machined housings are o-ring sealed for moisture and dust protection. 

The Milennium Universal M951XM107 WeaponLight is powered by two lithium batteries and produces a 65 lumen beam. The optional P61 high-output bulb can be used to produce an outstanding 120 lumen beam. This kit includes an IR filter for use during covert 

• CNC machined aluminum housing is o-ring sealed 

• Mil-Spec hard anodized finish is extremely durable 

• Thumbscrew mount enables quick installation and removal 

• 1.47"" Bezel accepts SureFire's accessory filters and protective cover 

• Tactical XM07 Tail Cap Switch 

The XM07 tail cap switch assembly features a click-on/off push-button switch, a plug in momentary-on switch with a 7.0"" cable, and a system disable option. These switches operate independently of each other. When the tail cap switch is activated, the tape switch is disabled. Turning the tail cap switch to the off position activates the tape switch. The system disable feature eliminates the possibility of accidental activation from either switch. 

• High Output Option 

P61 Bulb (included) produces a powerful 120 lumen beam 

• Turbohead Option 

Optional beam-focusing 2.5"" Turbohead delivers a tighter, longer reaching beam 

• Prefocused Beam 

No need to twist the bezel to adjust the beam, it's already perfectly prefocused. Lamps and reflectors are individually mated and hand-adjusted to within .005"" for optimum beam quality at all distances."

They shoot great!   Are accurate and fun, but we simply don't shoot them any more, time for them to find a better home.

Each comes with the two Colt, flush 7 round magazines, and one standard (slightly extended) 1911 7 round magazines.   

Each will come with a box of Blazer FMJ.    And each has original Colt box/plastic case.

Price each is $850 firm.    $1700 for the pair.  One is SOLD Pending funds.

If you want both, I will toss in two McCormick 10 round magazines, and 4 extra standard 1911, 7 round magazines.  (that would be a total of 6 extra magazines).

They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

I ordered Bersa Thunder magazines and they sent me these instead.
I know they're slammed with orders, but they haven't responded to any of my calls or e-mails.
I don't simply want to return these in the mail because I have no confidence they would be refunded or replaced (based on the lack of response I'm getting).

I'm a gun guy but not a Garand guy -- I am disposing of this for a friend who apparently had this rifle in the family for a while -- so I haven't fired this rifle, but am glad to answer any questions I can about it.
The ammo is 250 rounds of FMJ per can, two cans. One can is quite rusty on the outside, but the the ammo is packed in plastic and is not touched.
The price is pretty firm. I've done enough reading to know what they're worth in this condition. If you are a Garand guy, and you want to check it with gauges and such, you are welcome to do so -- but I'm not interested in being talked down.
