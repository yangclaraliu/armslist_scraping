This thing has about 700 rounds through it, just barely broken in. I have the original case, cable lock and 6 magazines. This is a full size pistol, I hate to part ways with it but duty calls and I have to do the responsible thing. For some reason these are sold out at Turner's, RifleGear and Ammo Bros, probably because of the package deal Springfield was offering. Also, I think I might even have a Springfield speed loader for this one, I'll have to check my stash. Overall, this is a beautiful pistol. Price seems fair at $550, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for looking. PPT to take place at Ammo Bros in Santa Ana."

The HK45 Compact Tactical builds on the tough, military lineage of the Heckler & Koch HK45 series of handguns to devise the ultimate operator’s pistol. The HK45 pistol series (compact and full-size models) were chosen as the first firearms made at HK’s American manufacturing facility so it is only fitting that a modified variant would be adopted as the new pistol of a major U.S. special operations unit.The HK45 Compact Tactical (CT) is the closest a civilian can get to that military pistol. The HK45 CT comes standard with a threaded barrel, 10-round magazine with extended floorplate, and replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the pistol to suit individual hand size and shooting preferences.The HK45 pistol series were originally developed as candidates for the U.S. military’s next generation handgun competition so there is little wonder that the HK45 CT is so well-suited for military, law enforcement, and security use. Each HK45 CT comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.An HK proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces affecting the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.An “O-ring” barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy. And the threaded barrel on the HK45 CT is made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.The HK45 Compact Tactical uses all HK45 magazines, from 10-rounders to the smaller capacity 8-round magazine. A Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for mounting lights and accessories is molded into the polymer frame of the HK45 Compact Tactical.The HK45 Compact Tactical is currently available with a “decock only” (V3) control lever mode found on its special operations counterpart or with a decock and manual safety (V1) control lever function. The HK45 CT can also be converted to a variety of other kinds of trigger firing modes including HK’s enhanced double action only “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) mode.The HK45 CT is currently being assembled at HK’s American manufacturing facility in Newington, New Hampshire."

It sure could not have been very many since you can’t find one at all.It is 6+1 and 2 shells at 2 3/4 each side of the stock (4) or 2 3” one each side.The recoil pad is breaking down and needs replaced.

The rarest gun I’ve ever owned and a hard one to sell knowing I’ll probably never get to buy another.I’m asking the same $950 for it. I may throw some shells in with it for the right deal. Thanks.

Engraved scene on the cylinder with the words ""engaged may 16 1843"". Made 1984.
Lyman's .54 plains pistol. Nothing special about this. Current production model, I suspect this one was made somewhere around 2011. Not sure. Charles Daly .54 percussion rifle. Made in Italy, 1985. .44 cap and ball with a longer barrel(12"") and a detachable shoulder stock. Made in Italy by pietta, in 1995. The octagonal barrel and open top frame point to it being a 1851 Navy; however, it's a steel frame, and has the buttstock. So i don't know what to tell you.All are functional and in decent shape, with some minor surface rust from long-term storage before we got it. Tons of bullets for each, some caps, patches for the .54s, powder horns, about a pound and a half of synthetic ffg for the rifle(Purchased new about 4 years ago, stored cool and dry. One pound still sealed), measures, funnel, and a lot more accessories.Inherited the collection when my father passed. We cleaned it all up and took it out shooting once, and it's sat in the back of a safe since. Would be a good way to get into a full black powder setup for the first time, or expand an existing collection for a reasonable price.Selling as a lot only, will not break up collection.Asking $500 for everything."

I purchased this scope October 2017 and it has never been mounted on a rifle. I have turned this scope on maybe a handful of times while in my deer stand in the early hours of the morning to look around. This scope has never been turned on during the day with or without the cap. I didn’t want to damage the tube. I purchased this thinking I would use it but reality set in and I don’t think I will ever use it; so I want to sell it to make room in the safe. Below is the manufacture’s specs. The Armasight Orion 5x Gen 1+ Night Vision Rifle Scope will help you shoot with celestial precision during the darkest nights. This night vision scope by Armasight utilizes cost effective night vision technology to give you a high accuracy night vision scope at a fraction of the cost of other scopes. Made with Gen 1+ night vision technology, the Armasight Orion 5x Night Vision Scope provides stellar night vision images in a compact and durable package. The night vision riflescope has a mid-range 5x magnification that will serve you well on any hunt or tactical operation. Armasight has included a detachable IR-810 infrared illuminator with the Armasight Orion 5x Gen 1+ NV Water-Resistant Riflescope, illuminating areas without enough ambient light for the Orion to draw from. The Armasight riflescope is easy to mount to your weapon, since it will mount to almost any standard Weaver-style rail. Challenge the night sky's greatest hunter with the powerful night vision optics of the Armasight Orion 5x Night Vision Tactical Scope.Specifications for Armasight Orion 5x Night Vision Scope:Magnification: 5xNight Vision Generation: 1+Mount: Weaver-styleIncluded Accessories: IR810 infrared illuminatorFeatures of ArmaSight Orion 5x Generation 1+ NV Rifle Scope:* Effective close to mid-range night vision rifle scope by Armasight* Gen 1+ night vision technology is affordable and effective* 5x magnification for close to mid-range engagements* Mounts to most Weaver-style rails* Comes with a detachable IR-810 infrared illuminator to light up the darkest environments"

Very neat historical set of a bow and 3 arrows made by the famous Indian Chief Geronimo. The bow is marked on the inside “GERONIMO” and to the right of it the initials “T.P.M.” On the outside part of the bow, it is marked “GERONIMO 1901/ TO THOS P MARTIN”. Both sides of the bow are decorated with geometrical shapes in both red and blue. Two of the arrows have iron heads and one is just sharpened wood point. All three are decorated similarly to the bow. The bow had a piece of wire and the remnants of an old tag. The rest of the tag is in an old envelope. The outside of the envelope says “Uncle Lonnie/Important.” The tag identifies the bow as being made by Geronimo where he presented this to Thomas P Martin in 1901 near Fort Sill, OK. It goes on to say Thomas P Martin presented this to the Oklahoma Historical Society in 1933. Geronimo lived at Fort Sill, OK from 1894 ‘til his death in 1909. He made his living selling bows and arrows as well as autographs and taking pictures with people. The day before he died, he has road in to town to sell of his bows and arrows.
