This Dan Wesson has definitely been used but not abused. It has some scratches as seen in the pictures below, it is a shooter and definitely NOT a safe queen. It also has the idiot mark that was put there from the previous owner. However, this has the ""Match"" barrel & shoots like a dream. The scratches are just cosmetic. This is one of the best PRODUCTION 1911's for the money, no MIM parts!

If my ad gets flagged again I am not going to sell the gun it will be given to my brother. It is really sad to see people flagging my posts without telling me why. I protect the constitution at work and I will defend gun rights to my death in my personal life. Normally one of my defenses to liberal anti gun people is how responsible gun owners are and they don't need constant supervision and more laws. Flagging my posts and not being man enough to admit it is the exact opposite or responsible. It is acting childish and it is a little upsetting that members of the gun community would be doing this."

 It comes with a 30rd promag drum, 4rd mag, and whatever ammo I have left by the time its sold(slugs,buckshot mix) Has modified tapco g2 fcg, SAW grip, CSS billet tri rail, detachable optics ount (lucid red dot NOT included) angled trigger guard, and a tapco 6 position stock.

Fired about 150 times, not even fully broken in yet.  Fires/cycles Winchester super x perfectly, from what I've heard no other saiga will cycle super x. That is a testament to the polishing work...

The saiga 410 retails for as low as $655 + $50 shipping + your $30-40 ffl fee, the drum mag retails for 200+. tri-rail $130, the conversion kits retails for $150-200 + shipping.
retail value= $1210.00, Im not trying to get that out of it, but its a ballpark youd need to land in...
Also, if you read up on saigas you will know that saigas usually come with very rough internals out of the box and usually do not cycle all ammo properly, So the bolt carrier group usually needs to be reground and then polished. a service valued at $200+ by your local gunsmith (if you can find one that is experienced, I had a hard time with that one lol). But I sent my parts out to a saiga specialist for polishing and what a difference, cycles like a breeze....

This listing is for One Magazine; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras I have on hand at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. These are 30 rounders, factory Colt and so marked, most conspicuously by the Colt trademark on their floorplates. These were manufactured in 2009 as stamped on the mag and never used.  They were loose in an ammo box with no protective packaging so there is faint amount of contact evidence.  All of them are new magazines. Manufacturer is Colt Industries. Construction is classic serrated gray military finish alloy body with steel spring and black anodized floorplate, and current design green polymer cartridge follower.

Description:

This listing is for one high quality Yankee Hill Machine YHM-15 Stripped Lower Receiver. Semi-auto lower is precision machined entirely at Yankee Hill’s manufacturing facility from a high-strength 7075 aluminum alloy forging. The perfect foundation for almost any kind of AR you want to build: tactical, competition, sporting—even a non-standard caliber. Mil-spec dimensions ensure superior fit and maximum compatibility with a wide range of available uppers, aftermarket parts, and accessories. Slightly oversized magwell chamfers help ensure fast, positive magazine changes when the pressure is on. YHM logo stamped on left side of mag well. Accepts standard .154"" hammer/trigger pins and .250"" takedown/pivot pins. Pin holes are left slightly undersized, so you can open them up just the right amount for an exact pin fit without slop or slippage. Hardcoat anodized with a durable, fine-grain, mil-spec matte black finish."

(Brand New) 30 Round, Black Magazine For M16/AR15 

Unlike metal magazines, Thermold products won't jam because they're made with a nylon that resists heat, dirt and rust. Abuse them, drop them, throw them in the mud. They are dent resistant, self lubricating and non-corrosive.

I have 10 mags and may consider a trade for a nice semi-auto handgun or hunting rifle. Will sell all 10 for $300 or 5 for $150."

The supply of these AR-15 bolt carrier groups is very limited, so make sure to pick one up for your next rifle build or for use as a spare before it's too late!"

Alloy frame, with stainless cylinder and barrel
The upper part of the frame, as the photos show, shield the hammer; but still exposes its cleat-serrated hammer spur enough to produce a cocking motion for precise single action firing. The lightweight stainless variant of the Airweight Bodyguard, the 638, was introduced as a limited run in 1989, then added as a regular part of the Smith & Wesson line in 1996, when Smith & Wesson beefed up the J-frame sufficiently for it to handle High Performance +P ammunition. This third, current variant of the 638 has a .312 MIM Metal-injected-Molded .312 smooth combat trigger and MIM flat-faced hammer with floating firing pin. All S&W Revolvers have an internal transfer bar safety that prevents accidental firing if a loaded weapon is dropped, and in 2002, the 638-3 entered the market with Smith & Wesson's patented internal lock. Barrel length is 1 7/8 inches, and this 5 shot pocket revolver only weighs 14 5/8 ounces empty."

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.


These pistols are going up in value and have been receiving great reviews. They are in the same class as the Taurus 709, Ruger LC9 and Keltec PF9, but in terms of reliability and feel of firearm, this gun has far better reviews and feel. This does not feel like a cheap piece. The construction is the exact same as a Glock, just smaller.

South African manufactured 308 Winchester ammo.  

The description is in the pictures taken directly from the packages.  This ammo was made in 1981.  See the pictures and read all information included in the pictures.  If you have any questions please ask.  This ammo is non-magnetic, brass cased. I will not ship this ammo, this is a face to face transaction only, in the Jacksonville, NC area.  There is only one full, sealed battle pack remaining, containing 140 rounds, which is 7 boxes of 20, see the pics to view a box.  There is one opened battle pack containing 4 boxes of 20 and one box of 16.  That is a total of 196 rounds.  I will not break open the sealed battle pack.
These rounds have been stored in a temp. controlled environment since the day I bought them.  I have fired some of these rounds in my firearms with no problems at all.  I have also sold some of these rounds previously, and have had no complaints from the buyers that fired them from their firearms.

I am pricing these rounds at a dollar a round.  Feel free to make me an offer of cash, (I prefer cash) or trade, worst I can say is no.  This isn't my first rodeo with ammo in the current market climate, so don't try to make an offer that is ridiculously low, or a trade that isn't worth it, just go look for ammo elsewhere.  Sorry for being rude, but I needed to put that out there, I don't have time for shenanigans.

The GLOCK 30SF in the legendary .45 Auto offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30SF .45 caliber is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control, especially for shooters with smaller hands.
