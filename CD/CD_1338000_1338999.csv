 The PLR-22 pistol is chambered for the popular and economical .22 Long Rifle cartridge (.22LR). It is based on the 5.56mm NATO chambered PLR-16 pistol and shares many parts including the grip and front and rear sights. The PLR-22 is not a simple conversion kit, it is a standalone firearm chambered for the .22LR and is designed for target shooting, plinking, or small game hunting. The PLR-22 and SU-22 operate by blowback action and have a 4140 steel bolt that rides on steel guide rails inside the polymer receiver. The ejector is attached to one of the guide rails and the recoil spring is located above the barrel. The cross-bolt safety and magazine release operate identically to the PLR-16 and SU-16."

DoubleStar doesn't spend as much on marketing as some of the more well known brands. Spikes, Colt, Bushmaster, Windham, S&W, Sig Sauer, Daniel Defense, PSA, olympic, DPMS and Bravo Company all make fine ARs. They also spend more to promote them, so their names may be better known.

DoubleStar Corp’s Origin
Many people ask “where did DSC come from?” After 25 years of success with J&T Distributing selling black rifle parts and accessories, Teresa and Jesse Starnes (Double-Starnes’) created a full line of complete weapons to satisfy the thousands of requests to build an AR-15. The J&T Distributing customer base demanded a rifle that incorporated the versatility and quality that J&T had been providing them for so long.

Manufactured in Winchester Kentucky, DSC has continued to supply not only the commercial market but military and law enforcement forces across the world with high quality firearms they can depend on. Every rifle built uses only US made parts, and is built with precision, care, and pride. Each rifle is built, test fired... not just some rifles... all of them.


Differences in AR-15 type rifles?
Some general info provided by an FFL that specializes in black guns...
USGI and/or mil-spec.: 
Commercial parts are made by casting and stamping, which requires weaker, softer steel to do. Parts wear out faster. USGI and mil-spec are forged and milled, much harder steel. And commercial parts don’t always work with mil-spec if you need a replacement, whereas all mil-spec works with all mil-spec. 

The DoubleStar costs more, but it is all USGI, all mil-spec. The DS-4 is a rifle with flattop. It does not come with a rear sight. They do that due to differences in personal preference. 
The DS-4 Comes with magazine and manual. 

The DS-4 bolt and carrier are far superior to most commercial ARs. Many commercial AR vendors say they have a mil-spec bolt carrier... probably not completely. The DoubleStar is USGI, M16 blueprint (no others can say that), all parts x-rayed and particle tested. Carrier is internally lined for the bolt travel and has a chrome firing pin. 

Finish and machining on the DS is far superior to most all manufacturers, and they use a higher grade 7075 aluminum. Most commercial manufacturers use 6061 aluminum, substandard and not mil-spec. 

I can go on and on. Only the billet and really high dollar manufacturers can really even compare to DoubleStar… And if I was to stake my life on it, I would want it to be the DoubleStar…



You won't be allowed to buy an AR like this once the prez has his way. Get this USGI grade AR while you still can! 

Even with ""gun control"" legislation voted down, the president is still pushing for ""reasonable and commonsense measures"" that he wants to impose on us AS SOON AS POSSIBLE... like ""Pass a new, stronger ban on assault weapons"". 
http://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/preventing-gun-violence
And McCain just said that he expects more ""gun control"" legislation to be presented for votes in the Senate in May.
Don't forget that the president has used the executive order to by-pass congress more than any prior president. If he can't get congress to do it, expect him to do it by executive order."

RCA uses a proprietary thermal process
that aligns the steel's crystalline structure

Polymeric Adsorption:
We bind a synthetic fluoropolymer of tetrafluoroethylene to each part to reduce friction and improve wear.

SOLD
Great example of the pinnacle of the Smith & Wesson 3rd generation auto handguns. I purchased this last year for exactly what I am asking for it now. I was able to hand select this from a dealer's batch, so it is a good one.  He also installed a new Hogue grip, and combined with the all metal construction and the grip this thing shoots like a dream.  I have only had it to range once, and fed it fmj's and hp's with perfect success.  Great internals, some small marks but as you can see from pictures they are not very prevalent.
$400 extremely firm, comes with 2 hi capacity mags in as new condition, and a very nice nylon holster that fits it's square trigger guard with a place for the extra mag as well.   No ammo is included in price, but I have some I will sell at a reasonable price if needed.
Small possibility I would be interested in trade; strait up or +/- cash. With the reasonable price this will probably sell for cash though. Cannot buy a better gun for $400 than a 3rd generation S&W - and if you order some law enforcement trade in 99% chance it won't measure up to this one, let alone the new grips, new holster, and new mags!"

This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the .22 416 rifle., The 416 is a dedicated .22. The barrel measures 9 inches in length and its rails are machined. The 416’s pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic.
The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 pistol are the same as the .22LR 416 rifles. They are made of high-strength polymer and designed to make loading simple and efficient. 
Operation

A blowback system operates the .22 caliber HK 416 Pistol. The dust cover functions and the bolt remains open when the magazine empties. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation and its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’."

DESCRIPTION: 
This is a BRAND NEW DPMS AR-15 rifle that is the flat top model with the forward assist as well as the dust cover and other enhancements. This is NOT the base model! I initially purchased this because I read it is the very best entry level AR-15 rifle on the market for the money! I tend to agree. It will ship in the original box. This still has all the paperwork and warranty information in the box. 

This is not the cheaper $800 Walmart version that doesn't have fwd assist, dust cover, and has the fixed sight that you cannot mount optics on without a very tall base.

It also reads 5.56mm-.223 on the lower, indicating you can shoot 5.56mm rounds out of this gun, unlike some of other uppers. 
Other notable details:
- 16"" barrel 1/9 twist. 
- Flat top, optics ready.
- 6 position stock. 
- 30 round hi-cap High capacity magazine. 
- Dust Cover.
- A2 Birdcage Flash hider. 
- Forward Assist.

ACTION: Very smooth, well oiled and crisp action."

22 lr ammo from the stores ""is"" 5 cents a round. oviously it is hard to find so I am willing to pay more, but give me a break! I am not looking for some super cheap rate or anythign, just fair trade! 7-8 cents a round for 22 is a very reasonable price especially for a valid trade on .223 at store price!  for $70 worth of store priced .223 it should not be unreasonable to ask for 1200 rounds of 22 ammo!"

These things are VERY difficult to find!  It is brand new in the box NIB and has never been fired.  I have REDUCED the PRICE.  I want this KSG GONE!!

The KSG is the ultimate tactical shotgun!
Overall Length:  26.1""
Barrel:  18.5""
Capacity:  15 rounds of 12 gauge!!!  (Incredible power in a compact package)
Also, there's so much picatinny space on this thing.  There's room for a flashlight, lazer, red dot sight, verticle grip, etc...

You really have to hold this thing to appreciate the compactness and build quality of this gun.

Check out the videos that ""nutnfancy"" put on youtube with this unique firearm.  It really is something different.  The dual magazine tubes allow for a 14+1 capacity of 12 gauge shells.  This is the gen 2 version which means all the minor quarks from the first version have been eliminated in this version.  Beware when you see other listings for KSG's.  They might be selling a gen 1 version.

Comes with:  KSG, Manual, Box, Sling, Hardware

Btw, the AWB is still alive.  They didn't kill the bill.  Do some research.  They removed the AWB section of the bill and are tacking it on as an amendment so that it will have a better chance of passing.  This is exactly what they did in 1994.  It passed then and the current AWB is following those footsteps to pass this time.

I only took it out to attach the accessories and put it back in the plastic. The M6-G features the Advanced Combat Bolt, Enhanced Trigger group, The LWRC BUIS, and up graded gas piston system. The big difference between the G model and the older A2's is that you don't have to replace the piston return spring every 3000 rounds, it's good for the life of the gun. Also in the package is a used Aimpoint Comp M2 which is the most widely used version. The optic shows some wear as I've had it for a couple of years and its been there done that but still works flawless. Next is a Surefire M900A Foregrip Weapon light with a swing lever mount. It too is used but still works flawless and has some play when mounted but doesn't affect operation, not sure if its normal. The pictures only show one Magpul mag but it comes with 2 more black standard metal GI mags that are new so it's a total of 3 mags. I can break the package up if you want but would prefer not to.

I have an antique production Winchester Model 1873 Saddle Ring Carbine, manufactured in 1892. Chambered in .44-40, 20” barrel, checkered oval finger grip dust cover, lever lock & of course a saddle ring. The rear is an adjustable flip up carbine sight with markings. It has not been “over cleaned” or tampered with & has that great vintage gun look. The stocks are walnut & are solid with no cracks or repairs. The condition is incredible especially considering the age. They are easy on the handling marks & fit the metal tight, a factory fit. The butt plate is the steel curved carbine style. Mechanically sound with a smooth tight crisp action, holds cock & half cock, loads, cycles, fires & ejects just fine with no issues. The bore has strong pronounced rifling with no rust or pitting issues, very nice. It appears to be correct & original. The Model 1873 is “the gun that won the west”; here is your chance to own a nice usable early Winchester and a piece of American history. I am asking $3999.99 obo, anyone that knows Winchester, knows these are hard to come by. My number is REDACTED."

The KSG is the ultimate tactical shotgun!
Overall Length:  26.1""
Barrel:  18.5""
Capacity:  15 rounds of 12 gauge!!!  (Incredible power in a compact package)
Also, there's so much picatinny space on this thing.  There's room for a flashlight, lazer, red dot sight, verticle grip, etc...

You really have to hold this thing to appreciate the compactness and build quality of this gun.

Check out the videos that ""nutnfancy"" put on youtube with this unique firearm.  It really is something different.  The dual magazine tubes allow for a 14+1 capacity of 12 gauge shells.  This is the gen 2 version which means all the minor quarks from the first version have been eliminated in this version.  Beware when you see other listings for KSG's.  They might be selling a gen 1 version.

Comes with:  KSG, Manual, Box, Sling, Hardware

Btw, the AWB is still alive.  They didn't kill the bill.  Do some research.  They removed the AWB section of the bill and are tacking it on as an amendment so that it will have a better chance of passing.  This is exactly what they did in 1994.  It passed then and the current AWB is following those footsteps to pass this time.
