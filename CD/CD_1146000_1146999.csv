The 1911 RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS â which stands for 1911 Compact SAS â comes from the SIG SAUERÂ® Customs Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. Available in either a Natural Stainless (shown) or NitronÂ® finish the RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile custom wood grips. The grips are either gray diamondwood on the Stainless model or rosewood on the NitronÂ® version. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols features a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability"

Nosler Ballistic Tip Hunting bullets have been trusted by hunters for nearly 25 years. They are precision made and individually inspected for the utmost quality which translates to incredible accuracy with every shot. The heavy jacket base prevents bullet deformation during firing and holds together at extreme velocities as well as a polycarbonate tip that resists deformation in the magazine and initiates expansion upon impact. The bullet's mid-section keeps it together at any velocity until impact, and a uniform, pure lead core eliminates possible imbalance and erratic flight caused by air pockets. Great for thin-skinned game like deer, antelope and sheep. This is not loaded ammunition."

-The Wilson Arms Company has been a leading manufacturer of gun barrels for more than fifty years.  This is one of the highest quality barrels for the AR15 Platform, with tolerances far beyond ""Mil-Spec"".

- Fab Defense (www.fab-defense.com) NFR-RS Quad Rail
- Made in Israel, this is also a completely top-notch part and it shows.  Pictures do NOT do it justice.  This is the only ""used"" part on the gun, but you wouldn't know it.  This was built by a people who know it was going to have people's lives depend on it, and frankly it looks and feels like it.

- Troy HK Style Front Fixed Battle sight, This is another very high quality component, and one of the best fixed front sights made, mounted on a very nice quad railed gas block.

- G.P.S. Grip Pod Systems Grip pod.  This is a front grip that snaps out to a BiPod at the flick of a button.  This is -NOT- the Cheap plastic knock-offs, It has the polymer coated metal legs, and the one you see pictures of soldiers standing on, showing off how tough it is.  

- This is a complete upper WITH Billet Charging handle, and COMPLETE Enhanced AR15 Bolt carrier group (BCG) (new).

Almost everything on this safe queen upper is in fantastic condition.  


$1,550.00/OBO (After checking all of Armslist in the US I feel this is fairly priced, and I saw an upper not as nice as this sell on gun broker for more).

Lightweight polymer body is impact resistant from -40F to 180F, wonât dent like steel and weights the same as aluminum  The L5AWM fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs combing the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine. L5AWM has the reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine.  Unique to the AWM is the one piece wrap-around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips wonât bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage.  An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.

I personally haven't seen any .22LR for sale in a retail store in about 2 months. The only reason I have these is they were purchased a while ago.  These are likely the last ones I'll have for sale for a long time.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .22lr ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't delay. These are going FAST.

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales. 2 box minimum on orders I have to ship.

I have a P.C.P. high end air rifle for sale or trade. Absolutely nothing is wrong with this rifle, and if you are tired of going to the range or have a small yard, this may be the answer for you. This rifle is not considered a firearm, so it opens new doors to where you can shoot. 
Equipped with this rifle is a shroud, which acts like a real silencer, without the paperwork, registration and hassle. Nobody will know where you shoot from, and even if they did, they wouldn't be able to really say anything about it as long as you aren't doing property damage or shooting people. People laugh when they try to take a pellet gun serious, but honestly the only difference between this and a .22lr firearm is the fire. This rifle is capable of velocities up to 1400 feet per second with .25 caliber 26 grain polymer tipped hollow point pellets. It is by no means a toy. Technically, by law, it is!  (Federal and state) However, THE RIFLE DOES NOT COME WITH A SCOPE!!!!!! The scope in the pictures is worth more than $500 anyways, which is overkill.  In all I have over $2,000 into this build. If you have any decent pistols or rifles worth at least $800 then offer them for trade if they just sit under your bed collecting dust. Remember, without the scope I have put over  $1300 into this package.
I will show a buyer how to operate the rifle, and fill the 3,000psi air reservoir for a 45 shot round of hunting/shooting. You probably shouldn't plink with this rifle in a residential area. Always check your back stop. Serious Inquiries Only! That means you either have something worth $800 for trade, or a combination of gun and money works too.  
**Michigan** Considers this to be a firearm, by definition of the law. Check the ordinances in your area to make sure you can legally own this.  I will meet a serious buyer/trade half way  from Mishawaka, IN. Call or email for more pictures and info. #REDACTED

This is the LE6920 model that includes the KAC Carbine Rail, Ambi. Selector Switch, H2 Buffer and M4 profile barrel. It includes a lot of extra parts and accessories. Here is a list of parts that were added on after purchase that will be included in the sale of the rifle.

Surefire M900A Quick Detatch Vertical grip with light 

This is the LE6920 with the highly sought after M1A1 rollmarks. I bought the rifle new 3 months ago (pre panic)  for $1600, the EOTech Optics were another $1100, the Surefire was $500 and the rest of the extra parts were another $300-$400 or so... I am not looking to rip anyone off, but I do think that because of the current AR market, a slight mark up on the Colt is not unreasonable. If you are looking for a GREAT, RELIABLE rifle that has EVERYTHING YOU WOULD EVER NEED already installed.... 

This rifle is not only a great shooter, but since its a Colt, it will hold its value better than any AR out there... especially considering the rare rollmark. $3500 OBO. Really the only trade I would be interested in is a KAC SR-15 E3."

This is a nice handgun. I bought it last year shortly after they were first announced back in September with all the intentions to keep it forever, but have now decided to sell. The handgun retails for about $850.00 (this is the two tone one, the all black one is $100 less) The handgun comes with 10 total high cap mags. These mags sell for about $60.00 each at Specialty Sports. (that is IF!!! you can actually find them). Anyway I'm asking $1,200 for everything. That puts the prices @ $850 for the gun (3 mags in box), and $50.00 pr individual packaged mag(7). This deal is actually cheaper than retail if you think about it (NO TAX). If you want to buy the mags only and not the gun then I'll sell the mags separately at $65.00 each or $60 for all 7.

The SIG SAUERÂ® P226Â® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleetâs special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.
