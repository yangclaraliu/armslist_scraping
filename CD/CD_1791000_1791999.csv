It blued (Royal blue).  It is in great mechanical condition.  It locks up tight and the cylinder timing is perfect.  It does have some holster ware on the end of the barrel and on the cylinder.  If looks like it was probably a police officer's service revolver.  The grips are houge rubber grips.   I do not have the original grips.

  Now for what it is made of . It is made of heavy leather and filled with tightly packed lead shot in the end . The one I have here is 10.5 inches long end to end . makes for a nasty knot on the head of the target perp.

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. 

The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. Proudly made in the USA, all Heritage revolvers combine quality with affordability...an American tradition!

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.
The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome.

Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver. Proudly made in the USA, all Heritage revolvers combine quality with affordability...an American tradition!

Rarely a handgun comes along that so captivates the mind and movie lore as much as the S&W 629 Classic Deluxe .44 magnum revolver. Capable of taking down animals as big as Cape Buffalo, and heavily relied on as bear stoppers throughout Alaska. This revolver is big, mean, and you darn sure don't want to be on the business end.

The S&W Model 629 Classic Deluxe or Classic DX as it is commonly referred to as. This beauty has a 6.5 inch barrel and a satin stainless finish. This revolver shoots the venerable .44 Magnum and was at one time, as Clint Eastwood said in Dirty Harry, the most powerful handgun in the world. 
Harry Callahan used it to blow the bad guys head clean off, and trust me when I say that it certainly could do just that.

Specifications
22 Long Rifle
40-grain, round-nose bullets
Blackened, Plated for reduced fouling
1,255 fps muzzle velocity


Designed specifically for the high-volume shooter using high-capacity magazines. These 40-grain, blackened, round-nose bullets are highly accurate, plated for reduced fouling and enhanced function and they maintain reliable feeding in high-capacity magazines. Clean burning powder produces consistent chamber pressure and delivers a 1,255 fps muzzle velocity. Noncorrosive primers for consistent, sure-fire ignition.

Good target and hunting ammo in the plastic box where the top slides to access the ammo. This is not cheap bulk crappy ammo this is good stuff. Never had one not fire or cycle in any rifle or pistol I have ever owned.
