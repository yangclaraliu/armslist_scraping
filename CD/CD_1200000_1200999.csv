Free shipping with $75 order

The SE-2 is the first and only AR-15 pistol grip to be integrated with an ambidextrous sling mount. The SE-2 is available in two versions. The Hook Mount provides a loop compatible with most common sling hooks; The Swivel Mount allows the attachment of push-button sling swivels.

The SE-2's sling mount is located above the hand and below the buffer tube, with a low profile design that stays out of the way of even fully collapsed M4-style stocks. When added to AR pistols, the SE-2 provides excellent one-handed control while providing sling attachment that doesn't clutter up the receiver extension.

Extensive strength testing has been performed on the SE-2 to ensure a reliable attachment point that you can depend on.

Just like the original SE-1 Pistol Grip, the design of the SE-2 enhances weapon ergonomics and functionality, bringing M16, M4 and AR-15 style weapons to a higher level of control and comfort. The grip has been designed for a wide range of hand sizes and shooting demands. Features include a smooth integral trigger guard to increase comfort, textured surface for added grip and storage for batteries or other equipment.

The SE-2 Sling Grip is available in Black, Flat Dark Earth"

104,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1200104,For Sale:  NEW IN PACKAGE MD ARMS SAIGA 12 DRUM (3 covers),"Ashland, Medford, Oregon",$ 110,"Listed On: Sunday, July 7, 2013",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Email me to arrange meeting/pick-up.   Making a few bucks on the funnest  hobby in this great capitalist Country stimulates the economy and is not worth sending nasty emails, kids.  

Each MD-20 drum now comes with a smoke rear cover installed and also includes a spare clear and black cover. 

Lifetime Warranty!

Imitated but very far from duplicated!

What sets the MD-20 apart from others?

Tried and proven design with real time use!

Unequaled reliability and durability!

Less friction from moving parts and feedlips!

At 2 lbs, the MD-20 is close to 6 ounces lighter than the imitator. And even though our drum is much lighter it is still stronger because it's weight was added for strength while the imitator's weight was added for low cost, ease of manufacturing.

Design Simplicity, 3 moving & 15 total parts!

Easier to load the MD-20 from the top than it is to use the imitator's load assist.

Locks into gun tight with virtually no movement!

The MD-20's rear cover is recessed in the drum body protecting it's locking points and better reinforcing both cover and body.

Our smoke cover is usable in much lower light conditions than the imitator.

The MD-20 is the best because it was built because we personally wanted it for ourselves, not just to have another item to sale to the masses...

The MD-20, Saiga-12 drum mag is made of only the best materials available. It loads 2 3/4inch shells and has a simple design with very few moving parts for the utmost in reliability, durability, and ease of maintenance. Our drum is made entirely in the USA! The MD-20 can be stored loaded!

Three rear cover styles included. Use the cover style you like best!!!

Please note: Some Saiga-12's will require fitting of the mag due to inconsistent factory tolerance of the gun. If your mag doesn't lock into your gun please carefully read your MD-20 User's Guide provided with every mag and also watch our fitting video by clicking this FITTING VIDEO LINK. This is super simple to do. Just read, watch, and understand BEFORE you fit. Not all Saiga-12's will require you to fit the mag.

Also depending on your gun's factory gas block and factory gas plug you may have problems cycling SOME high brass ammos from our drum. And the Promag drum is just the same but has a weaker feed... The factory gas plug offers a very low range of adjustment, especially considering how much 12ga ammo varies in power. Some 12ga ammos over gas the Saiga-12. And some Saiga-12's are a lot worse than others with a much wider range of ammo that will over gas it. There is a simple and cheap fix to all of this no matter what your gun's system is like. The MD Arms V-Plug. It installs in minutes simply by unscrewing the factory plug and screwing the V-Plug back in it's place.

As a gun community we need to come together to rid ourselves of one of the deadliest sins - greed. We are all tired of seeing $500 AK-47s listed at $2000, and $800 fully upgraded AR-15s posted for $4500. Guess what? As gun buyers and members on this and other forums, we are just as responsible for the state of our society as the price gougers and hoarders. We need to come together and do two thing: (1) STOP BUYING AT THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES and (2) click on the ad, go to ""Flag"" at the top, and press ""overpriced."" This whole process takes 1.3968 seconds.

I have upset a few of the posters here as being a socialist. I am far from that - I believe as a community we can police our own good and bad behavior. Helping each other and fair profits are a good behavior. I consider gouging a bad behavior. If you consider it an acceptable behavior, buy from them at the inflated prices.

These folks only have a business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement. NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing but we have the Boulder Airlift from Magpul to cover our AR15 needs, and we can also find many of these same things now online. Use a search engine to save yourself big bucks.

I personally believe every time I skip over a $10,000 ad for a $3000 purchased SCAR 17, I have just became part of the problem. Send them an email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly flag their ad so we can get prices back to where they all belong.

I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy and paste it to another state's listing in the US or repost later today or tomorrow. The average life span of this post is about 20 minutes.

Add your own two cents in if you'd like or if I got anything wrong. The price regularity will only return if we make it. I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns below:

AR-15: $600-$1300 depending on brand and usage (shots fired, wear, etc..)
AK-47: $400-$900 $400 for WASR, $900 for BNIB Arsenal
SKS:$300-$500
SCAR 16/17: $2000/$2800
AR-10: $1000-1500
Glock: $400-600
10/22: $229
ACR: $2000
1911: $600-1100
9mm ammo: $0.30/round is on the higher end
223/5.56: $0.40/round is on the higher end
.308/7.62 NATO: maybe up to $1/round (but on high side)
.22: $0.05/round is high

These are all prices that the sellers on here bought for. In most cases, they bought these guns for a lot less. I got most of my AR-15s for $600 and fully upgraded them for a total of $900. Anytime someone posts a Olympic Arms AR-15 on here, they directly insult everyone's intelligence. They think we are not wise enough to know they paid a total of $500 for the thing.

Again, feel free to add your $0.02, make changes, repost, and if you believe they are overpriced flag them."

If you are truly interested, I will send photo of the actual rifle.  The rifle has less than 500 rounds through it, and shoots great.  I have a couple of these rifles and need to unload one to help pay for my 4 wheeler.  It also has a match grade trigger, and I still have the original trigger to go with it.  It also has an improved flash suppressor, as well as the original (they mount via a quick connect)

This Bushmaster Carbon 15 Type 97S weighs in at 4.3 pounds. This rifle features a receiver, buttstock, and forend molded of Carbon Fiber material that offers incredible durability, strength and ultra-light weight. Carbon 15 material is unaffected by sunlight, water, oxidation or corrosion, and requires only minimal lubrication.

The Bushmaster Carbon 15 Type 97S Rifle has a fluted, stainless steel, 16"" match grade barrel offering light weight, outstanding accuracy, and corrosion resistance. It is fitted with a unique Quick Detach Compensator that reduces muzzle rise and felt recoil. This 1 x 9 rifled barrel is chambered for the powerful 5.56mm NATO Cartridge but also accepts the more common .223 Remington. Barrel fluting - eight deep longitudinal grooves - offers increased cooling and further reduces barrel weight. 

The Type 97S Upper Receiver and Forend features an anodized aluminum Picatinny rail that is the full length of both receiver and forend. It includes integral front and rear iron sights. The windage adjustable Rear Sight is a combination ghost ring and precision 200 yard aperture flip-up. The square post front sight offers elevation adjustments for fine zeroing. The Picatinny rail allows the option of mounting a wide variety of auxiliary sighting systems such as long eye relief or standard scopes, red dot, holographic, or laser sights.

Function controls on the Carbon 15 Type 97S Rifle operate much like standard AR15 type rifles. The exceptions are a unique release lever allowing the removal of the Carbon Fiber buttstock for storage and carrying convenience, and an Ambidextrous Safety Selector Lever. Selector markings are color-coded on both sides of the Lower Receiver for quick firing status checks. The magazine release button, Carbon 15 charging handle and takedown and pivot pins all function like the standard AR15. For ergonomic comfort, the Lower Receiver is fitted with a Hogue OverMolded pistol grip, and the Carbon Fiber Forend is molded in a comfortable oval shape with a non-slip stipple finish.

This rifle also has a Tactical ""Multi-Carry Mode"" Sling, 10 Round Magazine, and the Bushmaster hard plastic, lockable carrying case. 

Price is for rifle only.  Shipping and handling will be extra, to be determined at time of sale.  Prefer to sell locally for cash."

TRIJICON GL01 NIGHT SIGHTS 3-DOT FOR GLOCKS 9 AND 40


Trijicon Bright & Tough(TM) Night Sights are three-dot iron
sights that increase night-fire shooting accuracy by as much
as five times over conventional sights. Equally impressive,
they do so with the same speed as instinctive shooting - and
without the need for batteries. Housed in a metal body and
cushioned within silicone rubber, Bright & Tough Night Sights
feature a unique shock- resistant design that is patented by
Trijicon. Each lamp is capped with a sapphire jewel to help
evenly distribute the light while protecting the lamp from
solvents and puncture. Contained within aluminum cylinders for
additional protection, the lamps are mounted on silicone
rubber cushions to withstand shock and heavy recoil. Green
lamps are warranted for 12 years from the date of
manufacture.

As a gun community we need to come together to rid ourselves of one of the deadliest sins - greed. We are all tired of seeing $500 AK-47s listed at $2000, and $800 fully upgraded AR-15s posted for $4500. Guess what? As gun buyers and members on this and other forums, we are just as responsible for the state of our society as the price gougers and hoarders. We need to come together and do two thing: (1) STOP BUYING AT THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES and (2) click on the ad, go to ""Flag"" at the top, and press ""overpriced."" This whole process takes 1.3968 seconds.

I have upset a few of the posters here as being a socialist. I am far from that - I believe as a community we can police our own good and bad behavior. Helping each other and fair profits are a good behavior. I consider gouging a bad behavior. If you consider it an acceptable behavior, buy from them at the inflated prices.

These folks only have a business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement. NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing but we have the Boulder Airlift from Magpul to cover our AR15 needs, and we can also find many of these same things now online. Use a search engine to save yourself big bucks.

I personally believe every time I skip over a $10,000 ad for a $3000 purchased SCAR 17, I have just became part of the problem. Send them an email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly flag their ad so we can get prices back to where they all belong.

I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy and paste it to another state's listing in the US or repost later today or tomorrow. The average life span of this post is about 20 minutes.

Add your own two cents in if you'd like or if I got anything wrong. The price regularity will only return if we make it. I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns below:

AR-15: $600-$1300 depending on brand and usage (shots fired, wear, etc..)
 AK-47: $400-$900 $400 for WASR, $900 for BNIB Arsenal
 SKS:$300-$500
 SCAR 16/17: $2000/$2800
 AR-10: $1000-1500
 Glock: $400-600
 10/22: $229
 ACR: $2000
 1911: $600-1100
 9mm ammo: $0.30/round is on the higher end
 223/5.56: $0.40/round is on the higher end
 .308/7.62 NATO: maybe up to $1/round (but on high side)
 .22: $0.05/round is high

These are all prices that the sellers on here bought for. In most cases, they bought these guns for a lot less. I got most of my AR-15s for $600 and fully upgraded them for a total of $900. Anytime someone posts a Olympic Arms AR-15 on here, they directly insult everyone's intelligence. They think we are not wise enough to know they paid a total of $500 for the thing. 

Again, feel free to add your $0.02, make changes, repost, and if you believe they are overpriced flag them."

The 8 inch models are very hard to come by. This one is in excellent shape with only a couple of minor handling marks. With box and paperwork.
The Colt Python is a double action handgun chambered for the .357 Magnum cartridge, built on Colt's large I-frame. Pythons have a reputation for accuracy, smooth trigger pull, and a tight cylinder lock-up.
The Colt Python was first introduced in 1955 as Colt's top-of-the-line model and was originally intended to be a large-frame 38 Special target revolver. As a result, it features precision adjustable sights, a smooth trigger, solid construction, and extra metal. Pythons have a distinct appearance due to a full barrel underlug, ventilated rib and adjustable sights. Originally, Colt manufactured Pythons with hollow underlugs but left them solid to work as a stabilizing barrel weight. When the revolver is at full cock, just as the trigger is pressed, the cylinder locks up for the duration of the hammer strike. Other revolvers have a hint of looseness even at full-cock. The gap between the cylinder and forcing cone is very tight, further aiding accuracy and velocity. Each Python revolver was boresighted at the factory with a laser and was the first mass-produced revolver to do so.
In October 1999, Colt Manufacturing Co. announced the termination of its production of Python revolvers. In a 2000 follow-up letter to distributors, the company cited changing market conditions and the costs of defending lawsuits, as the reasons for the discontinuation of the Python line as well as a number of other models. The Colt Custom Gun Shop continued making a limited number of Pythons on special order until 2005, when even this limited production was terminated.
The Python was originally available in two finishes: Royal Blue and Bright Nickel. The Bright Nickel model was discontinued with the introduction of the more durable satin stainless and mirror-polished Ultimate Stainless models. The stainless steel and Royal Blue finishes were offered until 2003 by Colt on the Python ""Elite"" model.
Pythons were available with 2.5-inch (6.4 cm), 3-inch (7.6 cm), 4-inch (10 cm), 6-inch (15 cm) and 8-inch (20 cm) barrels. The six-inch model was the most popular generally, and the 8-inch model was intended for hunting. A 3-inch barrel version is very collectible, although not rare.
The Python Hunter model, with 8-inch barrel and factory-installed 2X Leupold scope, was made in 1980. The Python Hunter was the first field-ready handgun hunting package made by a major handgun manufacturer. The scope was mounted on the barrel using Redfield mounts and the gun was packaged in a Haliburton case. It was discontinued by 1990 and briefly offered as a ""Custom Shop"" model afterward. A Python Target model was made for several years in .38 Special only, in blue and nickel finishes.
Two variants of the Python were made in small numbers by Colt. The first was the Colt Boa of 1985, a limited production .357 Magnum revolver, made for the Lew Horton Distributing Company in Massachusetts. It used a Python barrel mated to a Trooper Mk V frame. Six hundred 6-inch revolvers and 600 4-inch revolvers were made, of which 100 were matched sets. Though it resembles a Python visually, it is substantially different internally. The second was the stainless steel Colt Grizzly of 1994, another limited production .357 Magnum revolver. It used a Python barrel mated to a Colt King Cobra frame. 500 of these revolvers were manufactured, with 6-inch Magna-Ported barrels and smooth, unfluted cylinders. The ported barrel includes a bear footprint. Similar to the Grizzly was the Colt Kodiak, which was a Colt Anaconda with a Magna-Ported Barrel and an unfluted cylinder. Approximately 2000 Kodiaks were8According to Colt historian, R.L. Wilson, Colt Pythons have been collected by Elvis Presley and various kings in the traditional sense: ""H.M. (His Majesty) Hussein I of Jordan ordered a limited number of Pythons, in 4-inch and 6-inch barrels, as gifts to his selected friends. Casing and barrel were embossed with His Majesty's crest. The Python for King Juan Carlos of Spain bore his name in flush gold on the sideplate. Among other celebrated recipients: King Khalid and Prince Fahed (Saudi Arabia), King Hassan (Morocco), Sheik Zyed (United Arab Emirates), President Anwar Sadat and President Hafez Assad (Syria)."""

I went to the Saxet gun show on Sunday 3/3/13 and the very best price I saw on any 7.62x39 was one dealer who had one box of Tula FMJ non laquered at $519+ tax for a total of $561.  Most dealers were selling cases for $600 to $800 and believe it or not some were asking even more.  I did see several cases sell for the $600 and $700 prices.  I chose not to speak to people looking at ammo dealers because I felt it wasn't right to try to steal their customers.



Anyway, with all that being said I am selling my cases at $500 each firm.  I have sold them for as much as $550 so I know I can get more but I am looking to move some cases quick.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvLt8-Wf7r0
if for any reason you're concerned about how hard it might be to install I'll do it for you when we meet. just bring your rifle with a collapsible stock.

I bought it and put it on my AR. I ran several clips through my rifle and had a blast but a) my gun is mainly home defense so full auto isn't exactly required and b) my wife wants me to unload some gun stuff to raise a little cash. So I took it right back off my rifle and put it back in the bubble wrap and in the box.

It is in brand new condition with all the bits and pieces in the box including both parts in the original bubble wrap, paper work, and the allen wrench it came with.

$375 for the stock and like I said, I'll install it for your on a collapsible stock rifle if you want me too. No shipping costs, no waiting on backorders. This stock is listed in the new ""assault weapons ban"" bill. Once that thing passes you won't be able to get these anymore."

Comes with a choke installed (not sure what kind, it's what came with the gun and I've never changed it.) 5 round magazine capacity. I purchased it lightly used in April 2005 and have put about 500 rounds through it with zero malfunctions. It is completely reliable and incredibly fun to shoot. Everyone has always been impressed by how far I've been able to hit targets with this gun when seemingly out of range - I think the full length 28"" barrel is to thank for that. The only bad thing about this gun is that one time while transporting it I put the barrel and stock together in the same case with the vent rib touching the stock. The bumpy truck ride caused the vent rib to scratch the wood in a couple places (see pics) - but hey do you want to shoot it or look at it? Speaking of the stock, I really love the dark walnut type of color this gun has as opposed to some of the lighter looking 870s out there.

The frame is machined from one solid piece of stainless steel (not 2 separate side pieces screwed together like a S&W). They are known to be very accurate, and are rugged enough to handle a a regular diet of full power magnum ""hot"" loads with no issues for a lifetime. This is a rare DAO spurless hammer model, making it a great gun for carry or personal / home defense. It has not just had the spur cut off (""bobbed""), it was produced from the factory this way and has only double action. With no single action option, should it ever need to be used in a defensive situation there will be no spilt second decisions needing to be made on whether or not to cock the hammer, or doing so out of reflex, because it is impossible to do and impossible to develop that habit in practicing which is the purpose of this design. This is the gun you want your wife to grab when a BG is in the house. Point and shoot, period. It will have a consistent trigger pull every time, will never fail to fire when you need it to, and the .357 magnum is one of the most destructive man stopping rounds made. Heavy duty weapon but not too heavy, just heavy enough to help manage recoil to stay on target. It has the original factory rubber grips with walnut side panels that are very comfortable, and a 4"" barrel."

Rifle comes fully set up with 1-4X optics and full Picatinny top rail. Up to 30 rounds of Alexander Arms .50 caliber ammo ammo available for purchase ($2.00/round).
Alexander Arms® is the originator of the large-caliber, .50 Beowulf®, AR-15 style weapon concept. As the leader in the field, we manufacture the best and most reliable weapons. We have an intimate understanding of the function of both the rifle and the ammunition and have in-depth data on both internal, external, and terminal ballistics. In a world of followers, we lead. The .50 Beowulf® was designed to generate devastating stopping power at short to moderate ranges. Combining the rugged reliability of the AR-15/M16 style weapons with a unique .500 inch projectile and cartridge, this semi-automatic weapon is ideal as a brush hunting weapon and is capable of knocking down virtually anything you may run across. For wild pig hunting, the rifle is without equal and is being used not only by hunters, but by game control agencies as well. Deer in close cover are easily taken with solid hits guaranteeing one shot kills and little or no tracking. The same reliable combination of heavy, large-diameter bullets and moderate velocities enable the .50 Beowulf® to tackle the largest game animals found in North America and it has been used against elk, buffalo, and bear with superb results. Providing a semi-automatic, light-carbine with the performance of the venerable 45-70 rifle, the .50 Beowulf® has found wide acceptance with military and law enforcement agencies. The external ballistics of the .50 Beowulf® cartridge are well-suited to urban environments where the shorter range template allows for more flexible application and the large projectile energy delivered by the ammunition can disable both motor vehicles and assailants with body armor. Windscreen glass does not affect the trajectory of the bullet, nor do automotive body panels. With frangible projectiles, the .50 Beowulf® can be used on most training facilities without damage and, with the addition of a muzzle brake to provide a stand-off, can be used for building entry. The combination of devastating stopping power and absolute reliability in a lightweight, familiar form factor, the .50 Beowulf® rifle from Alexander Arms® is simply without equal."

The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.

Comes with one magazine. Upper with only two boxes down range. Rifle comes fully set up with full Picatinny top rail and A2 style flip up, fully adjustable rear sight & detachable front sight with carry handle. BALLISTIC TIP AMMO shown in picture INCLUDED.
16"" M4 style with A2 flash hider, chrome-lined barrel with 1:7.5 twist, mid-length hand-guard. 
The 6.5mm Grendel (6.5×38mm) is an intermediate cartridge designed by Bill Alexander and Janne Pohjoispaa as a low recoil, high accuracy, 200-800 yard cartridge specifically for the AR-15 platform. Since its introduction it has proven an excellent and versatile design and is now expanding out into other platforms including bolt action rifles and the Kalashnikov system.
The name ""6.5mm Grendel"" was a trademark owned by Alexander Arms until February 15, 2012 when it was legally released to allow the cartridge to become SAAMI standardized. The release of the trademark removes the requirement of manufacturers to seek the permission of the trademark holder to use the mark.
The 6.5mm Grendel design goal was to create an effective 200-800 yard AR-15 magazine length loaded cartridge for the AR-15 platform that surpassed the performance of the native 5.56 NATO / 223 Remington cartridge. Constrained by the length of the 5.56 mm NATO round, the Grendel designers decided to use a shorter, larger diameter case for higher powder volume while allowing space for long, streamlined, high ballistic coefficient (BC) bullets. Firing factory loaded ammunition loaded with bullets ranging from 90 to 129 grains (5.8–8.4 g), its muzzle velocity ranges from 2,500 ft/s (760 m/s) with 129- and 130-grain (8.4 g) bullets to 2,900 ft/s (880 m/s) with 90 gr (5.8 g) bullets (similar in velocity to a 5.56 mm 77-grain (5.0 g) round).
The case head diameter of the Grendel is the same as that of the parent case the .220 Russian, the 7.62×39mm, and the famous PPC cases and is larger than the 5.56×45mm NATO, thereby necessitating the use of a non-standard AR-15 bolt. The increased case diameter results in a small reduction in the capacity of standard size M16/AR15 magazines. A Grendel magazine with the same dimensions as a STANAG 30-round 5.56 magazine will hold 26 rounds of 6.5mm ammunition."
