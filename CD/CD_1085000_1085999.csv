Remington® R-25™ Tactical Semi-Auto Rifle

        20"", chromoly steel free-floating, button-rifled, fluted barrel
        Recessed hunting muzzle crown
        Lightweight and ergonomic, it points instinctively
        Receiver-length Picatinny rail for optics
        Clean-breaking trigger is factory set to 4-1/2 lbs.
        Comes with a four-round magazine

Engineered with today’s big-game hunter in mind, the R-25 boasts some of the most advanced design features available in AR-style rifles. The 20"", chromoly free-floating, button-rifled barrel helps even the beginning marksman shoot tighter groups. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block increase rigidity, reduce weight and enhance barrel cooling. A recessed hunting muzzle crown aids accuracy as well. Much of the barrel is surrounded by a machined-aluminum forend tube. The R-25’s overall light weight and ergonomic design make handling it a joy. It points instinctively, and a receiver-length Picatinny rail atop the action accommodates your choice of optics or accessories. The clean-breaking, single-stage hunting trigger is factory set to 4-1/2 lbs. For concealment, the R-25 is covered in Mossy Oak® Treestand® camo. Includes a four-round magazine, making them legal for hunting in most states. Compatible with magazines and accessories that fit other AR-type rifles chambered for .308 Winchester-based cartridges."

Although the ammo is available, these rifles are not. Very hard to find a complete S&W. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. Please just compare apples to apples. Complete M&P15R to complete M&P15R, that is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of their rare discontinued status these will continue to climb in value even after the market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson is pleased to announce the M&P15R Rifle (along with the new Upper Receiver Assembly). This new rifle is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifles come with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.

Although the ammo is available, these rifles are not. Very hard to find a complete S&W. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. Please just compare apples to apples. Complete M&P15R to complete M&P15R, that is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of their rare discontinued status these will continue to climb in value even after the market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson is pleased to announce the M&P15R Rifle (along with the new Upper Receiver Assembly). This new rifle is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge.

Being kind of specific on what im looking for, I would prefer a multi gun trade equal to mine in value, but may take gun +/- cash depending on what you have. 

Im NOT looking for the following, shotguns, .22 rifles, AK's, SKS, Sig pistols, hunting rifles other than .270, 1911-.22 pistols.

This is not a ""panic buy"" price but an actual current market value for a collectible caliber rifle upper. Although the ammo is available, these rifle uppers are not. They are very hard to find. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. That is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of these uppers are no longer in production they will continue to rise in value even after the ""panic buy""  market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson introduced the M&P15R Rifle Upper Receiver Assembly). This rifle upper is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifle upper comes with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.

Looking to pay a fair price in cash or trade (mags, ammo, maybe random gun stuff) based on the model and condition. I'm not desperate so skip the MSRP plus for used stuff offers. Worst case I can buy a DPMS sight for $69 from Midway.

These retail for around $200.  They are the basic level night vision optics, but operate effectively.  Mil spec gen 2 or 3 are going to run anywhere from $500-2000.  If you are interesting in trading varmint tipped .223 ammo, preferrably hornady then please shoot me a reply.  Please don't send me unreasonable offers, I have been buying ammo before the fad and actually need this stuff.  I figure this is worth around 120-150 rds of varmint depending on brand and what kind it is.  I'm not trying to make any money or lose any so if you have a fair trade and are interested I'm your guy.

It's kind of crappy when you go to 5 different sporting goods stores and can't even buy any of the ammo your looking for and you see 20 guys on here that probably aren't even interested in shooting and just want to make a buck.  I guess you can argue either way,and I have seen people saying its messed up, and I have seen people defending their actions based on free market ideals.  I can see both ways, but to the one who is saying its a free market and supply and demand that's great and all but also when you guys are buying up all of it at cabelas and other places and sit on it you are manipulating the supply. Really there are plenty,and the ammo stores are churning out more than ever.  It's just people realize they can charge 2-3 times what the retail cost is that is messed up.  Anyway I'm going to wind down my rant.

This is what I have to trade plus night vision monocular:

- crimson trace full size 1911 laser grips
- workout bike (Biodyne 140 upright bike)
- kayak (perception sparc w/ your choice of two different paddles and a skirt mount)
- telescope (pretty nice Orion ShortTube 80 w/ equatorial mount)
- back inverter (ironman)
- inflatable kayak w/ paddle (fits inside small bag you can carry, great for prepped and survivalist)
- WD TV live hub (has a 1tb hard drive media player, and also all features of a roku box, is wireless)
- Apple 500gb time capsule (great for backing up those important documents)

I am liquidating a collection of firearms.  I have several shotguns, a revolver, a couple black powder guns, and a rifle listed for sale.  I will consider selling the entire collection in one lot.  All meetings to view any of these guns will take place at Bullseye Marksman Gun Club in Cumming.  They are located just off GA400 exit 13. Please do not bother to email and ask me to meet elsewhere as I will not respond.  Also, the reason I list a price is that is what I am selling it for.  Don't email and ask me ""what is your best price"" as I can tell you now, my price is what you see here.  Also, if the ad is up, it's still for sale.  I don't meet there for the purpose of transfers, it's just a safe location for both buyer and seller.  I will need to see a valid GA drivers license, and would like to see a GA CWL.  As with any firearm sale, I reserve the right to not sell to anyone, especially those who I deem as sketchy."

 I just got the pistol a couple months ago, but only used it once..
 It had no FTF or FTEs,shot about 150 rounds flawlessly.Of 6 different kinds.

 A good first gun by far, Im just looking to get a CC handgun.
 Anyways It comes with 5 Smart Reloader 100 round cases(New) worth $12 
Also comes with a brand new Sightmark Sureshot Reflex Sight(Red Dot)worth $50.It has 4 different patterns in red and brightness adjustment to from 1-7..
 Also comes with microfiber cleaning cloth and rubber cover for lens.Also paper packaging that came with it..Also comes with a HKS .22 Speed Loader(worth $5)
 The gun comes just like new with Beretta hard case and CA certified lock and 2 mags also all paperwork.
 So originally the gun is $250 w/tax=around $275 w/backgroundcheck = $300
 The Red Dot is $50 w/tax=around $54
 The HKS Loader is $5 something w/tax
 and the Smart Reloader Cases equal out to about $13

The 21"" barrel has the rifle sights for slugs.  It accepts both 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells.  The 870 is the best selling shotgun in history.  The quality is unquestionable, and the 870 is one of the most desired shotguns in the world.  $425 Cash only, no trades (I also have an 870 Express 410 for sale and it is identical in finish to this 12, would make a great father/son combo set!)

Also, I have had several inquiries about shipping this shotgun and out of state buyers wanting to pick it up face to face.  Current BATFE rules and regulations state I CANNOT sell a firearm to anyone not a resident of my home state (GA) without going through a licensed FFL dealer and filling out a form 4473.  I can ship it to your local FFL dealer of choice after receiving a copy of the FFL dealers license, and the buyer will have to pay the $25 outgoing FFL transfer fee from my local dealer.

I am liquidating a collection of firearms.  I have several shotguns, a revolver, a couple black powder guns, and a rifle listed for sale.  I will consider selling the entire collection in one lot.  All meetings to view any of these guns will take place at Bullseye Marksman Gun Club in Cumming.  They are located just off GA400 exit 13.  Please do not bother to email and ask me to meet elsewhere as I will not respond.  Also, the reason I list a price is that is what I am selling it for.  Don't email and ask me ""what is your best price"" as I can tell you now, my price is what you see here.  Also, if the ad is up, it's still for sale.  I don't meet there for the purpose of transfers, it's just a safe location for both buyer and seller.  I will need to see a valid GA drivers license, and would like to see a GA CWL.  As with any firearm sale, I reserve the right to not sell to anyone, especially those who I deem as sketchy."

434,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1085434,For Sale:  Remington 870 Express .410 {Pending Sale},"Cumming, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 425,"Listed On: Tuesday, March 26, 2013",Shotguns,Remington                                                                                ,410                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"{This 870 is Pending Sale on Saturday 3-31)
This Remington 870 Express .410 is in like new condition, having rarely been fired.  It has a 25"" barrel and accepts the 3 inch shell.  The .410 version of the 870 was a very low production model.  The number of these for sale at any given time is quite low.  These guns are quite desirable, especially for young boys getting their first shotgun.  This one is about as close to new as you could get without it still being sealed in the box.  It weighs 5.75 pounds.  The 870 Remington is the best selling shotgun in history.  It's quality is unquestionable.  $425 Cash only, no trades.

(I have been asked a couple times about the year of production.  The date code on the barrel is DL, which would decode into September of 1991----This gun was first released in 1992 so I'd have to assume this was one of the earliest produced of the 410 variety)

Also, I have had several inquiries about shipping this shotgun and out of state buyers wanting to pick it up face to face.  Current BATFE rules and regulations state I CANNOT sell a firearm to anyone not a resident of my home state (GA) without going through a licensed FFL dealer and filling out a form 4473.  I can ship it to your local FFL dealer of choice after receiving a copy of the FFL dealers license, and the buyer will have to pay the $25 outgoing FFL transfer fee from my local dealer.

I am liquidating a collection of firearms.  I have several shotguns, a revolver, a couple black powder guns, and a rifle listed for sale.  I will consider selling the entire collection in one lot.  All meetings to view any of these guns will take place at Bullseye Marksman Gun Club in Cumming.  They are located just off GA400 exit 13.  Please do not bother to email and ask me to meet elsewhere as I will not respond.  Also, the reason I list a price is that is what I am selling it for.  Don't email and ask me ""what is your best price"" as I can tell you now, my price is what you see here.  Also, if the ad is up, it's still for sale.  I don't meet there for the purpose of transfers, it's just a safe location for both buyer and seller.  I will need to see a valid GA drivers license, and would like to see a GA CWL.  As with any firearm sale, I reserve the right to not sell to anyone, especially those who I deem as sketchy.

Also, if you don't have the means to purchase this gun, or you just want to hassle me about price or shipping or whatever, don't bother emailing me.  I'm sick of waiting for those who email me that they ""will take it!"" only to back out or stop responding.  I have only so much time I can spend online most days, and here lately I'm wasting quite a bit of time with folks who seem to be in such a hurry to buy, then only to get shipping prices and FFL paperwork and the buyer change their mind."

I took this shotgun by the local range today, Feb 20th, and upon inspection they said that it is in excellent condition, and appears to have been fired very little. It is still tight and 100% functional.  After some research, I found that Riverside arms was a trade name owned by J. Stevens Arms Company who purchased Crescent Arms, and who was later bought by Savage who produced them until 1948. (This is the best information I can find, however I do not know the accuracy of it as such so the buyer should do due diligence)  Being that this gun was manufactured prior to 1968, it doesn't have a serial number since they weren't required.  These models were what was considered the ""hardware store"" version of the Stevens shotguns.  They weren't the ""top tier"" line quality units.  A little less refined after milling, they were designed to be more affordable given that they were produced from the turn of the century through the great depression and up until WWII.  While considered a ""second Tier"" gun, this was simply the finish (not luxurious) and not indicative of poor quality materials.  Many people still shoot Riverside products to this day, and replacement parts are still available.  While not overly valuable, the craftsmanship was built to last.

Refinished stock and refinished barrel.  Total scrub down of action and barrel making it clean and smooth as it should be.  This gun may have been owned by your grandpa, but looks like you are buying a vintage remake of something new out of the store.  See pictures on the refinish work.  7 ½ pounds, 22 inch barrel.

Sights:  Comes equipped with weaver style mount (not pictured) and the mounting screws.  This 740 is a very serviceable firearm though without a scope using the white metal bead front ramp and the step-adjustable semi-buckhorn rear.

What sets this 740 apart from all the others you see for sale on Gunbroker and on Armslist are two things 1) is the attention to refinishing the stock that was used.  The purchaser of this gun will have a one of a kind.  The flame maple you see was brought out through careful selection of oils and waxes.  The final finish that has been applied makes this a hunt-worthy gun that will stand up to the elements.  There is a hairline crack that has been there for years, and is not growing due to it being repaired long before my ownership.  On ebay people sell unfinished 740 stock blanks for over $225.  Anyone owning this gun has a great hunting rifle that you will be proud to have other’s see.  The great part of the finish that I chose for this, is it doesn’t give up its heritage old looking feel.  It just looks like something bought 50 years ago and stored well.

And number 2) this firearm comes equipped with the regular 4 round magazine as well as the 10 round magazine.  The ten round magazine is not bulky, fits well, and is a great addition to bring the extra firepower you want with you on a long hunt.  New 10 round magazines that fit the 740 run from 50-80 dollars.  It’s just fun to have a 10 round 30-06 too!  Great for hunting in those tight woods where you have minimal time to get off the second shot.  And great for those shots where you need to throw a lot of lead at a deer booking across a field.

Asking $500 or best offer.  Need to make room for my next restoration project.

That's where I can come in. I have the tools and the know-how on hand to ensure your AR is getting the best possible treatment short of sending it back to the factory's quality control department.

I take pride in doing the best job I can possibly provide, and I don't consider myself done until the job is completely done. This attitude comes from the way I was raised along with having done time as a US Marine.
I also price as fairly as possible, and if you need parts I can see about ordering them for you at the fairest price that I can find. My prices range from $10-$50 depending on what you need done; excluding expenses such as gasoline prices (I will charge this only if I have to travel more than 20 miles to my client).

Regarding my AR15 services:
--I can build ARs from the stripped lowers and uppers with parts. 
--I can give advice/counsel on AR15-related subjects (buying compatible parts and ammo, for instance; along with configuring your AR to your specific needs).
--I can diagnose your AR if you're having problems with it at the shooting range.
--I can perform required maintenance (such as a professional-level cleaning job using quality cleaning materials) as necessary for your AR."

I have a spikes tactical lower receiver, CMMG lower parts kit and a extra magpul PMAG that I'm looking to trade only for a glock 19 or 23. 

I would prefer a gen4 but it don't have to be. I can also add cash and or a spikes buffer tube kit (buffer kits aren't here in the mail yet but they will be here by Wednesday. I got tracking for them yesterday.)

I'm not looking to sell these parts and don't need to get rid of them. If I don't find anything by next weekend then I will just go out and buy the glock I'm looking for. Just figured I would try this first

Market value today on these parts are more then a few months ago. I just bought all this stuff within the last few weeks. I know market price is up on your glock too so I'm not trying to rip anyone off

Gun broker and ebay (I have accounts on both) these are selling for

LPK.   $125-150
PMAG $40-45
Buffer $150-175

That's between about 600-700 these parts could get me selling separate but I'm not interested in selling.

Please don't reply that I'm price gouging. That's why I want to trade. If you have what I want and I have what you want, then lets make a deal. If you have a setup that is obviously worth more then mine, then let me know what kind of cash your looking for in your end. Be real though. I have owned and do own quite a few guns and I know what things are worth. 

Also so you are aware of what price gouging is, gouging is when there is a high demand on a NECESSITY that you need to survive. Guns are not one of those thing. Market values on items go up and down everyday in this world. Sorry if you don't like the truth but that's all it is.

Details

The Ambush 6.8 SPCII hunting rifle delivers ample takedown power in a package light enough for the most mobile hunter. The adjustable buttstock gives another way to adjust the rifle to fit you, no matter your size or the clothes you’re wearing. To further augment the Ambush 6.8, we have included modular rail sections and an adjustable indexable foregrip, enhancing your natural shooting position. Outfitted with a two stage Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA®) Trigger to decrease rifle movement, the Ambush 6.8 SPCII realizes its superior accuracy to take 'em down in one shot. (Geissele SSA® Trigger has a total pull weight of 4.5 lbs, 2.5 lbs on the first stage and 2 lbs on the second stage.) The Ambush 6.8 SPCII features a monolithic upper rail platform and a 12” modular free-float hand guard, which protects the barrel while giving plenty of real estate for hand placement or accessories.

The barrel is in excellent condition.  This gun is 99.9%.  It is a Norinco and imported by Interarms from 1987 to 1996.  This gun was a copy of the ever desirable Browning SA22.  The wood is not as fancy as the Browning, and the scroll work on the receiver is not as detailed, but this gun could be bought for half what the Browning name brand costs. Other than the esthetics , I cannot find a lot of differences between the two.  This gun does have an interesting and rarer feature, the ability to load through the stock.  Finish is great and still like factory new.  After an in depth inspection by myself, a couple of other collectors, and a local gunsmith, I can confidently say we don't believe it had ever been fired.  Email me with any questions.  $300  Cash only, no trades.

4/23/2013 Update  I was going to keep this little rifle, and decided to shoot it.  It fired well except that it had a couple hiccups loading, which after a gunsmith had a look at it was determined that the factory milling had left a bit of a sharp edge in the receiver and the casings would sometimes catch.  I've since had that remedied and decided I don't really need another .22 as I already have 3.  It's a beautiful little gun, and I've received many compliments on it while I've had it at the range.  I also learned about the take-down feature on this gun, and anyone can disassemble this gun in less than 30 seconds.  It's simplicity has to be the most desirable part of the design.

I am liquidating a couple collection of firearms.  I have several shotguns, a black powder revolver, and a couple black powder rifles.   I will consider selling the collection in lots.  All meetings to view any of these guns will take place at Bullseye Marksman Gun Club in Cumming.  They are located just off GA400 exit 13.  Please do not bother to email and ask me to meet elsewhere as I will not respond.  Also, the reason I list a price is that is what I am selling it for.  Don't email and ask me ""what is your best price"" as I can tell you now, my price is what you see here.  (I have researched prices on all these firearms in depth and determined these asking prices to be more than reasonable) Also, if the ad is up, it's still for sale.  I don't meet there for the purpose of transfers, it's just a safe location for both buyer and seller.  I will need to see a valid GA drivers license, and would like to see a GA CWL.  As with any firearm sale, I reserve the right to not sell to anyone, especially those who I deem as sketchy."

I am liquidating a collection of firearms.  I have several shotguns, a revolver, a couple black powder guns, and a rifle listed for sale.  I will consider selling the entire collection in one lot.  All meetings to view any of these guns will take place at Bullseye Marksman Gun Club in Cumming.  They are located just off GA400 exit 13.  Please do not bother to email and ask me to meet elsewhere as I will not respond.  Also, the reason I list a price is that is what I am selling it for.  Don't email and ask me ""what is your best price"" as I can tell you now, my price is what you see here.  Also, if the ad is up, it's still for sale.  I don't meet there for the purpose of transfers, it's just a safe location for both buyer and seller.  I will need to see a valid GA drivers license, and would like to see a GA CWL.  As with any firearm sale, I reserve the right to not sell to anyone, especially those who I deem as sketchy."

Last year at this time I purchased a new in-the-box Mossberg 500SP. I then began my quest to create the Machine of my dreams and for my hands. The Project was completed as planned, but unfortunately I'll never have the opportunity to see what it's capable of as I'm leaving the State and will have no need for a Shotgun, therefore the lot is priced at $550.00 for a quick sale. To clarify, it's never been fired. I've cycled through a few Shells but that's the extent of the action having any movement. I'm sure most of you are familiar with what each item is (is worth), so please by all means stop me from having to dig for descriptions Online by letting me know your interested. Otherwise please stand-by for a list and description of all the Extras, which may take me a few days. You'll also notice a Marksman Pellet Gun w/ Pellets, some .40 Rounds, etc.. those are just misc. non-related items you may have as well. Everything in the bundle is brand new aside from the Pellet Gun.

This is not a ""panic buy"" price but an actual current market value for a collectible caliber rifle upper. Although the ammo is available, these rifle uppers are not. They are very hard to find. I encourage you to do your homework, read the reviews and try searching both Armslist nationwide and gunbroker. That is all I ask and see what I am saying is true. Because of these uppers are no longer in production they will continue to rise in value even after the ""panic buy""  market stabilizes.

With the ever increasing cost of 5.56mm and .223 ammo, Smith & Wesson introduced the M&P15R Rifle Upper Receiver Assembly). This rifle upper is chambered for the less expensive and abundant 5.45 x 39mm cartridge. The rifle upper comes with a flat-top receiver and the M4-style post front sight ready to accept the optics of your choice or a back-up iron sight. Also includes TWO 30 round magazines built specifically to accommodate the 5.45 x 39mm round.
