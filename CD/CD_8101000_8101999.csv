Same double action found on Billy the Kid when he was murdered. This Firearm is still in complete working condition and is pre turn of the century. Currently they're going for between 1k to 2k depending on condition. I've had this one appraised at $1400.

311,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8101311,For Sale:  Rare Spreewerke P.38 / Czech Vz46 Pistol,"washington, Washington, United States","$ 1,300","Listed On: Wednesday, March 14, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a rare Czech Army Vz 46 Pistol that was manufactured by the Czechs from German P.38 parts found at the Spreewerke factory at the end of WWII. Only 3,000 of these pistols were made and were only used for a few years by the Czechs.
 
When the German Army completed its P.38 testing with the end of the Fourth Variation Zero Series model manufactured by Walther, the P.38 was officially adopted as the German Army's standard side arm. Following this official adoption of the P.38, Walther produced the first true military P.38 known as the 480 Code P.38. Walther continued to refine the design of the P.38 with other variants that went into production.
 
The P.38, although a significant improvement over the P.08 Luger, still involved time-consuming and expensive machining of parts. This led other German arms manufacturers to experiment with designs incorporating more steel stampings. The exigencies of the war, however, led to a halt of experimentation since the Wehrmacht needed existing weapons delivered in large numbers. This led, in May or June 1940, to Mauser being asked to examine the possibility of producing the P.38. Despite the fact that Mauser would only have to manufacture an existing Walther design, as opposed to designing a new weapon, testing it, making product improvements, etc., Mauser experienced numerous production delays. The result was that Mauser’s first production P.38 did not roll off the assembly line until late September 1942, and the first delivery of Mauser P.38s to the Army did not occur until late December 1942. Germany’s military operations on the Russian front, as well as Allied operations in North Africa, Sicily and Italy and an expected second front in France, led to ever increasing demands for small arms, including the P.38. A third manufacturer of the P.38 was needed.
 
Very little is known about Spreewerke as compared to Walther and Mauser, which were two well-known arms manufacturers in Germany. Spreewerke was listed at least as early as the late 1930s in the master German firms list as Spreewerke G.m.b.H. Metallwarenfabrik, Berlin-Spandau, Freiheit 4-7, as a hardware or metal wares factory. There was also some connection during this time between Spreewerke and the famous Czech weapons manufacturer Skoda.
 
It is known that Spreewerke was a subsidiary of the Deutsche Industrie Werke (“DIW”), a conglomerate of industrial works. It is also known that Spreewerke was a large supplier of steel products to the German war effort, including raw, refined, light and heavy steel. As part of this war production, Spreewerke, like all German manufacturers during WWII, was assigned a code, which was “cyq.”
 
Although Spreewerke’s main offices and initial manufacturing locations were in Spandau, a northern suburb of Berlin, none of its P.38s were manufactured in Spandau. Spreewerke later added production facilities that were involved in P.38 production. One of these, called Werk Grottau, was in what the Germans called Grottau in the Sudentenland. The Czech’s, however, called it by its Czech name, Hradek nad Nisou. The second, and much larger of the two, was in the German city of Zittau. Because of the close geographical proximity to one another, and because of extensive rail and road connections between the two cities, they were sometimes referred to as Zittau-Grottau. Spreewerke caught the attention of German ordnance planners shortly after Mauser P.38 production got underway.
 
The concern was that both Walther and Mauser were manufacturing P.38s at single production facilities. Attacks or any other disruption in production at a single plant would effectively halt the entirety of production. The ordnance planners sought to rectify this potential problem by contracting with another company in which various parts would be manufactured at different locations and brought together for assembly and testing at a central location. The obvious choice of a company that fit this production requirement was Spreewerke with its diversified and geographically separate manufacturing arrangement.
 
Negotiations between Spreewerke and the German Government under control of the Waffenamt began in late 1941 or early 1942. The negotiations proceeded quickly and were finalized probably in late February 1942.
 
Once Spreewerke was selected for P.38 production, Walther assisted Spreewerke in setting up production facilities, supplying blue prints, jigs, templates, machine tool designs, tool shop models and setup instructions. Walther also provided Spreewerke with a contingent of Walther personnel who assisted in setup and initial production for approximately 10 months.
 
As noted, none of Spreewerke’s P.38 production occurred in Spandau north of Berlin. Rather, Spreewerke farmed out production of various parts and components to other firms in the Zittau-Reichenau area. Spreewerke then conducted final assembly, inspection and issue from Zittau-Grottau. Although Spreewerke’s dispersed production was advantageous from the standpoint of preventing complete disruption of manufacture in the event of a disruption at one particular factory, the dispersal inevitably caused delays in the production ramp-up process.
 
From March through May 1942, Walther assisted Spreewerke in setting up manufacturing facilities and tooling. As part of this setup period, Spreewerke began production trials on manufacturing various components. From early May though mid-June 1942, Spreewerke then began trial runs on manufacturing completed P.38s on an assembly line basis. By mid-June, Spreewerke had only manufactured approximately 50 P.38s, but these were not submitted for acceptance by the Wehrmacht. Instead, they were used for refining the tooling up process and for instructing the machinists. Spreewerke then spent the balance of June and early July 1942 correcting the production mistakes found in the first 50 pistols. Once changes were made, Spreewerke conducted another assembly line run of 50 pistols and these 50 were deemed to be acceptable from a production standpoint although they were never accepted by the Wehrmacht.
 
Initial serial number production began at Spreewerke in August 1942 with the production of 300 P.38s. Although the standard monthly production rate for all three P.38 manufacturers was 10,000 per month, it was some time before Spreewerke approached this production requirement although Spreewerke was able to double its monthly production runs through the end of the year with approximately 3,000 P.38s manufactured in December 1942.
 
Production estimations for Spreewerke P.38s are hard to come by since very few production records survived the war. Another complicating factor was that Spreewerke, unlike Walther and Mauser, did not year date their P.38s. One defining characteristic of Spreewerke markings was the change from the “cyq” code, used from initial production until some time in early 1945, when it was changed to “cvq.” This change was probably unintentional and probably resulted from the wear on the stamping dies whereby the bottom edge of the “y” was worn away to appear to be a “v” stamp.
 
As noted, this particular Spreewerke P.38 is serial numbered 1063, but it it cannot be dated based upon its WWII German P.38 serial number since this is a post-war Czech serial number. What began life as parts for a WWII German P.38 became a post-war Czech Army VZ46 Pistol.
 
When the parts for this pistol were manufactured at Grottau in 1945, that area was part of the Third Reich’s Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, although Czech locals and Czech’s from the government in exile still considered it part of Czechoslovakia. German production of P.38s at Grottau ended in May 1945 after General Patton’s Third US Army entered Pilsen on May 3, 1945 from the southwest and the Soviet troops entered Prague from the east on May 9, 1945.
 
After the German surrender, pre-war Czechoslovakia was re-established, with the exception of Subcarpathian Ruthenia, which was annexed to the Soviet Union and then incorporated into the Ukranian Soviet Socialist Republic. This was a time of great turmoil, particularly after the promulgation of the Benes Decrees, which abrogated citizenship for those of German and Hungarian origin who had accepted German or Hungarian citizenship during the Nazi occupation. The government also confiscated the property of the Germans and expelled about 90% of the ethnic German population, over 2 million people.
 
Those Czech units that fought alongside the Allies to defeat Nazi Germany returned to Czechoslovakia at the end of the war and formed the core of the new and small, recreated Czechoslovak Army. In the 1946 parliamentary elections, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia won in the Czech areas and the Democratic Party won in Slovakia. As a result, Czech communists dominated the parliament and government until February 1948, when the communists seized total control of the country and the government.
 
The small, recreated Czech Army used the parts seized from the Spreewerke factory in Grottau and built only about 3,000 P.38s for its use. These pistols were re-designated the Pistole Vzor 46 or Vz46 Pistol and were used by the Czech Army from 1946 until about 1950, when the Czech Army adopted the CZ 1950, which used the 7.65 mm cartridge. Sometimes these pistols are referred to as CZ46 Pistols.
 
On the front left portion of the slide is the nomenclature stamp “P.38.” Even though the Czechs changed the nomenclature of this pistol to Vz46, they left the P.38 designation on the slide as it was stamped at the Spreewerke factory. Just below the P.38 stamp is the Czech serial number, “1063.” When these parts were captured, most did not have serial numbers added so this stamp was made by the Czech Army. Just to the right of the P.38 stamp is Spreewerke’s “cvq” Code stamp, with the shortened “y” stamp. To the right of the “cyq” code is the serif “S” stamp that is occasionally found on Spreewerke slides. The finger serrations on the end of the slide have 15 valleys cut on either side. Spreewerke P.38s are known to have either 15 or 16 machined valleys in their production. The “S” Safe and “F” Fire stamps are crisp with only the “F” stamp partially filled in with remnant of the red paint.
 
The right side of the slide has the standard eagle over “88” Waffenamt assigned to Spreewerke, followed by the eagle over Swastika acceptance stamp. The sides and bottom rails of the slide exhibit the rough machining marks that are typically found on Spreewerke P.38s. Spreewerke was much more concerned with quantity of weapons that met contract standards and did not care for fit and finish like Walther and Mauser. The Slide retains 95% of its original blued finish on both the outer and inner surfaces with wear noted on the sharp edges and with two small circular wear marks on the right, front side of the slide.
 
The loaded chamber indicator pin correctly protrudes from the milled out section at the top of the hammer slot. The top cover retains the majority of its original blue finish. The extractor is correctly exposed as is the extractor plunger, but the plunger spring is correctly not exposed. The Rear Sight retains the majority of its original blued finish and is tightly secured to the slide by the top cover.
 
The left side of the frame has the matching Czech Army serial number “1063” just above the trigger guard bow followed by the Spreewerke Waffenamt eagle over “88” stamp. On the left trigger guard is the Czech Army “E” stamp followed by a slightly peened post-war Czech Rampant Lion acceptance stamp. Also on the left side of the frame, just above the slide stop return spring is the number “25R.” These numbers and capital letter suffixes are only found on Spreewerke P.38s and it is believed to be related to a steel lot number. The slide stop return spring remains in the white. The Slide Stop works correctly as does the takedown lever. The Sear is the standard P.38 type and is also correctly in the white.
 
The Trigger Bar on the right side is correctly unmarked and it retains virtually all of its original blued finish. The Trigger Bar Spring remains in the white. The Trigger retains 95% plus of its original blued finish that is beginning to fade. On the right front trigger guard bow is the “46” nomenclature stamp found on these Czech Vz46 Pistols. The front and rear magazine well walls retain the majority of the original blue finish with only minor wear. The Hammer Strut retains the majority of its original blued finish and the Hammer Spring remains in the white. The Magazine Catch functions perfectly and it also retains the majority of its original blue finish. The Lanyard Ring retains the majority of its original blued finish and it is still solidly secured to the frame.
 
Both Recoil Spring Guides remain in the white as do the Recoil Springs. The Ejector and Safety Hammer Lowering Lever both retain the majority of their original blued finish with sear on the top edges. The front grip strap and bottom of the trigger guard bow both retain the majority of the original blued finish that is thinning. Overall, the Frame retains 95% of its original blued finish.
 
The Hammer is the correct early style with eight fine grooves. The Hammer retains the majority of its original blued finish with wear on the striking face and on the sharp edges. The slide stop has the correct, late war smooth upper surface. The take down lever has seven horizontal serrations on the front face.
 
The barrel has the matching full serial number “1063” on the front flat, stamped over the X-ed out serial number “1015.” The locking block retaining spring is the flat leaf style and it retains the majority of its original fire blued finish. The Locking Block Operating Pin is staked in place and it remains in the white. The bottom of the barrel has the scarce “fnh” stamp, indicating this barrel was manufactured by Behmische Waffenfabrik at its Strakonitz Plant in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The left front barrel rail has the equally scarce stick eagle over “WaA76” Waffenamt, which is the wartime code for the Strakonitz plant in Prague. The bore still shows strong rifling with minor frosting in the grooves but it is generally shiny throughout.
 
The Barrel, to include the top of the chamber, retains 95% of its original blued finish. Centered over the chamber on the top of the barrel is another Rampant Lion Czech Acceptance Stamp that is still crisply stamped and unmarred. There is slight wear on the front sight ring. The original muzzle crown is present and unmarred. The standard front sight is solidly in place and the witness mark on the front sight aligns perfectly at the front with a corresponding line on the sight base. The front sight blade retains the majority of its original blued finish. The Locking Block is correctly marked on the right side with the Spreewerke Waffenamt eagle over “88” stamp. The bottom of the block has the matching partial serial number “63” and the left side of the block has the correct eagle over Swastika acceptance stamp. The locking block retains 95% of its original blued finish that is beginning to fade. Although the standard finish on locking blocks made by Walther and Mauser were in the white, Spreewerke, on a random and infrequent occasion, were blued."

This G35 was an unissued police gun and unfired when I bought it. It only has 300 rounds of quality brass ammo run through it so the gun is in great condition with very minimal wear. I have more pics available to send to serious buyers.
