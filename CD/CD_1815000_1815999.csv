Anything that looks like a flaw is due to a glare from the lighting, bluing and stock are shiny and perfect as it came from the factory. It has been shot ONE time to confirm function and accuracy, and it was spot on for me! Chambered in the versatile caliber of .300 Winchester Magnum famous for its' power and flat trjectory. Ammo diversifies it for deer up to anything America offers. It comes with it's original box, a Browning original Cimarron soft side takedown case for easy transport, and also includes 2 boxes of shells minus the 1 used to confirm function and accuracy. Retails for $1099, and the case for $49.00 and of course the ammo, you can save hundreds today!! This is a beautiful, and near perfect gun for hunting and lever actions ane growing more popular for home defense in lighter loadings. Photo ID required and exchange of contact information.


Compact and easy to transport, the BLR Lightweight ’81 Takedown can be assembled or disassembled in just seconds. The gloss finish on the Walnut straight grip stock contrasts beautifully with the deeply polished blue finish on the receiver and the barrel. This is what a serious lever-action rifle should be, and what every other lever-action wishes it was.

•Every BLR barrel is individually finished with a hand-reamed chamber for tighter tolerances and more precise headspace.
•The barrel’s target-type Crown enables a more uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in bullet trajectory. The barrel Crown is recessed to help protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy.
•The barrel’s standard sights include a Low-Profile adjustable square notch rear sight and a high-visibility front blade with gold bead fitted on a raised ramp-style base.?
•The richly blued steel finish on all external surfaces is a stunning reflection of the gunmaker’s art.
•The takedown models of the BLR are unique, allowing you to simply flip a finger lever, twist the receiver and barrel 90 degrees and instantly separate the two parts for space saving storage or easy transportation, even in a backpack or hunting duffle. Reassembly is in reverse order and takes only seconds.
•The barrel on BLR Takedown models is factory drilled and tapped for an optional Browning forward-mounted scout-style scope base to provide a rock-solid optics mounting platform, allowing you to remove the barrel for transportation and storage without losing your scope’s zero.
•The aircraft grade alloy receiver is precision machined to provide outstanding reliability and years of dependable service.
•The slick-sided receiver houses the BLR’s lightning fast, glass-smooth rack and pinion lever action.
•The BLR has a rotating multi-lug bolt head that locks into the barrel extension to produce bolt-action accuracy and magnum-level strength.
•The BLR is one of the few lever-action rifle designs that is strong enough to use today’s most popular magnum cartridges, giving you the extended reach and flat bullet trajectory other lever-action owners can only dream of.
•The BLR has a recessed bolt face that surrounds the cartridge head for added strength and lasting dependability.
•The BLR’s generously-sized side ejection port allows fired cases to instantly clear the action without hitting you or your scope and bouncing back onto the receiver, potentially creating a jam.
•The folding hammer on the BLR provides an added measure of safety when the hammer is at half-cock, having two positions in that mode so the status of the rifle can be instantly seen and felt.
•The folding hammer on the BLR has four basic positions; Full-cock, half-cock, folded hammer position and the dropped or fired position.
•The BLR’s trigger is unique in that it travels along with the lever as it’s cycled, meaning that pinching your fingers between the lever and trigger on closing the action is a thing of the past.
•The fingerpiece on the BLR’s trigger is nice and wide with vertical friction ribs to prevent your finger from slipping, giving you more precise trigger control for those demanding long-range shots.
•The detachable steel box magazine makes for quick reloading, both in the field and on the range.
•Unlike lever actions with tubular magazines, the BLR’s detachable steel box magazine lets you use aerodynamically-superior pointed bullets, which opens up a whole new world of ballistic performance that is usually found in bolt-action and autoloading rifles.
•Magazine capacity is 3 rounds in the magnum calibers and 4 rounds in standard calibers.
•The BLR’s stock is sculpted from fine Walnut and the cut checkering in the grip and fore-end is crisply executed for lasting good looks and a more solid grip.
•The straight grip BLR stock is true to the classic lines of the lever action rifle and has a traditional carbine strap at the fore-end.
•The BLR’s stock has a deep, glossy finish that brings out every nuance of the wood’s warm color and grain.
•The well-formed recoil pad helps reduce felt recoil and flinching.
•Steel sling swivel studs are pre-installed for easy mounting of your sling or bipod.
The button-rifled barrel is triple-checked for straightness and interior finish and then air-gauged to ensure a consistent diameter throughout the bore’s length."

I had the gun( and mag) professionally sand blasted and Cerakoted with a flat black and a Custom mixed gun metal gray with stainless,  the stock and rails are metallic gun metal gray while some other parts (cheek pad, bolts) are flat black.  Gun looks amazing and stands out next to a factory model especially outside.  These guns are not easy to find and you won't find a nicer set-up on Armslist.  I also have 110 factory rounds that can go with it for the right offer(30 250gr Herters, 80 250gr Hornady all Boattail Hollow Points)  The optic is a Night Force 8-32x56 NXS zero stop, scope also includes a sun shade and NF lens covers, and NF scope rings.  The 338 Lapua currently holds the record for longest confirmed sniper shot at 1.53 miles.  The gun speaks for itself and looks amazing in person.  The rifle has not been fired since the entire Cerakote job and was reassembled by a professional gun smith, trigger(accu-trigger) is adjustable and currently set at 3pds.  The rifle had around 40 rounds shot before the disassembly for Cerakoting.  Includes a brand new Harris bi-pod with swivel option.  This gun was more of a Hobby for me than anything and I don't need to sell it, just seeing what kind of offers I receive, these guns don't go for sale often and especially with a 10+ set-up and Cerakoted.

Features:
High Performance Hornady Bullets

All Hornady Custom pistol ammo is loaded with either the famous Hornady XTP (Extreme Terminal Performance) bullet, our FMJ or our new FTX bullet. All are supremely accurate, and deliver maximum knockdown power.

Select Cases

Hornady produces most of the brass for Hornady Custom pistol ammo. All other brass is chosen to ensure it meets our unusually high standards for reliable feeding, corrosion resistance, proper hardness and the ability to withstand maximum chamber pressures.

Powder

Each cartridge is loaded to ensure optimal pressure, velocity and consistency from lot to lot.

Primers

Like the powder, each primer is carefully matched to individual loads, and specifically selected for their ability to quickly, completely, and reliably ignite the powder charge.

Depending on the caliber, Hornady handgun ammunition is loaded with Hornady XTP, FMJ-RN, XTP Mag, FTX or FP (flat point)-XTP bullets.

 I've got 60 rounds of 7.62x39 ammo and 100 rounds of 22lr hollow points that i'll give you, unless im offered an ak then for obvious reasons i'll keep the 7.62 ammo.

 I've also got a brand new and never used modern u.s military gas mask with 2 unused o.d green canisters and an extra Tasco red/green dot scope i'll throw in to sweeten the right deal."

The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments."

The Rem 870 when using the pisol grip style stocks is a much better design than the Moss 500 because the Rem 870 has a CROSS BOLT safety that you can engage without moving your hands away from the trigger assembly. The Moss 500""s or like style shotguns that have the SAFETY on the reciever and when set up with pistol grips make you move you hand away from the ready fire position to engage the safety switch on top of reciever. So for a Home ""D"" style pistol grip shotgun the Rem 870 is a wise choose. Remember seconds count in a emergency. Enough with my rant and about this gun...

I've created a closed firearms enthusiast group in New Mexico. The group is on Facebook and we will be allowing everything firearms and hunting related swap (many members are helpful with advices also). The convenience of fb allows us to contact in live time and actually see who is contacting on the posts.  I'm an admin in 2 different groups in a couple of other states and we are growing everyday, I'm amazed of how much activities in our groups. There's rules and guidelines, plus we don't want to deal with gouchers.

Receiver weight (complete) is 1 full pound lighter than a complete aluminum receiver with an A2 stock.

 Wider magazine well accepts unmodified, submachine gun magazines in pistol calibers. With caliber conversion upper receivers and magazine blocks, standard AR15 magazines can be used without modifications. As well, any M16 magazine can be used with easier reloading than aluminum receivers.
 It has a longer service life, as Nylon6 resists impacts and wear better than aluminum. The integrated buffer tube, pistol grip and fixed stock give this design its strength.

This pistol is the model M709031-A5…USP 9 mm Compact (V1) Double/Single action trigger, safety/decocking lever on left, with two 13 round magazines.

The following information was copied and pasted from the H&K website and describes this pistol in depth. 
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Come check this gun out @ The Arms Room in Fayetteville. If you have any questions about this pistol please give me a call at 479-445-six4eight0. Shipping is available. Thanks for looking."

This rifle is based off of the AR-15 platform and has a lot of interchangable parts!

The magazines for this rifle are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient.

This amazing arsinal operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open."
