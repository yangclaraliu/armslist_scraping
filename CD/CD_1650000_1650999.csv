You can read a review of this model here: GunBlast.com Review 

The DT Sport proved to be one hundred percent reliable, as expected. The carbine fed, fired, and ejected every cartridge perfectly. Accuracy was excellent, especially considering the mil-spec trigger. I do much better work with a match trigger, such as the Alexander or Timney, but this carbine is built for fighting, and the trigger is well-suited to that task. The AR-15 is a wonderful concept, and Del-Ton executes it very well. The Del-Ton rifles are built very well, and just because the DT Sport is one of the most affordable AR-15 carbines available, does not mean that it sacrifices on quality. The DT Sport has everything that you need, and nothing that you don’t. It performs as well as rifles costing three times the price, and buying a basic rifle such as this leaves a lot more cash to purchase a good optic, plenty of extra magazines, and ammunition. You can’t have too much ammunition. The stuff keeps well, needs no refrigeration, and several thousand rounds will fit neatly under your bed. Buy it while you still can.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches

Gun is absolutely perfect and brand new and comes with everything as you would expect a new Delta Elite to come with.
The 10mm cartridge is gaining popularity lately with ballistics better than the 45ACP.

Get it now While you can still find one unfired and new as Colt is no longer making these again. This is not the model they made in the 80's as you can tell by the grips and the trigger, but it is the model made by Colt recently manufactured in the last few years. 

I bought new from the dealer so I am the first owner. But the gun in BRAND NEW!

$1500 FIRM and not a penny less, don't waste your time with offers because I have been monitoring Gunbroker.com and everyone I found identical to this is selling for $1500 then the buyer has to pay double FFL fees, Shipping and Credit card fees. So Get a better deal here and one you can handle and inspect with your own eyes. Also no need to worry about sending $1500 to a stranger out of state and hope you get your gun.  Face to Face is still the safest way to make a deal, no doubt!

Price: $499 OBO

Pistola: 1996 built Ruger Stainless 4.62 Barrel Blackhawk 357mag

I bought this gun late last year and have shot 500 or so 38spl wadcutters through it. It runs like a champ and is beautiful to boot! Without further delay I'll try to tell you about it so I won't get so many question pm's.

Trigger: I don't think anyone has ever opened up the gun because the trigger isn't that great. The only upside is that no one bubba'd it. And parts are readily available and smithing these yourself is easy.

Stocks: Beautiful Ruger real wood!

Finish: It does have a few spots here and there but, it's stainless just break out the Mothers Mag Polish. NO RUST.

Problems: None. The gate is tight and the ejector rod is straight.

Lockup: As tight as my sp and gp.

Since Ruger QC has been a lil lack luster as of late the fact that this is a 1996 built gun is what sold it for me.

This rifle features black phosphate/anodized aluminum finishes, a Stark SE-1 pistol grip with battery compartment, a 6 position adjustable stock by UTI, a Picatinny quad-rail forearm and top rail, rail mounted front/rear adjustable sights, and a stock sling mount. The free float rails are designed to fit all the tactical gear that you can carry. Unlike many ARs, this is a standard feature which you won't end up spending more to upgrade the rail set-ups. It has an efficient autoloading direct-impingement gas system for ejection of spent cartridges and auto reloading. No forward assist is necessary for a rifle this smooth. It does have a dust cover, a large trigger hole, and nice charging handle. The blued barrel is 16.25"", rifled for 1 in 9"" and ends with the muzzle-flash suppressor. The receiver, magazine release, and charging handle are all well designed to make use and maintenance reliable and easy. The upper and lower separate easily with two pins for service and cleaning. The receiver accepts 5.56 Nato ammunition as well as .223 Remington brass or steel casings. It has a 31 round capacity and is a real front-runner in the AR style market. Colt also makes a good quad rail set-up like this, but is generally much more costly. Mossberg redefined affordable with .223s and the .22lr. They have been around over 90 years. They must be doing something right. Mossberg offers their one year manu. warranty on this product. I have additional 30 round factory Mossberg magazines for sale. ************* LEGAL STUFF I HAVE TO TELL YOU: I cannot ship this gun or the magazine to the following places because of round capacity and/or ""assault weapon features""--California, Massachusetts, Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, District of Columbia, Chicago, Aurora, IL, and Cook County. I will not ship to Hawaii or Alaska for shipping reasons. Colorado (July 1st). The rest of Illinois, you will have to send a current FOID card and Driver's License. All rifles ship to a current FFL holder so set this up early. And for the love of Pete, make sure you can legally own this (i.e. not a felon, not crazy, not intending to hurt anyone, don't have a restraining order, haven't been to jail for a year for misdemeanor, are a legal citizen, are not a child molester, etc). You will be wasting your money if the FBI check is rejected. There will be a 25% penalty of the total purchase and the shipping is on you if this happens. Payment to be made with a United States Postal Service money order only. It's easy and cheaper than a C/C, cashier's check, and PayPal is not gun friendly. A signed copy of your valid FFL should accompany your check or E-mail to my address. Check with your state to make sure you don't need to be 21 to purchase this firearm. If you default on your contract to pay upon auction closing, appropriate measures will be taken.Thank you for looking, sorry for the legal garbage, and God bless. Contact me with questions."

I will not ship to Hawaii or Alaska for shipping reasons. Colorado (July 1st). The rest of Illinois, you will have to send a current FOID card and Driver's License. All rifles ship to a current FFL holder so set this up early. And for the love of Pete, make sure you can legally own this (i.e. not a felon, not crazy, not intending to hurt anyone, don't have a restraining order, haven't been to jail for a year for misdemeanor, are a legal citizen, are not a child molester, etc). You will be wasting your money if the FBI check is rejected. There will be a 25% penalty of the total purchase and the shipping is on you if this happens. Payment to be made with a United States Postal Service money order only. It's easy and cheaper than a C/C, cashier's check, and PayPal is not gun friendly. A signed copy of your valid FFL should accompany your check or E-mail to my address. Check with your state to make sure you don't need to be 21 to purchase this firearm. If you default on your contract to pay upon auction closing, appropriate measures will be taken.,  . Thank you for looking, sorry for the legal garbage, and God bless. Contact me with questions"

I will not ship to Hawaii or Alaska for shipping reasons. Colorado (July 1st). The rest of Illinois, you will have to send a current FOID card and Driver's License. All rifles ship to a current FFL holder so set this up early. And for the love of Pete, make sure you can legally own this (i.e. not a felon, not crazy, not intending to hurt anyone, don't have a restraining order, haven't been to jail for a year for misdemeanor, are a legal citizen, are not a child molester, etc). You will be wasting your money if the FBI check is rejected. There will be a 25% penalty of the total purchase and the shipping is on you if this happens. Payment to be made with a United States Postal Service money order only. It's easy and cheaper than a C/C, cashier's check, and PayPal is not gun friendly. A signed copy of your valid FFL should accompany your check or E-mail to my address. Check with your state to make sure you don't need to be 21 to purchase this firearm. If you default on your contract to pay upon auction closing, appropriate measures will be taken.. Thank you for looking, sorry for the legal garbage, and God bless. Contact me with questions"

1,000 per Box #500 CCI Small Pistol Primers are continuously tested and improved. These are the “bread-and-butter” of reloading, the most commonly called-for primers in reloading recipes. CCI standard primers are remarkably clean-burning, leaving primer pockets cleaner and extending the time between pocket cleaning. That’s a huge benefit for progressive reloaders. They are more sensitive and easier to seat than older CCI primers, and engineered for smooth feeding in automated equipment.

The free float rails are designed to fit all the tactical gear that you can carry. Unlike many ARs, this is a standard feature which you won't end up spending more to upgrade the rail set-ups. It has an efficient autoloading direct-impingement gas system for ejection of spent cartridges and auto reloading. No forward assist is necessary for a rifle this smooth. It does have a dust cover, a large trigger hole, and nice charging handle. The blued barrel is 16.25"", rifled for 1 in 9"" and ends with the muzzle-flash suppressor. The receiver, magazine release, and charging handle are all well designed to make use and maintenance reliable and easy. The upper and lower separate easily with two pins for service and cleaning. The receiver accepts 5.56 Nato ammunition as well as .223 Remington brass or steel casings. It has a 31 round capacity and is a real front-runner in the AR style market. Colt also makes a good quad rail set-up like this, but is generally much more costly. Mossberg redefined affordable with .223s and the .22lr. They have been around over 90 years. They must be doing something right. Mossberg offers their one year manu. warranty on this product. I have additional 30 round factory Mossberg magazines for sale. ************* LEGAL STUFF I HAVE TO TELL YOU: I cannot ship this gun or the magazine to the following places because of round capacity and/or ""assault weapon features""--California, Massachusetts, Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, District of Columbia, Chicago, Aurora, IL, and Cook County. I will not ship to Hawaii or Alaska for shipping reasons. Colorado (July 1st). The rest of Illinois, you will have to send a current FOID card and Driver's License. All rifles ship to a current FFL holder so set this up early. And for the love of Pete, make sure you can legally own this (i.e. not a felon, not crazy, not intending to hurt anyone, don't have a restraining order, haven't been to jail for a year for misdemeanor, are a legal citizen, are not a child molester, etc). You will be wasting your money if the FBI check is rejected. There will be a 25% penalty of the total purchase and the shipping is on you if this happens. Payment to be made with a United States Postal Service money order only. It's easy and cheaper than a C/C, cashier's check, and PayPal is not gun friendly. A signed copy of your valid FFL should accompany your check or E-mail to my address. Check with your state to make sure you don't need to be 21 to purchase this firearm. If you default on your contract to pay upon auction closing, appropriate measures will be taken. If there is any doubt, don't click on the ""submit bid"" button, please. Thank you for looking, sorry for the legal garbage, and God bless. Contact me with questions"

12 GAUGE / 3-inch

Made of 18-2 polished stainless steel and select Walnut, this custom shotgun has exquisite fit and finish. It is from a limited production run of only ten made. It has a single-digit serial number, 20-inch barrels, 3-inch chambers and a gorgeous Grade 2 wood stock set with engravings. It's slim and nimble, and an absolute pleasure to handle.

The Coach gun style of shotgun should be one of the very last types to be included in any new, mindless anti-gun legislation and ammo is plentiful. It's also one of the most effective and history-proven personal defense weapons ever designed. This particular one should last several lifetimes of serious use due to superior craftsmanship, and the material from which it is made.

German-made quality throughout. Don't confuse this one with what passes as ""coach guns"" these days. This one has the precise, Old World quality levels associated with guns of the past - with some added benefits from the modern age.

If you look up the reviews on these guns they are well loved and dollar for dollar can not be beat.  With the mods done to this one, it has been tastefully brought to another level of reliability.

Speaking of tastefullness, one gripe about the RI 1911's are the ungodly huge rollmark they put on the slide.  Well, I took care of that.  The rollmark has been removed as has all the parkerizing on the gun.  Some people are fans of parkerizing, I am not one of them.  I prefer a gun with a nice blue.  Therefore this gun got blued after the slide was smoothed.  It was not cold blued, it was done with a hot caustic blue like they should be.  The finish on this gun is outstanding with zero flaws or wear.

The gun is solid black and looks terrific.  Functions 100%.

Since the pictures the hammer was blued.  Sorry about the flash on the side pic, wanted to show the roll mark removal."

ROCHESTER, NY – American Tactical Imports is proud to introduce the FX 45 Fatboy Lightweight, exclusively from ATI. The new Fatboy LW weights only 27 ounces, making it ideal for conceal carry situations. The lightweight version is very similar to classic officers model 1911 pistol with 3.20” barrel length and an overall length of 6.89”; however, the Fatboy LW comes with an aluminum frame and a skeletonized aluminum trigger.

Please don't make any trade offers or half trade half cash offers. Bill of Sale IS required for my personal records. Please have a Valid State ID/DL to purchase this handgun.

I am selling my 5"" Kimber Warrior. I've had it for a few months and it's just collecting dust. I never have time to go to the range and I own 100 acres so whenever I have time, I just shoot my 22's (none of which are for sale). 

It's .45ACP, cleaned after every time I've finished firing it. They MSRP for $1,512 on Kimber's Site but I purchased mine from Vance's for $1,415 + Tax = $1,510.51. I've fired MAYBE 500 rounds through it. Kimber is an AMAZING handgun manufacturer and their Quality is unparalleled, if you can't afford a Wilson.

My asking Price is $1400 BECAUSE it comes with, in addition to all the stock items, 5 additional mags. Three 7+1's, One 10+1, and one 8+1. Not to mention it also comes with an open carry holster. The brand name of the holster escapes me, but it's VERY good. The grips are VZ Grips and are amazing, I put them on myself and I love them.

This is a package deal, so everything must be purchased. Seeing that each mag is roughly $25 and the Holster was $40, that brings my used Kimber's value at $1,235 which is actually a very good price for a Kimber Warrior in this condition.

Anyone who purchases this, can also purchase .45ACP target ammo from me. I have boxes of 50 and depends on how many boxes you want to buy, there are discounts involved. I have 950 rounds, so I have plenty upon request for sale.

New Gun Laws Took Effect July 1! 
Here's what I've learned that the news is not disclosing---

State law limits the amount the FFL Dealer can charge for Background Checks to only $10. It's basically a tax; the store must turn it over to the State.
The store must retain records for 20 years
The store must inspect the weapon; deeming it safe to operate.

I believe Corral Pawn on Main St. in Trinidad is doing the BGCs.
Artic Shooting Supply, on 6th St, in Pueblo is doing them for $20 which includes Transfer fees also. No limit on guns sold from Seller to Buyer. One fee! 
Or, paid in full first, I will agree to ship UPS OVER-NITE to your FFL Dealer for Transfer; at your expense of course.

Please: No Trades ""Except""---
I may consider trades for gold/silver bullion (no collectibles please)
I prefer 1 Oz Eagles or Maples Leafs.

250k miles and she runs and drives very well. Tires/brakes are good. Rear brakes replaced less than 7k miles ago with new calipers and pads. Battery is roughly 1 year old.  Timing belt,  gear box/manual transmission and clutch replaced by previous owner. Slave cylinder replaced, new valve cover gasket, new, thermostat, new starter, new fuel filter and tune up last year with new plugs and wires. Air conditioning does not work. We top off the oil and coolant every few weeks. Oil top off is around 1/4 of a quart of oil and coolant top off is a small amount as well.
