The Match has a flat face, for punching clean holes in paper targets.I built a gun rack for it that can either be wall mounted with a french cleat or just sit on a shelf. Has built in shelf with three recessed pockets to hold ammo tins.  Made of pine, and unfinished so you can stain or clear coat it, and put some felt or rubber in the gun hooks .Willing to sell, but I'm more interested in trades."

This gun is infamous for having lots of issues (almost all kinds of issues that can happen to a handgun happens with the mosquito) which led to numerous videos and articles showing how to fix them. I have fixed the fail-to-feed by polishing the feeding ramp. I also fixed the fail-to-eject by polishing the extractor pin as well as the rear cyclinder. These fixes greatly reduced the rate of fail-to-feed and fail-to-eject, however, they still occur once every 10 rounds or so. Besides, there is also the fail-to-fire which happens 1-2 every 10 rounds which I did not have time to look into. I have tried this gun with several different types of 22LR ammo (CCI, Federal, Amscor,...). So far, the one that produced the least problem was Federal bulk ammo (the target grade 325rd brick). The last time I worked on this gun was more than a year ago. So this gun has been sitting in the case since. If you are interested, send me an offer.Cash only.

If you are even kinda in the market, this is a deal that can't be beat. Price is for the watch as it sits with its beautiful OEM Rolex everything (zero aftermarket parts on this watch). I do have a 1CT VS1/18K Diamond Bezel that can be included, for the right deal.This is a 100% Authentic Rolex DateJust, 38mm across the case, it is an M-Serial Watch (2008 Model with signed warranty card). This Rolex is the updated/current version with the polished SS bezel, Oyster Bracelet, and is a little larger than the older models (but not too large). It could easily be worn by a women eventhough it is a mans watch. It was last serviced in Novermber 2017 (not an inexpensive service) and wont need anything for quite some time. Also taken in for its primary Rolex service in 2015, the last service they replaced any ""wear"" parts and did pressure tests etc. None of which was ""required"", but I wanted it to be in perfect condition.This Rolex has the very highly valued and hard to find Black/Grey Concentric Dial with Arabic Numbers. Condition wise it is about as close to new without the new price point, it was cleaned etc. when it was serviced. This Rolex also has absolutely everything it came with new (outer box, presentation box, Rolex cleaning cloth, all Rolex documentation, Rolex wax hangtag, also receipt and pressure test info from 2017 service). I posted this as for sale & trade because I am interested in trades (up or down) for other watches, as well as partial trades for other watches and firearms/optics with cash. I doubt I will want to trade straight across for guns unless it is quite the collection or a truly spectacular piece.
