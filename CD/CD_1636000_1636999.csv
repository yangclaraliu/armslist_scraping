I bought these in the un sure times and with the possibility of never being able to buy another one. Never the less I over paid but I wanted them so I got them. Either way thats not your problem , only mine. What im trying to say is that I have substantially more money in either one of these pistols then Im asking for them but I think Im being extremely fair. I realize what the msrp is but thats not relevant at this point in time so this is whatvI would think the going rate is. I am not a dealer and  really have not checked prices in a while but  was told that at these prices I shouldn't have much of a problem selling them . I need the money so trades are out of the question unless  you have some certain hk 's that I might want. I am selling one of these to help pay for something else I have a chance at. Im 5500 dollars away from getting it so there you go. Im starting with selling one of these.I might be willing to ship if the buyer pays expenses.  I will not ship to your house and if you dont have a carry permit to prove your not a felon then a government id and bill of sale is a must. Thanks  looking and please no low balling and offers.

I could possibly be talked out of both at the same time for the right offer. Regarding trades I am primarily looking for the following:

* Fishing boat w/motor & trailer in good condition
* Ruger Super Redhawk Alaskan in a 44 Rem Mag plus ammo or possibly other revolvers (no Taurus).
* Ammo (9mm, 22lr, 25acp) but only at a reasonable cost per round
* Jackson Racing Supercharger with Big Boost Kit for a Ford Focus SVT
* Springfield Armory M1A
* Anything awesome in a .308
* Ruger Super Redhawk Alaskan in a 44 Rem Mag plus ammo
* Eotech Holographic Sight in trade only for the SKS, Mags, Ammo (it would then go on the Mini)
* Honda 450 dirt bike

First, the SKS. It is a Chinese Type 56... not a Norinco SKS that was stamped out of pot metal. Mine is currently in an ATI collapsible/folding stock though I have the original (has a crack and is beat to hell). It comes with a steel 30rd duckbill magazine though I have the original (fine working order). It has an NCstar tri-rail mount though I have the original dust cover. All serial numbers match. Comes with stock 5rd and 30rd mag and 180 rounds (80 Soft Point - 100 FMJ - all steel). I threw 20 rounds down the barrel and was pretty accurate with just irons at 100yds.

Second, the Ruger Mini 14 Tactical. It comes with (4) 20rd magazines and a Weigand 1-Piece Picatinny-Style Scope Base. This is the one that has the collapsible and folding stock from the factory. Along with the rifle comes 190 rounds in brass and another 580 rounds in steel (varying grains and hp/fmj). Lastly, I would include a black carrying bag & sling.

I am the first and only owner. I've put around 400 rounds of brass down the pipe and the gun has fired with no problems each and every time from all 4 magazines. One of the magazines is stock Ruger... the other 3 are steel ProMag.

************

I am asking $700 obo for the Type 56 SKS, original stock, 5rd & 30rd mags, and ammunition.

I am asking $1,000 the Mini w/4 magazines, scope base, bag & sling.
I value the ammunition at $100 for the 190 in brass (53CPR) and $270 for the 580 in steel (46CPR) for a total of $370. Ammo is not available for sale separately unless the Mini sells."

Ruger Red Label 12 gauge, Model KRL-1227-BR, with 28"" barrels.

This pretty shotgun is in very good shape. I bought it years ago from Stone Eagle Firearms (CT), but shot it only a few times. It nevertheless has minor ""handling marks,"" which you can see in the pictures. The worst of these is a small ding on the edge of the rib, purely cosmetic, and which I never bothered to touch up with a blueing pen. You can see that spot in the closeup photo.

The gun comes with a choke tube wrench and five tubes: 2 skeet, 1 modified, 1 improved cylinder, and 1 full.

For sale or trade - a Colt Python in great condition, the bore is clean with sharp rifling. The Python shows some honest wear. This would be a great addition to your colt collection.  Gently used and perfectly working Colt Python from 1969 Blued in the 4 inch version, includes box and papers.  This revolver is EXCELLENT!

This is a a 4"" Colt Python .357 Magnum  from 1969 (serial 99435) with the ORIGINAL wooden grips and complete set of serial matched box and papers. 

This is a great shooter, very well taken care of and clean.  It does have some holster wear on the barrel and the cylinder.  Python locks up tight and is mechanically perfectly sound. VERY ACCURATE! The pythons made in the 60s era are some of the finest highest quality made guns ever made, highly sought after and hard-to-find.

Grips are AUTHENTIC and ORIGINAL to the gun.  Note the ""thumb rest"" on the grips, actually a loading clearance cut, only on the left side, and the semi-circular checkering border under the medallions.  The checkering pattern is on a raised area that stands up above the surrounding wood.   These are often thought to be the most attractive of the Colt Target grips

A little history - for the Python, Colt made their own special polishing wheels from large wooden disks covered with leather.  These wheels were used for only one grit of polish, and as the gun was polished, a different wheel was used for the next finer grit.  The Python polish went farther down in grit until the final polish was done with media the consistency of flour.  Since even a slight slip would ruin the Python's finish, only master polishers with many years of experience were ever allowed to work on the Python.  It's BEAUTIFUL and FEELS GREAT in your hand! Shoots buttery smooth.

This is number 16 of a 200 gun production run made specially for the Rhode Island State Police in the early 1970's. After receiving the firearms, the troopers determined that they prefered the 4"" barrel. They returned 198 of the guns to the distributor. (The govenor kept #1 and his driver kept #2.) Smith & Wesson made them 200 new model 66's with the 4"" barrel but refused to put the lanyard swivel. The distributor sold the remaining 198 original guns in the late 1970's. This is the only stainless steel gun that S&W ever made with a lanyard swivel.

This near perfect firearm comes in the original metal cornered box with the owner's manual, parts list, all paperwork and the S&W cleaning kit."

Our Horse IWB Tuckable Holster is the most comfortable IWB Tuckable holster we offer. People sometimes are turned away by the initial size of this holster. But actually this holster only adds 1/8 of an inch plus the gun’s width to your pants. While this holsters size actually wraps the body and distributes the weight of the firearm thus giving the person the ability to carry a much larger frame gun and still being comfortable for ALL DAY WEAR. Our Tuckable IWB holster offers the most protection from the sharp edges, safety, slide lock, and beaver tails on those 1911’s. Not only does it protect you from the gun but is protects the gun from salts and sweat from our skin. This holster is made of 100% American horse hide and has two leather incased powder coated holster clips that are adjustable for ride height.

692,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1636692,For Sale/Trade:  Avon RIB with MERCURY 9.9,"Smithfield, Wilmington, North Carolina","$ 4,500","Listed On: Saturday, May 18, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"The RIB is a 2009 Avon Rover 310 Lite, it is made of Hypalon. It is loaded with everything you need to hit the water., 2009 Mercury 9.9 motor, as new, pump, oars, tank, everything. It is a BLAST !!! 
There’s a reason the Navy SEALS AND the Coast Guard use Hypalon RIB’s  for rescue missions,,,,,they are TOUGH, they are nearly unsinkable and draft very little water. They can carry a ton of weight and go anywhere. This RIB is carried to the water either in my Yukon, in it’s own bag, or on it’s trailer. The floor is rigid, just like a boat, so it’s very tough, easily beached without harm. I use this on local lakes and also down at the beach on the ICW and on nice days you can hit the open ocean !!! Fishing off the RIB is easy. You can go where no one else can, explore remote locations and beach at secluded beaches no one else can get to!
This set up was $5,520.00 new, WITHOUT the trailer and used very little. About $6,300.00 WITH the trailer !
Again, look at the Navy SEAL and Rescue boats, they use RIB’s !!!
I bought a trailer to make transport even easier ! Then I customized it to also haul the Mercury 9.9 so as to avoid the hassle of putting it in the car trunk, the motor just mounts to the front of the trailer. 
Price is $4,500.00, no less, for everything. I’m looking for guns, ammo and a safe.
I would also consider a street bike on trade.
If the RIB is so great, why am I selling it ???? I have a 22’ Stingray and I just inherited a mint 18” 1964 Chris Craft and a 16’ Bass boat. I only have so much room /time for boating."

Product Description
glock The 4th Generation Glock ""Safe Action"" brings revolutionary design changes to the world's most popular pistol. Externally, what is immediately apparent is the multiple backstrap design of the frame, which can be instantly adapted to small, standard and large frame hands. The surface of the frame is the Generation 4 Rough Textured Frame scientifically designed, real world tested. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right handed shooters. The Generation 4 frame retains the Glock accessory rail for accessory attachment. Holds 10 rounds of .40 S&W ammunition. Matte black finish."

The RFB is a short-stroke gas piston operated semi-automatic rifle in 7.62 mm NATO caliber. It accepts standard metric FAL type magazines which work ""drop free"" and do not need to be tilted in. Four 20 round magazines is included*. Barrels on current models are 18"" and 24” long, with Salt Bath Nitride Finish in the bore and chamber. All of the barrels are now SBN (Salt Bath Nitride) for finish as it will last longer than the previous chrome-lining finish and the bolts are now finished with Titanium Nitride to assist with the smoothness of operation. The muzzle is threaded 5/8x24 TPI and comes equipped with our A2-style Flash Hider*, except the Hunter Variant which comes with a thread protector. All controls are fully ambidextrous; the reciprocating operating handle can be switched to either side. The trigger mechanism is second to no other Bullpup ever built and better than nearly all commercial semi-auto rifles. The safety disconnects the trigger and blocks the hammer action. A Mil-Spec Picatinny rail is attached rigidly to the barrel. No open sights are provided, allowing the user to select from the very best new optics and sight systems available. The RFB comes with a two point sling that can be easily configured to suit the user's preference. 


Available accessories include a free-floating, Quad Rail Picatinny and Sight Riser, bipod mounts, a removable bayonet lug for use with NATO style bayonets including our own Folding Bayonet, Stock Spacers for added length, and a Tactical Operation Handle.

I will ship this to a dealer, I am an individual and my state allows transfer of long guns from an individual to a dealer, if your dealer will not work with me however I can have the gun shipped from a dealer to your dealer for an additional $25.

[see photos below]. ls deadly accurate at 300 Yards, probably much farther. An unrivaled combination of precision accuracy, blazing-fast follow-ups and hunt-specific features. The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality for the modern predator aficionado. The results are astounding – with very serious implications for every coyote, fox or bobcat that crosses its path.

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

And our new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. Whether you choose the 223 Remington or 204 Ruger version, the semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.

Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails. This new family of firearms consists of three models. Each was designed with input from leading predator authorities and decked in the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage, open country and a multitude of hunting terrains. All come with five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other accessories.

The R-15 VTR Predator Rifle has a 22"" barrel with a fixed stock and pistol grip. At 7 3/4 lbs, it’s extremely stable – the best choice for long shots. Our R-15 VTR Predator Carbine and R-15 Predator Carbine CS* (Collapsible Stock) handle like lightning with their 18"" barrels and weigh a mere 6 3/4 lbs. – perfect for high-speed hunting scenarios. The Predator Carbine CS features a telescoping stock with a fully adjustable length of pull for a custom fit.

Originally bought this as a present for someone, but have decided to go in another direction.  Price is firm, unless you want to do a partial trade, knocking $100-$120 off the sale price (not interested in a full trade).

Styled in the familiar AR configuration, it’s a no-nonsense rifle you can trust with anything—including your life. This tough-as-nails rifle was designed specifically to answer the call for a low-maintenance, enhanced reliability carbine. The REC7 rifle’s dependability stems largely from its innovative operating system. Using a minimum number of parts, the piston system separates heat and powder residue from the bolt carrier and trigger assembly. The rifle runs cool and clean, reducing maintenance requirements and increasing endurance. The patented chrome-lined fluted gas block prevents excessive carbon buildup from operation under adverse conditions. The one-piece 17-4 stainless piston transfers energy to the anti-tilt bolt carrier. Machined from a monolithic block of 8620 steel, the carrier features an integral piston strike face. The Barrett Enhanced Bolt is made from high-strength 9310 steel. The bolt is designed specifically for use in the piston operated REC7, not just adapted from a direct gas bolt. The bolt’s gas-ring-free design is easy to clean. Reinforced at critical areas, every bolt is proofed and magnetic-particle inspected to guarantee reliable performance. At the heart of the operating system is a nitrided, two-position, forward-venting gas plug that retains the piston. The piston can be accessed through the front of the gas block without removing the handguard so optical sights or laser devices do not need to be zeroed after routine maintenance. The REC7 rifle’s forged 7075 aluminum upper and lower receivers are Type 3 hardcoat anodized. The lower houses an ultra-dependable single-stage trigger. The upper supports a free-floated, hammer-forged, chrome-lined barrel with M4 feed ramps machined into the receiver and the barrel extension. A mil-spec A2 flash hider protects the muzzle."

This rifle comes with a 3x9x 50 AO Scope with target turretsRifle has maybe 40 rounds thru it and was broken in properly. Shoots under MOA with factory ammo and I know it will shoot even better with hand loads.Scope is super clear and very bright with positive and precise adjustments. Mil spec. I do not know the brand of this scope but it is a super scope. I have had a lot of big name scopes that did not compare to this one. Also has lighted red reticle with 11 brightness settings. Millett rings. This is a great rifle with no handling marks even shows no scuffs on brass deflector. You will be very happy with this rifle.
