It's in fantastic shape, and the serial number dates it to 1990 and is one of the rarer ones that's marked Heckler & Koch on the side of the receiver. What's unique about this gun is that you can run it in BOTH semi auto and pump action because of its unique design, and that allows you to run anything from blanks to full power 3' magnum buckshot with no hiccups. It's also in the 'law enforcement/military' configuration, which gives it the pistol grip stock, as well as the full length magazine tube. The tube holds 7 rounds, plus one in the chamber, plus one 'ghost loaded' by thumbing the round under the bolt, giving you a total of 9 rounds on tap. It comes with a standard shotgun stock, a tactical pistol grip stock, as well as a shotgun scabbard. Asking $1100, or I'm open for trades, although cash is preferred. Text at 913-683-5904 or reply to this ad. I respond quickly to either. I am a KS resident, and will be posting this in the Kansas City section for MO due to my close proximity. If you are a MO resident, we will need to do an FFL transfer, and I will pay for it."

These are somewhat rare, not ""the rarest revolver in the world"", but not many people have them. The unique thing about these is the bore is on the bottom cylinder unlike other revolvers with the bore on the top. This firearm shoots very smoothly and without much felt recoil, I have carried it and I trust it with my life. It comes with 3 holsters, 1 custom owb, 1 custom iwb, and one chiappa brand holster that it comes with. I also have 4 speed strips, the ammo seen and other rounds I have may be available for certain deals. I am asking $800 for everything in pics except the ammo and case. If you would like the ammo OR the case I am asking $830, if you would like the ammo AND case I am asking $850. I am also open to trades, certain firearms in either .40 or .357 Sig. I would prefer compact sizes, but let me know what you have and lets see if we can make a deal. Thank you for taking the time to look at my ad."

Rifle is in very good condition, barrel is bright and shiny, internals all in good condition. It has a Tapco grip and trigger; wood is in good shape, grain and color don't exactly match from foregrip to buttstock. Safety lever has bolt hold notch cut in it to allow the bolt to be held open.I received this rifle in a trade, I'm not a huge AK guy. I had intentions of keeping it and shooting it, but I'm trying to free up some room in the safe. The rifle will come with 5 magazines (1 Pmag, 3 Korean made, and one of unknown origin). The unknown mag has a bolt hold open follower, so after the last round is fired through the gun, the bolt will hold open. I haven't shot it, but I have manually cycled the rifle and verified that it catches the bolt. All magazines are 30-rounds. Rifle will also come with an ammo can with ~200 rounds of 7.62x39 bi-metallic projectiles and lacquer coated steel cases. Like I said, I haven't shot the rifle, and from the way it looks, it doesn't look like its had many put through it. I'm looking to get around $650 for everything. I'm not really looking for trades, but would consider for a Sig P320 X-Five with cash on my end. Other than that I probably won't be interested. I'm located in Chesapeake, available most days to meet. If you'd like more photos, send me an emai and I'm happy to provide them. Thank you for looking."

Parker started its grade numbering system at zero to denote their lowest grade made at that time. As Parker introduced the named grades they named Grade 0 guns R, S, T, U and VH. Except for the VH which describes all Grade 0 hammerless Parkers, the other names describe Grade 0 hammer guns based on various gauge and stock configurations.  It had Decarbonized Steel barrels in the beginning and later used Plain Twist, Stub Twist or Plain Steel barrels. The early grade 0 guns were back action lifter guns and evolved into the front-action lifter. In 1899 the hammerless grade 0 , the VH, was introduced and it used Vulcan steel barrels. The grade 0 was the mainstay of Parker production and the fit and finish was excellent. They have little extra finish in the way of checkering or engraving and the wood used was plain, straight grain American walnut. The engraving was a simple border around the frame. The early guns had plain metal butt plates and later ones have hard rubber dogs head butt plates. The frame, forend iron and locks were casehardened."
