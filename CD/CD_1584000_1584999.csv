This rifle was purchased by me brand new in October of 2012. The rifle has about 200-250 rounds through it since that time (brass only).

During my time with this rifle I have not experienced a single FTF or FTE. I have always kept the rifle clean and also cleaned it right after firing. Notice that my price is not inflated, stop getting ripped off by people trying to sell you a C15 for more then $1000. This rifle MSRP's around 700-900.

Included in the 850 is of course the rifle, 4 30 round magazines and the sight. This is not the less the perfect bushnell trophy that is typically sold with the C15, it's a much better red dot. With it I can easily hold decent groupings at 100 yards. Costs around $180. Therefore with that and the magazines I think 850 is a fair price.

I have a full size M&P 9 that I shoot regularly so I ordered the compact for conceal carry.  However, in the time it took to get the gun from the factory, my interest changed.  So the M&P 9C has never gone into use.  Once I received it, I loaded it, function checked it, unloaded it, cleaned up the quart of oil that the factory ships it with, then put it back in the case.  Again, this weapon has not been fired since the factory test round.

One of the issues I had when I acquired the LCP was the low profile sites that were almost non functional for the accuracy that the LCP was capable of delivering so I had the slide dovetailed and fitted for better profile sights including a front tritium night sight. This is something Ruger decided to deliver with the new LC 380 pistol except that the new pistol is significantly heavier, nearly twice the weight. In addition, the feeding ramp has been highly polished to increase reliability and the trigger/sear has been polished for smooth trigger pull. This offering includes the original manuals, three magazines, case, and all that came with the original purchase. The gun has 300-500 rounds through it to break it in for reliability and I have fired a broad range of ammo without any malfunction. After the break-in and ramp polishing, this been absolutely reliable. For the buyer, I would have suggestions for ammo as I do considerable ballistic testing and have done that with this particular gun. The gun is also fitted with a Crimson trace laser and the gun is sighted dead on with both night sights and the CT laser for 30 feet combat distance. I have also fitted the gun with a belt clip and a home-made trigger block safety of my own making for IWB carry. The trigger block safety I crafted is easy to activate, you just push it out to the left or right as you place your finger on the trigger, yet adds a level of security to enable carrying a round in the chamber. I got the idea for a product I saw for glocks. I have carried this gun for nearly a year and it disappears; you don't feel it at all in your WB. I have also used a pocket holster and it disappears in your pocket. It is incredibly light for a .380; a great summer carry gun. This gun is capable for excellent accuracy for its size, shooting 2-3"" groups at 7 yards in fast fire mode for me. The offering comes with the original box, documents, locks, soft case, etc. It also comes with a book hide out I created which holds the gun and two magazines with a dust jacket for a book called 'Forgotten Valor' - see photos. It also comes with 3 each of extra different weight Wolf recoil and firing pin springs. I have trusted this gun with my life. You can buy a new LCP for less money, but you won't get the customizations or reliability out of the box you will with this one. Will accept cash or PayPal. Not interested in trades."

This is brand new and still in the box from the manufacturer.

Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun -- just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty. The abbreviated 3.8"" barrel and compact grip allow the Duty to disappear under clothing much more easily than full-sized models. This compact size and polymer frame along with the new slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached.

When designing the polymer frame for the Duty, the decision was made to retain the basic grip shape (circumference, angle, etc.) so popular in the CZ 75 family of handguns. The polymer frame platform eliminated the need for the grip panels that are used on most steel and alloy-framed autos. The absence of the grips resulted in some available space that was used to increase the magazine capacity by 2 rounds. The results speak for themselves -- the flush-fitting magazine of the P-07 Duty holds the same number of rounds that the full-sized versions of the CZ 75 do in both 9mm and .40 S&W.

The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. The new mechanism was first introduced on the P-07 model. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever (installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. 

P-07 DUTY FEATURES: 
16+1 9mm, 12+1 .40 S&W 
Convertible, safety or decocker 
New Omega trigger system 
Polymer frame with light rail 
Two 16 round magazines

She's all ready to be your home defense gun! Most guys have a couple barrels for their 870 to switch between home defense and field use/clays/hunting, now here it is the other way around so you can have a dedicated home defense or truck gun. 

I have a good bunch of ammo that will go with it so just ask, it'll be worth the money. 
I'd rather not have to mess with FFLs so face to face transactions are preferred unless you know your way around an FFL. 

PRICE IS OBO!!! I will listen to all offers and please keep my trades in mind (may be one of my trades + cash, a couple of my trades or just plain cash to get this receiver)"

861,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1584861,Want To Buy:  9mm Ammunition A MUST READ!!!!!!,"south, Sandusky, Ohio","$ 1,000","Listed On: Wednesday, May 8, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"You may not know this but George Soros owns most of the ammunition
 manufacturing companies and many arms manufacturers as well. He's selling ONLY to the government right now, per WH & DHS orders. My son works for ATK, who owns just about all the rest of the ammunition companies that Soros doesn't own. He tells me that ATK has been ordered by the federal government to curtail sales of ammunition, primers and powder to the retail market. What you see currently on the shelves is old stock and what's left in the warehouses since the CT shootings and new stock will NOT be appearing anytime soon. ATK and Soros' companies have more than enough government contracts to keep them going for years to come. Like Soros' companies, ATK is a huge defense contractor and they've been told to sell ONLY to the DOD, TSA, FBI, DHS and local/federal law enforcement agencies. This is VERY scary and VERY ominous for what's coming down the pike in the future.

My son has seen the proposed pricing schedule for Federal, CCI, Hornady,
Remington, Winchester and several other ammunition manufacturer's lines of ammunition, components, reloading equipment (ATK owns Outers, RCBS, Hoppe and a host of others) and he's flabbergasted! As an example, when the sales of .22 LR bulk ammo resumes, the pricing will be over $50.00 for a 535-round Value Pak! That's nearly a dime-a-shot!! They're also going to
raise the prices by 300 - 400% on dies, presses, powder measures and the
like. He's in management there at ATK in Salt Lake City and they're NOT
happy with it at all! They firmly believe this will basically shut-down
the civilian market while leaving the government as the only purchaser of
their products. He saw the government pricing for the centerfire
ammunition they've been stockpiling and their prices have actually dropped
from a year ago so the feds are buying this stuff REAL cheap while we
can't even get our hands on it at all!

Something I've always said since Obummer came onto the scene in 2008 is
that, even if they can't actually ban the weapons themselves, the
government will make it nearly impossible for us civilians to feed them
with ammo, reloading components and the like. The WH doesn't HAVE to
actually ban the guns, as Biden said in one of his many faux pas,
foot-in-the-mouth, Freudian slip speeches he's famous for making. "" All
we have to do is to make it too expensive to use them and the public will
eventually give them back to us if we offer an attractive price for these
weapons"". What's an ""attractive price"" - a $10.00 Walmart gift card for a
$3,000.00 custom hunting rifle? Those were his EXACT words in one of the
speeches he gave to the freshman congressmen last week! Remember, Biden was one of the architects of the Clinton gun ban of years ago. I think
he's as dangerous to the Second Amendment as Obozo is, maybe more so,
because he's so stupid and doesn't know the muzzle of a gun from the
butt...

Feel free to pass this on so gun owners will be aware of what we're up
against. I doubt the NRA can do anything about it, IMHO. La Pierre can
get on all the talk shows he's invited to and cry the blues about the
assault weapons laws that are forthcoming from the WH but the real crux of
the matter will be whether or not we'll ever be able to purchase
ammunition (at all) or, if we can, what we'll be paying for it. As an
aside, here, I deal a LOT with Midsouth Shooters Supply for my reloading
components. Two weeks ago I ordered 500 cases each of .45 Casull, .44
Magnum, .357 Magnum and 9mm Parabellum. I was told everything I had
ordered was out-of-stock and no in-stock delivery date was being forecast.
They wouldn't even accept a backorder for this stuff! Think the
government isn't manipulating it? Think again, my friend..."
