Ruger® LCR™ Revolvers
Light, compact and easy to conceal
Five-shot .38 Special+P
Recoil-taming Hogue or Crimson Trace grips
The Ruger Lightweight Compact Revolver (LCR) is a light, small-frame handgun with a smooth, easy-to-control trigger and highly manageable recoil. Its patent-pending polymer fire-control housing holds components in their proper dimensional relationships, reduces weight significantly and reduces recoil. An optimized friction-reducing cam results in a smooth, nonstacking trigger pull. The cylinder and barrel are supported by a monolithic, aerospace-grade aluminum frame treated with a black synergistic hard coat to reduce weight and enhance durability. The cylinder is strong 400 Series stainless steel, extensively fluted to reduce weight and is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s durable Target Grey® finish. Five-shot capacity."

Varmint-rifle performance and accuracy in a double action revolver. That’s what you get with our unique Raging Accuracy series. They are built with the same massively strong design as our Raging Bull™ 454 Casull revolver, with a signature bright Hornet Yellow grip insert. They feature dual cylinder lockup, eight-shot capacity, and a heavy unported 10-inch barrel for maximum shooting stability. The Raging Hornet comes in .22 Hornet and when fired, barely moves in your hand. Each gun is drop hammer forged and comes fully equipped with precision-adjustable open sights—but to get truly Raging Accuracy you’ll want to use the included new Taurus Scope Mount Base to fit a high-magnification scope.

A similar tenet is expressed by Marine Corps veteran and former SWAT team member, Clint Smith, who serves as President and Director of Thunder Ranch training facility in Lakeview, Oregon. When discussing the school's doctrines, Smith emphasized, ""We provide our students with functional and logical defensive tools that they can confidently use."" The newly-introduced, well-designed 500 Thunder Ranch shotgun is the culmination of Smith's life experiences and Mossberg's dedication to build dependable and innovative firearms.

At the core of the 500 Thunder Ranch shotgun is the field-proven 500 pump-action platform with non-binding twin action bars, positive steel-to-steel lock-up and anti-jam elevator for smooth, reliable operation. This compact 12-gauge features an 18.5-inch barrel and shortened synthetic stock with a 12.75-inch length of pull. The decreased overall length of 37 inches provides for added maneuverability in close quarters and for proper fit with use of tactical vests or gear. A fixed cylinder bore delivers optimal pattern densities and the machined stand-off barrel design can be used for breaching. For faster target acquisition, the barrel has a fiber optic front sight. Convenient tri-rail Picatinny fore-end provides for the easy addition of tactical lights and accessories. All exposed metalwork has a non-reflective matte blue finish and the durable stock and fore-end feature a matte black finish and sling swivel studs. Completing this tactical shotgun package is a handy, black padded sling; 6-round total capacity; 2 ¾ and 3-inch shell capability; and the distinctive Thunder Ranch logo engraved on the receiver.

""The new Mossberg 500 Thunder Ranch shotgun holds true to the doctrines and traditions of Thunder Ranch,"" stated Smith. ""Our goal is to provide individuals with the practical tools and defensive training that they need to defend their families and homes. Heidi and I are proud to work with Mossberg in the design of this effective, yet affordable tool.""

""Thunder Ranch has earned the reputation as one of the leading firearms training facilities in the world for military, law enforcement and private citizens,"" commented Tom Taylor, Vice President of Sales and Marketing for O.F. Mossberg & Sons, Inc. ""With the proven performance of the Mossberg 500 as the base platform, Clint provided us the necessary criteria to develop a defensive shotgun worthy of the Thunder Ranch name.""

*note*
The Lake City Army Ammunition Plant is where most of the small arms ammunition used by US Armed Forces is made. It's operated by a government contractor called ATK. And they're allowed to sell their excess production on the civilian market each year. They do so under the Federal label. I tested this ammunition in a colt LE AR with true M4 feed ramps, and multiple mags. It offered perfect function in all of them. There isn't really much to say here.

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life.
