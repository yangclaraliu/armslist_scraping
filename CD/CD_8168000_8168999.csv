The Benelli SuperNova® is an innovatively designed Pump-Action Shotgun made from the most advanced materials. The SuperNova is an ultra-reliable, nearly indestructible pump shotgun that's ideal for all-round rugged use. This SuperNova is finished with the Realtree MAX-4® camo pattern, designed specifically for waterfowl hunting. Filled with cattails, swamp grasses, and cane, MAX-4 blends in with marshlands as well as corn stubble and other agricultural cropland. The SuperNova comes with Benelli's ComforTech® recoil reduction system that tames recoil from magnum loads considerably and reduces muzzle rise for fast follow up shots. A shim kit enables adjustment of drop and cast; integrated sling attachments allow the shotgun to be carried with a sling. Benelli constructs the SuperNova with corrosion-proof polymer over-molded on a skeleton framework to form single-piece receiver and buttstock for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Exterior metal parts have a non-glare, anti-corrosive finish. The polymer forearm pushes a rotary-head bolt back with dual-action bars. Aggressive ribbing on a contour-tapered forearm provides a secure hold while cycling the action under any circumstance. A magazine disconnect button on the bottom of the forearm allows user to quickly unload the chamber without releasing another round from the magazine, to quickly load another round via the ejection port in the event that a different shooting situation suddenly presents itself. The premium steel barrel features a ventilated stepped rib with a mid bead and red-bar front sight. The Nova utilizes a magazine cap that doubles as a tool for pushing out the single pin that holds the trigger assembly in place; the shotgun can be fieldstripped down to basic components in less than a minute. The Benelli 12 gauge SuperNova Pump-Action Shotgun handles all 2-3/4"", 3"" and 3-1/2"" ammunition. The 3 included screw-in choke tubes (F, M, IC) enhance the SuperNova's versatility for hunting a variety of game over a wide range of habitats.

The Benelli SuperNova® is an innovatively designed Pump-Action Shotgun made from the most advanced materials. The SuperNova is an ultra-reliable, nearly indestructible pump shotgun that's ideal for all-round rugged use. This SuperNova is finished with the Realtree MAX-4® camo pattern, designed specifically for waterfowl hunting. Filled with cattails, swamp grasses, and cane, MAX-4 blends in with marshlands as well as corn stubble and other agricultural cropland. The SuperNova comes with Benelli's ComforTech® recoil reduction system that tames recoil from magnum loads considerably and reduces muzzle rise for fast follow up shots. A shim kit enables adjustment of drop and cast; integrated sling attachments allow the shotgun to be carried with a sling. Benelli constructs the SuperNova with corrosion-proof polymer over-molded on a skeleton framework to form single-piece receiver and buttstock for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Exterior metal parts have a non-glare, anti-corrosive finish. The polymer forearm pushes a rotary-head bolt back with dual-action bars. Aggressive ribbing on a contour-tapered forearm provides a secure hold while cycling the action under any circumstance. A magazine disconnect button on the bottom of the forearm allows user to quickly unload the chamber without releasing another round from the magazine, to quickly load another round via the ejection port in the event that a different shooting situation suddenly presents itself. The premium steel barrel features a ventilated stepped rib with a mid bead and red-bar front sight. The Nova utilizes a magazine cap that doubles as a tool for pushing out the single pin that holds the trigger assembly in place; the shotgun can be fieldstripped down to basic components in less than a minute. The Benelli 12 gauge SuperNova Pump-Action Shotgun handles all 2-3/4"", 3"" and 3-1/2"" ammunition. The 3 included screw-in choke tubes (F, M, IC) enhance the SuperNova's versatility for hunting a variety of game over a wide range of habitats.

A magazine disconnect button on the bottom of the forearm allows user to quickly unload the chamber without releasing another round from the magazine, to quickly load another round via the ejection port in the event that a different shooting situation suddenly presents itself. The premium steel barrel features a ventilated stepped rib with a mid bead and red-bar front sight. The Nova utilizes a magazine cap that doubles as a tool for pushing out the single pin that holds the trigger assembly in place; the shotgun can be fieldstripped down to basic components in less than a minute. The Benelli 12 gauge SuperNova Pump-Action Shotgun handles all 2-3/4"", 3"" and 3-1/2"" ammunition. The 3 included screw-in choke tubes (F, M, IC) enhance the SuperNova's versatility for hunting a variety of game over a wide range of habitats.

Ours features a deluxe checkered American walnut stock, a grooved receiver for easy scope mounting and a 19¼” barrel that will deliver the accuracy you need. The tubular magazine holds 11 rounds. It weighs 5½ pounds and overall length is 37½”. With regards to ballistics, in general the .22 Magnum projectile travels nearly twice as fast as the .22 LR, and produces more than triple the muzzle energy. Various types of .22 magnum cartridges are available from all the major ammo makers. Clair Rees, who authored a Rimfire Column article in GUNS Magazine, had this to say about our rifle, “I’ve done enough shooting with Henry’s .22 Magnum to know it operates smoothly and reliably. Accuracy is good, too. At 50 yards, it produced 5-rounds averaging an even inch center-to-center with Winchester Supreme jacketed hollowpoints. This great looking .22WMR lever carbine delivers. This is a good buy.”"

The XD® Mod.2® 5″ Tactical Model packs 16 rounds of 9MM ammo in each of its two included stainless steel magazines. While it’s a double stack design, it’s not too thick to carry like so many of our competitors’ models. Measuring just 1.2 inches wide, it is barely wider than single stack pistols with far lower capacity.
A pistol with a healthy sight radius is easier to shoot under stress, and that’s why we’ve chosen to fit the Mod.2® Tactical Model with a full five-inch hammer forged carbon steel barrel. It’s treated with Melonite® to stand up to moisture, sweat, and other undesirable conditions over the long haul."

Featuring the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2® .45ACP Sub-Compact is a great choice for comfortable and reliable concealed carry.
From high visibility low-profile sights to a slim-contour frame, the XD® Mod.2® .45ACP Sub-Compact is a pistol that squeezes a lot of value and features into a surprisingly small package. At just two tenths of an inch wider than the industry’s slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2® .45ACP Sub-Compact offers 9+1 rounds of .45ACP or 13+1 rounds with an X-Tension™ magazine. This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3.3” barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal.
Like all XD®s, the Mod.2® Sub-Compact is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ all work to make the XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol.
And of course, GripZone® ergonomics set the XD® Mod.2® apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2® Sub-Compact on target for round after round. When you pick up the XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact, you might find that a trip to the range is in your immediate future. After that, you’ll probably find that you’ve got a new favorite to carry."

Featuring the GripZone®, the XD® Mod.2® .45ACP Sub-Compact is a great choice for comfortable and reliable concealed carry.
From high visibility low-profile sights to a slim-contour frame, the XD® Mod.2® .45ACP Sub-Compact is a pistol that squeezes a lot of value and features into a surprisingly small package. At just two tenths of an inch wider than the industry’s slimmest single stack polymer frame pistols, the Mod.2® .45ACP Sub-Compact offers 9+1 rounds of .45ACP or 13+1 rounds with an X-Tension™ magazine. This noticeably slim profile, extraordinary capacity, and 3.3” barrel add up to make a carry pistol that offers serious firepower in a handgun that will easily conceal.
Like all XD®s, the Mod.2® Sub-Compact is loaded with safety features. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip-safety, internal firing pin block, and the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ all work to make the XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact a safe and easy to use pistol.
And of course, GripZone® ergonomics set the XD® Mod.2® apart from all others. Optimized contact between the human hand and the frame of the pistol keep the Mod.2® Sub-Compact on target for round after round. When you pick up the XD® Mod.2® Sub-Compact, you might find that a trip to the range is in your immediate future. After that, you’ll probably find that you’ve got a new favorite to carry."

RAS Forend Assembly Description: The KAC M4 RAS (Rail Adapter System) was developed for use on the US military's M4 Carbine, and with over 1 million rails issued to date, it is one of the most battle proven designs available for the AR-15 platform. This non-free float handguard is a simple-to-install, drop-in upgrade that features genuine Mil-Spec M1913 Picatinny Rails along its entire length. What sets the M4 RAS apart from other 2-piece quad rails on the market is that it securely locks to the rifle's barrel nut via a clamp and screw arrangement, making it a very solid foundation upon which to mount tactical accessories. Includes three KAC 11 Rib Rail Panels. Specifications: Length: 6.25"" Weight: 8.9 oz Free Float: No Material: Aluminum Finish: Black Anodizing Rifle Requirements: The M4 RAS is a drop-in replacement part for standard, 2-piece polymer, M4-type handguards. The rifle must have a carbine length gas system, delta ring assembly, fixed front sight/gas block, and round handguard end cap. Lighter barrel profiles work best (M4 or Government contours). Heavier barrel contours may require modification to the inside of the rail. For AR-15/SR-15 based platforms only; not compatible with SR-25 variantsPrefer cash but also open to pistol trade- would consider name brand CC"

The serial is in the first 15 ever made. Never fired outside of the factory. Factory crowned barrel, 3 (15 round) magazines, range bag (capacity: 2-4 boxes of ammo, pistol, 7 mags) with the original company name embroidered. Also included are two leather/kydex IWB and OWB holsters. Uses common Beretta 92 mags. Trigger is as crisp as it gets. This pistol rivals the big guys. Look anywhere, you will not find others on the market. Evans Manufacturing has put a lifetime warranty on this and they arent going anywhere. Story goes, the company had a gentlemens agreement with another company to use the name Nite Owl, once they started working to produce the early models they were presented with a law suit forcing the change of the name to New Order. Using a name with the same first characters allowed them to keep the logo and rebrand as needed. So this early model shows the original name and logo and comes with a bag with th original name (pre lawsuit). Really helps tell the story."

It remains in all original condition with the exception of the grips. The parkerized finsh shows some holster wear and thinning twords the front where you would expect it. The left side of the slide has less than the right so it was most likely carried by a left handed person durin the war. The front strap of the grip frame is excellent so it must have been carried more that shot. Where the finish has thinned the is no patina at all and it is just bright metal which is a plus. The bore only shows light wear and rates an 8 out of 10. The trigger has a crisp clean break to it. The grips are similar to what would have come with it but do not have the rings around the grip screw. Overall this is a very solid example of a rare WWII issued pistol.
