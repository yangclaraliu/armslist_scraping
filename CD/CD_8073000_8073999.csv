I have only seen one other come up on Gunbroker in the last year. This one has two magazines which are also hard to find. The Benelli handguns were only made for a few years in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s. This B77 is in great shape and shoots well. It has the target sighting and has excellent bluing. I am open to trades for high end AK’s or AR’s. It’s so rare that even armslist doesn’t have a listing for Benelli pistols! I would prefer face to face meeting but can ship to your FFL if they accept guns from private buyers.

The M22 brings you handling and performance that is closer to the modern defensive handgun than any other rimfire pistol. Designed for inexpensive high velocity 22LR ammunition, the accurate rapid fire performance of the M22 offers the shooter an economical shortcut for modern pistol practice.
The M22 gives shooters the opportunity to shoot with extreme accuracy due to the combination of a Lothar Walther match barrel, standard on all models, an extremely crisp, 4-lb single-action trigger and adjustable sights. The M22 is also the safest pistol on the market today with five safeties in every pistol.
All ISSC M22 pistols are finished with our proprietary Ti-clad, including the Two-Tone M22. The finish is comprised of the same chemical properties used by automobile manufacturers for exterior auto paint. This finish guarantees not only a very strong and even application, but protects your M22 pistol from all the elements that might otherwise harm the finish, including water, cleaning residues, gunpowders and other toxic chemicals.

This allows the rifle to be fired more accurately, because the rifleman's muscular tremors have less time to move the rifle off-aim. A hammerless design is also less likely to jam in brush or clothing.This model was made in 1918 and is chambered in 250-3000 also known as 250 SavageSee all the pictures click hereBuy hereREDACTED"

Pin Fire,"NE, Salem, Oregon",$ 750,"Listed On: Thursday, March 8, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"16 gauge pin fire antique damascus double barrel shot gun. I cannot locate a date for this item but a year range of 1840-1860 made in Belgium. The hammers are lose, but function. The triggers are firm and function. To open the breech hammers are placed at 1/2 cock and the lock under the barrels swing to your right. Some goober decided to coat the gun with some kind of coating on the metal, and shoulder stock making it look ""nice"" and ""preserving"" the gun. The bolt connecting the hammer plates together had a new thread tapped and bolt replaced. The little tang on top of the shoulder stock is loose at the rear. Barrel condition is very nice inside considering the approximate age, some minor pitting and or rust. I have in fact fired this shotgun by modifying modern 20 gauge hulls, small pistol primers, and 15 grains of pyrodex. If you want a very classic antique that is intact and fireable this may be for you. However please consider shells are not available and the use is not convenient at all compared to modern shot guns. I was very excited to get this piece, perhaps more than any gun I have acquired in a very long time. You may have a better use for it than hanging out in the safe. Were I to keep it I was thinking of removing with aircraft stripper the coating, and replacing the shoulder stock with a very beautiful walnut crotch cut with raised cheek rest. It is time for another to enjoy this piece. Make me an offer."
