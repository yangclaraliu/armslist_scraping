Tips for sniffing out these lowlifes that want to make you travel.  Luckily I sniffed this one out before going:
1. Don't travel to bring ammo - Best choice, sorry real buyers
2. If you still want to sell:
    - Get contact information and call it back
    - Only go if you have business in the area anyway
    - If they don't haggle at all, it is a clear red flag
    - Short messages 
    - When you find these lowlifes, pass the word on before the burn someone 
    - If they want to meet now, probably a scam

The 5.45x39 is the AK74 round that is super cheap to shoot. A case of 5.45 is selling for about $180 right now. If you have a AK74, this is a super easy way to get into the AR system and get a ultralight, accurate rifle that shoots the ammo you already have.

The upper is the uber reliable Smith & Wesson 5.45x39 carbine upper with a BCM Gunfighter charging handle and the new BCM Gunfighter compensator. The lower is a Aero Precision Milspec lower. The furniture is a Magpul MOE Handguard, BCM Gunfighter Grip, BCM M4 buffer tube assembly and a B5 Systems Bravo Stock and a Magpul rear BUIS. Buyer will receive all original parts and boxes. Rifle does not come with pictured RDS. 

This rifle is very accurate and only has about 1k rounds through it. Come with an Eagle rifle case, six 5.45x39 AR magazines, AR cleaning kit and six Magpul GI ranger modified to fit 5.45 magazines. 

I will sell just the upper with 3 mags for $800 & buyer pays for shipping. 

Also would consider trading upper for a 5.56 upper, or the full rifle for VEPR 308, a Glock 19/26 + cash, or a KelTec Sub-2000 9mm (Glock mags) + cash. 

If you 223/556 ammo prices too high, the 5.45 is selling at 20 cents a round. This is a great rifle, I am just cleaning out the safe. Great video outlining the 5.45x39 - http://youtu.be/CexkLfJ_bcI"

(Of these 38 super is the most rare)
So the 9mm-P220 is limited to a three year run never to be made again according to the people at Sig-Sauer. To heighten the overall rarity of the gun.. Sig told me that stainless steel slides accounted for lees then 10 percent of their total production runs for that year(1976)... although the 9mm-stainless steel SIG-P220 is not Ultra-rare.. it is highly likely that this will be the only one you ever see. In addition this gun has been cerakoated to perfection. It is a silver coat that is seemless and flawless... it is the best coating job I have seen.. both inside and out..
The gun is in excellent condition and functions flawlessly. It has been outfittted with the Era-Correct Wooden SIG grips...and has the european mag release on the bottom of the gun. Very tight..solid gun in amazing shape. has two magazines ..

Tripod is for sale at $600.  This iconic rifle is in excellent condition and ready to find a new loving home.

The M1919 Browning is a .30 caliber medium machine gun that was widely used during the 20th century. It was used as a light infantry, coaxial, mounted, aircraft, and anti-aircraft machine gun by the U.S. and many other countries, especially during World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Although it began to be superseded by newer designs in the later half of the century (such as by the M60 machine gun), it remained in use in many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries and elsewhere for much longer. It is very similar in design to the larger .50 caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Machine Gun, which is also a Browning-designed weapon and is still in NATO service.

Many M1919s were rechambered for the new 7.62×51 mm NATO round and served into the 1990s, as well as up to the present day in some countries. The United States Navy also converted many to 7.62 mm NATO, and designated them Mk 21 Mod 0; they were commonly used on river craft in the 1960s and 1970s in Vietnam.

The M1919 was an air-cooled development of the standard US machine gun of World War I, the Browning M1917, as designed by John M. Browning."

The rubber one has a storage compartment on the bottom side.  It also has a Burris AR-536 tactical scope.  I have the box the scope came in and have everything that came with it.  One of the mounting screws on the bottom is stripped.  I haven't contacted Burris to see how much one would cost, but shouldn't be more than a few bucks.  Other than that the scope is good.  You can check the specs on Burris' website.  But it is a 5x fixed power, with a BCD out to 600 yards for I believe 55gr.  It comes with 4-30 round clips.  A one point sling.

These were designed and manufactured in Israel specifically for the Tavor, but they function flawlessly in any gun designed to accept AR style magazines.

These 3rd generation E-Landers with a manufacture date of 3/13. They high reliability Israeli steel mags manufactured for the mako group. They feature white anti-tilt followers that make it much easier to identify an empty magazine, reinforced floor plates and a military tested protective coating covering the thick gauge steel body for added durability and reliability. The previous generation functioned flawlessly in my Sig 556 - I have 200+ rounds through the one in the picture below. While I never got any complaints on any of the 160 2nd generation mags I sold, issues reported around seating a full magazine and dropping free have been addressed in this generation: but in the third generation Mako has gone above and beyond to make the magazine compatible with every AR out there. These are very similar to the HK High Reliability Steel mags, but at a much better price. These are, in every way, far, far superior to C-Products magazines.

I also have Thermold 30 rounders coming at just $16 each!

Shipping is via Priority - I am offering a discounted flat rate of $5 for up to 4 magazines, and $10 for 5 or more.

- Lightweight (not pencil) Wilson barrel
- Chrome-lined to resist corrosion and rusting. Will last 1000s of rounds longer than an unlined barrel
- Yankee Hill (YHM) lightweight freefloat quadrail is as light as a standard plastic handguard yet it allows rock-solid attachment of sling, light, laser, foregrip, or bipod without degrading the barrel's accuracy
- Freefloated barrel is more accurate because it can resonate consistently
- 1-9 twist barrel handles a wide variety of ammo from standard 55 gr. up to heavier defensive rounds
- 5.56 NATO chamber
- A2 flash hider
- DTI upper
- Essential Arms lower
- Magpul MOE enhanced trigger guard
- This rifle is done right-- properly staked gas key, F-marked FSB, etc.
- Has had about 25 rounds through it-- just enough to break it in and sight it in

I will include the Burris 3-9x40 scope with calibrated ballistic drop reticle (already zeroed), Butler Creek caps, and rings for an extra $280, otherwise I keep it.
- This scope's reticle has tick marks spaced to match the bullet's flight, allowing you to place a shot right on target out to 500 yards without messing with the dials.  
- Burris scopes have a ""forever warranty""
- If you don't want it, you save $280 and the rail is ready for a nice red dot instead

If you're wondering how the scope works behind the front sight post, it works well.  There's a little loss of clarity and light transmission in the bottom center of the picture, but you can't see the FSP because it's so out of focus.

No sales to illegals.  I will ask to see your driver's license.

It's been used about 4 times and works great. I'm only letting it go because I need space in the house, and I only had one opportunity to use it this season so it isn't making the cut.

Compared to more expensive climbers it's a little heavy (the Lite version is aluminum instead of steel, so it's not the heaviest either), but it climbs as well as any of them. It comfortable enough to spend an entire day in it if you don't get bored. The stand and safety harness are still in very good condition.

Since 1986 Ultramax has provided top of the line ammunition with a reputation for accuracy, round after round at an unequaled value. All Ultramax ammunition is loaded to SAAMI specs and a visual inspection is performed on every loaded cartridge before it leaves the building.

All Ultramax remanufactured ammunition goes through a 10-Step Quality Assurance System. Once fired brass is inspected for flaws and is washed to clear the primer pockets and flash holes from any debris. Ultramax sizes each piece of brass to the same SAAMI specs as new brass. Remanufactured ammunition is often loaded with mixed head stamped brass. This ammunition is non-corrosive in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.

Detailed History of the Ruger P-Series:

The P series are short recoil-operated, locked breech semi-automatic pistols. They utilize a SIG P220 type locking system, and a 1911 style tilting barrel. The P series were made with a traditional double action/single action (DA/SA), or double action only (DAO) trigger mechanism.
The standard models have an ambidextrous manual safety/decocker located on the slide; when the safety lever is lowered to the safe position, the firing pin is cammed into the slide away from the hammer, the trigger is disconnected from the sear and the hammer is decocked. The decocker models have no manual safety; instead, when the lever is lowered it only cams the firing pin into the slide and drops the hammer, when the lever is released it springs back to the normal position. The DAO models have no manual safety or decocker. All models feature an automatic firing pin safety that blocks the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully rearward.[3][4]
The pistols make extensive use of investment cast parts and proprietary Ruger alloys. Nearly all internal parts, including the barrel, are stainless steel; while the slide and ejector are carbon steel. The P85 through P944 use an investment castaluminum frame, while the P95 and later models use a fiberglass-reinforced polyurethane frame.

Designed to reduce muzzle rise and felt recoil and it worked well on my rifle. I ran into a problem with my rifle because the rifle is a heavy varmint AR (12.5 lbs) and being designed to lighter rifles it had little enough recoil that this actually prevented proper cycling. Put in a regular buffer and it cycles perfectly now.  Even with the weight of my rifle it did reduce the recoil a bit and I'm sure it would be more pronounced on a lighter gun. Used 1 time for about 30 rounds  and shows a little wear from that but functionally perfect. 100.00 new and will sell for 50 as I have no real use for it due to the cycling problem.

We now have exactly one year to register our ""Assault Weapons"" and sell our STANDARD capacity magazines out of state or all of us people who own them are going to be felons. Personally I am not complying with ANY of this legislation and advise all of you to do the same. My ""Assault Weapons"" will NOT be sold out of state nor Registered. My STANDARD capacity magazines will stay loaded well OVER the 7 round limit & will also NOT be sold out of state. By complying with ANY of this legislation you are weakening the safety & security of your family, friends, neighbors and a FREE state. I'll take my chances of being arrested, jailed, or killed & all of you with a heart, a pair of balls & a substantial amount of intelligence will do the same. Thankfully the majority of the good men and women of our local and state law enforcement officers oppose this legislation and will not enforce it. To the few that are willing to sell themselves out for a bonus and enforce this law, I have absolutely no respect for you. I've been in contact with several state troopers and local LEO's and even a couple judges. I've heard mostly good things from them and you people should not fear prosecution. What is happening right now should bring fire to your hearts and tears to your eyes as it does mine. Use that passion as a defense against this assault on our rights instead of cowering in your homes with fear of prosecution."

This gun is dated 1941...manufactured in the Tula Arsenal. It is in excellent condition as the pictures show. Only minor wear from military type storage and includes the holster and cleaning rod. This is a double action revolver.

A little history:
The Nagant M1895 was the Tsarist Russian armies service revolver from 1895 until 1945. It was devised and designed by the famous Belgium gunsmith brothers, Leon and Emile Nagant in 1886. They also designed the renowned Mosin-Nagant M1891 bolt action rifle, this also for the Russian army.
The Nagant M1895 had a caliber of 7.62mm (.32 cal) and fired seven shots, there were two variants of this revolver, one was double action, only issued to officers whilst the other was single action issued to NCO's. Whether DA or SA though, they both had a very high twenty pound trigger pull, most revolvers have about twelve pounds.
However, it was a quality piece, being very well manufactured and exceedingly reliable in all conditions including cold Russian winters. What made this revolver so special though, was its extra power and covert capabilities that will be described further on.
It was known as a gas seal revolver in that when the trigger was pulled, the cylinder slid forward slightly and the cylinders aperture enclosed the breech so that there was no gap. With the cylinder/breech gap sealed off, the expanding gases from the firing bullet did not escape and hence was more powerful than any other revolver of the same caliber. It was an expensive and complex engineering feat but this didn't stop their mass production, as the army high command and troops alike thought well of them and hence were under high demand. This gas seal also made this the only revolver that could be effectively suppressed!

This historical Revolver was used and manufactured by the Russians throughout WWI and WWII. This gun is dated 1941...manufactured in the Tula Arsenal. It is in excellent condition as the pictures show. Only minor wear from military type storage and includes the holster and cleaning rod. This is a double action revolver.

A little history:
The Nagant M1895 was the Tsarist Russian armies service revolver from 1895 until 1945. It was devised and designed by the famous Belgium gunsmith brothers, Leon and Emile Nagant in 1886. They also designed the renowned Mosin-Nagant M1891 bolt action rifle, this also for the Russian army.
The Nagant M1895 had a caliber of 7.62mm (.32 cal) and fired seven shots, there were two variants of this revolver, one was double action, only issued to officers whilst the other was single action issued to NCO's. Whether DA or SA though, they both had a very high twenty pound trigger pull, most revolvers have about twelve pounds.
However, it was a quality piece, being very well manufactured and exceedingly reliable in all conditions including cold Russian winters. What made this revolver so special though, was its extra power and covert capabilities that will be described further on.
It was known as a gas seal revolver in that when the trigger was pulled, the cylinder slid forward slightly and the cylinders aperture enclosed the breech so that there was no gap. With the cylinder/breech gap sealed off, the expanding gases from the firing bullet did not escape and hence was more powerful than any other revolver of the same caliber. It was an expensive and complex engineering feat but this didn't stop their mass production, as the army high command and troops alike thought well of them and hence were under high demand. This gas seal also made this the only revolver that could be effectively suppressed!

This rifle uses PX4 magazines. |

I had someone message me that I was asking too much for this gun. Let me clarify a few facts for anyone who doesn't already know. 

First, you may be able to call your local gun shop and order this gun, I don't know, I never called mine. But know if you buy a gun from an FFL you will pay tax at 5.5% (in my county), and a background check fee that is usually between $15-35 depending on the gun. So, if a gun is sticker priced at $900 you'll actually pay about $970 out the door. 

That being said there are those who will pay a little more to be able to buy their gun from a private seller. I purchased this gun only to find out that it takes the px4 mags not the 92 mags. As I have a 92fs pistol and I want one that will use the many 92 mags I already have. So, since the retailer I purchased it from has a ""no returns"" policy I am selling it for only a couple of bucks more than I paid. I put the time into finding it, filling out the paperwork, and it's my name that is in the system if the Feds pass a law creating a federal firearms owner's database. So, I'm asking for an additional $35 for my time. Maybe you give your time away, I don't. 

So, anyone who is inclined you don't need to send me messages other than about your interest in buying this gun. If you think its over priced, blah, blah, don't buy it.

Also, I know its not technically a bullpup but most folks don't know what bullpup actually means (the action is behind the trigger). So, I use the term bullpup to give folks a ready image of what the guns looks like. 

I am a private seller. I'm happy to sell for cash to any legal Wisconsin resident. I will ask to see your driver's license to prove residency and age.  

Happy to ship the gun to any FFL holder in the country. I charge $30 to ship a long gun via Fedex insured and trackable.  

""The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine.
This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge.

A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of  the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. 

This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included).

The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities. From the 20 round magazines of the 92 and Px4 pistols, to the 17 round magazines of the .40 caliber Px4, there is a Cx4 configuration to complement every Beretta pistol."""
