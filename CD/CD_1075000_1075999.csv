DPMS RFA3OC Panther Oracle Semi-Auto223 Rem/5.56 NATO
Whether you are buying your first AR rifle, or need an affordable yet
accurate plinking gun, the Panther Oracle is for you. Built to bridge the
gap between the Sporting and Tactical markets, this introductory level
carbine features a 16' light contour barrel, an A3 Upper receiver with
Picatinny Rail, heat dissipating GlacierGuards and a collapsible,
six-position Pardus buttstock. Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs.
The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice
on the Picatinny Rail. The 16"" barrel, although light, provides plenty of
velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. The Pardus stock
makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter.

Ruger makes a nice pocket carry gun in the LCP. Only reason I am selling it is I have moved to all 9mm. Perfect every day carry for many folks. I have carried it almost every day since I bought it in December.
Comes with two six round clips, pocket holster (which works really well), lock, original box and manual. 
It was all black, but every time I broke it down to clean it, some of the finish would come off, so I decided to polish the steel and make it a two tone. The finish will be polished one more time for the next owner!

I am looking to trade my Romanian AK for something different. I really don't have anything particular in mind. If you are interested let me know what you have and let's make a deal. I'm just putting this out to see what there is out here. I have 2-30rd and 1-40rd mag, bayonet, side folding stock, front fore grip, a three carrier magazine pouch and approximately 400 rounds of 7.62x39 ammo. The ammo is mixed some FMJ and some hollow points.

Springfield Armory® SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a
standard picatinny rail.

Here's the deal: ever since I bought this rifle it fires and operates just fine for 5-6 rounds, then stops cycling. When it does, you can rack the bolt and it extracts just fine, and feeds fine, but won't work correctly until you give it a thorough cleaning.

I've tried several different types of ammo, different mags, nothing helped. Last thing I tried was putting in all brand new HK internals, HK firing pin/spring, extractor/spring, HK +2 rollers/retainer/retainer pin (over $100 in bolt parts), set the bolt gap at .017. Shot it today, same thing. Works great for 5-6 rounds then stops cycling.

I've searched the HK and CETME forums online and have done everything I can think of to do, but I'm not enough of a gunsmith to figure this out. These are going for $1200-1400 now; I'll sell it for $700. I don't think it will take a lot to fix this, just don't have the time or the knowledge to do so myself. Will throw in a couple alloy mags."

I don’t really want to sell this rifle, but I now own three different Daniel Defense rifles, and I don’t need this one. I hope that you’ll buy it, but, to be honest, I kinda also hope that you won’t...

Long story short, if you want an incredible rifle, this is a great one. I might choose a LaRue, Noveske, KAC or Wilson over this one (which is sad that I may never get one of these now, at least not without selling my house), but this rifle is pretty close to those super-premium rifles. I know that, from what I have seen, I wouldn’t choose any other options over this rifle (it is measurably better rifle than my Colt AR-15, which most folks consider the standard by which others are measured). If you just want to go out and do some target shooting, this will certainly work, but—to be honest—there are a lot of rifles that can do that job for significantly less. If, however, you are looking for a rifle on which you might need to bet your life, this is one on which you would feel comfortable making that bet. Go to YouTube and watch the Daniel Defense torture test and judge for yourself!

OK, so here are the vital statistics for this rifle:

It's completely free floating. Mid length, requires a low pro gas block if your using a carbine or mid length gas system, requires gun smithing to install. This has been freshly cerakoated and it is in PERFECT shape with zero blemishes, not used since, very little handling, you won't fine anything wrong with the hand guard or the barrel nut, the lock ring has some scuffs but they're only a few dollars from RRA if it bothers you. 

THERE ARE VERY FEW ROCK RIVER HANDGUARDS ANYWHERE FOR SALE IN THE COUNTRY, with everyone panic buying AR parts, VERY HARD TO FIND. I will ship with insurance/full tracking for $5

THe picture on the gun is old, before its was cerakoated, the pic of it alone is as it will come.

Springfield Armory® SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a
standard picatinny rail.
