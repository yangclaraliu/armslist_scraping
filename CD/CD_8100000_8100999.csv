My price is fair and firm for a vintage model 10 in excellent shape.  Please do not email asking me if I will take less, because I won't.  If the price bothers you, please move on.   You can always scour GunBroker and hope to snag one for a few dollars less, but I have done my research...and you won't.  Understand I am not being a jerk, but I am tired of the rediculous inquiries.  Buyer must pick up in Menomonee Falls area.  Buyer must be able to legaly purchase, sign a bill of sale, and show valid ID (CCW prefered).  My terms are also fair and firm.  If they bother you, please move on."

Serial Number: 30,688. This is the high polish variant, made to the highest quality. The finish on early CZ 27 pistols, with serial numbers ranging from 20,500 to 230,000, was bright blue. As the production progressed, the finish changed to dull blue, then to half blue and half phosphate, and finally to all phosphate. This pistol displays a Nazi-German Military “eagle/WaA 76” WaffenAmt acceptance mark (on right frame, top slide, and barrel). The barrel is stamped with an “eagle clutching a swastika” German Military test proof mark. The top of the slide is marked “BÖHMISCHE WAFFENFABRIK A.G. IN PRAG” (Česká zbrojovka [CZ] in Prague) followed by the Nazi proof and serial number. Left side of the slide is marked “Pistole Modell 27 Kal. 7,65”. All the numbered parts are matching (right on frame, top of slide, left on side plate, and on barrel). In March 1939, Germany occupied all of Czechoslovakia, and in early 1941, all CZ 27 pistol production was diverted to the German war effort. Czechoslovak sources put the beginning serial number of German Military production at 20,500 (the serial number of our early pistol is 30,688). Between 620,000 and 650,000 CZ 27 pistols were manufactured in total, 452,500 of those under German occupation. The pistol is complete with an original factory magazine stamped on the bottom of the base “P. Mod. 27”. This pistol has the original high polish blue finish, strawed small parts (straw color is generous), and is fitted with original one piece checkered Bakelite (early plastic) excellent grips with no cracks or chips, with the “ČZ” logos molded on the top. What makes this pistol so attractive is that the slide has turned a very nice reddish plum color that makes this pistol very attractive and appealing to the eye. This is a rather common WW2 German-issued pistol in uncommonly nice condition. CZ 27 was one of the most widely-issued non-German pocket pistols of WW2. They are extremely well-made and overbuilt. While most CZ 27 variants are quite common, it is difficult to find early pistols like this one in such exceptional condition. The pistol is housed in an original leather flap holster.For more info or to purchase click>>>>>CZ 27<<<<<"

You would be lucky to have one custom made for double the parts cost.  If you are looking for a fine custom percussion rifle that you can shoot and be proud to display above the fireplace this is it.  FTF in Chattanooga area.

CZ Model 1924 (vz. 24), in .380 ACP, was the standard Czechoslovak Army pistol of the inter-war period manufactured by Česka Zbrojovka (CZ) in Prague (as displayed on a rib on the top of the slide “Česka Zbrojovka A.S. v Praze”). It was an improved version of the CZ 22, which had been licensed from Mauser. Production of the CZ 24 started in August 1925. The original order for 20,000 pistols was completed in June 1926. More orders followed, and by the end of 1929, 100,000 pistols had been accepted by the Military and Gendarmerie, called in Czechoslovakia the “Četnictvo”. Overall, approximately 200,000 CZ 24 pistols were made. An inventory on January 1, 1939, showed the Czechoslovak Army and Air Force had on hand 171,756 CZ 24 pistols. The regular serial number range for the CZ 24 pistol is: 12,000-190,000 (there were some pistols produced as part of small international orders/contracts in a separate serial number range, for example, all 9-shot CZ 24 pistols range from serial number 1 to about 3,100, and are dated from 1929 to 1931). The serial number of this pistol is 12,042, making it the 42nd CZ 24 pistol ever manufactured. It was a part of the original order for 20,000 CZ 24 pistols completed in June 1926. The pistol is factory dated 25 (1925) and it stayed in the factory warehouse until purchased by the Military in 1926. It displays the 1926 acceptance “J, rampant lion, 26” mark of Czechoslovak Military. The pistol is unit marked to the Czechoslovak Army’s 39th infantry regiment (39P 842 534). CZ 24 is a meticulously crafted, well-built, robust, and reliable pistol that was very highly thought of at the time. During the German occupation (March 1939 – May 1945), the Czechoslovak Armed Forces were disarmed, and all the weapons were utilized by Germany and its allies. The CZ 24 pistols were not marked by the Germans, in any way, except for those used by the German Navy. CZ 24 pistols were also issued to the German Air Force, and Waffen-SS. The pistol is fitted with one-piece, smooth wood grips. Magazine capacity is eight rounds, and a Mauser Model 1910-style safety switch is mounted to the left of the pistol. The pistol is housed in an original leather flap holster.For more info or to purchase click>>>>>CZ 24<<<<<"

From 1890 to 1989, Colt manufactured a variation of the venerable Single Action Army with a uniquely different profile. The “Flattop Target Model” was fitted with an adjustable leaf rear sight and a blade front sight. Colt has taken this concept several steps further to bring shooters a reintroduction of a Colt classic. The New Frontier has that sleek flattop design with a rear sight that is adjustable for windage and elevation along with a target ready ramp front sight. The New Frontier is offered in .44 Special and .45 Colt in various barrel lengths. These guns are meticulously finished in Colt Royal Blue on both the barrel and cylinder, with a color case hardened frame. Finishing off the classic package are hand fitted walnut stocks with gold Colt medallions. Powerful and Versatile• Adjustable Rear Sight for Windage and Elevation• Ramp Style Front Sight• Royal Blued Barrel and Cylinder• Flat Top Color Case Hardened Frame• Walnut Stocks with Gold Medallions"

This shotgun comes in Good, Mostly Clean, Working, Pre-Owned condition. It does have some minor wear/tear, which can be attributed to the fact that it was previously owned, and saw only an average amount of normal usage. There are a small handful of shallow scratches and scrapes, as well as the occasional chip or nick throughout the shotgun's wood stock, including the shotgun's forearm. The stock is capped on the end with a hard rubber buttplate with the Mossberg brand name stamped on it. This shotgun's receiver is also in good shape, and has been etched by the manufacturer with a beautiful pattern of scrollwork. The action slides open easily, and the inside chamber, as well as the inside of the barrel show only minor signs of rusting, scratching, and scraping. The barrel is ribbed on top, and features a bead sight at the end. While the barrel does not show any rusting or pitting on the outside, it does have a moderate amount of scraping, which has rubbed a fair amount of the blueing off. This is a fantastic shotgun, that would make a great addition to anybody's collection. Please see our listing images, as well as available images on our website here, to see the EXACT condition of this shotgun. And if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask."

If you collect Czech pistols, note that this CZ 22 is one of the very first Czech pistols ever manufactured (SN 1818)! The CZ 22 was the first Czechoslovak Army pistol of the inter-war period. The pistol is the rare 9 mm Nickel caliber (caliber .380 ACP, known in Europe as the 9 mm Browning short). Also known as the “Nickel” or “N” pistol, CZ 22 was designed by Josef Nickl (also Joseph Nickel), who was employed at the famous Mauser Factory in Germany. Using the Mauser pistol, known variously as model 1910 or 1914 as a basis, he modified it to his own design. Brno manufactured only some 18,000 of the original Army Pistol Model 1922 before more modifications were ordered and production shifted to Česka Zbrojovka (CZ) works at Prague and Strakonitz. Fewer than 22,000 CZ 22 pistols had been made. CZ 22 served as a prototype for the CZ 24. The left side of the pistol displays the factory marking on the trigger plate, “Čs. st. zbrojovka, Brno.”, which translates to Czechoslovak State Arms Factory in Brno; the early 1920’s Czechoslovak Army acceptance mark (“S”, rampant lion, “6”) on the lower right of the trigger guard; and the “ČET” mark on the upper left of the trigger guard, which means Gendarmerie (Četnictvo in Czech). The right side of the pistol displays the army acceptance mark (“v.”) on the upper right of the trigger guard. Army unit marks (“32P 868” – the 32nd Infantry Regiment weapon 868) are displayed on the front of the grip strap. Czech pistols are widely collected these days and this is a great example of one of the hard to find key pieces. We only get one of these pistols every couple of years so if you need one, consider the rarity of the pistol. The pistol is housed in an original brown leather flap holster.For more info or to purchase click>>>>> CZ 22<<<<<"
