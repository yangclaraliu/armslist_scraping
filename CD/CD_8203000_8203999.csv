The Tavor SAR Rifle is lightweight, compact and ergonomically designed to become a natural component of the soldier. The Tavor is the most modern weapon technologically wise, based on a complete and manipulative platform which highly increases the performance capabilities of the soldier.

The weapon is ambidextrous and can be easily adapted to right or left handed shooters. The weapon has an ergonomic structure and is made of composite material; therefore, it is very light. The Tavor SAR rifle was developed in close collaboration with Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor has been chosen the weapon of service in the IDF infantry troops and Special Forces as well in many countries around the world. The constant use of IWI’s weapons enables the company to design its products accordingly, optimizing its features to face the modern way of combat. The Tavor is state of the art modern design weapon which includes modular picatinny rails. ""Flattop"" rails for multiple single line accessories and devices are also available. The Tavor SAR Rifle is a complete platform that comprises optical devices and other accessories, thus distinguishing itself as the ultimate weapon of the XXI century.

I have two boxes of bullseyes that I no longer need as well as one holster to go with it. New this model is $699. When you look online for the prices make sure your not looking at the 642 model for there is a difference between 642 and 642CT. It also adds the extra $200. This gun has been fired but not much. It’s mostky just sat in the box. It is not registered either and contains all the papers and original box. I feel $550 is a fair price for the gun, bullets and the holster. If your not interested in the other items and just want the gun I do not intend on lowering the price much but will consider all offers made."

Lockup and timing are tight, there are no scratches that I can see, and the grips are free of cracks and chips except for a tiny (and I mean tiny) piece of wood missing near one of the screw holes. (I can provide a picture if needed.) Barrel is pinned.Comes in original box with matching end label, all paperwork as shown, all tools as shown (including a S&W screwdriver), and a set of Pachmayr K-frame Presentation grips in their original box, part number SK-S-BLK.
