Semi-Auto in .243 is hard to find in any make, but Remington is the hardest.

This is a BDL style stock and forearm.  Lots of checkering and Patterns. 

The bluing is in about 80 - 90 percent.

The Wood Stock and Forearm are about 75%
The darkl spots on the forearm are where the finish is gone and gun oill has stained the wood darker.  Gives it a cool rugged look. 

I am not much into trades unless you have something of double value to trade even.  hahahahaha
I would listen to conversation about any Remington BDL guns you may have.

Redfield Revolution 3-9 x 50 brand new.  You can have it and the rings for $250

The Rifle is $450

There is plenty of .22 out there, it just so happens that anyone selling it has hopped on the bandwagon to try and capitalize on ignorant people. If this is you, then YOU are part of the problem! If you are still reading, this is where it gets good. I have a comfortable amount of .22lr for myself but just to make a point and hopefully others will start to follow suit I am willing to sell 10 individual 50rd. boxes of Blazer .22lr for $2.00 each. This is how it will work: So as to not go to someone looking to turn a rediculous profit on this ammo, there is a one box limit. You must pick up in person and be 21 or older. Pick up area would be Wilmington or Brattleboro. I would really like this to go to someone who has little to no .22lr so that maybe they can get out and shoot for cheap. Please, in your response, tell me why you need this ammo. If you ask for more than one box, ask to meet anywhere else, or ask me to ship I will ignore your message. The total amount this 500rds. will sell for is $20. I hope maybe people can pay it forward and do the same so we can start getting back to normal and start having fun at the range and in our back yards."

If you expect to find Walmart prices anywhere on Armslist your crazy. Walmart is the single largest firearm and ammunition distributor in the entire world. There is a reason they are so cheap. If you want those kind of prices then stock every Walmart with-in 30 miles of your house every day all day, deal with there lazy, rude, and disrespectful associates, and get there at the crack of dawn well before they start selling there ammo to get in line and then buy your maximum of 3 boxes of hopefully the largest quantity box sold for that caliber. But if not and you are tired of or don't have the time for all that B.S. then that's where I come in. No B.S, no lines, no waiting, no disrespect, available way past 10pm and before 7am everyday, can deliver locally, I take custom orders for specific ammo and calibers, my prices are not set in stone, and im relatively knowledgeable about firearms and ammunition and more than happy to help you with anything even if you buy nothing. If you expect all that for Walmart prices then please move on because I cant offer them without loosing all my money. All my prices are very reasonable in today's market and if you disagree let me know and well try to work something out. Im not trying to make millions or feed my family as I have a ""real"" job for that. Just trying to help folks out that don't care for all the B.S. involved with everything firearms these days and ease the sting on my wallet a little from my shooting habits. With all that said I HAVE AMMO :) and I have it now. As of right now I have **223**45ACP**40s&w**22lr**7.62x54r**12 gauge** for sale. I am trying to get rid of it ASAP as I need to make room for a new load of inventory coming this weekend and early next week. By mid next week ill again have about 7+ different calibers on hand and for sale with no B.S. Not gunna post which calibers yet as I don't need 50+ emails inquiring about something I dont have yet. Ill post as soon as its in my hands or if you'd like will send out an email stating what, how many, and how much $ for that given caliber. ****UPDATE**** So for now I have **223**45ACP**40s&w**22lr**7.62x54r**12 gauge**

Again one last time in case you forgot. I AM NOT WALMART.
I generally answer every email with-in 5 minutes 24/7 as long as I am at least kind of awake. If you would like to communicate via text message that works for me too. I can deliver for a very small fee depending on my availability at the moment and where i'm delivering to. If you are looking for something in particular from stocks to flash hiders and everything in between let me know as I can get ALMOST anything relatively quickly and the price varies depending on many different factors. Well thank you very much for taking the time to read my ad and I look forward to doing business with you.

The Interdynamic KG9 pistol was made in Miami Florida for a short time in the 1981-82 timeframe by Interdynamic of America, Inc. ATF decided in January 1982 that the gun was too easy to convert into a machine gun, and therefore decided that an unmodified open bolt semi-auto KG-9 was a machine gun. ATF exempted unmodified semi-auto KG-9 pistols made before this ruling from the scope of the ruling, so there are so-called grandfathered KG-9 pistols available in the USA. The KG-9 was based on a Swedish designed machine pistol, the MP-9. After the ATF ruling the gun was redesigned into a closed bolt, striker fired pistol, the Interdynamic KG-99, which was sold in the 1982-83 timeframe. After that Interdynamic went out of buisness.

The original gun the cheap tec-9 was made to copy. Rare! Less than 1000 made! Look it up. Look up prices too. This is the short (meaning shorter barrel & no heat guard.)

Someone who is a collector or who appreciates military arms in their original condition needs to have this one.
Between my father and I, we've owned dozens of Mosins over the years, and we both agree that this is the cleanest we've seen.
It's a 1935 Tula hex receiver ex-PE sniper, not the more common PU sniper of the later years.
As with all the ex-snipers, the scope and mount were removed, and the holes in the receiver were welded shut and ground off. With the PE snipers, which were typically top-mount scopes, the holes are not visible from inside. You can only tell they were there by the grind marks and slight dumpling on the outside of the receiver.
The bolt is super smooth, the best I've ever felt on a Mosin.
The stock is in great shape as well.
It includes only the cleaning rod and bayonet.
All numbers are stamped, and match, with the exception of the bayonet.
The gun is exactly as I took it out of the box. I saw what great condition it was in, and immediately decided that I'd have to buy a different one for my planned project, this one needs to go to a better home.
More photos available upon request, for serious buys only.
I'm not interested in trades, but the price is slightly negotiable.
I just want to recoup my money, since I already ordered another one for my project."

Serial is 67925. Stock, reciever, magazine plate, trigger guard, forend, and bolt all match.  The bolt was factory force matched and remains un-rearsenaled by CAI.  To the best of my knowledge, it was made in 1945. However, this rifle seems unique in that it is built with some pre-war parts, such as the barrel and front sight post (non-hood sight). The barrel is immaculate and looks like new with strong rifling. The beechwood stock shows some occasional wear and markings, but nothing to be concerned about and the forend is also VERY SOLID AND TIGHT, no movement whatsoever, which is a concern with these rifles and barrel harmonics. No rust or pitting anywhere.  I wanted to preserve the history of the rifle and did not refinish it. The action is very smooth, and I was surprised by the bolt. It doesn't look ergonomic, but it is one of the fastest bolts I have ever cycled, especially while still shouldered.

It shoots 7.5x54 french, which can easily be found online or reloaded. Surplus ammo can be found online for as low as $5 for 20 rds on stripper clips (avoid syrian ammo though, it's shitty). You can also reload using the same load data as .308 and same powder, primers, and bullets. Casings can EASILY be had as you can resize 6.5 swede casings, 30.06 casings, or buying PPU 7.5 brass. This is one of the cheaper milsurp rifles to feed, aside from a 7.62x54r.

I have shot around 50 rds through this rifle with absolutely no malfunctions (except for 5 rds syrian ammo with bad primers) It is very accurate at 100 yards, making nice round groupings with about 1-1.5 moa with french surplus ammo. Could probably get sub moa with handloads. 

The rifle includes its original spike bayonet and a reproduction (non-leather) sling.

These rifles are somewhat rare, and definitely underrated as they never got the chance to be proven in battle with the french army. More pics available, Asking $400 OBO

This is the one I shoot the least, so...

This is an FN Herstal PBR in 308 caliber, with the 22"" medium bull barrel.
In case you're not familiar, this rifle is based on the Pre-64 Winchester model 70 action, which is generally held by real shooters to be one of the finest rifle bolt actions ever made. It's rock-solid and designed to outlast me, you, and your kids. :)

The stock is a Hogue fully overmolded with a solid aluminum bedding block/pillar system, free floating the barrel.

The scope is a cheap NCStar, but it's VERY high powered (10-40x!) and worked fine the day I tried it out.

It includes a Harris-type bipod (not sure of brand, may be a Harris, not sure) and a really nice padded tactical (shock) sling.

The metal has been Duracoated in Flat Dark Earth (FDE) inside and out to protect from the elements, should you decide to hunt in foul weather.

This is an extremely rare rifle. There is exactly 1 one for sale on gunbroker, and none that I can find here on Armslist, if that tells you anything.

I've only had it to the range once (got it in trade a while back), but it shot just over 1 MOA with cheap steel case FMJ ammo at 200 yards in a nasty gusting crosswind. All the reviews and range reports I've found say that it's easily sub-MOA with decent ammo. I have no reason to doubt it.

The previous owner told me he had some bolt work done to it, so it's supposed to be slicker than stock. I don't have anything to compare it to, but the action is very smooth.

The trigger is adjustable. I'm not sure how it's set at the moment, but my ""finger scale"" says it feels like around 3.5 lbs with very little travel, so I'm happy.

I'm not really looking to trade, since that would defeat the purpose of ""getting rid of a few guns"", but you're welcome to offer if you have something you think I might like."

The mosin is great shape for a mosin, the smith and Wesson is basically in brand new condition, the Llama is in good condition except the dots on the sights are faded, and the tokarev looks brand new and is in great condition (could not include upclose pic of the Tokarev but if your interested I can send you one.

Abstract:  This pistol is truly a collectible.  It's history, smooth trigger and build quality are superior.  This pistol would make a fantastic addition to any collection.

History:The Smith and Wesson Model 39 was a semi-automatic pistol developed for the US Army service pistol trials of 1954.  After the Army abandoned its search for a new pistol, the Model 39 went on the civilian market in 1955 and was the first of Smith & Wesson's first generation semi-automatic pistols. Used by the Illinois State Police and the US Navy SEALs, it was a groundbreaking pistol for use with the military and law-enforcement agencies."

www.wickedlasers.com.hk

I have the 1000mW/445nm version - the videos online show this thing lighting matches, burning paper and popping balloons, but I think that's just for the 1250W+ models. I tried it, nothing happened.

I'm selling it because I really have no practical purpose for it, plus I'm a little worried about an accidental occular exposure. While it might not burn paper, IT WILL BURN YOUR RETINAS instantly and permanently. I played with it for half an hour and decided that this thing is more laser than I'm comfortable with and I should stick to the $5 keychain type laser :-P

These things are getting hard to find - Amazon pulled them from their listings quite a while ago. Can still buy from the manufacturer, but it'll cost ya $300.

Comes with:
- laser unit
- rechargable battery and charger
- safety glasses (yes, they're a good idea)
- case and lens wiping cloth for glasses

Pros:
- it looks like and is about the size of a lightsaber
- the laser is blue
- the beam is visible in dim rooms and really visible outside at night
- would be great for star pointer or astronomy hobbyists, or somebody with an interest in spectroscopy
- has safety disconnect plug and security sequence for activation

Cons:
- risk of blindness if mishandled
- risk of felony charges if pointed anywhere near airplanes
- DEFINITELY NOT FOR KIDS OR ENTERTAINING PETS

While you might think this is totally ridiculous, I will require the signing of a receipt for my records (if the feds show up at my house because somebody pointed a blue laser at a plane and I am one of the 20 people in the state on record for purchasing one of these things, I will want to cover my ***).

The red-dot sight comes with 7 intensities and 4 different dot styles.

-Ruger backpack
-lock

This 10 22 has built-in iron sights, but you can mount a rail over the action if you prefer a red dot or scope.  The rifle is brand new, never loaded, only removed from the bag for pictures.  Really cool gun, lightweight, compact, and easy to carry.  The barrel and fore end twists off when the bolt's locked open and the two pieces slide into separate velcro compartments in the backpack.

The backpack itself has two outer zippered pockets, one with compartmentalized pouches can hold six 25-round magazines and the other which can hold a pistol, ammo, and some extras.  There is a third compartment inside which can hold a scope, cleaning rod, or some other long objects.  The bag comes with one strap which can be used for over-the-shoulder carry, but it has two sets of additional D-rings for back-pack carry with an additional strap or straps.  The bottom pocket of the backpack will accommodate molle gear.

This is perfect for your bug-out-bag, or just for carrying in the trunk of your car.  It's discrete enough that you can carry it anywhere, yet it assembles in seconds for a functioning rifle.

I have some BRAND NEW extras available that I can include for an additional price, including:

In fact, if you're interested, I'd be happy to meet you at the range with no obligation and show you what this fantastic revolver is all about, just make sure you bring some cash because this revolver will literally start to sell itself from the first time you hold it. I am also happy to ship anywhere you'd like to the friendly FFL of your choice, with a 14 day satisfaction guarantee from delivery date. As much as I love this revolver, I am pricing this to sell because I would like to consolidate my calibers and I am interested in buying another gun that is currently for sale.

To seal the deal, I'll also include 70 rounds of hollow point ammo, worth around $70, but because it is priced to sell quickly, my price on this package is firm

Here is some info about this hand gun.
After the Second World War the Ministry of the Interior requested a new pistol design from Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod. The resulting pistol in .32 ACP was designed by two brothers Jan and Jaroslav Kratochvíl and closely copied from the Walther PP and PPK. The grip is made of bakelite. The pistol is fed from an 8-round single-stack magazine, located within the grip frame. Small fixed sights are located on the top of the slide. The operation is blowback - recoil causes the spring, which is located around the fixed barrel, to compress. The slide, after it reaches the end of its rearward travel, is returned forward by the recoil spring, stripping a new round from the magazine as it does so. The operation is double-action - after a round has been chambered and the hammer has been lowered, the hammer may be reengaged by squeezing the trigger."

I am selling my M&P15 22, model number 811030. It is in like-new condition with less than 1000 rounds through it. The rifle was purchased on Janury 15th this year. I maticulouly cleaned and oiled it before the first time I shot it and on the same day after each time I shot it. I'm the type of person that would rather have oil oozing out at the openings than risk any rust. The rifle was always stored in a temperature controlled evironment and protected from dust/humidity. My favorite thing about this rifle, other than how much fun it is to shoot, is that it has never jammed. I've read in a forum that S&W let a batch of these out to dealers at one point that had issues with jamming, but this is not one.

Included with the rifle are the following items:
-Original Box
-Original Instructions/documentation
-One brand new S&W 25 round magazine
-Two used S&W 25 round magazines
-One used Plinker Tactical 35 round magazine
-NCStar 3 Rail System 3-9x42 scope with blue illuminated mil-dot reticle
-Red dot sight with integrated laser sight
-Ergonimic fore-grip

I am selling 1000 rounds of 7.62x39 Wolf Military Classic Non Corrosive Steel Cased Ammo. It is all new manufacture in a case or 1000 rounds (50 x 20 Rounds) I am asking $10.99 a box for less than 25 box purchases, or $500 even for all 1000 rounds.

This rifle has a free floating glass bedded barrel, recessed target crown, stock-satin walnut stock, 60º bolt, blued finish, adjustable trigger and a hinged 3-round magazine floorplate. 

The rifle also has a muzzle brake which considerably reduces recoil from rather unpleasant to just a strong .30-06 load. With low power ammo even recoil sensitive people can use it. 

The rifle has a Nikon Buckmaster 3-9X scope mounted on it and it is included with the rifle. It has a bullet drop compensating reticle and is in perfect condition. I have the original packaging for the scope and I will also include it. The walnut stock is in good condition, only a couple very small minor blemishes on the buttstock but the finish is still perfect. The grip sections are checkered and it has a padded buttplate. The rifle also has a swivel, spring loaded bipod mounted on it, as well as a padded sling and a soft rifle case that will be included with the purchase. 

The rifle itself has been fired less than 100 times in about 12 months. It has been very very well taken care of however, given its limited use. While only firing it 3 different times, each time I fully cleaned the rifle and applied oil to the barrel and receiver before putting it in the safe. 

Also, I have over 150 rounds of 300 RUM that I am including with this rifle. These rounds include Nosler Custom, Federal Premium, HSM Trophy, Doubletap Barnes Tipped and Remington Premiere AccuTip Power Levels 1, 2 and 3. I am including these rounds at a significantly discounted price compared to their retail cost. No round is more than 3 months old. At least half of the rounds are match grade rounds with 4-5 different projectiles and weights to choose from. The other half are the Remington Premiere AccuTip rounds. Most of these are power level 1, which are loaded to match the ballistics of a 30-06. There are about 20 power level 2, which are loaded to match the ballistics of a .300 Winchester Magnum. There are also 20 power level 3 rounds which are fully loaded to .300 RUM specs.
