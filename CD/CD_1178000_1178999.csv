His Minimalist™ neck knife has proven to be very popular, so we are offering the new CRKT production version.
Here is a very small and lightweight knife which gives surprising comfort and control, thanks to the unusual geometry of the full-tang 2.0"" Wharncliffe blade, aided by three finger choils, hand-contoured green/black Micarta® scales, and a braided fob.
The Minimalist comes with a custom-fitted Zytel® sheath and neck paracord for inverted carry as a neck knife. Because the knife and sheath weigh only 1.6 ounces together, it is a personal carry you will barely notice.
Unlike many small neck knives, this handle is really functional for a wide variety of daily cutting tasks. The blade point gives excellent penetration, while the Razor-Sharp straight edge is perfect for scraping, woodworking and precision carving.
True to its name, this really is a minimal fixed blade, but it is also the most useful for its size that we have seen. And it's certainly a great value.

His Minimalist® neck knives have proven to be very popular, so we are now offering three CRKT production versions.
They are very small and lightweight knives which give surprising comfort and control, thanks to the unusual geometry of the full-tang blades, aided by three finger choils, friction grooves for the thumb, hand-contoured green-black Micarta® scales, and a braided fob. Unlike many small neck knives, this handle is really functional for a wide variety of daily cutting tasks.
Each Minimalist comes with a custom-fitted Zytel® sheath and neck paracord for inverted carry as a neck knife. The knife is held securely in place by a positive detent which locks the base of the blade in place for maximum safety. Because the knife and sheath weigh about two ounces together, it is a personal carry you will barely notice.
Minimalist® Bowie. We offer this deep-bellied clip-point Bowie style 2.125"" blade for those who desire a classic hunting knife blade shape. The Minimalist Bowie makes a great wilderness carry, and can be used for camp chores, cooking, and even skinning and dressing in a pinch. It is also an excellent survival knife.
True to their name, these really are minimal fixed blades, but they are also the most useful for their size that we have seen. And they are certainly a great value, which explains why the Minimalist family continues to grow.

TAPCO®  designed the SKS Detachable Magazines with serious shooters in mind. The mag body, made of high strength composite, has horizontal grooves cut into it for an enhanced gripping surface. We’ve used the highest quality interior components and incorporated a metal floor plate so you can expect maximum strength from this magazine. That, plus the fact that this mag is made in the U.S.A. so it counts for three compliance parts, you could say we’ve really thought of everything. Counts as 3 U.S. 922r Compliant Parts.

* Original Ruger case & paperwork
* 3 NEW Ruger 15-round mags
* 1 NEW Fobus paddle holster
* 135 Rounds of 115 grain FMJ ammo

This gun is a decocker model, no longer in production.  It is much preferred over the new safety/decocker models produced today.  IF you can find a new stainless P95 for sale today, you'll pay over $400 at a gun shop, plus check fees and tax - $450 out the door.  That gun will only have two mags, and they may be 10-rounders.  For $580 with me you'll get one more mag (and they are all Ruger 15-rounders at that), a fitted holster, and ammo.  And no safety to mess with on the gun.  Take a look at the on-line comments about the P95 - you'll see you can't wear them out and owners love them.

Face to face cash transaction only - $580.  I'm willing to drive a bit to meet, depending on where you are located.  I will not ship this gun!  If you are interested in the gun & mags only, I may be open to an offer.  Thanks for looking."

These are hard to find and are extremely accurate.  I had a 3x9 scope on it and it was lethal at 300 yards.  It has had very few rounds through it (less than 200) and looks and shoots like new.  It has a custom camo job on it.  I removed all of the camo except for the side of the stock that is away from you cheek if you are a right handed shooter.  I left it on there for additional concealment when I was calling coyotes.  The bull barrel cuts down on recoil and improves accuracy and it doesn't add much weight.  It is an awesome gun.  The sale also comes with 100 rounds of ammo.  Please contact me through this site or call me at three19-360-2286.  I am open to offers.

I'm not looking for something very nice however the firearm must be in good working order. I am not 100% firm on the price so if something nicer and reasonable comes along I can throw down extra. Also have some .223 ammo (on Monday will have 9mm .45and/or .22lr ammo too) I can throw in if you are in need of or looking for ammunition. I'm expecting over 1,500 9mm and about 1,000 .45 (mainly all Winchesters) in this week (hopefully .22lr also) that I can throw down with the cash or whatever's clever.

In regards to the current pricing, please reference for sale threads like this: http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=330942745....And I am not running a bid system.  So you can buy it now for my price or best reasonable offer.

And there are others similar in pricing....I just don't like GunBroker....seems to be a way to completely rob people blind with their bidding...HOWEVER, if it doesn't sell soon enough I will have to create an account and take it to GunBroker."

The trigger and other external parts are blued, not straw colored as I have found while doing research on Lugers. I don't  know if it came that way from the factory or not. If it has ever been re blued it was done before the 1940's because it has been in a drawer since then. I have fired a box of shells through it and it functions perfectly. Has some bluing wear on the edges and wear on the grips as expected. The rifling is nice and distinct. I've seen the 9mm pistols going anywhere from a thousand in junk condition to five thousand and up for very good condition. I'm looking to get somewhere in the middle. Make me an offer.

I would predict these will be one of the rarest of the current Talo collectibles in a couple years.  I really liked the concept of shooting the 45 ACP. Cost is half of what 45 long Colt is. I bought this because I enjoy single action and thought it would make a nice CCW. I did research for a CCW holster and found a nice one offered by Simply Rugged Holsters, www.simplyrugged.com
As it turns out, shortly after I bought this another one showed up in the blued version, if I would have known I would have waited to buy that one instead.  So now I must sell this one. Asking Price is $600.00.

I went ahead and bought the other Talo so I guess I will now consider trades for this one."
