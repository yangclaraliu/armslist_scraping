It is reported to have belonged to Frank Tenney Johnson, a famous Western artist active at the same time as Russell and Remington. The .41 Colt, the holster and gun belt, and the display case are all from the Ruger Collection. Also included, is a framed authenticated print of a 1936 Frank Tenney Johnson painting, ""On the Range"", which was added at a later date. The gun is in excellent mechanical condition and fine cosmetic condition. Case hardening remains on the hammer and frame and the original blue has thinned except on the barrel next to the frame. All serial numbers match, except the loading gate which, as is normal, has an assembly number, and the grips fit well, but are worn. The holster has a tear at the muzzle end, probably from being drawn repeatedly. There are some ""dings"" on the barrel just forward of the "".41 Colt"", and I have no idea what may have caused them. It is apparent that Tenney did not leave this weapon in a closet. This weapon would be an outstanding acquisition for a collector who can display it properly. I cannot, and hence, am selling it to someone who can showcase it as it deserves. The gun was manufactured in 1899 and an FFL is required for shipment. you can contact me via seccoalis@gmail.com, selling this to get some money, its worth more than 2850 , my loss is your gain"

I dont really have a cash price in mind as supply\demand economics isnt my strong point, but please dont waste my time offering a grand as this is one of only TWO AR's currently for sale on this site, and probably in all of NY.

Stag Arms is far superior to a Bushmaster and even Colt AR's in my opinion. I had a Colt in the service and they are known for one thing....jamming when you need them most. I put a hundred rounds thru the Stag in about 2 minutes without a hiccup.

Serious face to face buyers only. No ffl needed until the 16th of March....then the price of the Stag triples."

Fellow firearm enthusiast, please help clean up this site from price gougers. Start flagging the overpriced items. We should be sticking together and fighting the folks attacking our second amendment rights here in Colorado, not taking advantage of each other.

When you see these gougers, and they are apparent flag them. They are not trying to make a fair profit but are doubling or tripling the price, simply click on the flag option, click overprice, and hit ok.

This message will likely be flagged by them within minutes and will disappear, so please help out. Copy this message and repost yourself later today and various times during the week.

If we show a uniform voice, they will eventually keep their hoarded stashes or come down in price. I am all about capitalism – I am not about taking advantage of others in a situation outside their control. Did we all feel the gas stations in New York charging $12 to $20 a gallon after the hurricane was fair – NO, and neither is the gouging going on right now.

I am asking MUCH less than what these are going for right now.  Comes with everything you see in the pics below.

It's date code is BB (2011).

You opening this ad shows that you know the quality of HK firearms...they are simply the best fit and finish out of every single firearm item I own.

I do accept Discrete Paypal (+4% for their fees)  and I can also email more pics upon request...It is a beauty.

Asking price is $5,500 (this is a reduced price for a quicker sell but I am still open to REASONABLE offers to avoid having to post it on gunbroker....).  I can ship FFL to FFL as well.


In regards to the current pricing, please reference for sale threads like this: http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=330942745....And I am not running a bid system.  So you can buy it now for my price or best reasonable offer.

And there are others similar in pricing....I just don't like GunBroker....seems to be a way to completely rob people blind with their bidding...HOWEVER, if it doesn't sell soon enough I will have to create an account and take it to GunBroker."

436,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1180436,For Sale:  TO THE PRICE GOUGERS AND PEOPLE WHO MAY BE NEW TO SHOOTING,"NORTH CAROLINA, North Carolina, United States","$ 9,839,838,434","Listed On: Sunday, March 3, 2013",Rifles,Kel-Tec                                                                                ,7.62x39                                                                                ,no type,Rifle,"Dear price gougers, if you want to make 20 or 30% and take advantage of people who don't shoot much, go ahead.  Most of us who shoot every weekend, and have for most of our lives have been through this before, 2008, 1994, etc.  But trying to make a 100% on stuff just makes us mad.  This isn't drug dealing, you can still get this stuff.   Here is a small list for you people that may have not realized what prices were.
9mm blazer ammo should never be more than 13.00 a box
9mm american eagle should never be more than 15.00 a box
if you put 9mm on here for nearly $1 a round as I have seen, think about what you are doing.
Kel tec pistols are never more than $299 new.  They are on the shelves right now in the triad area,  don't email me and ask, go look.
7.62X39 ammo is all over right now for $8.95 a box, again  if you are putting this on here for $15 a box have fun.
You are forcing prices up unnecessarilly.  We don't mind if you make a little off of people who have jobs and don't have time to scavenge at wal mart like buzzards, but listing these riduculous prices for .22 ammo makes people think thats ok.  Again for those of you who don't know.... at the worst a box of 525 rounds of .22 LR ammo costs $23.99.  If you gougers want to sell it for $30 go ahead but to list that for $50 just looks stupid.  I might as well ask for a piece of land for a case of ammo.
I think the AR craze is almost over, but for those of you who don't know, prior to the events of the last few months, you could go to wal mart and buy a DPMS .308 AR rifle for $972 out the door,  You could buy one in .223 for about $800 out the door, and there were even ones with less features in the $675 area.  Most big time gun stores have AR rifles back in stock.  To the price gougers.... again, we don't mind if you make $100 on a rifle, but $300.  When this is all over, those of us who enjoy shooting every weekend will still be here, while you gougers are gone.  If you are among the shooters, keep flagging these idiots posts until they leave or at least come down to a price that's not an insult to our intelligence.   And one more thing, if you have time to sit at the Wal Marts before they open, would you please take 5 extra minutes and write or call your elected officials and ask them not to vote for any new gun control measures.  Thanks."

I bought this to try one method of tactical gear carry. It actually worked well, but I still decided to go another route. It’s in excellent (mint, really) condition, and is clean. 

Comfortable, and breathes in hot weather (yeah, you will still sweat, but you probably would anyway in hot conditions, even in just a t-shirt). You can attach a lot of pouches and other gear to this. Adjustable. I loosened the shoulder straps and was able to get a nice fit, even though this is a regular, and I’m definitely larger than that. 

This is a good deal at $60 if you are in the Raleigh area and can meet me to get it. If I have to ship it, I need to add $25 to cover packing and shipping through my local shipping guy (I’m going to let him pack and ship it, and he’ll add his usual surcharges). If shipped, it’s probably not as good a deal. Just sayin’…"

Payment by Cash or USPS (United States Postal Service) Money Order if shipped to you.

Why do I require a USPS Money Order for shipments?
When you pay by USPS (US Postal Service) Money Order and send payment by US Mail, the Post Office is a strong resource in case of any problems. Your USPS Money Order is registered to you (the purchaser). If it is lost, it can be replaced. It is payable only to the person to whom it is addressed and that person is required to show identification to cash it. If there is any fraud encountered (e.g. your purchased item(s) is not received by you after payment); Federal Mail Fraud procedures can be invoked against the seller. USPS Money Orders have a limit of $1000.00. If your purchase is more than $1000.00, multiple money orders need to be purchased. I recommend that you verify this at the US Post Office."

Here's the way this will work. I already have a standing offer of $315 (this $ amount will change as higher offers come in, if they come in:) for this can. This can will stay on arms list until Sunday afternoon or until someone wants to BUY IT NOW FOR $400, whichever comes first. You can make cash offers or handgun offers or a combo. If you have a handgun valued at more than what the ammo is worth to you I will throw cash in to buy/trade for your gun. I hope this is fun for all and no one gets mad for a unique approach to selling this extremely rare and highly sought for ammo :)

I will provide proof at any time that the offer that I post is legit if you request. No moogy foogy here!

I can probably take a cc on my new square if that's important to you (add 3% to cash discounted price)

Finally... If there are enough people that want less than 420 rounds at $1 a piece I will consider splitting the box.

Still in the plastic.

Nickel Boron Bolt Carrier Group. These BCGs sell for $400-500 alone on GunBroker. Nickel boron is popular because it doesn't require lubrication and is much easier to clean than a standard BCG.

Melonite coated inside and out to resist corrosion. You can shoot cheap Russian surplus all day and not worry about ruining your gun.

I originally bought this to shoot 5.45, because the ammo is still cheap and available for around $200/1000. You can easily spend double that on .223 lately. It's a good investment during this panic--if you shoot a couple cases you've already broken even on this upper.

If you win this auction, you'll also have the option to buy a 1080 round spam can of 5.45 for $225 plus actual Ground shipping. I would suggest using a tougher buffer and Wolff hammer spring as well, just because the 5.45 uppers function better that way.

Reels are complete with boxes and all paperwork as new. Rods have the original vinyl slip cases as new. For your protection and mine; payment by USPS (United States Postal Service) Money Order only.

You are probably asking yourself, ""Why is a guy in TN selling offshore tackle?"" Since moving to TN, I no longer have a use for this tackle. There's no offshore fishing in TN. I have other offshore tackle for sale as well: Aftco Stick Gaffs, Aftco Flying Gaffs, Aftco Tailer, Magma Bait Preparation Table and offshore lures, etc.

Why I require payment with a USPS Money Order:
When you pay by USPS (US Postal Service) Money Order and send payment by US Mail, the Post Office is a strong resource in case of any problems. Your USPS Money Order is registered to you (the purchaser). If it is lost, it can be replaced. It is payable only to the person to whom it is addressed and that person is required to show identification to cash it. If there is any fraud encountered (e.g. your purchased item(s) is not received by you after payment); Federal Mail Fraud procedures can be invoked against the seller. USPS Money Orders have a limit of $1000.00. If your purchase is more than $1000.00, multiple money orders need to be purchased. I recommend that you verify this at the US Post Office."

The gun is complete but has 2 known issues.  1. the little plastic tab that you push back to engage the barrel snapped off.  part number is 1077-007 but i don't know the cost of that part. 2. there is an issue with the co2 pressure getting fed in to the valve.  initially when a powerlet was pierced it would hiss and leak out all the pressure, now however no pressure is getting released to anywhere.  (maybe an o-ring fell deteriorated? dunno)

I am sure there are people who know how to fix such things, but I am not one of them.  I really liked the gun.  Its rated 625 fps and im not sure what it actually shoots with regular pellets but it seemed about right.  you can buy extra magazines at wally world fairly cheap.

Used very little and in excellent condition (no corrosion, etc.). $210.00 (including shipping). For your protection and mine; Payment by USPS (United States Postal Service) Money Order only.

Why I require payment with a USPS Money Order:
When you pay by USPS (US Postal Service) Money Order and send payment by US Mail, the Post Office is a strong resource in case of any problems. Your USPS Money Order is registered to you (the purchaser). If it is lost, it can be replaced. It is payable only to the person to whom it is addressed and that person is required to show identification to cash it. If there is any fraud encountered (e.g. your purchased item(s) is not received by you after payment); Federal Mail Fraud procedures can be invoked against the seller. USPS Money Orders have a limit of $1000.00. If your purchase is more than $1000.00, multiple money orders need to be purchased. I recommend that you verify this at the US Post Office."

The gaff is in excellent condition. $70.00 (including shipping). For your security and mine; Payment by USPS (United States Postal Office) Money Order only.

Why I require payment with a USPS Money Order:
When you pay by USPS (US Postal Service) Money Order and send payment by US Mail, the Post Office is a strong resource in case of any problems. Your USPS Money Order is registered to you (the purchaser). If it is lost, it can be replaced. It is payable only to the person to whom it is addressed and that person is required to show identification to cash it. If there is any fraud encountered (e.g. your purchased item(s) is not received by you after payment); Federal Mail Fraud procedures can be invoked against the seller. USPS Money Orders have a limit of $1000.00. If your purchase is more than $1000.00, multiple money orders need to be purchased. I recommend that you verify this at the US Post Office."

Why I require payment with a USPS Money Order:
When you pay by USPS (US Postal Service) Money Order and send payment by US Mail, the Post Office is a strong resource in case of any problems. Your USPS Money Order is registered to you (the purchaser). If it is lost, it can be replaced. It is payable only to the person to whom it is addressed and that person is required to show identification to cash it. If there is any fraud encountered (e.g. your purchased item(s) is not received by you after payment); Federal Mail Fraud procedures can be invoked against the seller. USPS Money Orders have a limit of $1000.00. If your purchase is more than $1000.00, multiple money orders need to be purchased. I recommend that you verify this at the US Post Office."

Very good condition. Recommend replacing plastic coated thin wire since plastic is worn. $55.00 (including shipping). For your security and mine; Payment by USPS (United States Postal Service) Money Order only.

Why I require payment with a USPS Money Order:
When you pay by USPS (US Postal Service) Money Order and send payment by US Mail, the Post Office is a strong resource in case of any problems. Your USPS Money Order is registered to you (the purchaser). If it is lost, it can be replaced. It is payable only to the person to whom it is addressed and that person is required to show identification to cash it. If there is any fraud encountered (e.g. your purchased item(s) is not received by you after payment); Federal Mail Fraud procedures can be invoked against the seller. USPS Money Orders have a limit of $1000.00. If your purchase is more than $1000.00, multiple money orders need to be purchased. I recommend that you verify this at the US Post Office."

Fellow firearm enthusiast, please help clean up this site from price gougers. Start flagging the overpriced items. We should be sticking together and fighting the folks attacking our second amendment rights here in Colorado, not taking advantage of each other.

When you see these gougers, and they are apparent flag them. They are not trying to make a fair profit but are doubling or tripling the price, simply click on the flag option, click overprice, and hit ok.

This message will likely be flagged by them within minutes and will disappear, so please help out. Copy this message and repost yourself later today and various times during the week.

If we show a uniform voice, they will eventually keep their hoarded stashes or come down in price. I am all about capitalism – I am not about taking advantage of others in a situation outside their control. Did we all feel the gas stations in New York charging $12 to $20 a gallon after the hurricane was fair – NO, and neither is the gouging going on right now.

Fellow firearm enthusiast, please help clean up this site from price gougers. Start flagging the overpriced items. We should be sticking together and fighting the folks attacking our second amendment rights here in Colorado, not taking advantage of each other.

When you see these gougers, and they are apparent flag them. They are not trying to make a fair profit but are doubling or tripling the price, simply click on the flag option, click overprice, and hit ok.

This message will likely be flagged by them within minutes and will disappear, so please help out. Copy this message and repost yourself later today and various times during the week.

If we show a uniform voice, they will eventually keep their hoarded stashes or come down in price. I am all about capitalism – I am not about taking advantage of others in a situation outside their control. Did we all feel the gas stations in New York charging $12 to $20 a gallon after the hurricane was fair – NO, and neither is the gouging going on right now.

This is one of the best lower parts kits with stock kit circulating today. I've checked each part of it, down to the detent pins and springs, to make sure it's perfect and complete. In addition, the stock has a nice Palmetto logo on it, making it the cleanest looking M4 stock. For reference, a stripped lower with this exact same lower build kit is in the top left corner of the photos of the kit. (CT Residents must pin the collapsible stock if installing on a non pre ban lower). All the pieces went in beautifully and smoothly and the lower functions perfectly. Any questions at all feel free to email me."

I don't have much cash at the moment but I've got two partial quads that I figured id see if anyone had an interest, I've got a 2001 400ex rolling chassis. Then I've also got a 2001 Mojave 250 that needs an exhaust cam, rocker arm, and tensioner ($300).  I've got them both listed on craigslist, and would value them for trade, lower than selling point, the 400ex probably $400 and the Mojave perhaps about $600.  Those numbers are just an idea, if you've got any interest, please let me know, email text or call

Thanks

P.s. I can verify identity, give license id, or anything else perhaps, I just do not have my cow at the moment

I have gold jewelry that I am also willing to trade for either or both. The gram weight is worth around $400.00 ... that is just shear gold weight . Some of these are diamond rings with retail value close to $1000.00 .... I think if you have a way to sell jewelry, you could easily fetch in between $1500 to $3000 for the jewelry. Willing to trade it out for a fraction of that.
