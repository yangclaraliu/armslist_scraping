This rifle has about 100 rounds through it, and no scratches or imperfections. It has been thoroughly cleaned after each use and i will throw in a Bore-Snake cleaner in .308. 

The 770 in general has had a reputation for a sticky bolt, but after I bought it I got a new bolt from Remington and after working it in it feels as smooth as a 700. The bolt on this rifle slides with ease and operates better than a brand new 770 rifle. This rifle also has about 8 months factory warranty and i can include the original receipt for that warranty. I am selling because I am building a custom AR15, and it has proven to be a lot more costly than expected.

Ingram M10A1 9mm (.45 ACP)
Military Armament Corporation
Stephenville, TX. USA
Serial # A604887

It was sold to me by former NRA president Sandra Froman (whom I met at Gunsite) and had previously belonged to her late husband, Bruce Nelson (famed leather/holster maker...designer of the ""summer special"" IWB).

It had never been fired when I received it.
I have fired less than 1000 rounds combined through the 3 barrels.
It originally came with a 4.5"" barrel and top mounted cocking lever. 
It used single feed Zytel (or steel) magazines.
It is only set up for 9mm but .45 ACP uppers are readily available.

I purchased a double feed bolt so that I could use Walther MP or older Cobray mags.
Also, since I am an old guy, I wanted optics on my Mac and purchased 2 uppers with side-cocking levers...it just went on from there.

I purchased an Uzi 9mm and have decided to part with my trusty Mac-10.

Here is a breakdown of prices for all the included accessories.

AWC 9mm suppressor $800
AWC Nomex cover $45

Everything set!","Central Jersey, New Jersey, United States","$ 5,000","Listed On: Tuesday, April 23, 2013",Rifles,Zastava                                                                                ,7.62x39                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a preppers dream package!  Start with a brand new, unfired Zastava PAP (PAP is a Serbian acronym , the letters P, A, P, stand for the Serbian way for acronymizing Semi Automatic Rifle) ... an AK-actioned rifle from the world famous Zastava Arms factory in Serbia.  This is one of the finest AK rifles ON THE PLANET.  It is made with a 50% thicker receiver than a standard AK and also a top quality barrel; therefore, it is non-chrome-lined, because the Serbians have found their best way to retain all the accuracy of the rifle, and by eliminating the chrome lining it maximizes the rifle without reducing life or resistance to any noticeable degree.  It comes with a picatinny rail on the dust cover, which is holding a brand new NcStar red dot/ red laser combination.  This beauty red dot sight with unlimited eye relief and huge field of view allows you to choose the red dot only, the red laser only, or both at the same time!

Then we add in 1500 rounds of Herter's 7.62x39mm FMJ Ammo!  This is some of the finest 7.62x39mm, with Berdan primers, its totally non-corrosive, and FMJ which is the best ammo for an AK pattern rifle to retain accuracy and reliability with perfect magazine feed and function.  - IN ADDITION, I have 4 boxes of Hornady SST Steel Match 7.62x39mm  , 50 rds per box - THIS IS THE FINEST AMMO FOR AN AK YOU CAN FIND ON THE PLANET, Hornady is probably the best ammo mfg. there is bar none.  This was EXTREMELY expensive.
Speaking of magazines, that was one of the topics that kept PAPs being discussed online.  Because this rifle is a Single Stack AK-variant with a single-stack 10-round magazine (When you add the 10rd-single-stack magazine, with the extremely comfortable and ergonomic thumbhole stock and crowned muzzle, this rifle is NJ legal from the factory, right out of the box [NJ having one of if not the most specific and difficult set of compliance laws]), people were not finding the magazines for this rifle.  Then when the importer decided to list some on its website, they were $50 a piece, going for $75 AND UP on popular websites.  After the December events I saw these for $120 on some websites.  WELL, I have *TEN* BRAND NEW FACTORY 10rd magazines to include IN ADDITION TO THE factory magazine that came in the box.  *AND* Included is 1 milsurp metal 10 round magazine I happened to have found a while back.   THIS ALONE makes it a GREAT Survival implement as this rifle was being called the best AK rifle for the money a year or two back, but was not getting hyped because of the lack of available magazines.  

This is probably the best package a Survivalist, Prepper, SHTF-planner or simply someone into firearms / collecting/ planning would want.  I mean its everything, a brand new highest quality Zastava PAP Serbian AK, brand new red dot /laser sight, 12 magazines, 1500+ rounds of Herter's 7.62x39mm FMJ, 4*50rds Hornady SST, and a hard plastic rifle case.

The war is over for me. I’m selling all my 223 ammo and my Mini-14 Stainless with two 20 round clips, two 10 round clips, three 5 round clips, stainless scope rings and stainless flash suppressor.

There is no lack of supply of 223 ammo. It is being produced and imported like always.  It is the spike in panic hoarding which is causing demand to exceed the supply. One fellow posted online that he just ordered 10,000 rounds. Another guy posted that he’s purchased 45,000 rounds. They might have a real need for it, but how many of us need that much?

The limit of 5 boxes of 20 will give someone enough to keep the dogs at bay until the panic buying calms down. Cost is $33 per box of 20. If you think things will return to normal, then the price is way too much.  If you think ammo will be unavailable within the next 4 years, then the price is cheap. After I sell all my 223 ammo, I’ll sell my Mini-14 Stainless with the extras for $1400, through an FFL only.

Copy of driver’s license is required to purchase ammo. Address on license must match shipping address.  I’ll post the actual shipping cost when I figure it out.  Probably about $15 to ship 5 boxes of ammo.

The 223 ammo is boxer primed, non-corrosive, Norinco brand, with a reloadable brass case.  I’ve been shooting it for years. It is good, reliable ammo. Like the Mini-14, it is more accurate than I am.

Good luck."

This is a nice handgun. I bought it last year shortly after they were first announced back in September with all the intentions to keep it forever, but have now decided to sell. The handgun retails for about $850.00 (this is the two tone one, the all black one is $100 less) The handgun comes with 10 total high cap mags. These mags sell for about $60.00 each at Specialty Sports. (that is IF!!! you can actually find them). Anyway I'm asking $1,200 for everything. That puts the prices @ $850 for the gun (3 mags in box), and $50.00 pr individual packaged mag(7). This deal is actually cheaper than retail if you think about it (NO TAX). If you want to buy the mags only and not the gun then I'll sell the mags separately at $65.00 each or $60 for all 7.

Professional Grade Weaponry,  by BCM®

Cold Hammer Forged Barrels
This process of manufacturing barrels has been used for European small arms for generations, and it is gaining popularity in the United States because of the increased barrel life and outstanding accuracy of a hammer forged barrel. The BCM BFH™ series of barrels are made right here in the USA!  (Just like all the BCM products.)

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.

T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.

Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E)
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.

5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.

Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking."

Been sitting in climate controlled gun safe ever since (after it was cleaned). Took it out last month and put another 30 rounds through it (cleaned it again) and she functions perfectly.  I have never seen a better example of a AK-47. This is one that has been built by vector arms of Utah. I was told they make their own receiver out the the best materials and then build it up using other choice parts. This isn't your run of the mill had a million rounds through it AK. This things just feels like quality. Includes 2 quality steel 30 round mags and owners manual. Shoots like a dream and I could not find a scratch on it except the normal wear where the safety engages which is normal. This has the desirable flip down stock which clears the 30 round mag just fine. Paid big big bucks for this thing new and had to be on a waiting list to get one and just never shot it. Asking $800 cash no trades. Seen the exact same one sell for big box on gunbroker just a couple of months ago for big bucks. Now you can buy one locally. I think you would be hard pressed to find a better example of a AK I really do. Cash face to face sales in Pocatello only.

Faster the a stihl 261 I use at work. Has a 16 inch bar that is normal Husky quality laminate, so it looks ugly but it is perfectly straight. Just a great running saw. Keep in mind this is a PRO grade saw. Not the junk you get a Tractor Supply or Home Depot. If taken care of it will last ten seasons of normal fire wood cutting. I am extremely careful with fuel mixtures, and normally run premium to keep the pistons cooler and prevent vapor lock in the hot summer. From dead cold will normal fire at the 4th or 5th pull. Chain-brake snaps with authority, and clutch has no slip. Pull cord is perfect. Primer bulb is perfect. I am a arborist and take very good care of my saws and know them well.

Original add stated ""Less than 50 rounds shot with this."" I have more high-res pictures if desired. 

The price is $500 FTF or shipped and insured to your FFL in CONUS. If your FFL requires shipping from another FFL, please add $30 to the price. Please know the firearms laws of your state and county. I will not ship where illegal. I am just trying to recoup most of what I paid for the lower.

I accept cash or major cc FTF in the greater Houston area (must show ID and sign bill of sale). E-check accepted as well by sending the purchaser a secure link in an email, major cc over the phone, or USPS money order. Lower will likely ship within 24 hours after funds clear in my bank."

I am looking to purchase my first semiautomatic rifle. I would prefer a nice SKS either wood or flat black, not too picky. I currently have a mosin nagant and a few other oldies all bolt action and looking for something different for the range. 

I made the mistake of trying to get everything that uses 9mm so keep one type of ammo. now 9mm is impossible to find and I cannot really go to the range with my friends and family. 

I am up for other suggestions as I do not know much about the thousands available but I would prefer a 10mm / 7.62x39 as the ammo is readily available. 

I will also pay reasonable for beat up items, very well for mint, and even buy your extra ammo for as close to retail as you can get. 

I am not a convicted felon, I have NO restrictions on owning firearms, and am looking for something for the range that either has a bunch of ammo with it or is readily available. I don't really need another like my 9mm's that are just sitting in my safe and never being used. 

Thanks again!

I just bought a 2013 Chevy Silverado and had a lift kit and new wheels & tires installed.  The stock wheels & tires are now sitting in my garage collecting dust, so this is your oppertunity to get a great deal and not pay retail price!!!   The wheels & tires are stock Chevy 18"" 5 Spoke Machined Silver w/ Goodyear Wrangler P265/65R18 112T.  This package is brand new with only 18 miles on them!!!!  If you bought these from the dealership they would cost you approx. $2,100.  You might be able to find them online for around $1,700.  Will fit any 2007 - Present: Avalanche, Tahoe, Silverado, Sierra, Suburban.    I have all center caps and lugnuts as well.  
I'm asking $1,250 or OBO....
