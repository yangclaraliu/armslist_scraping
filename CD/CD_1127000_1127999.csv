I had to have it. I was toting around my Russian made SKS 7.62x39mm which got a lot of attention. At the time I did not want to sell it. This gun is milled so it is extremely accurate at 100-150 yards. Its curtains for any animal on all fours with this hell fire round. Gun bore is shiny as any BRAND new barrel. It's been well taken care of. No pitting or any rust for that matter. All serial numbers match from butt stock to barrel. Dealer offered me 750.00 at the gun show. Like I said I wasn't ready to sell earlier. Not until I took the hit when I checked my balance. Don't get me wrong I am not hurting but got to explain Momma where the money went if I don't sell my ever so reliable and extremely clean SKS all Russian. Not a Chinese piece of junk. Sorry Norinko fans. I will let this gun go for 750.00 firm. Pretty soon this wont be available, not for this price. At the gun show they were selling ones in worse shape for 1200.00. That is highway robbery if you ask me.  Anyway I think in todays environment with prices for these gun just going up. 750.00 is an honest and fair price for this all russian made beauty. Made by Tula in Russia. It is so cool cause it's got russian writing all over it. Adds flavor to an awesome rifle. Gives you some wiggle room to add new furniture if you want. If I were you I would keep it just the way it is. Eats rounds flawlessly. Gonna protect in times of need. I would choose this rather than a Wasr 10/63 anyday. Plus for a lot less too. Hit me up if your interested. Setup for the quick sale. Must have valid ID and not be a felon. First 750.00 gets it. Oh it has all the original cleaning kits with original bayonet with original military green strap. Barrel is hammer forged and chrome so this will eat any ammo corrosive or non corrosive. Photos enclosed. Thanks for looking."

It has the original Willy's stamp on the firewall under the hood. This jeep is in excellent condition, mechanically sound, runs and drives GREAT!! Absolutely nothing wrong with this jeep mechanically or cosmetically. I did a mechanical overhaul on this jeep so it has all of the new regular stuff it would need, brakes, brake lines, fuel lines, spark plugs, wires, distributor cap, alternator, solenoid, ect, ect. 4 wheel drive (must lock front wheels to engage 4 wheel drive), 3 speed, low and high gears, transfer case, can NOT get stuck in this thing!! It has the military tires so that the enemy can NOT tell which way you are going if they try to follow your tracks, wheels are left hand threads. The front windshield folds down. Jeep is is equipped with an ammo can as a glove box, cb radio with speaker, military police siren, blackout light. I have many miscellaneous extra parts to go with it. It has a gas can mount on the side and I have extra gas cans to go with it.

I can not guarantee that this jeep was in the Korean War but it was built at the end of the war, also the military cut it in half for shipping purposes and welded it back together. I also have roll bar, canvas top and doors for it (not shown in pictures). I did this jeep as a U.S. Army military police scenario, it is lots and lots of fun. I am in not hurry at all to sell it and am more interested in someone taking good care of this jeep as I have. If you are trying to make a profit off of me and this jeep than please don't waste my time. I want somebody to appreciate it as much as I have. When I got insurance on this jeep, they told me it was worth $8,000 in it's worst condition and $16,600 in it's best condition. I would guess that it falls somewhere in the middle but I have it insured for $8,000. Like I said, I am in no hurry at all to sell it so if you are interested please make me an offer. I am willing to do a cash sale or a trade and cash sale or just a straight trade if the price is right. E-mail me your offers, you never know you just might have something I can't live without"

It's a Russian made 1.5mm RPK receiver with an integrated front sight/gas block and a heavy 16"" barrel. The barrel is cold hammer forged, and is chrome lined, along with the gas tube and piston. The muzzle is threaded for the standard AK 14x1mm LH muzzle devices. It has a TAPCO bird cage installed that nearly eliminates flash (I've shot it in the dark, and wow!). I used an ACE receiver block and Pig Nose adapter to install an AR stock and Hogue grip. It comes with one 10 round magazine, and one 5 round magazine. I've only shot a few hundred rounds through this rifle, and it's in pretty decent condition.

This is by far the smoothest AK platform rifle I've ever handled. The trigger has a little creep and a very clean break. It's comparable to some of the nicer AR two stage triggers. Some guys claim to be getting 1.5"" groups at 100 yards with a scope.

Info from net:
SRC - Its M4A4 flat-top upper and picatinny rail gas block make it optics ready. The 16” heavy-profile, chrome-lined barrel with A2 flash suppressor is built to withstand high rates of fire and maintain accuracy. Six-position telescoping buttstock fits nearly any shooter. A new fit and finish design provides tighter tolerances for a solid feel, greater confidence and increased accuracy. For custom performance, a proprietary machining process provides a crisper and smoother trigger than other rifles. Aluminum trigger guard withstands rugged use. Hardcoat black-anodized finish is corrosion-resistant. M4 double-heat shield handguard protects your hands from excessive heat generated while shooting. Comes with one 30-round magazine, hard plastic case and black web sling. 

MPC - Same custom performance features as the SRC with the exceptions of a flat-top receiver, Diamondhead flip-up rear sight with dual-apertures and fixed-front sight."

I've had it since I was young and it has served me very well - it cycles very smooth and I can honestly say I've never had it jam on me. I took perfect care of, and cleaned it thoroughly after every use (I even take the trigger out after each use and clean the residue accumulation, I'm kind of obsessed with my guns).

The reason I'm selling it is because I just bought a Browning Citori and need the cash. The only downside to this gun is the slight wear on the bluing of the gun, which truly isn't that bad (you can take a look for yourself in the pictures). This is a very solid gun and I've had no problems with it for the 9 years I've owned it.

I will also throw in 3 chokes (mod, IC, Skeet).

I'm looking for an offer fairly close to the number I posted. This gun is easily worth more, but like I said, I want to sell it as soon as I can so I can buy a case for my Citori. I am willing to meet up in the Greater Seattle area or a little further if needed. Also, email me if you would like more pictures.

Thanks!"

 The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of Sig's popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm. The SP2022 – the only polymer framed pistol engineered to perform, built to protect and good enough to be called a SIG SAUER.

Bought this .32 as a conceal carry, but decided to go a different way. I bought it new and has never been fired since purchase. Comes with manual, lock, plastic case and extra clip. It also includes a Hogue hardwood grip set (shown on the gun in the photos) made from Pau Ferro wood. These grips give it a ""beefier"" feel. The original grips are there, pictured in the Hogue packaging. Priced right at $580, considering what they are going for on GunBroker without the extra grips (plus shipping/transfer fees) and the fact that these pistols are getting harder to find. For an additional $20, I will include 50 rounds of .32 auto ammunition. Indiana residents only, meet locally and will not ship. Buyer must be of legal age with Indiana driver's license and agree to sign bill of sale. Contact through Armslist or text 812four55two38five. Thanks!"

I NEED TO SELL THIS ONE SO I CAN FINANCE MY NEWEST PROJECT.
This pistol is in like new condition. Some minor slide wear, but besides that it is as new as the day it was purchased. Approximately 1 box of ammo has been fired through the pistol in the two times I have taken it to the range. Just after Christmas I shipped it to Sig Sauer in NH and they replaced the trigger with a short reset trigger and the original grips have been replaced with Sig Ergo grips (the old grips are included). They also cleaned and inspected the pistol thoroughly, and it has not been taken to the range or fired since it was returned. These additions with shipping are around $250 alone. The pistol comes with the original box, gun lock, two 12 round magazines, the parts that were returned by Sig after the work was completed, and all of the original paperwork.
I am willing to sell the pistol, but I would like to trade for an AR that is in the $1200-$1500 range. As much as I would love a $4000 rifle, I am just looking for something plain. $800 cash OBO or $950 trade value.

The subject of this review is my own Bushmaster XM-15-E2S that was made in Windham, (I got mine!). It is an A3 model with an A2 style fixed buttstock, handle sight, inch heavy barrel with 1 turn in 9 inch twist rifling, bayonet lug, birdcage flash suppressor  16 inch and it came with a 30 round magazine.
This Bushmaster rifle is chambered for .223 Remington and 5.56mm NATO rounds and is marked as such, so both may be safely used. I don't recommend that these rounds be used interchangeably in any firearm that is not specifically marked for both. There are many that believe that the .223 Remington and the 5.56mm NATO round are the same but in fact they are not. According to Small Arms Manufacturers Institute, Inc, (SAAMI), it is unsafe to fire 5.56mm NATO rounds in firearms chambered for .223 Remington. If you do a little Google searching around the Internet you can find the technical information related to that subject if it interests you. Be careful and only use the ammunition your firearm is designed to fire safely. new in box trade value 1600 REDACTED  16inch"
