After having a couple kids and moving across the country I find that I don't have time to shoot anymore.  This firearm accepts .223/5.56 NATO ammunition and was broken in correctly with cleaning after every 5 shots for the first 100 rounds.  I have not shot the firearm much, as the only owner I've put fewer than 500 rounds through this great Prarie Dog killer.  With handloads I've achieved .75 MOA 3 rounds and 1"" for 5 rounds.  Though it is a flat-top receiver I will include a raised mount and scope rings.  I also have a 4X Simmons scope that I can throw in if you should desire it. The grip was replaced with a larger grip which can be seen in the pictures.  I will also include a 30 rd magazine and the original case and grip (if desired).

Powerful and highly accurate! If you have ever fired one, you know. Cosmetic damage to finish on stock. See pics

When RWS first introduced the Model 48, we expected it to become a classic. What was unexpected was its rapid rise to classic status among knowledgeable air gunners. At 900fps in .22, this rifle propels pellets at .22 rim-fire velocities! This tremendous power is generated by the use of a very robust spring piston power plant cocked by a side lever action. The action is mounted into an extended beech stock to reduce felt recoil and to aid in achieving accuracy potential. Not designed for the faint hearted, this is one impressive air arm, both in performance and presence. It fulfills its purpose as a potent, full-size sporting airgun suitable for either pest control or field target shooting, yet it does so with both balance and grace. The substantial one-piece stock allows for comfortable offhand shooting and adds to the overall sensation that the Model 48 is a force to be reckoned with. The rifle is fitted with a finely rifled, fixed barrel system loaded via sliding breech opening. Its full accuracy potential can be realized by the use of a quality RWS airgun scope mounted to the scope rail. Other standard features include an adjustable trigger, an adjustable rear sight, and an automatic safety."

I believe that the ""version 21"" saiga .308 is the least common of the saiga .308's that have been imported into the U.S and here are the features that set it apart from the other saiga 308's:  It has a 21.5"" barrel, nice wood furniture with thumbhole stock, and the trigger/fcg comes in the proper ak location right out of the box so no need to ""convert"" it like all the other saigas.  You dont see these ones too often.

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail."

$800 cash you can take it home today, trade value is going to be a little higher. This is a ""working"" gun, you'll find a couple scratches and dings on receiver so if you're one of those guys who handles his guns with kids gloves you won't be interested.

Benelli 121 M1.
Imported into the U.S. by H&K early to mid eighties (Has h&k import stamp) 1 of 5000 brought into the country and snatched up strictly for law enforcement / military use. This is the grand pappy of Benelli shotguns and arguably the fastest cycling shottie Benelli has ever produced. With this being a retired police gun don't expect a museum quality collectors piece but this stout workhorse is in nice shape and runs like a machine when you get her going. A PURE combat shotgun. Cycles fast, cycles smooth, hits hard, well balanced and very stable on target.

From the manufacturer...

The Tactical Entry II™ has the performance enhancing
features demanded by law enforcement and military professionals plus the power of the great .45 ACP cartridge. Rounded and blended edges will not snag on clothing or holsters, 30 lines-perinch checkering on front strap and under the trigger guard promote a positive grip and Meprolight® three dot (green) night sights guarantee a positive aiming point regardless of light conditions. The
premium KimPro II® fi nish on the frame is both selflubricating and extremely resistant to moisture and salt, an important advantage for a pistol that might be used in a harsh environment and not cleaned regularly. Like all Kimber pistols, the slide and frame are mated early in production and travel through the factory together, ensuring the very best fi t of every part. No pistol design has ever matched the 1911 for dependability, accuracy and natural pointability in a tactical environment—and no other production 1911 brand has ever matched Kimber quality."

What would happen if you had to use your firearm?  In any self-defense situation, your primary responsibility is to survive and protect those who are in your care. You may face one or multiple threats.  Assuming that you have used good judgment and successfully ended the threat, you are now faced with the aftermath of your actions.

There may be one or more dead bodies or those who need medical attention.  As a responsible police officer and a law-abiding citizen, your first phone call should be to 911.  You should report the incident and request that police and a medical crew come to the scene.  However, once you have done your civic duty to notify police and bring medical attention to the injured, you then have a responsibility to yourself and your family to make sure you are protected against the legal forces that may be brought against you.  So your second phone call should be to Second Call Defense.

The number you call will be our 24-hour Emergency Legal Hotline.  This line is manned day and night and available exclusively for those who have been involved in a self-defense shooting.  A real person will answer immediately.  Tell us what happened and we will give you simple instructions for what to do next.

What would happen if you had to use your firearm?  In any self-defense situation, your primary responsibility is to survive and protect those who are in your care. You may face one or multiple threats.  Assuming that you have used good judgment and successfully ended the threat, you are now faced with the aftermath of your actions.

There may be one or more dead bodies or those who need medical attention.  As a responsible police officer and a law-abiding citizen, your first phone call should be to 911.  You should report the incident and request that police and a medical crew come to the scene.  However, once you have done your civic duty to notify police and bring medical attention to the injured, you then have a responsibility to yourself and your family to make sure you are protected against the legal forces that may be brought against you.  So your second phone call should be to Second Call Defense.

The number you call will be our 24-hour Emergency Legal Hotline.  This line is manned day and night and available exclusively for those who have been involved in a self-defense shooting.  A real person will answer immediately.  Tell us what happened and we will give you simple instructions for what to do next.

If you're so upset that you are unable to follow our directions, you can hand the phone to responding police and we will intermediate for you on-the-spot to make sure your legal rights are protected.  If necessary, we will provide you with a referral list of highly rated attorneys in your area within 24 hours to provide legal consultation and help protect your rights.

You do not have to be the victim!  You can protect yourself by becoming a member of the Second Call Defense http://secondcalldefenserecruiter20115.com.  Your membership entitles you to a comprehensive set of emergency resources and protection:

If you carry a concealed gun you must have thought about it?  What would happen if you had to use your firearm?  In any self-defense situation, your primary responsibility is to survive and protect those who are in your care. You may face one or multiple threats.  Assuming that you have used good judgment and successfully ended the threat, you are now faced with the aftermath of your actions.

There may be one or more dead bodies or those who need medical attention.  As a responsible police officer and a law-abiding citizen, your first phone call should be to 911.  You should report the incident and request that police and a medical crew come to the scene.  However, once you have done your civic duty to notify police and bring medical attention to the injured, you then have a responsibility to yourself and your family to make sure you are protected against the legal forces that may be brought against you.  So your second phone call should be to Second Call Defense.

The number you call will be our 24-hour Emergency Legal Hotline.  This line is manned day and night and available exclusively for those who have been involved in a self-defense shooting.  A real person will answer immediately.  Tell us what happened and we will give you simple instructions for what to do next.

If you're so upset that you are unable to follow our directions, you can hand the phone to responding police and we will intermediate for you on-the-spot to make sure your legal rights are protected.  If necessary, we will provide you with a referral list of highly rated attorneys in your area within 24 hours to provide legal consultation and help protect your rights.

However, once you have done your civic duty to notify police and bring medical attention to the injured, you then have a responsibility to yourself and your family to make sure you are protected against the legal forces that may be brought against you.  So your second phone call should be to Second Call Defense.
