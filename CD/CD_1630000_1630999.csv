Springfield XDM 4.5"" Standard
4.5"" XDM 45ACP W/ Black Finish

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster.

XDM Features
XDM DESIGN

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.


(M)odel Contour Frame

The ideal grip angle of the XD has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.

(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations

Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.




(M)ega-Lock Texture

The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function.

The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.




XDM TECHNOLOGY

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.


(M)elonite

Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 

The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M)is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.

(M)atch Grade Barrel

Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry




(M)inimal Reset Trigger

The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.



XDM INNOVATIONS

The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD is now captured in the all new XD(M) line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M) series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.


(M)inimal Error Disassembly

Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster.

(M)aximum Reach Mag Release

The modified contour of the new XD(M)grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.




(M)ega Capacity Magazine

The new XD(M) Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR Mag 
X-Tension (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the 
.40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.



XDM PERSONALIZATION

Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M), you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.


(M)ould-Tru Backstraps

With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.

(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System

A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position. 




(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case

Your total XD(M) experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M) it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M) pistols.

(M)agazine X-Tensions

With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions, SPRINGFIELD ARMORYhas added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)



XDM STANDARDS

In 2001, Springfield Armory set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. With the introduction of the XD polymer pistol, they did just that….


Loaded Chamber Indicator

The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.

Striker Status Indicator

The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position. 




USA Trigger System

The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.

Grip Safety

Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol."

The SPS™ Tactical version adds features to deliver even more incredible tack-driving, game-dropping accuracy. Its X-Mark Pro® trigger is externally adjustable so you can customize the trigger pull. A SuperCell™ recoil pad minimizes kick for fast follow-up shots. The 20"" heavy-contour barrel teams with dual-point pillar bedding to enhance accuracy. The ergonomic black synthetic stock has Hogue® overmoldings for a sure grip in any weather, and a semi-beavertail forend aids stable shooting off a rest."

I will ship the rifle anywhere in the country (to an FFL or C&R) but I prefer a face to face sale in Arkansas. I will do a bill of sale requiring DLN and date of birth of Arkansas residents. I will also accept a Concealed Weapons License number on the bill of sale which would eliminate a DLN and Date of Birth. Thank you!

As reliable and accurate as every Ruger 10/22, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown makes it even easier to keep America’s favorite rimfire rifle by your side. The barrel and forend of the Ruger 10/22 Takedown are easily separated from the action and buttstock by pushing a recessed lever, twisting the halves, and pulling them apart. Reassembly is the reverse of takedown, and is quick and easy. The friction fit lockup of the assembly joint is simple to adjust, but will rarely need re-adjustment after the first assembly. Despite the ease of assembly and reassembly, the lockup is secure and repeatable, ensuring an accurate return to zero – even when receiver mounted optics are used. The Ruger 10/22 Takedown is shipped in a ballistic nylon backpack-style case that features internal sleeves that hold the separated rifle halves, and external pockets with MOLLE webbing that provide storage for magazines, ammunition, and other accessories. Multiple attachments points for the padded, single-shoulder strap offer different carrying options. The 4.67 pound Ruger 10/22 Takedown is 37” long when assembled; each half is less than 20-1/4” when disassembled. Utilizing the standard 10/22 action, and provided with one ten-round rotary magazine, the Ruger 10/22 Takedown offers legendary 10/22 reliability in a new compact and portable package.

This handgun features a grip safety similar to the 1911, and is known for being a very safe as well as practical firearm. Instead of having the grip safety at the palm of your hands it is at your finger tips which in my opinion is an awesome feature.

This model has been used by police and military forces all over the world, the gun in specific has issue branding of the Military Police of the Bundeswehr, both on the lower and upper of the gun.

I need the money to pay a bill this weekend so if this doesn't sell by Friday evening it is going to Gander Mountain.  Take advantage of this deal, it is easily the best deal on a defense shotgun you will find.

Items Included:

1) 18.5"" Barrel NEF Pardner Shotgun (Remington 870 Clone) - This was test fired and has only 10 shells through it.  Very good action and shoots very well.  Some like these better then the Remington version which costs 3 times as much.

2) Lots of 00 Buckshot.  Top shelf stuff, take a look at the photo.  There is a lot of Federal flight control, military grade, and Remington shells.  75 shells total.  All are 2 3/4"" 00 buck.

3) Very nice soft case with external pocket.  Inside is very nicely lined.

4) Shotgun sling with quick detach swivels.

5) 5 Shotshell holder mounted to right side of stock.

6) Fiber optic front sight.

ONLY Face to Face and Cash.  I will need to see proper ID and a bill of sale will need to be signed by both parties.  I will provide ID as well along with a CCW license if requested.  Absolutely no felons.  This will sell fast at this price (there is $100 in shotshells alone) so please call me right away to arrange the sale.  You can call tonight until 10:30 pm or anytime tomorrow starting at 7:00 am.  I will be working in Broofield tomorrow and can meet in the area around noon.

At the end of the 1982 Israel-Lebanon War arose an understanding that the modern battlefield had changed. One of the conclusions from the war, particularly relevant to the small arms industry, was that the battle had moved from open field conflicts to close-quarters engagements – and there was a need for a seamless transition from daylight to nighttime capability on a single mission. Out of this understanding, and after more than a decade of collaboration and testing with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) - the TAVOR® rifle was born. Just as race car technology trickles down to consumer automobiles, so do these time and battle-tested firearms now become a modern sporting rifle platform for civilian gun enthusiasts. The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR® is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines – but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines.

This is a brand new Heritage Rough Rider RR22MB6 Single Action 22LR / 22 Mag Combination Revolver, Blue Finish, With Wood Grips. 

BRAND: Heritage Arms

Model: RR22MB6 

Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.

The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.

Interested in Blue/Wood 20 inch barrel with iron sights only.  This cartridge has essentially been orphaned by Ruger, no other manufacture chambers a rifle for it or ever has chambered a rifle for it.  There is one factory round available (185gr GMX) and NO BRASS available anywhere on this planet for this rifle.  If you know otherwise let me know.

If you have a collector, the first one made, the last one made, the only one made or need a pile of money for your rare and highly desirable rifle don't email me.  I don't want a high dollar rifle.  

If you want to make space in your safe for a rifle you can actually shoot then give me a holler.  These were going for $400 at CDNN when Ruger dumped them from the line up.   Any reasonable offer considered."

SIG SAUER P250 40SW

The SIG SAUER P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Whether you are buying your first AR rifle, or need an affordable yet accurate plinking gun, the Panther Oracle is for you.

Altogether, it weighs in at only 6.6 lbs. The flat top A3 upper allows the shooter to mount the optic of their choice on the Picatinny Rail. The 16"" barrel, although light, provides plenty of velocity for most sporting and tactical applications. The Pardus stock makes this carbine comfortable for any shooter.

Enjoy all the features and benefits of the popular Springfield XDM™ in a smaller version that’s great for concealed carry and home defense. 16+1 capacity in .40 S&W, impressive for a carry gun. The dovetail front and rear three-dot sight system acquires targets quickly. The rugged polymer frame is mated to a strong forged steel slide with ultratough Melonite® finish. A 3.8"" steel match-grade barrel and fully supported ramp ensure accuracy and reliable feeding. Interchangeable backstraps customize the fit to your hand. A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. The minimal reset trigger allows for faster follow-up shots by not requiring the trigger to travel to a full-forward position before the gun is ready for the next shot.
