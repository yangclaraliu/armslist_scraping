Burris Speed Bead.

The radical SpeedBead System handles many of the factors that make wingshooters miss, and turns poor shooters into good shooters and good shooters into great ones. With the SpeedBead System, both the target and the red dot remain in focus. The optics and their position on the sight plane eliminate the need for perfect left/right, up/down head position for an accurate shot. The innovative mount puts the center of the optic directly in line with the ventilated rib, so altering your shooting style is not necessary. And with 3-1/2 inches to 4-1/2 inches of eye relief, there is absolutely no worry about your eyebrow running into the sight nor any interference with your hand gripping the shotgun. Should the common CR-2032 five year battery ever fail, you can revert to your front bead without visual obstruction. For a better view on rising targets, there are 1/8 and 1/4 risers available.

Has all original paperwork, Blackhawk Serpa Paddle holster, up to four Glock 17rnd magazines for the right trade, magazine loader and original Glock case. The only thing missing is the brush and one of the backstraps, both of which were lost by the previous, original owner.

Only two owners since first sale, pristine condition; Not a scratch on the gun or in it. 

500 for gun and 2 mags, will throw in a third for $20
Thanks!

We are a 501c non-profit charitable organization that raises money to help military veterans in the North Alabama region. 

We have our annual poker run on August 17th 2013 and we are desperately seeking vendors/contributors to help raise money.  This is our 3rd annual poker run and the past two have been a great success because of the involvement of the group and the local community. We are trying our best to get more people and bigger companies involved to raise awareness and money for the great veterans of the area. 

The generous few that find the ability to help us out get to advertise their links on our web-page and will be mentioned on our facebook page. Any donations of value over $100 also get a personalized wall plaque to commemorate their donation to the cause. 

Of course monetary donations are always the greatest gift, but we also would like donations used as door prizes and raffle prizes as well. If you have the ability, it would be great to have a representative from your company set up a display table with merchandise or samples. This allows cheap advertisement on your part and also gives people the opportunity to immediately ask any questions about the gift you supplied. No matter the amount of the donation, you are able to use the monetary value as a tax right off because of our 501c status. This is a win-win situation for all involved. 

I hope you can find it in your heart to help support the great men and women that have sacrificed so much for this great country.

The V-Force Grills mask is actually better than the Dye i4 system, for a number of reasons:
- the Grill Z actually covers your entire lower jaw line! (That's right, folks, with the i4 you can be hit right in the chin or the jaw bone - i4 only covers your mouth and cheeks! And those with long faces better keep their mouths shut as well, or risk eating a paintball! :D )
- the complete and unobstructed view either left to right, or up-down as if you were looking having no mask on at all
- the lowest profile (while not compromising the unmatched comfort) of any mask currently on the market
- the most unobstructed breathing and anti-echo helmet design - best venting of air + communicate clearly with your comrades :) !
- comes with the sun & rain visors stock, unlike i4
- one of the most quick and easy lens replacement systems
- the quickest SEPARATE comfort foam replacement systems (that's the part that prevents the mask and the lens from sitting directly on your eyes and nose)

The All-Round Talent

GLOCK 19 ""GENERATION 4""


The GLOCK 19 is ideal for versatile use through reduced dimensions compared with the standard pistol size. With the proven caliber of 9x19, it has found worldwide distribution in security services. In addition to being used as a conventional service weapon, it is suitable for concealed carry or as a backup weapon. For instance, many of the elite pilots of the USAF for instance trust the GLOCK 19 for their efficient defense in emergency situations. 

The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested
“Safe Action” system
durable exterior finish
cold hammer forged barrel
durability
reliability
light weight

... that make GLOCK firearms famous!

The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back strap) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size.

The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin.

The grip angle of the GLOCK “Safe Action” Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol.

    The smallest back strap is integrated in the GLOCK MBS Frame reducing the trigger distance of the standard size frame by 2 mm. The medium back strap is a 2 mm back strap offering equal size of a standard frame. The large back strap is a 4 mm back strap.

    The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts.

    Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps.

    Internally, the original recoil spring has been replaced with a dual recoil spring assembly. The dual recoil spring assembly noticeably reduces the recoil while simultaneously increasing the life cycle of the assembly.

All GLOCK pistols are backed by the GLOCK Limited Lifetime Warranty and world-class customer service and support that is second to none in the firearms industry!"

Improved Global Pistol


The GLOCK 17 GEN 4 in caliber 9x19 is the most widely carried law enforcement pistol worldwide. Because of its unsurpassed reliability, above-average magazine capacity of 17 cartridges in the standard magazine and its low weight, it is trusted by law enforcement officers in their daily duties throughout the world. The Glock 17 Pistol is safe, easy and quick to use through the revolutionary “Safe Action” trigger system. GLOCK 17 Generation 4 – designed for professionals.

With the new GEN 4 frame, features which have been requested by past users have been incorporated in this 2010 Glock model. Removal of a single pin allows the user to quickly and easily change grips to fit the GLOCK 17 Generation 4 into a small or large hand.  Glock's long life dual recoil springs replace the single spring found in previous models, giving a much better feel. The Glock 17's surface of the stock and backstraps have been redesigned to provide a much improved grip, providing better control. The last improvement Glock made for this model is the slightly larger and reversible magazine catch. 

GLOCK 17 Gen 4 pistols are backed by the GLOCK Limited Lifetime Warranty and world-class customer service and support that is second to none in the firearms industry!

Glock 15 + 1 Round Double Action Only 40 S&W w/Fixed Sights

Glock pistols are the perfect combination of reliability and accuracy.
Their high-tech engineering and construction create a handgun that can
stand up to more punishment than even the most unforgiving conditions can
generate. When you investigate the individual advantages of a Glock, you'll
see that it will out perform whatever you're shooting now. The unique Glock
barrel features hammer forged rifling for increased velocity and even
greater accuracy. With a consistent trigger pull and excellent
pointability, there's a very good chance you'll be hitting your targets for
a long, long time.

The V-Force Grills mask is actually better than the Dye i4 system, for a number of reasons:
- the Grill Z actually covers your entire lower jaw line! (That's right, folks, with the i4 you can be hit right in the chin or the jaw bone - i4 only covers your mouth and cheeks! And those with long faces better keep their mouths shut as well, or risk eating a paintball! :D )
- the complete and unobstructed view either left to right, or up-down as if you were looking having no mask on at all
- the lowest profile (while not compromising the unmatched comfort) of any mask currently on the market
- the most unobstructed breathing and anti-echo helmet design - best venting of air + communicate clearly with your comrades :) !
- comes with the sun & rain visors stock, unlike i4
- one of the most quick and easy lens replacement systems
- the quickest SEPARATE comfort foam replacement systems (that's the part that prevents the mask and the lens from sitting directly on your eyes and nose)

The Camco Gen-turi RV Generator Exhaust System is a venting system designed specifically for RV generators that provides for fresher air around RVs as well as reduces generator noise. The Gen-turi utilizes a tubing and coupling system to raise generator exhaust above the top level of your RV. It can be used with RVs utilizing virtually any exhaust pipes size by way of a variety of adapters. Additional features include: light weight design, a rubberized stabilizing/sound reduction system and a storage bag.

Vent generator exhaust for cleaner air and quieter conditions.

Reduce RV Generator Exhaust and Noise

RV generators are a popular and convenient tool for providing instant power when you on the road, but close quarters at rallies, tailgate parties and at campgrounds create a need for a reduction in the noise and exhaust fumes that they generate. This is where Gen-turi comes in. The Gen-turi is made specifically for use with RV generators,* when the vehicle is at rest. It diverts nasty fumes away from the ground, where they can be inhaled by neighboring RVers and campers, allowing you all your comforts while remaining a good neighbor. As generator exhaust is vented above the roof line of the RV and is also air cooled in a patented process.

Everything you need, including a range of adapters, right out of the box.

Rising hot air draws in cooler air, diluting fumes and reducing noise.

Easy assembly and quick disassembly when it is time to hit the road.

Dilution of fumes leads to less rattle that is often transferred to the vehicle body, and then the surrounding area, resulting in reducing noise all around. The Gen-turi is also conveniently light weight at only nine pounds, and comes with its own soft storage bag.

How it Works

Exhaust ""noise"" comes from two sources: vibration and the sound made by the actual gases leaving the exhaust pipe. Most manufacturers mount generators in a manner that uses some type of rubber material to isolate the vibration of the generator. Even though the Gen-turi is rigidly secured to the exhaust system, rubber straps are used to stabilize the Gen-turi to the coach. This prevents transferring the vibration noise of the generator system to the coach. As an added benefit, the noise made by the gases discharging from the generator exhaust pipe is diverted upward, above the roof line of the coach. As a result, in most installations, the exhaust system is actually quieter with the Gen-turi installed.

Compatibility

The Camco Gen-turi Air Cooled Generator Exhaust System is designed for near universal compatibility. With that in mind, it can be used with any recreational vehicle that utilizes an exhaust pipe with an outside diameter of 1"", 1¼"", 1⅜"", 1½"", 1⅝"", 1¾"", and 2"". Adapters required for 1¼"", 1⅜"", and 1½"" are included. These will accommodate most installations. Adapters required for 1"", 1⅝"", 1¾"", and 2"" may be purchased separately.

It is recommended that the Gen-turi exhaust pipe extend 6"" above your RV's roof line. Gen-turi has an overall length of 120"". Please measure your RV for compatibility.

Key Features

Vents RV generator exhaust up and away resulting in cleaner air for you and your neighbors

The All-Round Talent

GLOCK 19 ""GENERATION 4""


The GLOCK 19 is ideal for versatile use through reduced dimensions compared with the standard pistol size. With the proven caliber of 9x19, it has found worldwide distribution in security services. In addition to being used as a conventional service weapon, it is suitable for concealed carry or as a backup weapon. For instance, many of the elite pilots of the USAF for instance trust the GLOCK 19 for their efficient defense in emergency situations. 

The Gen4, just like any GLOCK pistol has the same time tested
“Safe Action” system
durable exterior finish
cold hammer forged barrel
durability
reliability
light weight

... that make GLOCK firearms famous!

The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size G17/G22 MBS (multiple back strap) frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size.

The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin.

The grip angle of the GLOCK “Safe Action” Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol.

    The smallest back strap is integrated in the GLOCK MBS Frame reducing the trigger distance of the standard size frame by 2 mm. The medium back strap is a 2 mm back strap offering equal size of a standard frame. The large back strap is a 4 mm back strap.

    The magazine release catch of the Gen4 is reversible and enlarged. The reversible magazine allows users to switch the catch to the left or right side of the pistol with no additional parts.

    Additionally, the Gen4 has a new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps.

    Internally, the original recoil spring has been replaced with a dual recoil spring assembly. The dual recoil spring assembly noticeably reduces the recoil while simultaneously increasing the life cycle of the assembly.

All GLOCK pistols are backed by the GLOCK Limited Lifetime Warranty and world-class customer service and support that is second to none in the firearms industry!"
