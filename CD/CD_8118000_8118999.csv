Here are the specs...- Brownells A1 upper and lower (clone correct)- Clone correct repro aluminum buttstock.- BCM upper and lower parts kits. - Original Colt 16” (legal length) barrel assembly from an original SP-1 carbine. Chrome lined pencil profile.- Slip over faux moderator- Clone correct Vietnam era sling, original. - Original A1 pistol grip.- Clone correct profile handguard.- Mil-spec bolt carrier group. - BCM receiver extension, buffer, and spring.*** If you’re more into the IDF carbine look, you can simply slip off the moderator, throw on an A2 birdcage, and you’ve got an IDF carbine! *** If you’re more into the Black Hawk Down Delta look, I will also throw in a free scope rail so you can mount an aimpoint.Here’s the legal: I will not break the law for a stranger, so don’t even try. We will meet at a gun shop. If you like her, we do a transfer through the shop. I also cannot provide you with magazines, as much as I’d like to. This rifle deserves an old Colt 20-rounder, unfortunately, that does not trump my desire to stay out of prison. DO NOT ASK ME TO BREAK ANY LAWS FOR YOU. That will end the discussion immediately."

So around 1k rounds put through it. It runs like a champ but would be better with an extended firing pin for steel rounds. The previous owner had taken model paint to it which I completely stripped off and covered with rattle can with the intentions of getting it cerakoted in the future.

The trigger is amazing, the sights are better than most tiny .380's, and it's very, very small. Even smaller than an LCP.***FULL DISCLOSURE: The firearm has been having light strike issues lately. About 2 in 30 rounds. I took it apart, cleaned it, shot it again, same thing. Most likely a weak striker spring (striker isn't broken or anything) but I just purcahsed a Seecamp .380 and I don't have the time nor energy to figure this out. It's a great gun, and Kahr has great customer service, but I don't feel like dealing with it. That being said, I'm selling this insanely cheap so someone else can deal with it.This comes with:- Kahr CW380- Talon Grips- 1 6 round factory mag- 1 extra 7 round factory mag (doesn't usually come with it)- 1 custom Kydex low profile holster- 1 custom Kudex low profile mag carrier- Factory box, paperwork, and lock.I'm asking $200 FIRM for this. That's a stupidly good deal since all you have to do is send it into Kahr or buy some new springs for it. If I fixed it myself I could easiily sell it for $300 or more, I just don't really care that much. Not interested in trades.Located in Northville, not really willing to travel super far for a $200 sale so you'd have to come near me. Livonia, Novi, Northville, etc. Must be 18+ with a purchase permit or CPL, NO exceptions. No shipping.Best way to contact me is by texting REDACTED at any time.Thanks for looking!~ Mike"

Unfortunately the Round Counter broke so I can’t tell you definitively how many rounds are down the pipe, haha! But I can tell you it’s not very many, I would guess less than 500. I bought it because my wife had expressed interest in getting her permit, hence why I bought so many holsters for her to try. She never ended up getting her permit so I really have no need to keep it. I have shot it some over the past couple of years to “break it in” and well because why not? Wasn’t going to just let it sit around and not get shot. It’s very accurate and a pleasure to shoot. I would keep it for myself but I definitely see myself scratching the heck out of it and generally just abusing it, if I was to carry it daily and for me personally it’s just too nice of a gun for that. I prefer polymer that is ugly to start off so the abuses of daily carry don’t really matter much.I want to sell everything as a “package” which will include:Springfield EMP 9mm bitoneOriginal box and papers3 original magazinesfactory holsterfactory mag carrierfactory rosewood gripsIncluded extras:3 extra magazines so you will get a total of 6VZ grip panelsHogue wrap around rubber gripsCrimson Trace Master Series Laser Grips (red laser)Stealth Gear USA IWB holsterClick Holster OWB kydex holster with suede liningSOB holsterVedder IWB appendix carry holstercustom made pancake holster with belt slots and thumb break retention strapcustom made pancake holster with leather loops for belt with thumb break retention strap*all holsters are for a right handed shooter*Off the top of my head I would value the package around $1500 but I also don’t keep up with gun prices, so I am going to do a little homework and talk to a few gun shops about value, in the meantime please feel free to make me an offer. Worst I can say is no thanks. I would be open to a few trades. Mostly I am looking for another nice mountain bike, large frame, full suspension, nothing you would buy from a big box store. I would consider a used seadoo/pwc as well. In terms of firearm trades I will consider any other 1911, and any small ccw’s in either 9mm or 45 such as a baby Glock or Springfield XDS. Other than that, not much really peaks my interest, but feel free to make an offer.

This is the original M&P (no thumb safety and will fire without the mag in it) and I bought it right when they first came out. This was my daily carry gun for many many years and couldn’t speak more highly of it’s reliabilty and accuracy. However, I’ve decided to make a change and could use the money with a baby on the way. Since I’ve had this so long, I have quite a bit of extras to go along with it. The gun itself is in great shape. Slight amount of holster wear on the nose but hardly noticeable. It comes with the original case, manual and the 3 palms swells it came with from the factory. I have 6 magazines for it; two 15 rounders and four 10 rounders. The 15 round mags come with the extended grip sleeve for a perfect fit to the compact frame. Three of the 10 rounds have the factory pinky extender floor plate on them and 1 is the flat base plate. I have 2 more flat base plates without the pinky spot that will be included. All mags and extensions are factory S&W, not aftermarket junk. I’m also including a Crossbreed IWB holster, a Fobus paddle holster and a black leather double mag pouch. I’ll also through in a compact Insight XML light for the mini rail. And if the buyer is interested, I have 394 rounds of ammo I’ll include for the full asking price. There is over $900 worth of gear (without the ammo) included in this deal so it’s a great buy for someone who wants to be fully suited right off the bat. Email me if you have any questions."

This was NOT modified into a trench gun, but rather built as one. Bayonet lug indicates that it was used by the military. Includes 1913-style bayonet. My research indicates Model 1897s in this configuration were sold to law enforcement, prisons, and priviate citizens. Very clean bore...cleaner than I make them by far. Barrel says CYL, indicating it was NOT modified. Yes, the handguard and bayonet are clean, but neither shows signs of sandblasting or other invasive cleaning. I tried to make the ""Winchester Model 1897"" and serial number stand out more by filling it in with crayon...all I did was make a mess, Sorry."
