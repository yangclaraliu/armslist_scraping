We know what needs done in 2014. Don't know if the picture of Gabby Gifford is real or fake.

Dear Fellow Coloradan,

The horror of the Newtown shooting, arriving on the heels of the mass shootings in Aurora, Columbine, Virginia Tech and Tucson, has appropriately reignited a national debate over gun violence.  Sadly, this week even a bipartisan compromise to expand background checks to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill, drafted by two conservative U.S. senators — Republican Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia — failed to pass the U.S. Senate, despite being supported by 90 percent of Americans and over 70 percent of NRA members.

Last week I met with the mothers and fathers of the children who were murdered in Newtown; although they told me about how thankful they were to the families and community of Aurora for their support, I know they are uniquely disappointed in the Senate's failure to pass meaningful gun-safety measures.  This gulf between public support and congressional inaction cannot continue.

Mark Udall

As with many issues, Colorado serves as a roadmap for the steps we must take: Our state closed the gun show loophole through a ballot initiative in 2000 and in March this year, Gov. John Hickenlooper signed into law several bills that require universal background checks for all gun purchases and limit high-capacity magazines.  These actions mirror my votes in the U.S. Senate this week in favor of background checks, supporting a ban on high-capacity magazines, cracking down on illegal gun sales and trafficking, and improving mental health services.

The U.S. Senate also considered an assault weapons ban.  And while I've previously called for an effectively crafted ban on military-style weapons, the specific ban we considered went much further than the 1994 assault weapons law and also would have banned legitimate hunting rifles and even some shotguns.  I spoke to sportsmen from across Colorado and they voiced their concerns about how this ban would restrict their ability to hunt and responsibly practice their sport, which is an important part of our economy and way of life.  I know some Coloradans may say that banning some legitimate hunting weapons is a small price to pay to keep other, more dangerous weapons off of our streets — especially for a state that has suffered mass gun tragedies.  I can relate to that sentiment, but after years of seeking to find common ground on gun-safety issues, I also know that overreach can spur the backlash that we've seen undermine even the most common-sense solutions - like universal background checks. 

But an assault weapons ban alone should not serve as a litmus test for people who want to reduce gun violence.  Even if a perfectly drafted assault weapons ban were signed into law, we would still be left with easy access to millions of military-style weapons on our streets today - which is why it is so important to also ensure that a background check is conducted on every gun sale.

There are no easy answers, but we should all agree — and a large majority of NRA members do — that we must keep firearms of any kind out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill by requiring universal background checks.  But loopholes — which the Manchin-Toomey proposal sought to correct — continue to prevent many of these background checks from occurring today.  Disturbed individuals should not get a chance to fire even one round into their communities, let alone the 30 rounds a high-capacity magazine would allow.  Together, background checks and a ban on high-capacity magazines achieve much of what an assault weapons ban seeks to — preventing the wrong people from having access to weapons that can inflict mass casualties in a matter of moments.

Coming from a state with a long and storied tradition of gun ownership that has also suffered through too many gun tragedies, I know we must simultaneously renew our commitment to keeping our children safe while safeguarding our Second Amendment rights.  My friend Gabby Giffords, a survivor of the senseless violence in Tucson, knows too well how important this debate is and her strength has only affirmed my conviction that the status quo must change.  I will keep fighting for Colorado's families and values.  Our nation deserves nothing less.

Warm regards,

Item Description

This Eye Grabbing SKS Build - Blued Steel- with ATI Strikeforce composite fiber black stock system plus stock muzzle BRAKE - with Bayonette! is loaded with Extras including the already mentioned and pictured $180.00+ Valued (others have asked over $240 for this Stock) ATI Strikeforce Stock Installed- Comes with 75 Round Drum Clip - Included - compatible with most other aftermarket SKS clips especially when you don't mind doing a little fitting. The 3-9x40mm Barsca or similar Scope is included!! DETAILED INFO: ATI Strikeforce gives the SKS an AR style lightweight - military style “black rifle” look which offers expanded accessory mounting versatility with several picatinny bases for accessories. This Tough stock is created from tough reinforced molded polymer. The bases allow you to install a wide variety of tactical accessories designed for any tacical rifle platform for live-fire training with 7.62x39 ammo.We set these up with either a AAA Powered Light or Laser Unit OR separate light & laser varied battery cell type Laser and light configurations! - awesome for low light conditions, always great to have! Watch the laser tighten up those groups.
The upper receiver housing with integral Tri-rail has been hand-fitted and accepts a broad array of popular tactical optics. We keep these tight. They maintain zero! The original wood or composite upper handguard may be used. The Adjustable, six-position Folding buttstock replicates the feel and functionality of USGI military carbine stocks, there are several ambidextrous receptacles for single-point push button slings. The ergonomically shaped pistol grip has comfortable molded-in finger grooves. The pistol grip has comfortable medium and large hand sized grip surface and is able to be handled by all but the smallest shooters.
Note the bipod front hand grip can be shipped, or replaced with the 5 position folding grip at the pleasure of the buyer - Either / Or. Both can be had for a modest extra ""$18"" for costs. Either way this system makes for extreme flexibility of the platform. As in the photos the picatinny rail set is used to full function yet still has remaining open mounting areas. A very functional finish for this striking weapon.
Measures were taken to protect the SKS used as the basis for this build. Most 'offending' cosmoline removed, and gun-oil applied to needed areas covered with other equipment such as the barrel under the hand guard. This setup is very tight, We were impressed both by the amount of fitting the tri rail required yet how tight it can be left after fitting to allow for optimal zero retention by the scope or other optics mounted on it. These also have see through mounts that allow the front sight to be used if needed. The gun however having not been fired for sighting - has not been zeroed with real ammo. Parts that are able to be laser bore sighted will be, you can tweak it quickly at the range either way.

COOL!.........................................

Gun is ridiculously accurate as seen by the test target. Functions 100% and is covered by Nighthawks transferable lifetime warranty. Will e-mail additional pics of gun, one hole test target, etc..

My loss is your gain. I bought this set of 4 rims and tires used online for an anniversary gift for my wife. The weekend they came in, she sold her SUV for a Prius. Go figure...anywho, these rims will fit most SUVs (Ranger, Explorer, Land Rover, etc) and most rear wheel drive cars. They will fit bolt patterns, 5x120; 5x4.5; 5x4.25. 

The rims are wrapped with Hankook Ventus V4 ES tires. One of the tires needs to be replaced, it was messed up during shipping. The rims do show signs of wear, but are not bent and have been balanced. 

The rims cost $650 a piece new, center caps cost $80 each, and the tires are $175 each. New these would cost over $3600. 

If you have any questions please let me know and if you have something of value just ask...worst I could say would be no. :) I have more pictures on request."

This pistol is a rare find.  The black on black construction isn't common.  This pistol is truly a throwback to the Cold War era.  Due to its age this piece can be considered a relic and in prestine shape.  Firing the common and very affordable 9x18 makarov, the caliber is more potent than the .380 but less powerful than the 9x19 or standard 9mm.

The V-Force Grills mask is actually better than the Dye i4 system, for a number of reasons:
- the Grill Z actually covers your entire lower jaw line! (That's right, folks, with the i4 you can be hit right in the chin or the jaw bone - i4 only covers your mouth and cheeks! And those with long faces better keep their mouths shut as well, or risk eating a paintball! :D )
- the complete and unobstructed view either left to right, or up-down as if you were looking having no mask on at all
- the lowest profile (while not compromising the unmatched comfort) of any mask currently on the market
- the most unobstructed breathing and anti-echo helmet design - best venting of air + communicate clearly with your comrades :) !
- comes with the sun & rain visors stock, unlike i4
- one of the most quick and easy lens replacement systems
- the quickest SEPARATE comfort foam replacement systems (that's the part that prevents the mask and the lens from sitting directly on your eyes and nose)

This is Walther P99 11mm (.43 ) paintball marker pistol made by Umarex that is sold (or rather ""re-sold"") by either the T4E or the RAP4 . People claim that there are different versions of this marker - they are wrong - both RAP4 and T4E are just resellers for Umarex which, in turn, manufactures these markers in the same factory in China. RAP4 & T4E are EXACTLY the same.

The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. And, it's water resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.

The Springfield XD(M) 3.8 chambered in 9mm Luger utilizes a 3.8"" barrel and full size grip. This combination results in a firearm that makes a great choice for controllable concealed carry. Additionally the Springfield XD(M) incorporates front and rear slide serrations, accessory rail, and interchangeable backstraps.

All XD pistols include the XD Gear System, which consists of a XD Gear belt holster, XD Gear double magazine pouch, XD Gear magazine loader, two magazines and a cable lock. It's more than a new set of features; it's about raising your expectations of what a polymer pistol should be. It's about creating a new standard in value. The XD(M) has a match grade barrel, minimal reset trigger, and melonite finish. Also featuring a loaded chamber indicator, USA trigger safety, grip safety and striker status indicator.

This pistol is brand new in the box.  I purchased it about 6 weeks ago.  I was wanting an XDM in the full size 4.5"" barrel, but unable to find one at time, I purchased this one.  Eventually I came across the full size version and I no longer need to keep two nearly identical pistols. 

This pistol retails for $697.  Cabelas, Bass Pro and elsewhere are selling most pistols at full retail or more because of the tight market.  I've listed this XDM nearly $50 under retail and it's selling for a little less than I gave for it.  Nearly everyone is sold out and back ordered on hand guns.  Get this NIB Springfield before it's gone. Call REDACTED"

The free float rails are designed to fit all the tactical gear that you can carry. Unlike many ARs, this is a standard feature which you won't end up spending more to upgrade the rail set-ups. It has an efficient autoloading direct-impingement gas system for ejection of spent cartridges and auto reloading. No forward assist is necessary for a rifle this smooth. It does have a dust cover, a large trigger hole, and nice charging handle. The blued barrel is 16.25"", rifled for 1 in 9"" and ends with the muzzle-flash suppressor. The receiver, magazine release, and charging handle are all well designed to make use and maintenance reliable and easy. The upper and lower separate easily with two pins for service and cleaning. The receiver accepts 5.56 Nato ammunition as well as .223 Remington brass or steel casings. It has a 31 round capacity and is a real front-runner in the AR style market. Colt also makes a good quad rail set-up like this, but is generally much more costly. Mossberg redefined affordable with .223s and the .22lr. They have been around over 90 years.

You have what is known as a ""Trade Brand Name"" shotgun. A ""Trade Brand Name"" shotgun is one that was made by a major maker (and before 1940) for and was sold by a wholesale sporting goods dealer, a retail chain store or an independent retailer who chose the name to go on the gun. I have three listings for the name Russell Arms Company, two made by a Belgian maker named Joseph Cap of Liege,Belgium. Those names are just plain RUSSELL ARNS CO and RUSSEL ARMS CO FINE BARREL STEEL. These guns were made for, imported by and sold by H & D Folsom a large wholesale and retail sporting goods dealer located in New York City. The guns would have been imported before 1914. One other name, again just plain RUSSELL ARMS CO was made by Crescent Fire ArmsCompany of Norwich,CT (1892 to 1931) for and again sold by H & D Folsom. To tell which is which look for proof marks on the bottom of the barrels under the forearm. Belgian made guns will have the letters ""ELG"" in an oval with a crown over that stamped there. America made guns will not have proof marks. Finding an original butt plate is going to be difficult because none have been made in over eighty years. You can surf the various gun auction sites like Gun Broker for parts or parts guns being auctioned off. You can also contact Gun Parts Incorporated to see if they might have one that can be adapted. A word of caution here. The gun is at least eight years old and was designed and made using the technology and metallurgy of the times and for the ammunition in use back then. Belgian made guns are most likely to have damascus barrels and all will be chambered for 2 1/2 inch shells loaded with black powder and lead shot. hey were not designed for modern 3 inch or magnum shells loaded with high pressure smokeless powder or steel shot. I recommend that you do not attempt to shoot the gun. Value? Every one wants to know. The value of these old guns depends upon the condition, the amount of original finish remaining on the metal and wood as well as the mechanical condition"
