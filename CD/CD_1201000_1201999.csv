Even with so few made over 40 years ago, named on CA ban list. Awesome design with early use of aluminum that was developed originally to be a full auto subgun and many were made full and suppressed by Wilkinson. Made to extreme tolerances from info I found. Wood stock and front, 30 round magazine. Mags are available but this original is $120 online! More info available and manual from J&R. Guns and Ammo packed 9mms with Bullseye and got 2000fps in one with no damage.(I have issue) $35 shipping.

I dont charge a lot and Im not picky, only request some form of payment, parts, magazines, ammo, cash or whatever of value.  

Pick whatever you want done.
#1. FIX crappy rocking slide release for quicker reload.  
I modify it so it acts like nearly any modern firearm, it locks back after last round fired and then you just insert mag and pull back the slide to rack forward loading a round.  
No more fiddling with the little rocking lever under finger guard to release slide.   

2. I can smooth and polish trigger group.  (You would be amazed how gouged and rough they usually are)   I assure you there will be a noticeable difference in how smooth the creep to fire is.

These barrels are cold hammer-forged from high-grade chromium-molybdenum-vanadium alloy steel for exceptional strength and accuracy potential—like a high-end match rifle barrel. Magnetic particle inspection (MPI) ensures there are no internal flaws in the metal. Durable manganese phosphate finish give excellent resistance to surface wear.

Built for long-lasting continuous use, the Katadyn Pocket water microfilter features a silver-impregnated ceramic element that's effective against bacteria and protozoa even in extreme conditions. Unlike disposable filters, the ceramic element can be cleaned several times--even in the field. More importantly, the element filters all microorganisms larger than 0.2 microns (0.0002mm), producing clear, drinkable water wherever you are. The pump also includes an improved, round pump handle for better ergonomics and an outlet hose that attaches to water containers with a single clip.

The Pocket hails from Katadyn's Endurance series, a high-quality line of filters that can produce up to 100 times more water than standard water filters. The Pocket is so tough in fact, that it's the first choice for extreme adventurers like Mike Horn. Plus, it's the only water filter with a 20-year warranty. Other features include a measuring gauge that indicates when you should change the filtering element, a cushioned base that makes it easy to pump on all surfaces, a prefilter, and a carrying bag.

During the 1960's the Soviet military made the decision to convert their assault weapons from 7.62mm to a reduced caliber of higher velocity. This was based in part on studies of the American made M-16 during the Vietnam conflict. They felt that the United States may know something they didn't and decided to follow their example. This did not sit well with Mikhail Kalashnikov who felt that the M-43 7.62x39 cartridge was sufficient for all modern battlefield needs. Even so he began work on a new weapon to chamber the smaller cartridge.
The task of designing the cartridge fell to a group led by Viktor Sabelnikov. Other prominent designers on the team were Lidiya Bulavskaya, Boris Semin, Mikhail Fedorov, Petr Sazonov, and Petr Korolev. Their task was to develop a 5.45mm low impulse cartridge that would be more accurate than the cartridge currently used in the AKM assault rifles.
The result was a small caliber bullet of very high velocity. The bullet also has good sectional density and a fairly flat trajectory. Despite being lighter in weight than its predecessor, the 5.45mm cartridge retained the same lethality as the older round. It can penetrate a 5mm steel sheet at 350 meters, not bad for a 53 grain bullet.
Another feature that contributes to the lethality of the cartridge is that it becomes unstable when it strikes an object. This means that although it flies perfectly well through the air, it tumbles violently after striking a target - creating a larger wound channel when compared to a normal bullet. This was accomplished by leaving a hollow space at the front of the bullet which makes the round imbalanced on impact with flesh or wood.

REVIEW: This caliber is just great fun to shoot. We tested it in a Romanian rifle with eight 30 round magazines. Recoil is SO LIGHT and it functioned 100% of the time. No malfuntions at all. Overall, this is SUPER GOOD SURPLUS."

Dirty ammo: keep your gun lubed well, if your depended on it.

Steel case: disposable cases, might save them up to sell for scrap. 

If your hording: This ain't the ammo you want, once this craziness is over you'll realize what it's worth.

Super light recoil with same or better ballistics and velocity but tumbles on impact to produce some very devastating wounds. Wideners has 1080 round cans in stock right now for $180 but it can still be had for as little as $160 per 1080 rounds. Shoot 4 times as many rounds as your buddies for the same cost.

During the 1960's the Soviet military made the decision to convert their assault weapons from 7.62mm to a reduced caliber of higher velocity. This was based in part on studies of the American made M-16 during the Vietnam conflict. They felt that the United States may know something they didn't and decided to follow their example. This did not sit well with Mikhail Kalashnikov who felt that the M-43 7.62x39 cartridge was sufficient for all modern battlefield needs. Even so he began work on a new weapon to chamber the smaller cartridge.
The task of designing the cartridge fell to a group led by Viktor Sabelnikov. Other prominent designers on the team were Lidiya Bulavskaya, Boris Semin, Mikhail Fedorov, Petr Sazonov, and Petr Korolev. Their task was to develop a 5.45mm low impulse cartridge that would be more accurate than the cartridge currently used in the AKM assault rifles.
The result was a small caliber bullet of very high velocity. The bullet also has good sectional density and a fairly flat trajectory. Despite being lighter in weight than its predecessor, the 5.45mm cartridge retained the same lethality as the older round. It can penetrate a 5mm steel sheet at 350 meters, not bad for a 53 grain bullet.
Another feature that contributes to the lethality of the cartridge is that it becomes unstable when it strikes an object. This means that although it flies perfectly well through the air, it tumbles violently after striking a target - creating a larger wound channel when compared to a normal bullet. This was accomplished by leaving a hollow space at the front of the bullet which makes the round imbalanced on impact with flesh or wood.

REVIEW: This caliber is just great fun to shoot. We tested it in a Romanian rifle with eight 30 round magazines. Recoil is SO LIGHT and it functioned 100% of the time. No malfuntions at all. Overall, this is SUPER GOOD SURPLUS."

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin."

I have spent a great deal of time (since 1981) in the reloading hobby and in this current climate, it has become a near necessity. I currently reload for many calibers, some of which simply are no longer available and the only way to keep some of the old guns shooting is to 'roll your own'.

I am a full time police officer, law enforcement firearms instructor and concealed carry instructor. I have been reloading for over 30 years and have managed to accumulate a bit of knowledge that I'd like to pass on.

While I have loaded for MANY calibers in the past, my current efforts are:

40 S&W
9mm
45 Colt (Cowboy Loads and Full Power)
38 Special
45-70 (Full Power and Trapdoor Loads)

setup. It came built from CORE with upgraded MOE Magpul parts including Stock, Flip up 

sights, Hand guard and pistol grip. I also has an extended trigger guard. This AR comes with 

all the bells and whistles. CORE15s warantee is second to none. If it’s not working like it 

should they fix it , no questions asked. It doesnt matter if your the first or 50th owner, 

40th round or 4 million rounds shot, they fix it!  I will include a hard plastic case and 

one PMag. If the buyer is interested in additional PMags and ammo I have something like 6 

PMags and about 600 rounds of 5.56/.223 that we can work into the deal. I also have soft 

case.



Again, I have only ran about 30 rounds through the rifle. The MSRP is $1499 plus taxes and 

background fees. I am not looking to make money just break even, give you a great deal and 

pay my house payment this month (Babies are expensive!)

ARMSLIST and all other gun marketplaces are community run for the most part. As a gun community we need to come together to rid ourselves of one of the deadliest sins - greed. We are all tired of seeing $500 AK-47s listed at $2000, and $800 fully upgraded AR-15s posted for $4500. Guess what? As gun buyers and members on this and other forums, we are just as responsible for the state of our society as the price gougers and hoarders. We need to come together and do two thing: (1) STOP BUYING AT THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES and (2) click on the ad, go to ""Flag"" at the top, and press ""overpriced."" This whole process takes 1.3968 seconds. 

I have upset a few of the posters here as being a socialist.  I am far from that - I believe as a community we can police our own good and bad behavior.  Helping each other and fair profits are a good behavior.  I consider gouging a bad behavior.  If you consider it an acceptable behavior, buy from them at the inflated prices.

These folks only have a business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement.

NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing but we have the Boulder Airlift from Magpul to cover our AR15 needs, and we can also find many of the other magazines now online.  Use a search engine to save yourself big bucks and compare pricing.  

After the panic that $800 Glock is going to be selling new in the gunstore cases for upper $400 to mid $500. When you find them now, that is what they are selling for NIB.  Nothing in the Colorado bills will change the pricing structure or their availability.

I personally believe every time I skip over a $10,000 ad for a $3000 purchased SCAR 17, I have just become part of the problem. Send them an email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly flag their ad so we can get prices back to where they all belong. 

I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy to a word file and please repost it later today or tomorrow.  The average life span of this post is about 20 minutes - this message is reallly upsetting the profiteers.

Add your own two cents in if you'd like or if I got anything wrong. The price regularity will only return if we make it. 

AR-15: $600-$1400 depending on brand and usage (shots fired, wear, etc..)
AK-47: $400-$900
SKS: $300-$500
SCAR 16/17: $2000/$2800
AR-10: $1000-1600
Glock: $400-600
10/22: $229
ACR: $2000
1911: $600-$1100
9mm ammo: $0.30/round is on the higher end
223/5.56: $0.40/round is on the higher end
.308/7.62 NATO: maybe up to $1/round (but on high side)
.22: $0.05/round is high

Again, feel free to add your $0.02, make changes, repost, and if you believe they are overpriced flag them. That is why Armslist has the flag option – it is intended to be community regulated."

This is a ONE OF A KIND TRUCK, NOT ANOTHER ONE LIKE IT ANYWHERE. I'm selling my 1986 Chevrolet M-1008 CUCV 1-1/4 ton (5/4ton) Military Truck. It has almost 44,000 actual miles on its 6.2 liter Diesel motor and it's one of a kind. It's a 1986 K30 with new CROSS OVER STEERING, new rear shackle hangers for extra lift in the rear, new heavy duty brake lines, Two new 12 volt heavy duty deep cycle truck batteries, new brake calipers & brakes, 9 inches of lift, 3 inch summit body lift, 6 inch Rough Country suspension lift, Rough Country shocks with 2 inch billet Aluminum wheel spacers on the front, New dual Exhaust (sounds great), TH400 3spd auto Transmission, 6.2 liter Diesel with Dana-60 Front Axle, GM 14-Bolt Rear w/Detroit Locker, 4.56 Gears and Goodyear Wrangler 37X12.50X16.5 Military OZ tires and Military Humvee rims. It has way too many modifications to list such as bucket seats, Reece hitch receiver on the front, for your winch, as well as the military petal hitch and 2"" rear receiver hitch. I bought this truck from the US Army at Fort Meade, Maryland and replaced the entire body with a rust free Scottsdale body. If you are lucky enough to find one for sale by the government, they sell these trucks for around $4,000 or $5,000 and that's a plain truck with nothing added. These trucks last forever and trust me; these trucks are somewhat hard to come by and are like Sherman tanks. They were built for the US Military to be the toughest truck around and they were and are just that. Many new and custom parts have been added to this truck. I'm buying a house and need the money for the down payment or I would consider trading it for another truck that was newer. I have more money invested than I'll ever get out of it but if you are looking for a truck that's like no other then this is your truck. NO EMAILS, I won't answer emails because of spammers, serious inquiries only. The axles alone are worth $2,500. Call or text me at REDACTED $4,700 OBO. I'm getting too old and because of knee replacements, it's just too big for me, I can't get in and out of so I may consider a trade for a nice ATV or cash is just as good. Please don't be offended if I can't trade even for your ATV. It would have to be a very nice ATV for me to trade even."

They are hard to find. Don't overpay for a Bushmaster. CORE 15 is new to the AR market but they are making an amazing rifle. Please do your own research and you'll will see what I have learned about them. The term mil spec is over used in my opinion but CORE does use manufacturing processes like MPI to ensure the highest quality parts. No i don't work for the company but I was sold on their guns. I was originally going to buy a Bushmaster and hadn't heard about CORE 15. After looking at their rifles it is was a no brainier between the two. It's not a Colt, but for the price you can't beat them. Their current price is $1299 and the wait is at least 6 months minimum. I have listed the specs from their website. It does come with one 30 round PMAG. This gun has been used only 3 times for coyote hunting. It has less than 50 rounds fired throug it. I'm only selling it because I need the money for a down payment on a new house. I'm firm on the price; I love this gun and will not let this gun go for cheap, so please no low ball offers. It does come with a Bushnell red dot sight and case. If you don't like the camo paint job it's easy to remove to the original Black Rifle.

The A-15 is the DPMS AR carbine version with a 16"" medium weight barrel, the fixed AR front sight with the flattop receiver with picatinny rail and no rear sight, and the collapsing buttstock. This rifle is virtually brand new, and has has a total of less than 100 rds down the barrel, probably closer to 50...I'm not so anal retentive I count every round, but I do know I didn't go thru more than a couple boxes of both Wolf .223 and Lake City 5.56. I looked the entire rifle over while taking pictures and couldn't find any damage to either the plastic bits or the metal finish---I might have missed something but if I did it's pretty darn small! I currently have a EOTech 512 holographic sight on the rifle and sighted in at 100m; there are a couple of scratches on the protective housing (that's what it's there for) but the glass is perfect and the image is clear. My brother did a trigger job on this using Brownell parts and while it's still an AR, it's noticeably better than most for creep AND let off; the original springs will be included if I can find them and you want them. 

The rifle will come in the factory black plastic case with the serial number sticker; I can't seem to find any paperwork (it's an AR, we all know how they work and break down, right?). It will come with 2 brand new mags, neither of which came with the rifle---one is a DAH Industries 30rd marked ""Law Enforcement/Military Use Only"" and the other is a Colt 30rd; I don't know what happened to the original and I have too many AR mags to waste time looking for the exact one. I will also throw in one 20rd box of PMC brass 55gr FMJ rounds so you can shoot this thing after buying it!

My price is firm, so only reply with a genuine question about the rifle or to discuss meeting---I want $1350 with the EOTech or $950 without it. Case, mags and the box of ammo are included either way. Thanks for looking!"

I listed it as a rifle even though it is considered a pistol for legal purposes. Yes, you can open carry this in Tennessee as a pistol. I have stained and finished the wood a dark redish colour. The gun had a stiff fire selector but I have polished it and it is perfect. Nice single stage trigger. This is not a parts gun, but is all original from the country it was built in because pistols don't have to meet 922r compliance. Has the two original bolt hold open 30 round steel magazines.

They are hard to find. Don't overpay for a Bushmaster. CORE 15 is new to the AR market but they are making an amazing rifle. Please do your own research and you'll will see what I have learned about them. The term mil spec is over used in my opinion but CORE does use manufacturing processes like MPI to ensure the highest quality parts. No i don't work for the company but I was sold on their guns. I was originally going to buy a Bushmaster and hadn't heard about CORE 15. After looking at their rifles it is was a no brainier between the two. It's not a Colt, but for the price you can't beat them. Their current price is $1299 and the wait is at least 6 months minimum. I have listed the specs from their website. It does come with one 30 round PMAG. This gun has been used only 3 times for coyote hunting. It has less than 50 rounds fired throug it. I'm only selling it because I need the money for a down payment on a new house. I'm firm on the price; I love this gun and will not let this gun go for cheap, so please no low ball offers. It does come with a Bushnell red dot sight and case. If you don't like the camo paint job it's easy to remove to the original Black Rifle.

From Remington Website:

The first time you carry a Model Seven in the field, you’ll understand why it’s considered one of the finest dense-cover rifles in America. Lightning-fast in close quarters. Superbly accurate for the long shot. 

    •  2 3/8"" shorter overall length than Model 700™ counterparts makes the Model Seven perfectly sized for small-statured shooters and dense-cover hunting situations
    •  Compact design for fast handling
    •  Features the same legendary strength as the Model 700™ action: “Three rings of steel” with the bolt face, barrel and receiver encasing the cartridge head
    •  Cylindrical receiver design provides a consistent bedding area in the stock"

Even though FPS rates may look the same from brand to brand, that may not always be the case. Hatsan tests this rating using lead pellets, but most competitors use lighter aluminum alloy pellets. What this means for you is that your Hatsan Striker 1000S .177 Caliber Air Rifle w/ 3-9x32mm Scope will deliver more knockdown power than an alloy-tested airgun with the same FPS rating.Hatsan airguns offer specialty features that come standard within the product line to provide shooters with a better shooting experience.

It is a high-quality firearm.

The gun is a compact, steel-framed semi-automatic. It is recoil operated, with Browning cam locking and short barrel recoil. Barrel muzzle is externally cone-shaped to achieve the best fit into the slide for improved accuracy. It has an ambidextrous safety that allows for ""cocked and locked"" carry (hammer is cocked and safey is applied). This is one of the smaller carry pistols but not the lightest. The solid steel construction makes these guns extremely sturdy and reliable, and additional weight greatly improves recoil control and makes the shooting quite comfortable."

This original barrel looks new and has had very little use if any, TE = 0.01 and MW = 0.01. There is a very small mark in barrel by chamber from a cleaning rod.

Stock has one stock bolt, a JFC inspector stamp (John F Coyle at Springfield 1905 - 1918, per Brophy) on left side by receiver (see picture). Stock has been lightly refinish and has two stock parts joined that is covered by the lower band (see next to last picture). I can see no cracks or splits in stock (very small piece of missing wood in front of trigger guard, see trigger guard picture). Stock is sturdy and is a very nice looking stock and handguard.

Some of the extras: Chaos quad rail, Chaos front and rear HK style sights, CSS tapco trigger kit, Saw grip, Tromix trigger guard, Tromix Charging handle, CSS modified BHO, CSS stock block, Ace folding stock, Ace folding stock adapter, CSS Barrel shroud, Archangel fore grip, rail covers, aftermarket spring and gas puck, MD arms adjustable gas plug, 8 rd. mag, 20 round drum, etc, etc.

Performance modifications: Gas ports opened and gauged, polished bolt, internals, and trigger parts (left the outside of the bolt black for looks).

 This thing cycles smooth as silk and will shoot the cheap low brass walmart value packs of birdshot (not many can do that without a hiccup)
