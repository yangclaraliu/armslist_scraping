This is a 1 1/2"" shooter all day with the cheap surplus ammo.  You must see the bore on this gun, you will not believe it is a Mosin barrel.  Bluing on barrel is a extremely well done, best I've seen on a 91/30.

I constantly buy old surplus guns (one's no longer with collective value) and sporterize them.  It is a hobby of mine, being a machinist, I love doing metalwork.

This is a very fun gun, you can take it to the range all day on the cheap, or take it out in the field with you on you're next out of state deer hunt.

175,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1903175,For Sale:  Cherokee Trail of Tears Tribute Rifle - America Remembers #1 Proto Proof,"Virginia Beach, Hampton Roads, Virginia","$ 5,000","Listed On: Thursday, September 19, 2013",Rifles,Winchester                                                                                ,30-30 Winchester                                                                                ,Lever Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a one of a kind Artist/Designer Proto Proof (prototype) it is the very first one made and numbered #1 of 300 - When America Remembers decides to commission a rifle or pistol the artist/designer will do an original piece called the Proto Proof, these are very rare, as the big wigs at America Remembers usually keep them and you never see them for sale anywhere. 
Now I'm not sure exactly how the process works at America Remembers.  But once they receive the original design they make changes to the original design and in most cases they make minor tweaks and/or design changes. However in this case the differences is quite substantial.  The differences between the proto proof (see my other auction for Cherokee Trail of Tears #2 of 300 or go to Americaremebers.com and look at the closed items) and the other 299 that were produced is that the entire receiver on the Proto Proof is 24k engraved where as the others have less than 20% coverage, the stock is a dark walnut finish vs a lot lighter wood/finish and plus the Porto Proof has hand etched checkering on the grip and the stock. Remember this is a one of a kind piece. It comes with all original paperwork the certificate of authenticity and original case and packaging. This working Winchester Model 94AE has never been handled has never had the lever action moved, the hammer cocked or the trigger pulled. It has been in a climate controlled vault since manufactured and never has been displayed. .

It was one of the darkest moments in American history. Disrespectfully uprooted from their ancestral lands, the Cherokee were herded like cattle into open stockades to await their forced westward exodus. So moved and saddened were those who witnessed the Cherokee's unimaginable suffering that their passage is known as the ""Trail of Tears.""  After the horrific forced march westward, the surviving Cherokee
people set to work to rebuild their lives. With perseverance and determination, they succeeded magnificently, and today the Cherokee are the second largest Indian tribe in the United States. ""Morning Tears"" by John Guthrie, a noted Cherokee Artist with many national awards to his credit. His work can be found in private collections and prestigious galleries throughout the United States. Today, America Remembers and the Museum of the Cherokee Indian, Cherokee, N.C., are honored to introduce this handsomely decorated firearm in special remembrance of all those who endured the saddest period in Cherokee history, and a tribute to the spirit and proud legacy of the Cherokee. 
The Cherokee Trail of Tears Tribute Rifle - Right
Right side of the receiver pays tribute to two of the most revered Cherokee leaders - Principal Chief John Ross, one of the Tribe's legendary leaders who carried the records and laws of the Cherokee Nation to the Oklahoma reservation and Stand Watie, who worked to establish the new homeland and later become a Civil War hero, the only Native American General in the Confederate Army. Also featured is a map illustrating the routes the Cherokee traveled across to Oklahoma, along with Sequoyah's translation of the word ""Cherokee."" Additionally, the Cherokee word ""Yunwiya,"" meaning people is featured.

The Cherokee Trail of Tears Tribute Rifle - Left
The left side of the receiver features a portrait of the statesman Sequoyah, whose creation of the Cherokee alphabet led to the remarkable literacy rate of his people. His portrait is flanked by two starkly contrasting scenes in Cherokee history - an image depicting the Cherokee working in the fields they loved and a touching image of the Cherokee moving west to Oklahoma on ""the trail where they cried.""

Cherokee Trail of Tears Tribute; The Tribute's lever, hammer, trigger, barrel bands, and hooded sight are polished and decorated in 24-karat gold. Hand-polished walnut stocks beautifully frame this handsome tribute to an exceptional people.

 Uncle Mikes Pro 3 Triple Retention Duty Holsters PRO-3 duty holster positively locks the gun to make snatching extremely difficult from the front, rear, top or side TRIPLE RETENTION DUTY HOLSTERS WITH PATENTED INTERNAL LOCK The emphasis on weapon retention in duty holsters is greater today than ever before, but this vital need to protect the gun must be balanced with the ability to draw the officer's weapon efficiently. PRO-3 duty holster positively locks the gun to make snatching extremely difficult from the front, rear, top or side. Yet, with a swift, simple motion, the officer can release the thumb break and draw the gun cleanly without the need to release any complicated system of snaps and straps. 

 AN INSIDE LOOK AT THE PRO-3 Three types of independent retention 
 1.Patented internal locking device 
 2.Retention strap/thumb break 
 3.Adjustable tensioning device 
 4.Patented laminated construction - either MIRAGEÂ® or CorduraÂ® nylon exterior, foam core and smooth nylon lining 
 5.Positive triggerguard stop positions gun the same way every time 
 6.Holster suspended within patented thermoplastic exo-skeleton for support, strength and rigidity 
 7.Non-stretch retention strap and molded thumb break stay open for easy, one-handed reholstering. Contoured thumb break discourages blading

The Taurus was purchased mew by me about 2 years ago. I have put maybe 150 rounds through it (mostly Winchester white box) and it has never had a malfunction. There is not a scratch on it and it is pristine. 

The S&W I got in trade. This gun is fantastic. The trigger is amazing and I have held very few guns that were as comfortable. It has Hogue grips and is not perfect cosmetically with a little holster wear on the end of the barrel, but I won't be sad if this gun doesn't get traded. It is wonderful, accurate, and functions flawlessly. It even sounds  (mechanically) like a gun is supposed to sound. This gun alone is worth a used Glock."

Like all of models in our XD® line, the XD-S™ has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol. Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) 

Trigger System™
The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.

Grip Safety
All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite® finish on all XD® models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S™ trademark it carries.

It's been cleaned after both times to the range, then put back into it's case. Never carried and shows very little sign of use, at all. 

I bought two new magazines and added Pierce Grip extensions to two of them. I also added Fiber Optic sights to the front and rear. I upgraded the spring to the Gen 4, dual recoil spring. Lastly, I bought a slug plug (Punisher logo) and replaced the factory rear slide with a custom Punisher one. If you don't like it, I still have the factory one that's all black.

This gun retails for $649 in 99% of gun shops. Yes, you can very find it cheaper than that, but not often. The mags are $30/each anywhere you go and the grip extensions are another $10/each. The sights are $75. After the math, you'll see this is no $500 Glock. 

I love this gun but I never fire it and have other options to carry, so I'm deciding to sell it. I'm open to trades, but it's only going to be for the right deal.."

It was offered ""bright polished"" in both the Government and Officers size by Colt, but never in the Commander size, ""I JUST HAD TO HAVE ONE!"" Colt charged $237.00 to complete the task, and it took 60 days before it was returned in one of their ""Colt Performance Center"" padded boxes. I have the box and paperwork, 2 mags, and I thought the Madagascar Ebony grips added such a nice touch to a ""one off gun"". I assure you there isnt another 1911 like this one on the planet. It is a beautiful gun with the upgrades, but heck it was a beautiful gun to begin with. I am moving away, and where I am going, I cant take my collection with me.

The ""Taurus Judge"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances where most altercations occur, or for longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sight, fiber optic front sight and Taurus Ribber Grips, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

It's only 2 weeks old, but after firing 4 mags through it, I realize that it just is too small for my big hands! I want VERY badly to love this and to bond with it, but it's just not going to happen. In addition to the mag that came with it, I bought a second mag for it that gives an extra round and a finger extension. Still...too small for my hands. It's the nitron finish with rosewood grips and is absolutely gorgeous! I'm looking to either sell, which is $100 less than I paid, or trade it on something else that's still a size that's conducive to concealed carry. It will have to equal what I paid if I trade in either cost of the gun, gun plus accessories or cash or something along those lines. It could also include ammo. My preference would be a carry sized 1911 in 9mm. In any case, I'm only interested in 9mm, but if it's a 1911, I may consider a carry sized .45 instead. Maybe a Glock 19 or something around that size. Email me and let's see what you have to offer. I'll get back to you even if to say thank you but I'm not interested. Have a great weekend!"

The only difference is the walnut stock and a raised cheek rest. This is an excellent rifle, and honestly it shoots more accurately than a 10/22 due to the microgroove barrel. Although Marlin doesn't advertise this series as being heavy barreled, it essentially is. I will include a half brick of ammunition, which is a mix of standard and hollow points. 

The rifle is in great condition. There are two minor dings, but other than that it looks brand new. This is a great varmint gun, or a great starter gun for children.

This will only be an in person face to face cash transaction.  I prefer to sell to somebody that has a CCW,  if you do not you must have a valid state driver's license and I must have a signature on a bill of sale only to promote proper transfer of such a weapon.  I need to make sure that everything is documented so that if the weapon was over used the wrong way it doesn't come back on me.  I am NOT looking to do a background check but just to make sure to cover myself.  If this is not OK with you please do not waste your time or mine.

The tac light is not included if your trading a shield 9 unless a little cash or ammo is involved. . I live in franklin and must meet close by. Trading for a shield should be a non issue or no brainier for you if your looking for a full size and gaining value. These guns go for a bit more than the shield in stores.
