Wood is original - no splits in stock and there's a longitudinal split in the wooden forend but it doesn't hurt the functionality - it's been there as long as I can remember. This was an Oklahoma red dirt 'barn gun' and is no collector queen for sure but does shoot OK. I've personally had this gun since the early 50's and it was my Grandad's before that - as far as I know he bought it new.

Only selling because I have decided to get a good quality 22lr semi-auto target style handgun. It is very accurate, dependable and these are very rare and hard to find because people keep them. Never had a ftf, fte, jams or any issues.
High Standard has been at the top for competition guns since 1952, used in the Olympics and for all around shooting. Longer barrel, light weight and very well balanced. Vented receiver, helps when shooting a lot of rounds and reduces malfunctions and keeps the receiver cleaner. Another unique feature is the receiver doesn't feed another round until you release the trigger.
This rifle is in excellent condition and will shoot 22longs, shorts and 22long rifle, any brand. It has been kept clean inside and out.

This is not the heavy varmint barrel, just to save you asking that question. Nevertheless it is a fine shooting gun. 
I took this gun to the range and ran half a box of CCI through it. Not one misfire or misfeed. Totally fun gun to shoot and really accurate groupings.

I can include a 3x9  40  Bushnell scope that came with it for an additional $40. Or you can buy your own. There are no sights on the gun, just mini-rails for mounting a scope.

Includes all documentation, original box for rifle, including wrench for trigger adjustment. Comes with one 5-round clip, which, once I dry lubed it worked easily and smoothly.

This rifle features the AccuTrigger, which is shooter-adjustable down to less than two pounds of pressure. Out of the box it is one of the smoothest triggers I have ever pulled. Butter smooth. If you are looking to get into a .17 caliber (ammo is still out there), then this is a sweet way to get introduced to the caliber.

The black composite stock is really sharp. The blued barrel is perfect.  The rifle also comes with sling mounts already installed.

 The SCAR family of rifles has served U.S. Special Operations Command units in the field for some time, and the Special Operations Combat Assault Rifle Heavy finally became available to consumers with the FN SCAR 17S.
A semi-automatic-only version of what's carried by active members of the military to this day, the SCAR 17S is chambered in .308 Win./7.62x51 mm NATO, making it larger and more powerful than the previously available SCAR 16S.
Adaptable, powerful and fun to shoot—and also the closest most civilians can come to military-level firearms—the FN SCAR 17S was an easy addition to the Gun of the Week series.
Technical Specifications:
Caliber: .308 Win./7.62x51 mm NATO 
Action Type: gas-operated, semi-automatic center-fire rifle 
Receiver: aluminum upper and polymer lower 
Barrel: 16¼"", cold-hammer forged, chrome-lined 
Rifling: six-groove, 1:12"" RH twist 
Magazine: 10- or 20-round detachable box 
Trigger Pull: non-adjustable, single-stage; 6 lbs., 5 ozs. 
Overall Length: 38.5"" (buttstock extended), 28.5"" buttstock folded 
Weight: 8 lbs.

This is a very awesome piece of history. It is the Remington / Elliot's model Over/ Under double Deringer (Yes, before the trademark required other manufactures to change the spelling) chambered in 41 short rim-fire. The batch # on the frame and barrel both show ""46"" which is a very low batch #! 
This was purchased directly from the owner that has owned it since the 1940's! Likely removed from an outlaw 50 years prior to that! Please watch the video to see more details about this West Plains Deputy Sheriff and his story!

ITEMS:
It comes with the firearm as well as the leather holster. 

FROM A REMINGTON HISTORIAN:
""Good afternoon sir,
Thank you for visiting Remington Country! We certainly appreciate you taking the time to write in with your question. You have a Model Number Three Double Deringer, Second Issue. It would have been chambered to 41 short rimfire, but I cannot guarantee that it still is chambered to that caliber. You would need to have a chamber cast done to verify. The number you found on you Deringer is not a serial number but in fact a batch number that was done for the pistols bearing ""Remington Arms Company Ilion,NY."" These particular Deringers were manufactured between 1888 and 1911 before Remington merged with the Union Metallic Cartridge Company to form Remington -UMC.""

This is a quality build on a nodak spud receiver that was professionally done. I believe the parts kit is polish. It has the nice little touches that the nicer built AKs have, like a recoil buffer and TAPCO G2 trigger, so it's easy on the shoulder and finger. I also have some magazines that I can trade with it if I need to. I also have ammunition to trade if switching calibers.

Just purchased this month at local dealer, and I have receipts to prove. Still in new condition. Save by buying a new firearm without background check fee's, sales tax, and new firearm price. This firearm is the same length and height of the popular Kel Tec PF9, but holds 10+1 rounds instead of the 7+1 that the only very slightly smaller PF9 holds. The P11 also is able  to use Smith&Wesson 15 round magazines (unlike the PF9).

No problems with the firearm, but I just have my sights on another firearm. Face to face cash only transaction please. More pictures coming soon.

KEL-TEC CNC INDUSTRIES 

The Kel-Tec P-11 is one of the smallest and lightest 9mm made. Thanks to it's locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially suited for plain clothes police officers or as a secondary weapon for military personnel. All machined components are also made on modern high speed computerized equipment. Equally advanced quality control equipment and test procedures ensure a firearm with uncompromising quality in materials and workmanship.

Would trade for .223, Saiga 410, or small utility trailer...

The time has come sell my M109R. This things is a beast! Just over 6900 miles, 1783cc's, 8-valve DOHC, liquid cooled V-Twin engine. This thing has MASSIVE torque which means when you roll on that throttle you better hold on.

I bought it with 1200 miles on it and it was completely stock. This is what I've done:

- Less than 200 miles on brand new Dunlop 250 rear tire
- Debadged (took all the decals and stickers off to give it a more clean look.)
- TRE installed
- Fender Eliminator
- Under the tail LED Rear Blinkers
- Front LED Blinkers (De-lolipopped it. Means I took off the original ugly blinkers)
- Professional Paint job on front headlight cowl
- Custom Freedom Performance Exhaust (nice deep & loud Growl)
- Cobra PowerPro fuel injection management System
- Spiked Air Intake
- BadBoy Air Horn
- Universal RAM cell phone & GPS holder
- Also comes with passenger seat, a skid lid, and full helmet (not pictured)


This bike is a beast! Since I debadged it I get a lot of compliments and ""What is that? Is it a Harley? Is it a Victory?"" No its a Zuki :-) Just as fast and more torque for a fraction of the price. There is a reason when you type M109R into the search engine on CL not many come up for sale. This is the best bike I've ever owned and a lot of fun and I get a lot of looks. 

$8000 or best reasonable offer - you can find a stock one for 6500-8000 and put the $2000+ of mods into it or buy one ready to ride; no hassle no install!  would also consider trade for a small utility trailer + cash. I am willing to wheel and deal a little (that's why it says best offer), but low ballers and scammers don't bother. No I won't ship to your brother who is a foreign exchange student in Zimbabwe. 

MUST have motorcycle endorsement on DL for test rides and insurance. No Joy Rides!

I am the original owner (purchased mid-2012) and the rifle is in excellent condition. This gun is dead nuts reliable. I have shot with guys who AR .22lr conversions, dedicated .22lr uppers, AR-style .22lr rifles and Ruger 10/22's, and none of those are as reliable as this 15-22. This rifle feeds, ignites, extracts and ejects flawlessly. If you enjoy shooting rimfire, you will absolutely love this rifle.

I have fed this gun ammo that wouldn't feed or ignite in friends' rifles and this puppy ate it up without hesitation. It is not ammo picky! No need to buy expensive rimfire ammo. It devours Federal bulk.

And since it has the same controls (including bolt lockback on last shot) and breaks down like an AR15 (upper and lower held together by two takedown pins), it makes for a great training platform for the AR but with much cheaper ammo.

Includes one 25rd mag, and I can throw in additional mags for $18 apiece.

I've tried this a couple times already, and for reasons unknown, people are still trying to get away with panic pricing.

This like new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in my opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

Comes with all accessories, including case, mags, and grips."

Slide Fire Solutions' ground breaking ""Slide Fire Stock"" technology and ergonomic design provide individuals the ability to bump fire more safely, offering another element of entertainment for recreational shooters everywhere! You can now safely and accurately bump-fire your AR-15 at an incredible rate. Each SSAR-15 comes with a Hex Key to remove the factory pistol grip, Interface Block, SSAR-15 Rifle Stock, and Installation / Operation Instructions. Every SSAR-15 stock has a Lifetime Warranty from the manufacturer covering defects in materials and workmanship.

Applying principles that have been used for over 40 years to Bump Fire, this new radical design ensures the operator can hold the rifle correctly without compromising their own safety or the safety of others around them. Unlike when bump firing from the hip; the SSAR-15 allows the shooter to properly aim the rifle. In addition, the shooter must push forward to discharge each round, as a result, the shooter corrects their point-of-aim for each shot discharged instead of allowing recoil to push the muzzle upward.

The primary difference between the SSAR-15 SBS™ and the SSAR-15 OGR™ is the design intent. In an effort to cater to varying consumer preferences, the SSAR-15 SBS™ is designed to resemble current combat rifle stocks. In addition, the SSAR-15 SBS™ was designed with multiple accessories in mind which will be available in the near future."

 I was told that this gun fired off one mag about 25 years ago-And after seeing this gun I believe it, this could pass as never fired. After slowly, carefully stripping it down I've found most of the springs were just hardened stiff-and there was very little powder residue on the feed ramp. I cleaned it all out lubed it up and replaced all the springs with a set of Wilson Combat springs-a standard set-not competition springs. And that's it-everything else is original. As you can see the gun is flawless- If you didn't know better you would think it was never fired. Forget the fact that its not only a collectible gun-with a cool box-Its a mint Colt 1911 built in 1970-that feels and looks like a new one-and you can run it at the range-along with your other guns.

The Model 600 came out in 1964 and was produced in what were the first commercial short magnums, the 6.5mm Remington Magnum and the .350 Remington Magnum. The magnum models also introduced the first laminated stock supplied on a factory rifle. A standard model with a walnut stock was also produced in the more pedestrian .308, .243, 6mm, .222, .223 and .35 Remington calibers. Possibly the new carbine length rifle with its 18.5"" barrel, along with the new short magnum cartridges and laminated stock, was just too much for the shooting public to accept all at one time. Well, that and the recoil and muzzle blast that the .350 unleashed on an innocent shooting public."

It's a great piece, but it turns out I just like my .40 better.  You never know till you try though.  

Comes with all the originals as pictured.  The only thing that is different is the paddle holster that came with it.  I left that on the bedside table and apparently the dogs thought it was a fun toy (the gun was NOT in it at the time of course).  So the one end of that holster is a little chewed up, but nobody uses that dinky little thing anyway so let's not pretend that's a big deal. 

$550 obo. Comes with a box (25 rounds) of Hornady Critical Defense 135 grain +P if asking price is met. 

Possible PARTIAL trade for home defense shotgun.  Not looking for some tricked out, just something simple and reliable. 

Must have CCW or Pistol Purchase Permit.

I got this gun in a trade recently, with a couple problems with the hop up and compression, I have since fixed those problems and put the rifle up for sale, I don't care to play a sniper role and I want the money to spend towards a different gun. I put a scope from my .22 on it and have not sighted in, the mag does not leak, I have lubed the oring and a small amount of gas has been left in it to preserve the oring, the mag does not leak.i do not have any gas to test the gun further, but u are welcomed to bring ur own gas to test functionality.

I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

It is not import marked and has a ground mum.  Stock is dark with bumps and dings but no cracks.  The stock has shrunk some near the buttplate and does not exactly mate up perfectly.   There is one small crack about 2 inches along the top of the handguard near the front sight.  Metal is in very good condition with some finish loss/patina along the receiver and near the bayonet mount but no rust or pitting.  Bore is quite good and this is a very good shooter from my experience at 100 yards.  It has a folding bayonet and fixed 5 round magazine.  This is a first variation bayonet (of the 3 variations) and probably been around since the 20's-30's.  Also most likely a vet bringback though I cannot verify this.  I cannot determine if this is a matching numbers rifle as I believe these are matched thru an assembly number located under the receiver.  I am not willing to disassemble.  The bolt numbers do not match the receiver or the bayonet mount.  This is a nice opportunity to own one of these rare carbines.  Please...no trades on this one...looking for cash transaction only.  Will consider a reasonable offer and be willing to drive a short distance to meet/make the deal.  I have several other Japanese rifles I may be looking to sell as well.  One Type 38 6.5MM and a couple of type 99 7.7MM.  Also one or two last ditch type 99 in 7.7MM.  All have ground mums and most are non matching..but are in good shape.

The SR-22lr Ruger semi-auto pistol I purchased is about as particular as they come when it comes to what it feeds nicely. I continually had fail to feed with this firearm using both of these particular rounds. They worked flawlessly in a Ruger rifle so maybe someone who does a lot of rifle shooting can use these right now..

Getting out what I paid for them. Nothing more as long as I don't have to travel further then Cabellas in Rogers.

I'll probably just find a used 22 rifle to use these on if I can't get that..

Will also come with extra carlsons M835 cylinder .774 choke for steel or hevi-shot. I'm firm on 280.00 cash.
