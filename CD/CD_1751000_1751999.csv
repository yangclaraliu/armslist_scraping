The laser is activated by a small switch on the left side of the stock. This rifle has had about 1000 rounds through it give or take a few.

This gun is meticulously cleaned after every trip to the range and has been well loved. Some minor scratches here and there i can send pictures. This is truly a very cool firearm to own and so much fun to shoot! Comes with factory lock and a case and the red dot sight in the picture and factory mag.

This is the hard to find Hi-Capacity Bersa 380. Its basic design is that of a Walther PPK, a proven German pistol with strikingly handsome looks. Going beyond the PPK, It features an amazing 15+1 capacity, Satin Nickel Finish,a factory Hogue-like rubber grip instead of the plastic ones on most 7-shot Pistols. It has twice the capacity of most 380's which solves the problem of insuficient capacity, multiple bad guys, etc, or being forced to pack an extra magazine with you"

This grade is rare and is only available occasionally in limited quantities. Because of the scarcity of these rifles, they will only be sold on the CMP auction site.

By Far the most advanced composite AR 15 lower on the market today, and at a price anyone can afford. Formed from a blend of scientifically advanced materials, the PCF C-15 lowers have proven to be among the lightest, most durable composite lowers available today. And because they are molded from a solid color, finish ware and scratches are a thing of the past. 

Every lower is shipped with the accu-group composite fire control system, a market first in the AR 15 world, and offer a 4.5lb to 5.0lb trigger pull with zero perceived creep, an ultra crisp let off, and incredibly fast lock up times. These lowers also feature a reversible safety to accommodate right or left hand shooters. 

Still want more? How about a six position buffer tube and slider (commercial)? If that’s not enough, how about the fact that this lower will except any milspec upper and offers an 8% elongation factor, giving it a zero slop fit? No more wedging the back of your lower with extra parts! 

A nice inexpensive light lower option at 1LB, 11oz compared to 2lb, 3oz of a similarly equipped forged lower."

advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the
best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with
full-size Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger
pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly
larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger
gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911
will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in

The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits.


The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld.

Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions.

The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. During transport the stock folds and locks onto the bolt handle maintaining the same rifle width whether folded or extended.

Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle's length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button.

From its quick-detach sling mounts to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color that blends into any environment - every detail of the MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle you can truly make your own.

The reason for its popularity is because it shoots great, looks great and is remarkably affordable - about half the price of the competition's rifles.

The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself.

It was designed by John Browning in 1894 and originally chambered to fire two metallic black powder cartridges, the .32-40 Winchester and .38-55 Winchester. It was the first rifle to chamber the smokeless powder round, the 30 WCF, for Winchester Center Fire. This round was later chambered by Marlin which designated it the .30-30, which used the black powder cartridge nomenclature of using the caliber as the first number and the grains of black powder as the second. Marlin used this nomenclature so as to not promote its competitor's products.[1] The 30-30 name finally became synonymous with the cartridge and Winchester ultimately dropped the 30 WCF nomenclature. The 1894 was produced by Winchester Repeating Arms Company through 1980 and then by U.S. Repeating Arms under the Winchester brand until they ceased to manufacture rifles in 2006. The rifles are back in production today, being made by the Miroku company of Japan and imported into the United States by the Browning Arms company of Morgan, Utah.

The Model 1894 has been referred to as the ""ultimate lever-action design"" by firearms historians such as RL Wilson and Hal Herring. The Model 1894 is the rifle credited with the name ""Winchester"" being used to refer to all rifles of this type and was the first commercial sporting rifle to sell over 7,000,000 units.[2]

The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly.

Berreta Info: 

The new Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semiautomatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability.
Manufactured in three calibers, the Px4 Storm uses an exclusive Beretta designed innovative locked-breech with a rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. 
The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass. Modular structure, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts make the Px4 Storm the ideal firearm for law-enforcement use, as well as personal defense.
1. Accessory Rail: The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MILSTD-1913 rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices.
2. Slide: The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in both wet or dry conditions.

Other PX4 Accessories 3. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is
located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
4. 3-Dot Sight System: Features a white ‘3-dot’ sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in
an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
5. Ambidextrous Safety (Type F): The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. (NOTE: Type C does not have an external safety/decocking lever). Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
6. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of
misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
7. Individual Size Grips: Pistol may be configured with small, medium or large backstraps to individually fit the hand of each shooter. The backstraps are checkered to ensure a firm grip in both wet or dry shooting conditions. Three backstraps included with every pistol.
8. Reversible Magazine Release: Multiple-sized, reversible magazine release buttons allow for customization to the individual’s hand size. Small size comes standard on the gun, while medium and large buttons are available as accessories and easy replacement. Each size may be positioned for right-handed or left-handed use. 

9. Simple Field Stripping: Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental
dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
10. Light Technopolymer Frame: The light, yet durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of Corrosion resistant fiberglass reinforced polymer.
11. Barrrel: The Px4’s unique rotating barrel and locking system dissipates recoil energy radially, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise. This is the strongest Beretta pistol action. Chrome lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.

I also have 2,200 rounds of surplus also in spam cans. All 147gr. 2 russian spam cans, 3 Bulgarian. (440rds ea. X 5 = 2,200). Plus I have another 50 or so rounds laying around

- 10 or so (not exactly sure have to find them and count) stripper clips

- scope mount and a Long Eye Relief (LER) scope that you could mount on the rear iron sights.

500 for the ammo (will not separate the ammo) - ammo cans online will cost you about 210 for 2 and 110 for one (checked a few retailers). With the amount I have, that will cost you 530 and that IS NOT including shipping (so probably up near 600 after shipping). The ammo is definitely worth it, Surplus is becoming harder to find, and a box of 20 Winchester 7.62x54r will cost about 30 (so do the math to get to 2200 rounds)

 125 for the gun (scope and such included)

 so 625 I think is reasonable. However, like always, I am willing to negotiate.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

The PMAG 20 GEN M3 features a long-life USGI-spec stainless steel spring for commonality, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

In addition to enabling more precise sighting, the LaserMax sight integrates two Picatinny rail surfaces for attachment of additional accessories, such as a tactical light or infrared laser. Available exclusively through Ruger, the new 10/22 laser product represents another successful collaboration aimed at delivering the very best in high-tech products to Ruger’s loyal customer base. 



The Ruger 10/22 is a semi-automatic rimfire rifle chambered in .22 LR. Immensely popular for its simple construction, user-friendly handling characteristics, negligible recoil and inexpensive ammunition, this carbine has been in constant production since making its debut in 1964. Many variations exist today and the new LaserMax sight was designed to work in concert with all models featuring a barrel band, including the popular 10/22 Takedown® model, which easily disassembles into barrel/forend and action/buttstock subassemblies for compact storage and transportation. The LaserMax laser system adds less than 2 ounces and is constructed from rugged FRN (Fiberglass Reinforced Nylon), chosen to withstand rough handling and exposure to the elements.



The bright red 635 nm continuous wave laser is actuated by LaserMax’s signature Controlled Activation™ switch, which prevents premature or inadvertent activation of the laser. It comes “out of the box” ready with factory pre-alignment for POA/POI at 25 yards and a supplied tool allows user adjustments to windage and elevation. A single 1/3N Lithium cell battery provides two hours of continuous run time and replacement batteries can be purchased directly from LaserMax for about $5 each. All LaserMax lasers are covered by a newly extended 5-year warranty. Kurt Worden, LaserMax VP of Commercial Sales, was apt to point out that, “Ruger came to LaserMax because they wanted to deliver the finest laser sighting technology available.  Working in concert with Ruger’s firearm designers yielded an incredibly successful outcome and a product that both companies are very proud of.” Scheduled to begin shipping in late January, the Ruger 10/22 Carbine with LaserMax will be priced at $399 MSRP. Ruger will also off er the 10/22 laser separately for $129.95 MSRP.

465,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1751465,For Sale:  AR15 AR-15 Adams Arms  A3 Tactical Elite Piston Upper,"New Albany, Indiana, United States",$ 900,"Listed On: Thursday, September 11, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This Adams Arms Tactical Elite Mid-Length Gas Piston Upper Assembly is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO and comes ready to fire right out of the box after installation onto any standard AR-15 lower receiver. It features a melonite finished, 16"" government contour barrel with a 1 in 7"" twist, making it capable of stabilizing medium- to heavy-weight projectiles of up to about 77 grains. The Mid Tactical Elite upper configuration comes equipped with a free floating, 12"" Samson STAR-M-EX-P Quad Rail Handguard that extends to surround the picatinny rail piston gas block on its bottom and both sides for additional rail space. Together, the forged A3 flat-top upper and handguard create a long, uninterrupted top rail interface with ample room for mounting optics and/or iron sights. Additional features include a mid length gas system for a longer sight radius and smoother recoil impulse, M4 feed ramps to help ensure reliable feeding and functioning during rapid strings of fire, an A2 flash hider, bolt carrier group and charging handle assembly. The upper's barrel has been finished inside and out with Adams Arms' proprietary QPQ Melonite treatment that bonds with the metal on a molecular level. Also referred to as salt bath nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, extending a barrel's service life by reducing the friction produced inside the bore upon firing for a net decrease in bore surface wear over time. Nitriding converts the barrel steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. The end result is a barrel that's capable of producing accuracy on par with a match stainless steel tube, while also exhibiting the longevity and resilience of a chrome lined, mil-spec barrel. All Adams Arms uppers feature a short stroke gas piston operating system, which prevents hot gas and debris from being directed back into the action upon firing. The result is a rifle that runs cooler, cleaner and more reliably than those utilizing a standard direct gas impingement system of operation. To ensure that damage doesn't occur to the buffer tube from carrier tilt, the bolt carrier is equipped with enlarged ""skis"" to help guide it into the receiver extension. The bolt carrier's solid steel, 1-piece construction incorporates an integral piston strike face to guarantee integrity over time, while the bolt assembly is spring loaded for proper lock-up and to help reduce bolt bounce and cam pin wear. All piston components are finished in QPQ Melonite for corrosion resistance and easy cleaning/maintenance.

Huldra - made by Adams Arms

Huldra's Adams Arms patented piston system technology will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride meloniting process, making them harder than hard chrome.

The melonited corrosive resistant CrMoV (Chrome-Moly-Vanadium) 4150 barrels provides excellent coating uniformity and no tolerance build up in the barrel to create deviation. Our melonited barrels have higher lubricity, last longer and are just plain tougher than chrome lining. The barrel chambers are speed polished reducing resistance on the cartridge entering and exiting the chamber. The upper and lower receivers are machined from high quality mil-spec 7075-T6 aluminum forgings, with critical tooling dimensions held within ±.001"" and Type III Hardcoat finished. The mil-spec buffer tube is precision machined from 7075-T6 aluminum as well. The magwell front features recessed chevrons for improved control.

Cannondale Moto 5 (MSRP $2399.99) - Pick the adjective of choice for the Moto: Burly. Brawny. Beautiful. Bump-aliscious. For all-mountain riders on steeper terrain, the Moto shines. Revolutionary floating shock technology gobbles up baby-head sized rocks, and delivers premium suspension performance. Ultra-stiff bottom bracket shell resists torsional stress and the sloppy flex that takes away from the riding experience.
HATCHET DRIVE

Cannondale's engineers break rear shock stiction faster and have re-oriented shock forces in the frame with the floating shock of the Hatchet Drive for better real-world riding performance. Why call it the Hatchet Drive? The links look just like a hatchet. Go check it out.
PIVOT PLACEMENT

The lower pivot location - above and ahead of the BB shell creates a favorable angle of attack in the suspension motion ratio. This creates a bike with excellent pedaling performance and a suspension ratio curve with 160 mm of true travel.
ASYMETRIC STAYS AND PIVOTS

For the ultimate in power transfer and resistance to energy-sapping torsional flex, the Moto's chainstays and swingarm pivot are asymmetrically shaped. The designs also optimize our desire to shave unneeded weight.

Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 are made of high-strength polymer and are designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. The estimated retail price for the 416 rifle is $559.

I am selling one of my rifles. I can consistently hits at 500yds at the COSSA range. I built this for hunting and some competition. Round count is at 88. Weatherby guarantees .99 MOA, best I have done is .89MOA with factory Nosler ammo, I have done better with my handloads. The gun shoots 165/168gr Nosler Accubonds amazingly and loves the 155gr even more. I bought the gun new, it has and EGW base, Warne rings, Vortex Diamondback 4x12 with BDC reticle scope (lifetime warranty), two stage adjustable trigger, Butler Creek flip up scope covers, bipod, sling, action has been worked (smoother and tighter), plastic follower replaced with metal one. Custom paint job, butt of stock has been filled to make more rigid, and it has two sling swivel studs in the forend (for bipod and sling). Also will come with an almost full box of Nosler Accubond Trophy Grade custom ammunition (17 New rounds). Selling because it just sits in the safe, I tend to take one of my other rifles hunting and shoot 3 gun matches so don’t need a precision rifle. Selling for $1050 OBO, Would consider partial trade (up to $450 value) for Marlin lever action in .30-30 with safety, bolt action or lever .308/7mm-08, 22"" barrel maximum.  Cash only, FTF, must have valid Oregon DL and be legal to own a firearm, will provide bill of sale.

Authentic in looks, feel, and operation, this replica MP5 is engineered as a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It’s built in Germany with a match grade precision barrel, metal receiver, MP5 standard forearm, and retractable stock. It also has a NAVY pistol grip as well as HK-style sights and an imitation 3-lug flash suppressor to maintain authenticity. The compensator is attached so that the 16.1 inch barrel extends the full length of the gun and compensator.

The magazine is made of high-strength polymer and is designed with grips for the spring on both sides making it simple to load. A 25- and 10-round version of the magazine is available. Both are proportionate in size to the centerfire version’s mag to maintain the authentic look of the 9mm MP5s magazine. The estimated retail price for the MP5 A5 is $475.
