This is not an Olympic Arms Wolverine. 	

This is an original Whitney Wolverine pistol manufactured by Whitney Firearm, Inc., New Haven Conn. in Oct. 1956. It is S/N 30,XXX and comes with the original box numbered to the gun and a factory instruction sheet/parts list. The frame is cast from Alcoa #380 aluminum and it does not have “Wolverine” on the right side.

The pistol is in very nice condition. There is a nice contrast between the dark gray main frame and the gloss black barrel shroud. There is very little in the way of storage or handling marks on the finish. The grips are nice and sharp with no edge chipping.

It is excellent mechanically and the bore is bright with no pitting. It’s doubtful if the pistol has ever been fired.

The box is original and not in great condition. The Alcoa Aluminum sticker is still in place on the bottom of the box. The interesting thing about the box is the “Klein’s” stickers. Klein’s was a mail order house in Chicago. Not only did they handle this pistol but they sold Lee Harvey Oswald the Carcano rifle used to assassinate John F. Kennedy.

Buyer pays $30 shipping."

The quality rivals custom built rifles. With a 1/2 moa GUARANTEE how much better can you get!! Heck some higher dollar manufacturers or even CUSTOM builders don't even offer that good of guarantee on a semi auto rifle. ----------- Now down to the details. ----- Billet upper and lower, made from 7075-T6 aluminum with type 3 anodize ----- Bolt carrier group has been nickel boron coated for easier cleaning. ----- Now the trigger group is VERY nice! It's a single stage with hardly no creep and has been nickel boron coated as well ----- The carbon fiber handguard helps keep weight down. There is plenty of attachment points for other accessories as well. Carbon fiber is also less heat sensitive, meaning in hot or cold weather your hand will not get as cold or hot as if it were holding onto one made of aluminum.----- Magpul ACS stock ----- Ergo grip ----- A match grade 18"" fluted barrel is used. It's threaded 5/8x24 and is melonited for added barrel life. AGAIN .5 moa is guaranteed from the factory! The gas tube and gas block are even melonited. ----- Comes with one 19 round mag that has been rhino coated, that's a coating that has a non-slip texture to it.

I am selling my .50 Knight Disc rifle. It is the one that takes the orange discs. The only blemishes are a little bit of rust on the frame under the bolt and there is a little corrosion inside the barrel just past the breach plug where the powder sits. These are very small spots.
I would like $175 + shipping for the rifle, rings, tools, some bullets, and just a few discs. I also have the book and fiberoptic sights that came with it somewhere.
I would like to keep the 3-9x40 Nikon Buckmaster scope, but if someone wants both we might work it out.

The sight does not affect the accuracy. Along with the rifle it comes with a 10 round magazine. I'm looking to either sell or trade it.

This AR was built with quality parts and I'm only asking for what I have into it. The matched upper and lower lock in very tight, tighter than any AR I've owned. Here is a list of what it has:

- JP Enterprises adjustable gas block (.750 diameter)
- Spikes branded mid length FN 14.5"" 5.56 barrel with pinned and welded BCM Mod 1 compensator for legal length.
- Spikes bolt carrier and bolt
- Magpul MOE Mid length hand guard. This was FDE but I dyed it black.

- DPMS mid length gas tube, delta ring and barrel nut
- Magpul MIAD grip 
- DPMS LPK
- Phase 5 Tactical winter trigger guard
- Magpul UBR stock
- Voodoo tactical single point bungee sling

I'll even throw in three unused but opened C-Products mags and your choice of either a NIW GenII Windowed PMAG or a GenIII non windowed PMAG. 

I have only put 180 rounds through this rifle. It is very accurate and has an awesome balance to it. I won't be sad if it doesn't sell, just trying to use this as a catalyst to fund other projects. I don't need to sell so no low ball offers please.

The coyote finish on this rifle is somewhat iffy. It's very thick and has a tendency to chip from pins and such moving around. Most that damage is already done though (from take down and such). I bought the upper and lower done this way and am not certain what was used. The finish is still in pretty good shape though. Also, due to the finish being so thick, I had to sand the finish under the Larue rear sight for it to sit flush. I had planned to strip it and have it redone once it got to a point where it started looking ugly. It's far from that point though. It's really not as bad as I make it sound but I like to disclose issues to buyers as I'm not here to push garbage in others laps. Simply trying to fund other projects.


Only trade I'd be interested in is another non-poly lower, complete or stripped(plus cash obviously).

Would prefer a FTF sale. Must be willing to show a valid state issued ID to verify age and residency. If you're from Denver city or county, I cannot include the magazines. Please let me know if you are ahead of time and we'll work on a price without the mags I'm offering.

Feel free to e-mail me via the site with any questions.

The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, softshooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) and bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for lefthanded shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

Fully serviced and shooting like a champion. The action is incredibly smooth, the head space is perfect and the bore is in great shape.

It has been stripped of cosmoline and given a light sanding. I have not yet replaced a finish on the rifle so it is still 'raw' Chu wood ready for the finish of your choice. This is without question one of the best Type 53's I have encountered to date. Like 99.99% of these encountered, there is no cleaning rod but any 30/30 cleaning kit will work just fine.

If you are a fan of the T-53's you'll know finding one with a stock and barrel in good shape is tough to do, add all matching numbers to that, add the matching numbered stock and you come up with a pretty uncommon piece to say the least.

My camera died last week and I have no way to take pics just now. All I can say is I know these models & this one is one any milsurp collector would be proud to own.

Face to face trades only in Camdenton/Linn Creek. I live in a rural area so you will have the opportunity to shoot it a few times & see what you think."
