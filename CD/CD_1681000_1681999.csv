This holster uses belt loops at the front and rear to pull your handgun tight against your body for better concealment. The angle this holster positions your handgun allows faster drawing with full combat grip, more comfortable wearing, and much safer use.
A regular Small of the Back (SOB) holster places your gun over the base of the spine. A fall or hard blow with your gun in that position could cause serious spinal cord injury. This holster is engineered for kidney carry to avoid that danger.
Made of waterproof foam for a comfortable carry and to protect gun from moisture. Lined on both sides with rugged Cordura® nylon for durability and a smooth, fast draw. Webbing inside the holster protects your gun’s sights and keeps holster partially open for easier re-holstering. 
Great for use while driving. Comes with an adjustable thumb break to keep gun secure. Fits belts up to 1½” wide. Made in the USA."

This certificate which has been signed by the original purchaser, will entitle you to 1, 4-day class in; Defensive Handgun, Tactical Shotgun or Practical Rifle. If you prefer, you can take a friend and split the training with them by using the certificate for 2, 2-day classes as long as you both take the same class. 

There is a $50 background investigation fee payable at the time of registration which is not included in this certificate. That is the only money you will be asked for at Front Sight unless you rent equipment from them which I would recommend. They will rent you the necessary equipment for the classes for $100 for the 4-day class. Ammunition is of course extra.

Check out the Front Sight website and think about making a trip with some friends. Splitting expenses like fuel and rooms will make the trip very affordable. 

Just remember, you can only use one of these certificates once. After that you either pay the full $2000 or join the resort. The 2-day classes are great but the 4-day class is much more than twice as much. The days are around 12 hours long, but they fly by. The instructors are the most informed, practical and intelligent trainers I have ever encountered. The facilities are first rate and everyone involved is professional in every way.

Front Sight offers different certificates and promotions from time to time for other classes and things. Sometimes I have those available. If there is something Front Sight related that you desire or need, just ask. I might have something available that will fill your need.

I have several different types of firearms training opportunities available in my other auctions.  Please take a look at my other auctions."

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue G-10 Piranha grips in black and grey provide maximum grip and a distinctive look."

Answers to most frequent questions:
- Gun is in great condition, with less than 500 rounds through it, and very minor wear.

- No, gun does NOT have a de-cocker because it is the law enforcement series, but one can be easily put on there for about $40-50(as I was informed by a gun dealer). 

- And yes, the gun can easily be converted to .40cal, by simply buying a .40cal barrel.

Barrel Length: 20""   Type of Finish: Blue  Finish Originality: Factory Original
Sights / Optics: This shotgun is mounted with a center rib and a single brass bead at the muzzle 
Stock Configuration & Condition: The stocks are lightly finished checkered wood. There is just a bit of wear and thinning, but almost no marking. The LOP measures 14 ½” from the front of the trigger to the back of the plastic butt plate. The stocks rate in excellent overall condition.   Bore Condition: The bore is bright. There is no erosion.
Overall Condition: This shotgun retains about 95% of its metal finish. The balance of the finish shows just a bit of thinning at the edges. The shotgun shows very little use. The screw heads are sharp. The markings are crisp. Overall, this shotgun rates in about excellent condition.   Box, Paperwork & Accessories: None
Mechanics: The action functions properly. I have fired four rounds through this shotgun, and it performed flawlessly. 
Assessment: Here is a good shotgun for cowboy action shooting, home defense, and general purpose shotgun fun. The 20"" barrels and 3"" chambering make it the all-purpose side-by-side.  Safety: safety slide behind the breech release. 
     You can buy one new, but not with this 50 year old, beautiful walnut wood stock.  She looks like, and shoots like new!  The 12 gauge Magnum is devastating.  It will decimate whatever it hits!  Short enough for home defense, close-quarters or gorgeous enough to hang over the fireplace…until needed.  Buyer pays $30, for shipping and handling.

The gun was manufactured in 1897.  This was determined using the serial number.  The gun is in perfect operating condition and good condition appearance wise.  It has been in my family since it was purchased new.

This gun also has a history behind it that is unsavory but factual and a part of my family history.  My great great grandpa shot and killed a man with this gun.  He spent most of his life in prison.  I don't know too many details about the incident but we have his prison records and the story that has been passed down.  My father (age 85) told me that the gun has only been fired a few times in the last 100 years.  Amunition is still available online and I have found boxes of 20 rounds between $40 and $80.

Although an appraiser has not seen the gun, I have spoken with one over the phone and described the gun and condition to him.  He told me that without seeing the gun in person, the best he can estimate it's value is between $4500 and $7500.

I have two pictures of the gun.  I can take and send more for anyone that is seriously interested.  In the one picture, it is the 3rd one from the right.  I would like offers from serious individuals only.  I will only accept cash.  I am located in Kenosha.

Up for sale, 500 rounds of Santa Barbara military surplus 9mm Largo ammunition (AKA 9x23mm). Loads are 128gr FMJ.
I bought it back when I thought I'd be buying a Star Modelos Super.
Plans changed and I no longer need the ammo, so I'm trying to get rid of it now. The brass is in super condition--zero corrosion. You'd never know they were loaded in the 60's.

The rounds come in 25rd boxes. $175 for the lot ($8.75/box) or $10 per box separated.
FTF preferred, as much as possible. If you want to cover shipping, I might consider mailing it."

It has ambidextrous selector lever/magazine release, adjustable/removable, flip-up sights, adjustable/folding, butt-stock, cheek-stock and plenty of picatinny rails, for your accessories/optics.  Don’t forget the free-floating, 16 inch, chrome-lined barrel. Oh, and the charging handle can be mounted on either side.  The weapon came with one steel 20rd magazine and cable lock.  There are three more steel and two more, polymer 20rd magazines.  None have even been loaded!  Included are four, 50 round boxes of Magtech; .308 WIN cartridges.  This is a tactical weapon with the right optics, (and shooter), can easily hit 1,000 yard targets.  Without optics, the max effective range for a point target is 700 meters and the round is still very affective.  A .223/5.56mm loses effectiveness at much shorter ranges.  Made in the USA!

This is the Romak 991 model. It comes with gorgeous laminate wood thumbhole stock and forearm furniture. It is used and has some signs of use; however it is in great shape for its age. I have owned this rifle for a number of years and have enjoyed it the entire time, never had one issue with it. It is extremely dependable, lightweight, and easy to clean. The iron sights are dead on up to about 200 yards, and maybe further. I don't have anywhere to shoot further than 200 yards. I recently purchased a Sig Sauer 556r and it's time to find this AK a new home, although I hate to see it go. This rifle comes with the following:

- (2) 75 round high capacity drum magazines (these things are both fun and expensive)
- Sturdy adjustable sling
- Bump fire enabled trigger attachment (allows you to easily use the semi-auto recoil of the rifle to shoot in ""full auto"". Attachment can easily be removed, if desired)
- 75 rounds of 7.63x39 ammo
- Hard carry case (holds both the rifle and both drum magazines)
- I have a regular (30 round???) magazine for this rifle somewhere. If I can find it, it's included as well.
- Plenty of additional ammo available for purchase if needed.

Price - $800 OBO for everything. This is a steal; you will not be disappointed with this rifle and the drum magazines. Will not separate, package deal only. Must be at least 18 yrs. old and have an Ohio ID. FTF sales only, no shipping. CCW owners preferred. Willing to meet in, or around, the Akron area. Although I'm not looking for any trades, feel free to try me. Will only consider high end optics and higher end semi-auto pistols for trade. Not opposed to adding cash for the right deal."

The Chiappa 1911-22 standard black model is a rimfire replica of the most well-known firearm designed by John Browning, the M1911. The original M1911 was a single-action, semiautomatic pistol chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge. It was the standard-issue sidearm for the United States armed forces from 1911 to 1985, and is still carried by some U.S. forces today.

The Chiappa 1911-22 features the same weight and handling characteristics of the original M1911. However, with Chiappa's 1911-22, the action has been redesigned to utilize a fixed barrel design and it chambers .22LR ammunition. The result is a very high-accuracy firearm at an affordable price to shoot.

The Chiappa 1911-22 is the natural choice for semi-auto plinking, target shooting, and affordable handgun fun.

I'm willing to travel a reasonable distance for the right deal.  And yes, I have cash.

I can be reached at amk22787 AT gmail DOT com with any offers.

Thanks,

Now that's all out of the way lets talk about this particular sight. I bought the optic before I purchased a good rifle (which was suposed to be a Daniel Defence AR-15), however, money for the rifle had to be spent on other thiwamounted to a firearm, nor has it felt any firearms recoil. The sight is missing it's tuperware (plastic cacha at on the list from another rifleman and he had long since lost the case, thus the optic has lived in a padded, digital camera case and has been in a drawer. How does all this apply to me?, you may be asking yourself...well, if I were to have the tupperware and manuals I would be asking $400.00 for the optic and wouldn't take a penny less, however, the funds for the optic need to be recouped quickly, so I think $300.00 is more than fair. The price is firm.If you think is not a good deal here is some food for thought:

It shoots extremely well, and amazingly accurate. The target was shot at 50 yards distance, 5 shots group with CCI Blazer.

The metal parts are 99.99% like new ( yes, come and see it yourself. Absolutely no fading, rusting, pitting on the metal. The stock has few scuffs and nicks on the right, near the bolt handle but hard to see, and not affected on the functions of the gun at all. The trigger is fully adjustable, one or two-stage trigger pull. Can adjusted down to 4oz (not lbs ). Mine sets at 8 oz. Clean, crisp and breaks like glass.
*Single shot bolt action
*Free floated- Premium bull-Target barrel
*Beautiful European walnut wood stock. The stock has wide forearm, and high comb. Pistol grip and under the stock has stippling, provided a solid feel when holding and shooting the rifle.

*Rubber butt-pad.
*Factory manual.
*Burris high-profile scope rings.
*CenterPoint 4-16x40mm Illuminated Scope with lenses cover.

It was purchased as new in box. I didn't like the look of the cheap synthetic stock and the heavy 3 lbs trigger pull and it suffered the accuracy. So I had my gunsmith adjusted the trigger down to 2.1 lbs professionally, make sure it's till safe when carrying around, and I painted it camouflage finish. 
After the trigger adjustment's done, the gun shoots very well with cheap CCI Blazer 40gr .22lr. The target shows 5 shot groups at 25 yards. Almost went through the same hole. The rifle had exact 50 rounds through it. No more. No less. Basically it is just a new rifle, which still 99% condition. The original box, all paperwork: warranty card, manual are included.
The reason I'm selling this, is because I've just bought an Anschutz 1416D HB on Gunbroker and I need cash to pay for it. I spent almost $400 for this Marlin, and I'm only asking just $300 for it. Or $250 without the scope.
What are so special about a factory Marlin XT-22 ?
*The gun is 100% American made, Marlin did a very good job on it. 
*The trigger is fully adjustable, Pro-Fire series trigger design ( like the Accu-trigger on Savage's ).
*Microgroove barrel rifling.
But, what made my gun even more special over the factory's one?
* Trigger job is already done on this rifle, 2.1lbs pull with no creep and travel. It breaks like glass
*Camouflage painting 
* 2-7rd magazines ( factory's only came with 1. They aren't cheap. $30/each )
*Extended picatinny rail. 25MOA rise. Not a Chinese's crap on Ebay. This rail is 100%, high quality material, American made. And it isn't cheap.

This rifle is a little more uncommon than most - it is a double date stamped gun with an ""MO"" marking.  On a scale of rarity, from 1-10 (10 being most rare) a double date MO gun rates as a 6.

a blurb about MO guns:

""MO is known to be the Russian abbreviation for ""Ministerstvo Oborony"", or Ministry of Defense. The Defense Ministry was established on March 15th, 1953 in a merger of the Military and Naval Ministries (Voennoe Ministerstvo, Voenno-Morskoe Ministerstvo, ""BM"" and ""BMM""). The numbers are thought to represent dates because of their placement and the fact that they are always larger than the previous date. However, all the known dates are between 1942 and 1953 when there was no MO except for the last nine and a half months of 1953. There are a few known firearms with double dates that lack the MO mark, but they are the rare exception. Likewise, few MO marked firearms without a second date have been reported. There is an obvious relationship between the date and MO marks yet just as obvious a conflict with the establishment of the MO and the dates. Based on information from sources in the former Soviet Union the MO marked firearms were used by the Defense Ministry Militarized Security force, or ""Voenizirovannaya Ohrana MO"", abbreviated VOHR MO.""

I had 4 buyers last week and all of em canceled over the weekend.  So,  before you contact me make sure you are serious bout buying it. 
 Only thing about this rifle that I need to mention are: mag was welded to prevent the bottom from flipping open (I didn't do this, it was like this when I bought it), but it does come out like any other type of firearm.  Gas tube is a little loose, but hasn't affected the shooting at all.  A known SKS ordeal.  And lastly, the front sight was made to look like an AK sight, again I bought this rifle in this condition at a gun show in Tulsa a few weeks ago.
I had planned on just getting a tapco stock,etc. and just modding it out, but need the money now more than a project.   I do have two twenty round mags that fit in the gun.  I never even used them since I have another SKS that I own and shoot all the time.  One of them is a stamped metal mag and the other is a tapco.  
Im not interested in any trades, so please cash only.  Im asking what I paid for it, but best offer will take the rifle, if someone takes it this week.  Im leaving outta state in a week, so please make your offer and we might work out something."
