Included in the box are what looks like a cleaning solution or wipes, manual, chamber flag, gun lock and a 30-rd. Magpul Pmag.

Anyway, I've looked up reviews on this rifle, and I have noticed more than one difference in what I have to sell, and what they review online... with pics to back up what I have found. Any changes I notate below are from DPMS, I haven't touched them other than to get pics of them, so the changes are factory changes.

Reviews online of the DPMS Oracle rifle include the following detracting points:
--Poorly staked gas key screws/bolts
--Non-Staked Castle nuts
--Semi-Auto-cut Bolt Carrier Groups (BCG's)
--No thread-locker on the gas block screws

Obviously concerned, I opened one of my boxes and had a look.... these *absolutely* have properly staked gas key bolts (Allen-type bolts, not YFS brand)... the extension tube/buffer tube castle nut *is* staked (although it could be better staked).... the BCG is indeed a full-auto/M16 style BCG, which is really only important if you wish to run something like the Fostech Echo-II Binary trigger... and there is definitely some thread locker compound on the front gas block screws.

So.... all of the 'bad points' about this rifle in all the online reviews I have seen have been addressed by DPMS with the rifles I have here. 

Some 'bad things' in the reviews which have NOT changed... it still is not a chrome-lined barrel (the BCG is lined) which may or may not bother you-- Chrome=longer life, less accuracy, while non-Chrome=better accuracy, less life.... it does still use a commercial (larger OD) extension/buffer tube for the stock which, again, shouldn't matter unless you want to run a bump-stock or something like that.

Some GOOD things I can say about this rifle... it's very tight. There is *zero* slop between the upper and lower when assembled.... is it very well machined with no nasty machining marks inside the upper, on the BCG, or in the lower. It's a well-made firearm..... the finish is great, it looks like a well-made firearm as it has a nice finish and proper machining.... it's a VERY reasonably priced rifle if you're just getting into the AR-platform market or wish to have a rifle to gift-away or if you need a truck-beater rifle.

I think that is about it... I've covered the good, the bad, mentioned how I want paid and the procedure. If you're keen on making it faster, I *do* have new Slide Fire SSAR-15 MOD stocks (bump stocks) and Fostech Echo-II triggers that we can discuss at the time of sale.

In Pickerington.

Thanks!"

As for the specifics of what I'd ideally like to have in a P226, here is what I'm looking for: must be 9mm, must be in excellent working condition (the aesthetic condition is not super important, as long as everything works like it should, and I'm not going to have to replace any parts anytime soon), and I'd love for it to have the bottom rail, and I'd love for it to have at least 2-3 mags with it. Other things I'd love to have with the P226, but are definitely not necessary just yet, as I haven't done a ton of research on it yet: a concealed holster, a carrying case, and then optional furniture (just light / just laser / laser + light combo / tritium sights or night sights).
