The flash hider is also Yankee Hill Machine and is a tulip style.  It has a MagPul STR stock with battery compartments and a high cheek weld.  It also has MagPul MBUS popup sights that co-witness with the Vortec Sparc red dot sight.  There is a Magpul vertical foregrip and horizontal foregrip for long range or CQC.  This rifle has had approximately 4 full mags put through it.  A couple when I first got it several years ago, and a couple just a few days ago to make sure it ran both 5.56 and .223 (which it does, like butter).  Make me an offer, lowballs will not be responded to."

Bought it new myself at Cabelas in Avon for $750, did not buy it used or receive it in a trade. Since I have no use for it, figured I’d see if there was anything out there I could use. I’d really like a full size P30, or some other HK. Just because I have no use for it though doesn’t mean I’m willing to take a huge loss. I’d entertain cash offers but won’t reply to silly ones, mostly looking for trades as money is not an issue for me. Willing to meet in or around Painesville area.

Selling my Century Arms M70B1 Yugo AK. They are Yugo M70B1 surplus kits built on US made 1.5mm RPK style receivers and 4140 non-chrome lined heavy contour barrels.
This is a rifle that I sent down to Two Rivers Arms to refinish into a more authentic looking Yugoslavian M70B1. They are the folks that did all the guns for the Chris Kyle movie ""American Sniper"". They restored the military bluing(from a grey parkerized finish), added historically correct selector notches and Serbian markings, serialized the bolt & dust cover to match with the receiver, removed parkerizing from the bolt, carrier & the top of the leaf sight. I also have a surplus set of M70B1 wood furniture on it. 
This rifle has proven itself to be a great shooter and very accurate before I decided to send it to be refinished. I have not been able to take it out since getting it back so it's still really new looking. I asked them to re-do any canting of the sights that they could see so I imagine it's even better now. The bore is in awesome shape with no pittng or rust.
The only negative things I can think of are there's very tiny bit of play in the lower handguard and the gas piston by the gas tube shows a bit of wear from use/age but nothing that affects function.
 
Comes with:
5 new production 30rd steel Serbian & Croatian Yugo Bolt Hold open style magazines. They appear to be every bit as durable and reliable as the surplus steel mags.
Yugoslavian AK Bayonet (without the leather frog)
Romanian sling
Soft case
The rifle has a Century RAK-1 trigger group, Power Custom Hammer/Trigger retainer plate, and an ALG defense heavy recoil spring added for shootability and reliability.
 
Asking $700 cash only. No trades. No shipping. Lower offers will be ignored as I do not need to sell this rifle. I can meet around Saint Paul (Midway area) weekday evenings after 6pm or weekend mornings by appointment.
First come first serve. Buyer must show a valid PTP/PTC and ID to purchase. No exceptions. Thanks for looking!"
