If you want a fair deal on a great AK act now.
 I am looking for a compact 1911, really want a 3.5 inch bbl, in .45ACP. I may consider others if you have something really cool. I am asking $700 trade value. I really don't have any cash to trade up, but I may be able to add some ammo or mags if your interested. I may be willing to trade down if your gun is in excelent condition with extras or cash. I will be as fair to you as you are to me.
 I'm fine with keeping this rifle. If I do not get an offer for what I am looking for I will apply for my tax stamp next week and go SBR with this. My point being, if your looking to get this on a low ball offer you are wasting your time.
 Thank you for looking and have a great day."

If you can make that happen, Ill take 1000 rounds in its original sealed packaging instead of 1200. This Honda has been in my family for 28 years. It was passed down by my father when I left home and joined the Airforce in 2002. I'm now a family man with two daughters to keep safe, and quality rifle ammo is getting very expensive & difficult to find! I took my 3-wheeler out often before being deployed in 09, but it currently remains in storage in Colorado Springs. I still have the original title and instruction manual for the ATC, almost completely unheard of. I have them scanned but they are too large to upload on armslist.  I have taken very good care of this 3-wheeler, and it was packaged accordingly for long term storage! If you're interested in trading an/or have any questions, feel free to send me an email, I'll respond quickly.

There’s never been a rifle that looks and performs like a Coyote Outback Stainless. The satin-finished gray laminated stock with extra bipod stud has been extensively lightened with flow-through cutaways in both the buttstock and fore-end areas, saving more than a pound of weight. A bedded matte-finished stainless receiver and medium-heavy, free floating fluted stainless barrel save even more weight, making the Outback easy to carry all day long across the roughest terrain found in your own favorite “outback.”

Local face to face sale only; I will not ship to PA, or anywhere else, so please do not ask. Please respond with a phone number and I will contact you. I will not respond if you do not provide your phone number! I am sorry for being so rude, but I have been jerked around too much lately.

I have listed for sale my Ruger Vacquero 5.5"" Blued/Case Hardened finish pistol chambered in .45 Colt. Ruger has verified from the serial number that this pistol shipped from the factory in the first month of production of the Vaquero (April, 1993). This is NOT the New Vaquero. This pistol is the original Vaquero that is capable of safely firing the higher pressure ""Ruger-only"" loads found in the handload manuals. The New Model Vaquero has thinner cylinder walls and cannot accept these loads. What that means is that this Vaquero is capable of loads exceeding .44 magnum balistics.

Condition of this pistol is Very Good to Excellent, though it is a shooter and not a collection piece. The bore is shiny. The pistol has slight wear at the muzzle and end of the ejector housing. The ejector housing also has slight scratches at the bottom, and scratches from the ejector rod cycling and removal of the cylinder. Overall blued finish is 90+%. Slight turn marks on the cylinder. The case hardened finish is more difficult to rate, but appears 80-90+% ( I can't tell if there has been some fading, or if that is the way it came). Disclaimer, I am not an expert at rating firearms, so the condition could be slightly better or worse than I have stated.

There is no box or paperwork with this pistol. As well, the grips are not original, as it shipped from the factory with eagle rosewood grips (which I do not have).

I have done my research online as best I could and found pistols of this vintage and condition to go from $600-$700, the higher end are with box and no papers. Pistol will come with a box of Hornady Critical Defense."

I have added a Hogue grib, which DRASTICALLY improves the grip of the gun. I have also purchased 1.25 inch magazine grip extenders.  I put one on the original mag, and the other I left in the bag. I have also purchased an additional magazine, but have not used it. I switched the bottom of the mag from the flat bottom to the pinky lip bottom, but havent gotten back to the range to use it. 

I have the leather shoot-through wallet that I got from a buddy, but I havent used it since I had the Hogue grip on it (wont fit unless you remove the grip). I'm including 1 box of PCM ammo. I also have an ankle holster for this gun as well.

LWRC M6A2 SPR - LNIB
Black 5.56
Spiral Fluted Barrel

In Stock & Ready to Ship!! NO credit card fees!!

We just received this rifle from a customer. He claims and it appears that it has never been fired. It truly appears to be in perfect, same as new condition. The rail segments have never been mounted and it comes in the original box with sealed 30 round PMag and other original packaged items. 

The new LWRC International Special Purpose Rifle (SPR) is the epitome of a well-balanced and fast pointing tactical carbine. The rifle uses a lightweight sculpted rail derived from our REPR platform. The SPR-MOD rail, at 12” in length, is 33% longer than our Mark II-B rail, but incredibly is still 5% lighter. The cold hammer forged barrel is spiral fluted prior to being treated with our NiCorr surface conversion process. The spiral fluting shaves 20% of the weight off the barrel and relieves the longitudinal stresses that can cause the stringing seen in conventionally fluted barrels. The weight reduction in the front end and the svelte wrist of the user configurable rail, make for an incredibly well balanced rifle.

The SPR features our enhanced fire control group. The fire control group, the bolt carrier and the bolt are all coated in our proprietary nickel coating that promotes permanent lubricity and allows the operator to run the gun nearly dry when the situation requires it. The piston system is our mid-length system, which provides a more direct recoil impulse for faster follow-up shots.

It came with the pictured Circasian walnut stock, and not wanting to screw that up I put it in the H.S. Precision stock it is in now.  It is topped with a Minox 2-10x40 riflescope.  I am asking $1,000 and if you don't think it's worth it, look up what an H.S. Precision sporter stock costs, then check out a Minox scope, then add in the rifle.  This is a bargain fellas, and if you're not familiar with 6.5x55, then think of something with better downrange ballistics than a .308, but the recoil of a .243.  Top that off with the fact that you CAN find ammo for it, and it's a steal at this price.
