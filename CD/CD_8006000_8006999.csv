This rifle is fully upgraded and there is no expenses spared. This is a top-of-the-line rifle and definitely not your average scar 17. The upgrades are as follows, 45 degree Magpul front foregrip, high quality single point sling that is fully adjustable and can also be turned into a dual point sling, Handl Defense gas jet, MK 17 aircraft aluminum lower that accept standard magazines instead of the proprietary expensive scar mags(will now take pmags or other sr-25 pattern magazines), Handl defense aircraft grade aluminum stock hinge and stock button, Handl defense extended magazine release. Handl defense gas jet regulator and gas tuning kit. All of these were professionally installed by a qualified gunsmith. Comes with a GGG quick release sling mount on the side of receiver and also has a quick sling release on the bottom of the Handl Defense aluminum hinge for the folding stock. Also comes with a IWC charging handle. Comes with a Geisele Super Scar trigger. I can include a Trijicon ACOG with a bullet drop compensator for .308 to automatically do the calculations of bullet drop for quick Target acquisition at different distances. This weapon sight uses fiber optic cables that charge the reticle during the day and also illuminates in low light conditions. The Trijicon is a TA11H-308G. I can sell the rifle separately without the weapon sight. Also comes with a really nice flash hider/ muzzle brake from FN. On top of this I have several magazines for it including the original polymer lower and original scar magazines. I have a large amount of brass ammunition for this as well. Here is a breakdown of all of the parts and accessories with cost before tax and before Gunsmithing fees. Super Scar trigger $325/ Trijicon ACOG $1322.99/ Handl Defense aluminum lower $350/ Handl Defense gas jet regulator and gas tuning kit $70/ Handl Defense extended magazine release $27/ GG&G quick detach sling mount $42/ Handl Defense aluminum hinge $85/ Aluminum stock hinge button $63/ IWC charging handle $35 and the scar 17 in fde was $3,499.99. this brings the total to $2,319.99 for just the upgrades alone before taxes and Gunsmithing fees. Adding this to the cost of the rifle is $5,819. 98 and all of the Gunsmithing for this is $600 bringing the total up to $6,420 plus all of the taxes on top of that makes the rifle around $7,500. I will sell everything for only $5,300 meaning a savings of $2,400. Without the rifle scope I will sell for only $4,300.  You can also call or text me at REDACTED"

This gun has all the proof marks and numbers matching. A mid-life upgrade to the Glock pistols involved the addition of checkering on the front strap and serrations to the back strap. These versions, introduced in 1988, were informally referred to as “second-generation” models. To meet American ATF regulations, a steel plate with a stamped serial number was embedded into the receiver in front of the trigger guard. In 1991, an integrated recoil spring assembly replaced the original two-piece recoil spring and tube design. The magazine was slightly modified, changing the floorplate and fitting the follower spring with a resistance insert at its base.REDACTED"

I used a calibrated machinist's Pin Gauge set to measure
    chamber throat ID = 0.301"" to 0.302""
    muzzle ID = 0.301"" to 0.302""
The 0.301"" pin slides in snugly, no wiggle.
The muzzle appears to be lathe-turned to a smooth surface with a slight concave bevel.I do not know who made this barrel.
Winner is first eMail [irish-shooter@hotmail.com] that says ""I'll take it"" with your name,address, and zip code.
All sales are final, no returns.
I shall accept payment in United States Postal Service money order, or cash.
I shall VERY carefully wrap and pack in a USPS Priority Mail box for USPS shipment.This will be an odd price, since the barrel is long and heavy. It will still fit in a US MailPriority Mail tube and I shall really carefully pack it. I want this barrel to get to youundamaged, as much as you want to get the barrel in an undamaged condition.
You pay handling and shipping costs for packed box weight to your Zip Code. I shallget that measured at the local Post Office and email costs to you. Shipping cost is goingto be a bit more expensive, as this weighs about 2-1/2 pounds and is 24 inches long.
I can email more pictures to you as you want them. And, again, I do not know who made this barrel.
Thank you for looking ! Cheers ! Paw-Paw"

The assault pack has padded shoulder straps with a quick release system and a sternum strap, and an adjustable waist belt.  The back panel is also padded for maximum comfort.  Inside the main compartment is a pocket designed to hold a hydration bladder (included).  The hydration tube can be fed out through the top of the pack on either the left or right side."

What is odd is this rifle has a factory length barrel of a No 1 1/2 rifle. The barrel IS factory, not cut off (see pics). Full 28"". Special factory order? I don't know but would guess so. The ""serial"" number on the lower tang does not date the rifle as I have learned. It is merely a ""run"" number. These rifle are impossible to date as the records burned up in 1898. Has been refinished and some of the sharp areas are rounded some. But still in pretty nice shape. Needs a REALLY good cleaning. Lead fouling is bad. But the rifling remains good. Wood stocks are solid and no cracks that I see. Most likely was made pre-1898 BUT as there is NO HARD PROOF available to prove this, it MUST GO TO AT LEAST AN 03 C&R FFL. $400 PLUS ACTUAL SHIPPING. I do NOT charge over my cost to ship! Email Shawn at REDACTED or call REDACTED.  Must go to an 03 FFL or better. I take USPS money orders, discreet Paypal gift, or credit cards plus 3% of the total.

Flat top, Gas system is carbine length, front A2 sight, and the handguard is a Knight's Armament with quad picatinny rails, a foregrip, and multiple adapter pieces to allow different attachments (lights, lasers, etc.) or grip covering.I purchased the gun for over $900 when I got it. I am asking $650 OBO (please do not low-ball me, I know what the gun is worth and I'm also not desperate to sell). I am not really interested in trades right now as I mainly want the money for other purposes. I've attached a couple of detailed pics, so take a look and let me know if you have any questions. I can share more at your request, but Armslist will only allow 3.Bill of sale will be completed, and I will ask to see ID and Carry permit at time of purchase. This is non-negotiable.Local face-to-face sales only, I will not ship nor will I do FFL transfers. I live on the SE side of Indy, but am willing to meet within reasonable distance.

This is a 1911 style pistol. It comes with 1-8 round single stack magazine. The pistol has a thumb safety but no beaver tail safety. The finish is excellent, I have to assume it was refinished at some point in its life, but i cannot confirm that. The pistol functions flawlessly, i have run a fair number of rounds thru it, accuracy is right on par with other 1911 pistols. I just don't shoot this one enough to justify keeping it. Along with the pistol comes 150 rounds of 9mm Largo ammo and 275 rounds of 9x23 Winchester. Before you ask, NO the 9x23 cannot be shot in the Largo as is. The 9x23 is to high pressured, BUT the case for 9mm Largo is 23mm long, hence 9x23. If you pull the bullets and download the powder charge and reassamble you have 9mm Largo. Once those are fired you have the brass you need to reload. If you have any questions please ask and I will do my best to answer them. Please make sure you are able to legally purchase and own this firearm. If you are unsure consult your local gunshop. If you are not from the area I will ship the firearm to a FFL dealer of your choice. Buyer to pay shipping. Credit cards accepted 3% service fee. No sales to restricted areas."

The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief.The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse.Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.Assembly and adjustment only takes a few minutes, then off to the range."

Designed for both competitive and tactical use, the FSC Series allows for superior muzzle stabilization and aids the shooter in faster follow-up shots and accuracy.   The unique port design of the FSC Series yields muzzle control that meets or exceeds the performance of the best muzzle brakes on the market without the teeth-rattling overpressure indicative of other brakes and compensators.   All of the FSC Series muzzle devices have been classified as a non-flash suppressing device by the BATFE, thus removing any restriction from assault weapon ban states or provinces. A copy of this document is available upon request or on our website at www.primaryweapons.com.   Designed for the venerable AK47, this industry-leading FSC47 flash suppressing compensator provides unparalleled muzzle control and recoil reduction.   *For use on weapons that have a bullet diameter equal to or less than 7.62x39 and threaded 1/4x1 LH."
