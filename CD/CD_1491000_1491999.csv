In 1998 Joe Roebuck recognized the increasing demand for a safe, simple to use, and affordable firearm due to political climate changes and most states enacting legislation to allow conceal and carry permits. Joe Roebuck has been in the manufacturing industry for 35 years, and chooses to use his talents as a Tool & Die Maker and Mechanical Design Engineer to design the CPX series of firearms. . September 2003, Joe Roebuck founded Skyy Industries, LLC now known as Sccy Industries, LLC to produce a conceal & carry firearm known as the CPX 9mm. The company's first offices and manufacturing facility was located in South Daytona, Florida and as of February 2010 relocated to a new 21,000 sq. ft. facility located in Daytona Beach, Florida, just a half a mile from the famous Daytona 500 speedway.

 Contained in Sccy's new facility are numerous state of the art CNC machining centers of various types using custom tooling and programs designed by Joe Roebuck. The barrel, slide, receiver and all other major metal components are manufactured at the new facility. It was Joe Roebuck's vision that the CPX series firearms could be both cost effective and precisely manufactured to be as good as or even better than other name brand name products, without the high cost to the retail buyer. Sccy is now positioned to continue producing and developing new designs for the CPX series firearms. The CPX series envisioned has been successfully manufactured and sold throughout the United States using its own dealer network. Sccy's success is benchmarked by producing over 45,000 firearms to date. This success continues to grow with the current introduction of the new ""Generation 2"" CPX series. This year, 2011 Sccy will produce CPX-1 and CPX-2 ""Generation 2"" pistols and expand its national dealer base to a new all time high."

Stainless steel with flush baseplate. The Kahr magazine tube is constructed of corrosive resistant 400 series Stainless Steel and heat treated to 50 Rockwell for durability. Plasma-welding the stamping to form the magazine tube gives a smooth interior surface for the “ammunition stack” to rise and feed, and creates an “unbreakable” seam. Furthermore, tumbling the magazine in the finishing process provides a smooth, consistent burr-free surface. There are no sharp edges on which to cut yourself. Another feature, unique to Kahr magazines, is the steel slide stop pin contact insert in the magazine follower. This innovative insert assures that the follower will reliably engage the slide stop lever and lock the slide, magazine after magazine. With this feature, you do not have to be concerned with the inevitable wear that accompanies most plastic followers.

With bayonet.

This rifle came to me unfired, unissued, and still covered in cosmoline. 
I cleaned it out thoroughly,  fired 20 rds throught for testing and there it sits in it's case not doing much of anything. 
I usually bring other stuff to the range and figure someone else may enjoy it more.
I'm not selling because I need money. I've seen crappy production model SKS's sell on here for more than $575.00. 
My research shows its a 1970 model. Low Low Low serial number. Under 1,500.
It's pretty much like a new 43 year old rifle. 
First $575.00 takes it. 
Must have valid FOID, and willing to complete a bill of sale. 
One day waiting period applies to private sale by Illinois state law. I know it sucks, but I didn't make the law. I just have to abide by it. 
First come first serve. 
Don't miss this barely touched beauty!!

I also have a 2000 round lot of 7.62x39 Tul Ammo for sale.
$700 for the 2000rd lot. Equals about $6ish a box. About 300 of the rounds comes on stripper clips.
I'll even throw in a new 20 pack of stripper clips.
Will combine the sks and the 2000 rds in trade for 
A stock (uncostomized) Bushmaster or DPMS AR-15. Preferably with a handle on top, but will look into all offers with an open mind."

This easy-to-use product can get a shooter within three to four inches of the bull's-eye at 100 yards in about three shots. Constructed from tough T6 aluminum, the Laser Bore Sight comes in a sleek red finish and works great on any weapon with at least three inches of barrel length. The Laser Bore Sight makes sight-in sessions a breeze for scopes, lasers or iron sights on any firearm from .22 to .50 caliber with included adapters. For maximum versatility the system also works with new accessories (sold separately), including a shotgun adapter for .50 to .75 caliber and improved scope leveler. The Laser Bore Sight activates with a roll switch and is powered by three 393 batteries that provide one and a half hours of continuous use. This unit is also excellent for modern rifles and its modest design works great with most flash suppressors and muzzle breaks.

All top notch products went into this rifle. I have only bore sighted it and test fired it with about 10 rounds to be sure it cycles correctly. The lower receiver is Franklin Armory with a receiver tensioning screw that takes all the wobble out of the upper and lower. This makes for a very tight accurate gun with no need for accu-wedges. This is a 50 state gun and is California compliant for buyers in California and I can send it without the bullet button for the rest of you lucky people in the more rifle friendly states. Inside the receiver is an Armalite National match 2 stage trigger with a 2.5 pound take up and just under 2 pound let of. All internal springs are chrome silicon for reliability. The fire controls have been nickel plated for durability aesthetics. It has a full length quad rail for mounting anything you want such as night vision, lights, lasers....just about anything. Don’t think this rifle is all show. It will certainly hold a 1 inch or better group with factory loads. The barrel and upper receiver are DPMS. The receiver is a super heavy duty slick side and the BCG and has been Molly coated for smooth operation. The gas system is rifle length and has a weaver gas block for back up sights. The barrel is a heavy contour 18"" match grade 1 in 8 twist Panther Arms Mark 12 in stainless steel. It has been factory coated with black Teflon to keep the recce/mark 12 look correct. The optic is a brand new Nikon 3x9 P223 scope with BDC bullet drop compensating reticle and it has a brand new Burris 20MOA cantilever scope base. Rifle comes completes as shown with bi pod and ...sorry 10 round magazine. y'all can change that! The stock is Magpul STR with H-buffer and the pistol grip is MOE."

Description:

I've run fewer than 500 rounds through this gun. It's a great gun but just not my style. (I'm a 1911 guy at heart.) At a friend's advice I took a chance on this smaller frame (good for concealed carry), single-stack (7-round) composite gun.

The gun is dead accurate for me at 25 yards (3-inch groups). The ""revolver-style"" long-pull trigger is smooth as butter."
