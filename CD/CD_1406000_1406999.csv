Ready to follow your every move, the MRAD adapts to a variety of user needs without sacrificing performance. With unrelenting precision and unfailing accuracy, this bolt action newcomer has  already defined a whole new class of long-range rifles.

The MRAD rifle’s user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun’s modularity. The precision-grade barrel can be removed by simply unscrewing two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design paves the way for future caliber interchangeability and serviceability.

The MRAD also boasts Barrett’s new easily accessed trigger module. This match-grade trigger is drop-fire-proof and combat-ready. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld.

Integrated into the MRAD rifle’s 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is an M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper and 21.75 inches of rail space. The configurable side and bottom rails can also hold a number of accessories.

The MRAD rifle’s stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. When folded, the stock latches around the bolt handle for added security during transport. Because the stock folds to the bolt handle side of the action, the rifle is the same width overall, folded or extended.

Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle’s length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button.

From its quick-detach sling mounts to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color of the rifle that blends into any environment—every detail of the MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle you can truly make your own.

Bolt guide acts as a dust cover to reduce contaminants

The barrel has a sharp address and the TG has a trace of 45 cal on the back left.  The ivories are original Colt.  I have made grips and carved ivory for many years and I know the screw together ivories from the Colt factory in those days...they are Colt.  Interesting, there is blood on the right grip.  Don't know what kind but it is blood.  left has an old small either an  F on a D or a P on a D...see pictures.  I'll let the pictures tell the rest of the story.

This rifle hands down is one of the few weapons I've came across in its excellent condition state. Only reason I'm parting with this rifle is in order to add more to the collection, the boss said something has to go. Rifle itself is in excellent condition for its age, all factory measurements and gauging are far within original specs. Bore has a mirror shine and crown is excellent. Gas system is spotless with no carbon fouling anywhere. Rifle has been shot once to verify function, then completely detail stripped and meticulously cleaned and greased/oiled were needed. I am also including a reproduction canvas WWII case and muzzle cover along with 200 + rounds of military 30-06 in a .30cal ammo can. Also many enbloc clips and bandoleer packs as well. Rifle has never seen commercial 30-06 which is a no no, and has been a safe queen. The pictures don't do this rifle justice, it's a fine collectors piece and I'm in no hurry to let it go! Absolutely no trades, asking 1,000 OBO for everything with a FTF sale only. Must be willing to sign a bill of sale for legal purposes upon purchase.

These are the same mags used by the Israeli military in the Tavor TAR-21 and M16. These mags feel SOLID! Buy them from me and avoid the 2 or 3 month wait from the importer. Here is what they say about them:

E-LANDER MAGS are high-performance durable steel magazines.

30 round steel magazines for AR-15/M16/M4 magazines.

Made in Israel for the Tavor, M16, and common sidearms, they were tested by special military forces
and anti-terror units. These magazines have proven to withstand severe combat conditions and requirements.

Backed by over six decades of experience the company has specialized in the manufacturing of precision-stamped metal parts and tools with an uncompromising commitment to quality and reliability. A wide range of the company’s products are exported to worldwide customers.

• High performance steel body - strong heavy-gauge steel

• Tested by special military forces and anti-terror units

• Fine resistance body coating, enduring up to 96 hours salt-spray test.
This exceeds the military salt-spray test requirements.

The Noreen 338 Lapua weighs only 13 pounds, and it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. This rifle comes with a custom muzzle-break and semi-auto action that significantly suppresses recoil. In the AR tradition, the Bad News 338 Lapua disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reasembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle seamless. This Noreen includes an ultra-heavy duty Plano case, which is far superior to a pelican style case. 100% Made in the USA.

I upgraded the mag release to a Tapco quick release, and I have replaced the firing pin with a new Murray’s SKS firing pin. This is a much safe firing pin. It has a spring on it, reducing the risk of slam fires. I have also added several attachments. The first attachment is a Tactical 3-9x40 optics R4 reticle crosshair air sniper hunting rifle scope with a Tapco intrafuse shell deflector and the scope is mounted on over-under sites so that the SKS iron sites can still be used. Then I put a Military Law Enforcement Steel Inserted Leg Mil Spec Polymer Composite Grip+Bipod+Side Rail. The last attachment I added is a laser sight with a pressure on and off switch hooked to the for grip. The rifle also comes with a one point bungee tactical sling, two twenty round magazines, and one forty round magazine, and fifty-four 7.62x39 rounds.

""The SIG516 Patrol FDE in Flat Dark Earth with a matching FDE Cerakote® finish on both the upper and lower receivers and quadrail handguard. As with all SIG516 Patrol rifles, the Flat Dark Earth use the SIG SAUER innovative short-stroke gas pushrod operating system, which reduces chamber debris and allows the rifle to run cleaner and cooler.

This system, along with the SIG SAUER proprietary fully supported extractor enables the SIG516 to be one of the only rifles to pass NATO’s “Over the Beach” test.

A 16” chrome-lined barrel is chambered in 5.56mm NATO and is surrounded by a free-floating M1913
quad rail. The top rail is optic-ready and includes SIG SAUER flip-up iron sights.""



I am looking at offers on my second generation Sig 516 patrol in FDE. This rifle was purchased NIB in December and has around 300 rounds put thru it. Rifle comes with 1 30rnd FDE PMAG and 1 30rnd Pro-Mag metal magazine. Includes factory 1 or 2 point sling, factory blue hard case, small picatinny barrel mount with blackhawk bipod and a magpul AFG. This gun was professionally cleaned prior to its first shooting and never had the failure to feed issues some others have had when breaking in their 516s from not properly cleaning out the factory junk before break in. Rifle is very clean and functions flawlessly. I am only willing to do a face to face transaction at Eagle Gun Range in Lewisville or Elm Fork in Dallas. Cash only transaction and I am willing to let you shoot the gun before buying. Bring your own bullets please.

This is an actual Sig 516, not one of the many scams you see on this website trying to sell you a top of the line rifle that has not been seen on a store shelf for months now. I am not asking for you to send me money through the mail before I ""ship"" it to you. This is a real face to face cash only transaction.You must be able to legally own a firearm and be willing to complete firearms bill of sale, CHL holders preferred.

FROM VIKING TACTICS SITE BELOW:
Unlike any sight on the market, the Revolutionary design of the Viking Sight will enhance your ability to close with and destroy the threat, day or night. The Viking Sight from Viking Tactics, Inc. features a tapered front sight that will draw you immediately to the correct aiming point. This sight is not only tapered for speed, but to help with accuracy at distance when needed. The tapered sight leads to an indestructible fiber optic that will help to drive your focus where it is needed. These sights are extremely fast. The rear sight notch has also been cut lower than normal to not only enhance speed, but to allow the shooter to see the tritium vials that have been inserted below the fiber optic. The Viking Sight will allow you to have the fine aiming point that you want and need, coupled with fiber optic to help draw your attention. If the sun goes down you are now able to use the tritium that is slightly below the fiber optic.
Tapered Front Sight; Serrated Front and Rear Sights; Fiber Optic Speed Sight; Tritium Night Sights."

Revolver is in excellent condition, almost like new. Has slight ring around cylinder, is easily 98-99%.
Has original box and papers. I have fired this very little and it is unlikely that the previous owner used it much either. When I first got it I had some issues with light strikes, must have been the ammo though, CCI maxi-mag works great. A round that works very well is 22WRF, CCI has started producing this again and it is very accurate out of this revolver.

If you where to see it's internal parts you would notice that it hasn't been broken in period! All your tactical removable front and rear forged black matte finish iron Put down range maybe 50rds at the most. Only and exclusively ""QULAITY AMMO""..need to quote that! ""Lead Free"" guys.. Only Copper Plated...my faves 40gr hollow point Federals smooth and sights, rear site flips for eye compensation, front ""Polymer"".. quad rail, not ""Aluminum""... which is not as hard! Comes with a standard A2 style pistol grip, but as you can appreciate on the pics, i have upgraded it with a Hogue 4 finger pistol grip which gives you a snug and sweat free grasp which i love, compared to the standard plastic composite factory version. Pretty much your true legit AR in a .22 Cal an exact clone of the big brother .223/5.56 beautiful rifle. It also has the bolt lock and release button on the left side as well as your fire and safety lever. I have all receipts and warranties including original box, comes with it's standard 10rd mag plus a S&W/M&P 25rd mag i purchased along with it. Bi-pod, Lower quad rail fore end grip i believe it's by Magpul, Optics by Barska with ready mounts Picatinney rail, as you can see in the pics. Red Dot very good scope, about $100 bucks, but very good quality. Also all your quad rail rubber grippers by U.T.G. Lastly, just purchased as you can see 3 Winchester bricks 555rds each, believe 1665rd all together couldn't find federals, but this ammo is as good quality wise as the Federals in preference in my opinion! Lead free..Copper Plated, again hollow points love the damage aftermath on any varmint which never had the privilege since i am still thinking of really keeping it!!! Just to add, it took me only 15rds to drill the red bull at 100 yards. Started of course at 15 yards... then the rest of the 35 were at  1/2 to 2 inch groups...very, very, accurate rifle, fires true!!

In great condition. Comes with wooden ""gator"" grips. These are very nice looking factory stocks with a rough texture that really allows a solid grip on this lightweight gun. While they do not take the sting out of shooting the gun, they let you hold on without having to readjust after each shot. But, unlike Hogue or similar stocks they do not catch on clothing and look good. If you can't tell, I really love these stocks. I have some magna stocks I would trade them out for if the buyer prefers.

Shot a 100-200 rounds through it, mostly low pressure range ammo. Kept clean and looks almost new. Lock up is good. I have painted the front sight orange, which really helps picking it up for a fast sight picture. This gun DOES HAVE the internal lock (if that matters to you).

I will include 10 rounds of SD ammo (Remington Golden Sabre I believe) with one speed strip and an Uncle Mikes pocket holster. This will set you up for pocket carry. 

Buyer must have CC License, KY DL, and be willing to sign a bill of sale. Or, you must pay FFL transfer fee (usually $15-25). Sorry, but I want to make sure the buyer is legally permitted to own this gun.

I am open to trades, but prefer a straight cash sale. Selling in order to fund a long desired Seecamp. All trades must include cash my way and/or your gun will have to be of greater value and something I really love. I am not trying to be a jerk, but I hope you understand given my reason for selling."

I have for sale or trade a like new (only 7 rounds through it) Remington 870 Magnum Special Purpose 12 gauge pump shotgun. This 870 hasnt seen a field yet for a hunt, its just been shot the 7 times - so id love to find it a great home to get out and hunt with as i already have an 870 that i hunt with.

This gun is beautiful, the Camo is mossy oak obsession I believe, has truglo raised fiber optic front and back sights, a Remington turkey choke, shoots 2 3/4 and 3"" magnums....the works - you'll be ready to get a gobbler with no problem.

The special purpose shotgun is about 1/2"" shorter on the buttstock than regular 870s (I sized it to my full size 870 - everything else is the same), but it shoulders phenomenally - super quick to throw up at a target.

If you're looking to buy, my price is $450 for the gun / comes with the choke / truglo sights (they were $100 or so) and I can throw in a pack of general game loads or turkey loads - your pick. I would also consider trades for the below mentioned things. 

Interested? Shoot me your number in an email with any questions/offers/etc. thanks for looking and be blessed!"

pretty compact (easy to conceal IWB), attractive and holds 10rnds of .45, which is very nice capacity for a compact .45.

I've always switched back and forth between carrying 9mm and .45 ... 9mm you have the lighter recoil and usually higher capacity but .45 ... thats some pretty incredible stopping power.

I feel pretty safe carrying ten rounds of it knowing that a hollow point .45 round will stop a bad guy pretty quick.

It has the stainless slide.

Uses Glock magazines, or the optional (more expensive) KRISS 25-round mags.  This Swiss Manufactured KRISS carbine features a unique bolt system that reduces recoil by approximately 75%.  Used by various military, para-military, and law enforcement units (the fully auto version), this semi-auto model was designed for the commercial market.  Other than the semi-auto function, this is the same rifle as used internationally.  This kit comes with the following:

1.  Original box, all manuals, cleaning kit, lock, etc.
2.  Tactical Black Carrying case
3.  Five (5) - KRISS (Glock extended) 25-round Magazines (these mags alone sell for $60 each)
5.  Tactical foregrip/bipod arrangement
6.  Bushnell Tactical Red Dot Scope
7.  Front and rear KRISS tactical (removable) Iron Sights 

This is a brand new rifle purchased 5 months ago.  It took me almost 1.5 years to finally get one - but now, due to other circumstances, I'm forced to cut back on my collection of firearms.  This is one rifle that I do not want to sell.

REASON FOR SELLING:  I've developed too large a collection and over the past 6 months I've been slowly selling off bits and pieces.  I'm a retired Marine and I've cut back on my shooting tremendously, so having many of these firearms just sitting in the safe, does me no good, so I'm reluctantly selling this KRISS.  Because of the rarity of this firearm, it will be first come, first served..  

PRICE:  $2600 Cash (no trades or checks).  Please note - I paid $2995 for everything you see here.  It's the way it was ordered.  I'm selling it for $2600 - my loss - but whoever can afford it and gets this setup - will have a blast (no pun intended).

MY LOCATION:  I'm situated in Fuquay Varina, which is just south of Raleigh, NC.

BEST METHOD OF CONTACT:  You can call me on my mobile at REDACTED anytime between 9 AM and 10 PM EST daily.  Or, you can reply to this Ad.  Contacting me on the cell phone is the best and fastest way to go - first serious caller will get the rifle.

Two overruns from the LEO/Gov't side of Rock River Arms. RRA makes civilian AR units and also has a custom department specifically for LEO and government orders. If you want a civilian AR that say's ""operator"" or ""sealmeat special"" or Green Berets"" these ain't them; these are real live tac units! Color per contract was to ""match"" their carry vest which is close to Ranger Green; I was told this ""hue"" actually is a better match for the Arizona desert than any tan color, but it seems to be an awesome match for any terrain. Order requirements were: 16"" chrome moly match barrel, medium contour, tapped and threaded for suppressor with tactical flash suppressor, sub 3/4""moa guarantee ( these are the only chrome moly barrels I have ever seen that come with a sub moa guarantee- as you know chrome lined barrels are designed for an intensive high rate of fire and increase barrel longevity usualy at an accuracy cost). Two stage match trigger with short reset trigger system. .223 Wylde chamber so will shoot both .223 and 5.56mm. 1/2 quad system with horizontal heat release ports forward of handgrip. Forward under picatinny rail system for white light use. Five sling swivels w/ bipod studs. Offset 45 degree folding back up iron sights which were replaced with the Trijicon holographic RMR system on a Trijicon offset mount. Main optic Trijicon 4x ACOG Government issue w/ Tenebraex ARD (anti reflective device), scope covers, steel turret retention devices, picatinny mount rail system with .223 BDC (ballistic drop compensator) with red chevron and crosshairs from 100 yards to 800 yards (each marked- target at 600 yards put the 6 on it, etc)) along with windage hash marks and distance measuring capability. The Trijicon RMR shown has a 9 moa dot for close quarter battle and as a back up out to 150 yards! Matching magazines DIRECT from Magpul w/ matching color- not ""painted"" aftermarket junk! Ok so we have a stunning duracoat and cerakote rifle w/ matching magazines that shoots around 1/2"" groups at 100 yards with a government issue ACOG loaded with all options!"
