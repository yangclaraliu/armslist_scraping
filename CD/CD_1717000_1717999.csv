RFB stands for Rifle, Forward-ejecting Bullpup. Why forward-ejecting? Because it allows the RFB to be the first truly ambidextrous 7.62 NATO Bullpup ever developed. The patented, dual-extractor system maintains control of the case from the moment it leaves the magazine and upon firing, pulls the fired case from the chamber and lifts them to push them into an ejection chute above the barrel, where they exit. The Bullpup configuration and tilting-block mechanism allow the 18"" model to be only 26.1"" long, or as much as 14"" shorter in overall length than its competitors with equal barrel lengths. Furthermore, the stock and mechanism cross-section is similar to a conventional rifle, in stark contrast to existing Bullpup rifles. The RFB is also the safest Bullpup ever developed because the breech is separated from the shooters face by two layers of 1.6 mm steel. In the highly unlikely event of a case rupture, gas expansion is directed downwards through the magazine well to protect the shooters head and face."

This is a Ruger Mark III 22/45 (model 10119) pistol.  

It is a .22LR in the original case with two 10-round magazines included and features a 4” bull barrel.  The pistol is in excellent condition and has been well cared for.  The photos show some fingerprints on the barrel, those are from me adjusting the pistol for the picture; I’ve already wiped them off.  The pistol will come with: two 10-round magazines, a rail system, and a 30MM red dot 5 MOA reticle.  

I have two postings on Armslist for Ruger Mark III 22/45 pistols.  When you write if you could let me know if you are interested in the: slab sided, one with rails, or both firearms it would be helpful.

While it would be a lot of fun for our marketing department to sell the Camp 10 as the ultimate zombie-whacking tool, the truth is, it actually has a lot of other uses that you just might find to be of a more immediate nature than zombie defense. Not that we’re ignoring to the coming Zombiepocalypse, mind you. We just think that the Camp 10 makes a pretty awesome camp knife and that it does a great job of whacking campsite or other outdoor chores down to size in very short order.

From clearing brush to making kindling, the Camp 10 is the ideal outdoor and survival tool. Cut, chop, slash, hack, split, scrape—just about any task you ask of it, the Camp 10 can handle. The full-tang Camp 10 is made of carbon tool steel for toughness and wear resistance. A basic black powdercoat protects the steel and makes maintenance easier.

You’ll like the secure, contoured grip of the Camp 10, too. The handle has a built-in hand guard and is drilled in both front and rear so you can attach a lanyard either place—or both—for carrying versatility. Of course, if a zombie does get up close and personal with you, then yeah, you’ll be pretty glad to have a Camp 10 in hand, too.

They don't make them like this anymore. This gun was made in December 1995 - not strictly speaking a pre-ban but made before they stopped using USGI parts. Originally it did not have a USGI flash hider with bayonet lug - but it does now.

Also, it was a special model (forget the exact model number) but it was refered to as the GI Collector edition. Aside from USGI parts it came with a collector quality USGI walnut stock. The pictures don't do justice as the stock has a beautiful grain to it - and perfect Defense Acceptance Stamp and P cartouches.

I do pefer a local sale (I am in Fullerton). If it does not sell within a day or two I will ship. I need cash only at this time, no trades - sorry.

This M1A comes with the following for $1350:

USGI Web Sling
USGI Buttstock Cleaning Kit

This gun is 15 years old but has only had a couple of hundred rounds down the tube. It is mint. You won't find a better M1A for a better price - at least I did not.

692,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1717692,For Sale:  Big Eddy -- Designed by Russ Kommer,"WEST, Las Vegas, Nevada",$ 26,"Listed On: Friday, June 28, 2013",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"NIRK - Designed by Glenn Klecker  $26.22   These went fast 1 Left

Intelligent design advocate Michael Behe coined the term ""irreducible complexity,"" which means ""a single system composed of several well matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function of the system, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning."" It certainly describes this new folder by Glenn Klecker, award-winning knife and tool designer from Silverton, Oregon. He has named it after his son: Nathan's IRreducible complexity Knife, or NIRK™. There are just two well-thought-out pieces, plus a blade pivot screw. 

 The innovation is Glenn's use of a single sheet of stamped and folded stainless steel to serve as the folder frame, back spacer, spring and lock, resulting in a solid lockback folder. The geometry of the cutout areas is critical, carefully calculated to provide just the right spring action when the rear of the spine is pressed. 

 At the front of the frame, the lock tab mates with a notch in the blade to provide safe lockup. The tighter the grip on the handle, the tighter the lockup, making this an exceptionally safe design. It is very difficult, if not impossible, to accidentally release the lock, and it is very, very strong. 

 When the blade is closed, the same lock tab ramps over a rounded detent to hold the blade in the closed position. 

 The high-carbon stainless steel blade is a utilitarian drop point shape with a deep belly, high hollow ground for easy cutting, and with a swedged top edge to aid penetration. It is a hefty 0.131"" thick. The blade can be opened with either hand using the oval thumb hole. 

 The 5180 sport and work model has a high satin blade finish, brushed frame and Razor-Sharp cutting edge. 

 The NIRK has a stainless steel pocket/gear clip. 

 There you have it: a simple, flat, almost indestructible folder. All you need to do is oil and sharpen it occasionally and you have a friend for life. It is priced so you can afford several: one for the toolbox, one for the backpack, one for the truck, one for the boat, one for the survival kit. 

 In the knife world, it is a fine example of intelligent design.

They don't make them like this anymore. This gun was made in December 1995 - not strictly speaking a pre-ban but made before they stopped using USGI parts. Originally it did not have a USGI flash hider with bayonet lug - but it does now.

Also, it was a special model (forget the exact model number) but it was refered to as the GI Collector edition. Aside from USGI parts it came with a collector quality USGI walnut stock. The pictures don't do justice as the stock has a beautiful grain to it - and perfect Defense Acceptance Stamp and P cartouches.

I do pefer a local sale (I am in Fullerton, CA). If it does not sell within a day or two I will ship. I need cash only at this time, no trades - sorry.

This M1A comes with the following for $1350:

This gun is 15 years old but has only had a couple of hundred rounds down the tube. It is mint. You won't find a better M1A for a better price - at least I did not.

930,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1717930,For Sale:  Kershaw RJ II,"West, Las Vegas, Nevada",$ 32,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 16, 2013",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The smaller brother of the tactical RJ I $32.33

RJ Martin’s blade design and grind gives you the piercing power of a tanto with just enough curve to the belly for slicing aptitude as well. The tanto point is even stronger than comparable tantos because Kershaw makes the tip thicker and gives it a tough flat grind. The result is an über-strong tip that takes on the toughest piercing tasks with no fear. But the RJ II isn’t done yet.

This knife offers a full range of cutting edges. The plain edge is ever so slightly curved, giving the RJ II slicing capability—something not all tanto blades offer. In addition, the blade is partially serrated to make cutting through tough or fibrous materials a breeze. The blade is made of 8Cr13MoV stainless steel that’s tough, wear resistant, and takes a keen edge. For a distinctive look and enhanced performance, the blade is coated with titanium carbo-nitride.

The RJ II also features 3-D machined G-10 handle scales and a secure stainless-steel locking liner. It opens with one-handed ease thanks to the SpeedSafe assisted opening system. Access it with the built-in flipper or thumbstud. The pocketclip is reversible for tip-up or tip-down carry. Tactical looks and a multifunctional blade combine in the RJ II—also available in a larger size as the RJ I.

 Technical Specifications
•2-Step Serration
Serrations assist in cutting through particularly tough or fibrous material, such as rope or cord. The Kershaw 2-step serration is a more aggressive style of serration.

•Flipper
May be used on either manual or assisted opening knives. The “flipper” is a protrusion on the back of the blade that the user can pull back on, or flip, in order to move the blade easily out of the handle.

•SpeedSafe®
Assists you to open any SpeedSafe® knife quickly and easily with a manual push on the thumbstud or pull back on the flipper; built into many Kershaw best sellers.

•Liner Lock
Locks the blade open during use; one side of the knife’s steel “liner,” the steel plate to which the handle scales are attached, moves into position behind the blade to securely lock it open.

•Reversible
Pre-drilled holes in the handle enable the user to change either the tip position or the side on which the knife carries.

.Additional Features
•SpeedSafe assisted opening
•Liner lock
