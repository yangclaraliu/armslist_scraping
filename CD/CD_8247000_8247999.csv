A high-performance LED generates 600 lumens of brilliant white light that is focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The X400 Ultra produces tactical-level light—enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark-adapted vision—for 1.75 hours per set of batteries. The X400 Ultra’s 5-milliwatt laser sight, located below the primary light, emits a high-visibility green (505 nM) beam. The laser's aiming adjustment mechanism uses Nylok® screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed. Activating the X400 Ultra is done via ambidextrous switching located at the rear of body, providing one-finger control — press the switch on either side for momentary-on activation, flip up or down for constant-on activation. A separate switch at the rear of the X400 Ultra allows you to (1) activate white light illumination only, (2) activate white light illumination simultaneously with the laser sight, (3) activate the laser sight only, or (4) disable the entire X400 Ultra. See illustration at upper left. Optional DG grip switches (for pistols) permit the X400 Ultra to be activated without altering your grip on your weapon. The versatile X400 Ultra can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its T-Lock mounting system permits rapid attachment/detachment from either Universal or Picatinny rails. Its high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance and is O-ring and gasket sealed to keep out dust and moisture."

Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.   P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. S models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode —and have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame —in addition to the two safety levers.   A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.   Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.   During a 2010 endurance test, a randomly selected P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.  Features a set of photoluminescent sight.  Includes (2) (15) round magazines, a hard case, and a lock.  Ammunition and accessories are all 5% off with the sale of a firearm.  ------Specs:------ Caliber – 9mm Capacity – 15+1 Barrel Length – 3.85” Over All Length – 7.12” Weight – 26.08oz.

With few artificial light sources, then non-autogated does a better job, especially with illuminators.  Has manual gain, and pretty darn clear image.  2 small spots in tube like most (theres no 100% clear tube out there, MFG process isn't there yet...)If you have questions, let me know, this specific tube and unit sells for $3,200.00. Please know the differance between a $1,400.00 PVS-14 and a high end unit.  PLEASE don't email me if you know squat about night vision and just gonna say I looked them up and found one for $1400.00, cause you obviously won't know what you're looking at....Pics were taken for a friend to show a laser, you can see resolution on grass is crystal clear, I didn't have it focused 100% and used my camera phone holdng the unit, laser, and phone, so I did best I can."

I know that the side plates are missing but I don't know what else might be. i got if from my Dad's estate. It belonged to my Uncle and My cousing once left it out in the rain. It sat in a barn for decades and then my Dad got a hold of it. He machined a couple of internal parts out of aluminum at one point just to watch the lever move but never seriously tried to refit / refinish it. I wouldn't fire it if it was put back together but would make a nice wall hanger once finished. I don't know when it was made but the serial number appears to be 65682. The metal is pitted on the outside pretty much through out. Again, I would only sell this for it to one day be a nice decoration.It has an octagonal barrel that is 24"" long.I have no idea of the value of it. A couple hundred? Maybe? Ida know. Make me an offer I can't refuse. I would trade it for a cheap home defense 12 gauge with an 18"" barrel or maybe a .22 rifle, perhaps a youth sized one. Or possibly other trades? I'm open to hearing offers. Feel free to send me an emailI'm in Lyndenthanks

Functionality: 10/10 (it has been performing flawlessly even with bulk reload ammo).The barrel is 16"" length, 1:9 twist, and chambered in 556 so it will shoot both 223 and 556. The rifle was purchased brand new from Turner's Outdoor couple years ago and has had roughly 1000 rounds through the barrel. Upgrades include:- JP enterprise 3.5 lbs trigger spring kit which significantly reduces the trigger pull, but is still strong enough to fire all the bulk ammo we have been using.- Trigger job (polishing) so the pull is crisp with clean break.- Magpul rubber grip- Magpul foregrip- Hexmag (10-rd) magazine- Rubber stock pad- NcSTAR quadrail- Extended takedown pins (front and rear)- BAD-style magazine lock pinAlso comes with black M4 rifle bag.It is fully CA legal after the bullet button ban. The rifle is fitted with magazine lock pin similar to that of Battle Arms Development (BAD). When the action is closed, the pin is depressed and prevents the magazine release button from working, thus the magazine is fixed. When the action is open, the pin is pushed up by a spring, allowing the magazine release button to work and release the magazine. The spring is not too strong so it will not push the pin all the way out. The pin also won't come out even when you turn the rifle up-side-down with shaking. So you don't have to worry about losing the pin for whatever reason. To remove the pin, you will need a small plier or tweezer to pull it out. Both takedown pins are upgraded to extended length which allows quick takedown of the action to release the magazine.Price: $400Meet at Turner Outdoor in Torrance for PPTAddress: 18305 Hawthorne Blvd, Torrance, CA 90504PPT only, buyer pays transfer fee, no shipping, no trade, no cash-and-carry or off-the-record.If ads is still up, the gun is still available.
