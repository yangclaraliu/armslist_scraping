The 1911 in .22 caliber connects original design with an innovating concept. On one hand Sig stuck to existing design and measurements, this means a development with “Mil-Spec” specifications in inches. On the other hand Sig added additionally the magazine safety, drop safety and firing pin safety to meet present safety standard. 

Gun is super clean and has everything that came in box when bought and an extra mag. 

Should only use high velocity ammo and has no FTF FTE. Many of this guns have gone over 10k rounds with no issues. Youtube has video of one sot 30k rounds, so this gun is a quality gun build to last.

Don't try to make us think that because you get up early drive a few miles you can justify the 100% markup. I am fine with driving myself to Bimart, Walmart or wherever I need to go. I think I speak for most everyone out here when I say  just leave it on the shelf we will buy what we need ourselves. Last thing a reminder to anyone buying and paying these prices. As long as you're buying people will keep stripping the store shelves of ammo.

These are a MUST HAVE for any Winchester or WWII buff. These have never been used and were found in a storage shed where they had been sitting for quite some time. The shells are made of wood, metal and brass. I was told these rounds/shells were used for training and the weight of these are the same as an original shell. They are 30"" long and weigh approximately 28 pounds. Most are marked MK V 3"" 50cal training rounds most commonly mounted on Navy escorts and submarines. The Winchester printing was likely a post war addition but is well done, and appears to have aged consistently with the rest of the piece. My educated guess is they were stamped and used Winchester promotional material shortly after the end of the war."

Pioneered by Hornady for use in hunting bullets, this technology broke new ground in ballistic engineering and is now used in bullets for everything from match to varmint shooting. The secant ogive is a geometrically developed design that creates the most ballistically efficient profile, yet retains the optimum bearing surface. The combination of the slender point and increased bearing surface results in lower drag, increased stability, flatter trajectories and amazing accuracy.

Hornady's V-Max Bullets feature a polymer tip which enhances accuracy and promotes devastating expansion. The tip raises the ballistic coefficient for faster velocity and also acts as a wedge, initiating bullet expansion. The boat tail creates in-flight stability for long-range shooting. Hornady's swaging process creates precise formation of the core around the tip of the bullet, creating a build-up of energy which contributes to its phenomenal performance. The copper jacket provides the necessary bearing surface for maximum stability out of the barrel, and the jacket is built to withstand the fast twist rates of the most advanced varmint rifles. This ammunition is non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.

SIG SAUER® is offering several variants to its tactical platforms. Leading the way is our new SIG556 Russian, chambered for the widely used 7.62 x 39mm caliber. Using AK-type magazines, the shooter now has a more potent round for small to medium game. The SIG556R features a Swiss folding stock, and an M1913 rail for accessory attachment. The 16” barrel features four-groove rifling and a twist rate of 1:9.5”. The SIG556R measures 35.875” but can fold to 26”, making it ideal for situations where maximum maneuverability is required. For Special Forces requiring an accurate, more potent rifle, chambered in 7.62x39mm, the SIG556R sets a new standard for dependable operation and function.

Magpul Original Equipment (MOE) is a line of firearm accessories designed to provide a high-quality, economical alternative to standard weapon parts. The MOE line distinguishes itself with a simplified feature set, but maintains Magpul engineering and material quality.

It features an impact resistant polymer construction, easy to disassemble design with a flared floorplate for positive magazine extraction, resilient stainless steel spring for corrosion resistance, and an anti-tilt, self-lubricating follower for increased reliability.

The GEN M2 MOE is identical in form and function to the older model PMAG except that the optional Impact/Dust Cover is now sold separately.

These are marked down because they either have signs of high usage, small tear or rip in one of the components. For example, one set has a small tear on the bivy cover that will 'not' impact the water proof ability of the bag. Another set has small tear on the patrol bag and another has tear on the Intermediate bag. All are still fine for usage, just not as pristine as my other bags that I'm asking $90 - $100.

Patrol Sleeping Bag -- This outer bag, when used by itself is rated for temperatures down to 30 degrees. This bag is ripstop nylon Polarguard HV resin polyester fill and is water resistant. It has a reversible double pull slider which allows the top or bottom to ventilate and a draft flap to prevent heat loss. The hood adjusts for heat retention. Color: Green

Intermediate Sleeping Bag -- This inner bag is rated for temperatures down to -10 degrees. It has an anatomically designed foot box that contains twice the insulation as the bag for extra warmth. A Sewn in quilted chest collar prevents air drafts. Hood adjusts for heat retention. This bag is also ripstop nylon HV resin polyester fill and is water resistant. Color: Black

By joining the bags together, placing the black inside the green, you can weather temperatures down to -40.

Bivy Cover - The bivy cover is made of durable 3-layer GORE-TEX fabric. It is waterproof/windproof and is designed to protect yourself and your sleeping bag in inclement or colder weather. Includes snap fastener and slide fasteners. Color: Woodland Camo

Compression Stuff Sack - For stowing and transporting your sleep system. Compressible to one cubic foot. Has six 1"" wide nylon webbing straps adjusted by buckles. Nylon drawcord closure with a barrel lock. Color: Black

Will not split up sets. FTF Collinsville or Owasso and will consider Tulsa when my schedule allows.

It is 2 guns in one.  Besides being a great hunting shotgun with the 2 barrels, it is great for home defense.

It is about 9 months old and I have have put less then 100 rounds through it.  I love the gun and I am in no need to sell it.  I took the Aimpoint Pro off my new Daniel Defense DDM4 as I wanted a longer range scope on there.  I have hung the PRO on the KSG but have not taken it out to sight it in.  Great scope for the KSG.  

If you know what a KSG is then you are already ahead of the curve.   I have not taken pictures of it yet with the PRO on it so I am not going to post pictures at this point.  Anyone serious we can work something out.  The KSG has a manufacturers price tag of $1197 (used to be $880) and I bought it new in the box with Magpul MBUS sights, a fore-grip (no longer with it) and sling for $1100. I see some people were able to find some below MSRP but that was rare, especially for the updated ones.  If you want to know the difference check out You Tube.  When you watch the videos you will see where people were having FF and FE problems.  I must admit that worried me and when I got mine I bought several different boxes of ammo to try.  I had some low end Federals that would expand the empty casing and stick in the chamber which happened to be the ones I tried first.  I switched over to Winchester Loads and have used slugs, PDX rounds, buckshot, and bird shot with no issues at all.

I figured eventually they would go down in price but that has not happened yet in fact they are going up. As you can see from checking further on Armslist the price has gone up. And in the stores I think they are still hard to find.  But I haven't looked all that hard.  But what I do have is a gun that I spent money on and I am not opposed to making money and replacing the shotgun at a later date.  I bought this gun as a SHTF defense weapon to augment my longer reach stuff.  At 15 rounds (or 29 with mini shells) it is perfect for that job and once the Aimpoint is sighted it is a bad ass tool. 

So no need to send me emails telling me I am whacked for asking that much because it is just a number.  The value is to the guy who wants that shotgun.  As I said I do not need to sell it and not all that convinced I want to sell it but would be a fool not to accept that kind of return on my investment."

The P380 pistol from Kahr, chambered for the .380 ACP caliber, has a 2.53"" barrel and an overall length of 4.9"", with a height of only 3.9"". It weighs in at just under 10 ounces (9.97 to be exact) without a magazine. The P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The black polymer frame features 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength not found on competitive brands. The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 does not have a magazine disconnect nor does it have ""double-strike"" capability. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable, white bar-dot combat sights that dovetail into the slide, with optional night sights available.

The quality of the tiny P380 from Kahr is unrivaled when compared to competitive brands. The barrel is a premium Lothar Walther match grade polygonal rifled design, allowing higher muzzle velocities for hollow point ammo than other conventional rifled barrels on competitive brands. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. The P380 model features two high quality 400 series stainless steel 6 round magazines, standard with each gun shipped. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings.

The P380 is substantially smaller than Kahr's popular PM9, and proves itself to be an ideal concealed carry weapon. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Asking $500 OBO. I also like trades, feel free to make offers. Preferences are nice .17HMR setups, AR parts, .223 bolt guns, anything with a threaded barrel, etc. This does not include the scope or rings, and obviously does not include the suppressor. I can sell the scope and rings for extra if you are really interested. 

I have $600 into this rifle as it sits not including optics - it has exactly 500 rounds through it.

A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.
The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions."
