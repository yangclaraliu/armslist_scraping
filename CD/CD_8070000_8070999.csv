Rifle was manufactured in 1916, right in the middle of WW1. The United Sates was contracted through Great Britain to build these rifles during WW1. Rifle shoots .303 Brit. This is the predessesor to the much more common 1917 Enfield. Rifle was manufactured by ERA. Eddystone Remington Arms. Eddystone was a subsidiary of Remington that souly made Enfields. The United States didn't enter WW1 until 1917. Up until then, the USA was just manufacturing loads of stuff for allies. The P14s were primarily used as sniper rifles during WW1. This rifle has one of the nicest triggers I've ever felt on an old military rifle. Bore is very nice. These rifles had one of the strongest actions during WW1. P14/P17s are commonly built into big bore rifles because of how strong their action is. It's in very nice condition for being 102 years old. Whoever this rifle was issued to took very good care of it. Rifle is all matching numbers, even the barrel and the rear site. It also has its original volley sites. Most were lost during refurbishments, so this is a not so common feature. This rifle has a very hard to see import mark underneath the muzzle end of the barrel, so you know this rifle was actually shipped over to Europe and used. It wasn't just some trainer or arsenal rifle kept in the US. Very neat rifle, lots of history, can't say enough great things about it.Asking $800 OBO, shoot me a text at REDACTED if you're interested, can send plenty of pictures"

LOCAL DEALS ONLY From Arsenals Web Site:  Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.  Arsenal's Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal's hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.  Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal's meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.  Summary: SAM7R-51 | 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, Arsenal, Inc.'s US made hammer forged and machined trigger that features a wider trigger grip for more comfort on the shooter's finger and a Bulgarian Warsaw Pact length buttstock, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

While examining the condition of the rifle ( more on that in a sec ) he began to say he wasnt familiar with the law and didnt know how to complete this trade.  RED FLAG ALERT,  A topic already agreed upon during our emails when we selected the FFL to use.  I informed him of the process and when I said lets head over to the gunshop,  he began saying he didnt have any cash and upon further disclosure he had no means of payment for his end of the transfer. RED FLAG ALERT,  we agreed to meet the next day at the gunshop which was local to him.  Later that evening, he sent an email that someone had bought the rifle. RED FLAG ALERT.  Well, low and behold now the very same ad is listed again.  If that's not enough, the rifle condition is suspect.  Clean as his ad says perhaps.  Shot out is more like it, the action has heavy wear.  The wooden flutes that hold the arms of the retractable stock in place have cracks which will make an already loose stock even more sloppy.Value.  Way overpriced.  Anyone who can type the word google will find these in like or better condition for $350 on average as Plainsfield M1's are commercial clones and were not built with GI critical parts.  Avoid this guy or find yourself cheated.  You have been warned."

Color is ""Smoke Gray"", lightly used, no rips, stains, etc. Asking $80, goes for $134 new. I can meet near Tacoma, or find out about shipping if you're out of the area. The photo of the outside of the bag is the actual bag. The photo showing items inside the bag is from the manufacturer's website, and those items are not included. If you've never looked at these bags before, check out Vertx.com or YouTube and see some videos about how they work. You can set them up for off-body concealed carry. I used this bag as a low-key way to take my H&K SP5K out of the house, and it worked great. I sold the gun though, and don't have a need for it any more. Description from the manufacturer's website:Mini sling bag built for low profile, compact missionsThe EDC Transit Sling provides a low-profile, compact way to carry essential gear and access firearms with speed. Designed to hold a tablet or small laptop in addition to a weapon, the transit sling works effectively in the field and urban applications"

Please know your local laws as we will not ship where it is prohibited. The addition of the new APX semiautomatic pistol completes the full size pistol portfolio and makes Beretta one of the few manufacturers to offer full size polymer and metallic framed handguns in both hammer and striker fired operating systems. Designed specifically for military and law enforcement operators, the APX has been put through extensive testing and evaluation at the professional end user level. The result is a pistol that delivers superior performance in durability and reliability, ergonomics, trigger, and modularity. Utilizing a removable, serialized chassis frame, the APX can be easily modified with replaceable grip frame housings and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Each APX comes with 3 interchangeable back straps so users can best fit their hands and preferences. The APX’s aggressive full length slide serrations make slide manipulations easy under any conditions. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the APX’s magazine release button can be easily reversed, and the slide stop is ambidextrous. The APX’s trigger breaks at 6lbs and has a clear tactile and audible very short reset. The APX truly is the ultimate striker fired pistol from Beretta."
