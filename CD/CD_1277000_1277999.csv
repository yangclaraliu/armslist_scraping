It will come with everything you see in the pics including the 5 - 30 round magazines that are new in wrapper... The reason there are two grease gun lowers is because one is built in with the pistol grip and the other utilizes the factory stock.

It has two Grease Gun Lower Receivers (shown below) and the factory lower.  One of the Grease Gun lowers is aluminum and the other is polymer (like the factory USC lower).

I have never shot it and I am selling to fund other projects.

I have had a few people ask me so I will add this into the for sale ad. These lowers and conversion kits require minimal, if any, fitting. Mine are pretty much drop in. If you have any specific questions feel free to ask.




I know the process of selling a firearm over state lines and if needed I can ship to your FFL from my FFL for the cost of my transfer (I will pay shipping...).  So this is a deal that extends beyond Texas.

Methods of payment are Paypal, Certified Cashiers Check, or Cash for face to face, and can be discussed further in email.

I am asking $2,650 shipped to your FFL for this new set up. This is a good price since these range from (with less accessories) $2,500-$4,000+....

I am pretty firm in the price. Reasonable offers can be considered and though it is not preferable, I am open to trades...

If you have any questions, let me know! Don't hesitate to communicate!



******PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A PANIC PRICED SALE!!!  Just these HK USC rifles by themselves new, unfired (as this one is), go from $1,800-$2,000..the grease gun lowers are very hard to obtain and they can sell for $300 easy if new and unfired (as mine are)....the 5 magazines are all new in wrapper (as shown).******"

I have taken extrem care of it and it would stand side by side with a new gun. As most know the T/C's desirability is that it is a set of components that can be purchased separately and added to, or changed at will. My gun is the Super 14 version, in 30-30 Win, and .22 LR. I shoot around 5-6 rounds through the 30-30 barrel every year and around 50 rounds through the .22. At the beginning of dear season I take it out and put 5 rounds through it at 50 yards to check my scope is still on and then after seeing it put all 5 right dead above the bulls-eye where i want them, I put it in its holster and only fire it again if I'm hunting and get a shot. I have not shot anything with it latly. The last three years I have took deer with bow, muzzle loader, and my 30-40 Krag, but have not had one come out while caring the contender. That said, you give me a 150 gr bullet from any maker and I'll show you how to drop the biggest dear in the woods at 100 yds even wearing my bi-focals, haha. Everybody has their cartridge they like in a Contender and many go for the more exotic rounds, but I can attest from 20+ years of owning and shooting one, that the 30-30 round is as good as it gets. 1st: you can buy 30-30 150 gr bullets about anywhere. I went to the gun show out by McConnell here just a while back and picked up three full boxes for 10.00 a box. 2nd: If its any bigger, or hotter round than a 30-30, I don't want to shoot it out of a Contender anyway. 3rd: I usually hunt the Contender in the woods and very seldom get a shot with it over 100 yrds and the majority of the time its more like 20-30, but I know it will shoot 200 if I want to and keep it sighted for 100 dead on. I don't use the 30-30 for target practice, or plinking because it just has more recoil than I like to shoot for long periods of time, but its perfect for hunting and somehow I never feel the recoil when shooting game, haha. Now before I move on to the other other barrel let me tell you one more thing. Can you say here piggy piggy? You want a fun shooting hog gun, here it is. it will drop one like a bad habit. Secondly I have a .22 barrel same size and weight. The best fun you can have with it is to hunt you tree stand either before, or after deer season for squirrels. I don’t know if you ever have shot a 14 inch .22 bull barrel with precision adjusted sights, but you can head shoot them at 25 yards. I hunt through deer season and pattern the squirrels around my stand and then the week following deer season I put the whammy on them. I still have 3 in the freezer right now. What’s nice is you can shoot the .22 all day cheep and it has zero recoil in this gun, and then switch over to the 30-30 to hunt and never think about recoil. Right before hunting season sight in the 30-30 then switch barrels and take the .22 to the indoor range and shoot it for the evening, swap out the barrels and go hunting. Now for the scope it’s a Leupold M8-4X Extended E.R. Pistol Scope. I see them listed on gun sites for around $200.00. I like the 4 power on this gun. I is a good mix for me between target acquisition and magnification. I would use less magnification on a target pistol that I shot a at close range like indoors, but for big game hunting, its just right, and I pick up my target pretty fast with it. I adjusted it years ago out at the rifle range at Cheney Lake and have never had to adjust it since. I have shot 5-6 different brands of ammo, whatever the cheapest 150 gr they have the day I need some and it all shoots well. I changed out the factory forend with a 40.00 Pachmayr because I liked it better. I have looked at all the components and have come to the conclusion you can go onto gunbroker.com and buy all the components to build this exact same setup for 964.00 right now and I could part it out and list for that and I might, but I thought if someone like a nice set up like this, then I’ve kept it like new all these years, just for you. There is nothing in the world wrong with this gun, I’m just getting to the age where things are changing for me. This past season was exceptionally warm and I like to froze to death every time out. I’ve bought a new muzzle loader in 54 cal,.32 cal and 20 gauge for next year. What am I looking for. A. 700.00 cash, B. A really nice semi-auto pistol, or C. a 12 gauge 3 inch auto loader.

Dimension is a bolt-action platform you build on, season after season. no gunsmith required. start by purchasing one complete Dimension platform rifle in your favorite caliber, then choose a second barrel in the next caliber you want, as well as a bolt that matches the same letter series as the barrel: A, B, C or D. if both barrels are in the same family, you can use the same bolt. 

The basic Dimension is comprised of a universal stock (with a nice squishy recoil pad that has removable spacers), an aluminum receiver, and trigger (so-so at best). The barrel(s) interchange, as do the magazine(s), magazine well(s), and bolts. This enables you to convert the Dimension to .204 Ruger, .223, .22/250, .243, 7mm/08, .308, .270, .30/06, 7mm Rem Mag and .300 Win Mag.

The 92FS, designated M9 by the U.S. Military, not only meets or exceeds all U.S. Military testing guidelines, it totally rewrites them.From the jungle heat of Panama to the sandstorms of Iraq, the men and women of the U. S. Armed Forces have counted on the Beretta M9 pistol for over two decades of distinguished service and reliability. The commercial M9 pistol is the closest replica to the military M9 that a civilian may legally own. 
The 92FS, Beretta's premier full metal gun, most resembles the military M9 9mm pistol. Accurate out of the box, this workhorse features an open slide design that virtually eliminates jamming, a safety system that combines de-cocking with a slide-mounted positive thumb safety, and a combat muzzle crown. Beretta's proprietary black, non-glare Bruniton finish gives your 92FS a wear-resistant coating, which means it will stand up to any special duty. The Inox model features a stainless steel slide and barrel designed for corrosion resistance.

Here is a snipit from the web about the rarity of this gun:
From Chad's reference:
KMK514 special distributor model. Features a regular production KMK514 with Desert Camo laminated thumbrest grips. Known s/n range 216-42263 to 216-43553. About 1,500 produced for Outdoor Sports (OH) in 1990.
I might also add that a Ruger Mark II KMK 514 NIB at the current going prices for MK II's on GB will most likely top $600.00 at auction. The only MK II selling for more than them right now are the Government Target versions in stainless and I saw one of those go for $750.00 which would have been unheard of a few short years ago. Gun prices for the Ruger variations have really started to climb in the last few years!

Here's a similar, but lesser gun listed on Gunbroker with lesser grips and higher serial number than the above referenced guns.  No bids, but you can see the asking price:

454,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1277454,For Sale/Trade:  Original 3-Point Adjustable Stock From XM177 (?) CAR-15 (?) Need AR LPK or Magpul Stock,"Louisville/St.Matthews, Louisville, Kentucky",$ 1,"Listed On: Sunday, March 17, 2013",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I  recently was searching for a stock for my AR build and came across this one. Not my first choice, but it was all i could find at the time. I purchased it, and the guy i got it from asked if i needed any other parts. It turned out that his father had passed away and left him this stock along with a ton of other original M16A1-A2, XM-177, CAR-15 parts but he had no idea what any of it was. He even had 3 fully build M16A2's that his father had built and saved after he returned from duty! He's sitting on a gold mine and doesn't even realize it yet!

Anyway, i figured this stock would be great for someone that is doing a retro build, or maybe even used an actual XM-177 when they were in the service and maybe prefer this style stock!

The guy claimed that it was brand new, and for being roughly 30 years old, it does look pretty well taken care of. My guess is, he removed it whenever the M16 was issued to him, and maybe placed a different stock on it. Or this could have possibly been a spare he purchased for a later build he planned on doing, who knows. 

I believe it is a mil-spec stock, and mil-spec buffer. Not sure if they even had a commercial back then, but the buffer is not slanted at all in the back. 

It's not the aluminum model, but is more like a high density poly material. Still looks and feels amazing though, and will definitely withstand some blows!

I CAN also include the original buffer kit if you need that as well!It will include, buffer, buffer tube, buffer sprint, castle ring, and the other standard locking ring.

Trades:
AR Lower Parts Kit (complete kit with grip)
Magpul MOE or ACS in black or Tan
Cash (offer, no clue what it's worth.) If it's colt it would be worth a couple hundred, but i can't verify that it is colt.

She stopped traveling to trade shows last year when she fell deathly sick, and just recently passed away. Nobody really knew how to run these machines but her, so they gave them to me. I have figured out the basics, and tested all equipment to make it works 100%, and it all performed perfectly! I am just a busy college student though, with a very small apartment and no room or time to learn this equipment well enough to start operating a business.

I remember when my friend bought into all of this stuff, and i know she paid well over $45,000 for it all. Is it worth that now, most definitely not, nor will i be trying to get that out of it. I have successfully found about half of the machines that are in my possession on websites like ebay, craigslist and other forums that recently sold. The ones i did find range from 200$ to 800$ so there is still quite a bit of value in this stuff if you plan on selling it down the road. The main machine was 23,000 alone and i can't seem to find any info about them at all online really. None that have sold or are up for sale either.

But anyways, on to the equipment. Here is what i have up for trade

QLT Futura 100 Graphic Design Machine (This is the supposed $23,000 box, in it's prime of course) With the QLT software disk (Have found a TON of people looking for this disk. The machine won't work without it from what i've read! Allows you to do color modification to images with the turn of a knob (actually 5 knobs).

Shinko CHC-545 Thermal Printing system. This box is responsible for heating your wax image from the thermal paper to a heat transfer sheet to place on your products (T-Shirts, Hoodys, Sweatpants, Buttons, Mugs, etc!) I have found a few in non-working condition, or beat up shape for 400-600$. Mine is fully working and ready to print. Even have a roll or two of the thermal film.

Hitachi-VY170 Color Video Printer. I believe this is what operates the screen, kindof like a brain for the Futura 100 Box if i had to guess. You can load smaller thermal film into the front of this. This machine could be responsible for just the smaller items like buttons, hats and such. 

Sony UY-T35V Color Video Scanner. I would assume this scans your logo/photo/image onto either the Hitachi or Shinko for transfer to a transfer paper.

Hix Basix B-400 BT Heat Press. Hix no longer produces these, however some sites still have the base model B-400 for 900$ new. This one is an upgraded model with timer and thermometer. Looks only slightly used, heating element is great, thermometer is 100% spot on.

ex/press swivel press. This is a slightly smaller press, maybe used for easy maneuverability for the smaller products to be printed on. It swivels to the side, or pushes alright down onto the heat board. Heating element is flawless, but this is press shows a bit more wear then the basix. 

Trintron RGB Television. The futura machine will only display images on RGB screens, or other screens with a special adapter. This one is made almost specifically for the futura and will work as your editing monitor. You could probably use a newer monitor if you could find an adapter to convert the colors to RGB.

Panasonic KS-222 Camera w/ Tripod, camera mounts, upgraded lense, extra bright flash unit on top. This thing hooks directly up to the futura for image editing! Back when my friend ran this portable business she would do portraits of grand children, children and other people to print onto a shirt. 

There are endless possibilities with this equipment. There is some great potential if you'd like to get your feet wet in the custom t-shirt printing industry, at roughly 1/20 of the price it would cost to buy the latest equipment!

If interested please call/text REDACTED for more info! I would be willing to part one of the heat presses for smaller items if you would like! I am very bust with college, work and everything else going on in my life so if i do not answer, please leave a voicemail and ill get right back to you! Text however is the easiest form of contact, or e-mail!"

Remington Says - 
     Reliability has always been a longstanding hallmark of Remington‚ autoloaders. The Model 11-87™ is no different. Its patented pressure-compensating gas system is the biggest reason why. The same gun you use one day on the skeet range can be used the next day in the goose blind. And while many have tried to copy its dependable performance and versatility, none have come remotely close.
     Take the time-honored, all-weather dependability of the Model 11-87 action and combine it with the capability to handle high-payload shotshells. Now prepare to rule the flyway. Ultimately versatile for today's varied waterfowl (or any other) hunting situations. Its patented self-cleaning pressure-compensating gas system, delivers reliable shell cycling with virtually any load. Impressive.

American Tactical's state of the art polymer AR 15 lower reciever with a CORE 15 lower parts kit and a Bushmaster 6 position stock (new take-off). I've built several of these and have been impressed with the fit of the LPK's and overall finish. The trigger is also fairly nice and smooth for a stock trigger set. Feels much better than the PSA trigger kit I just installed in another lower. Has about a 5 lb. trigger pull. This is complete and ready to pin on an upper and ready to shoot.

Will swap this stock out for a New DPMS 6 position CAR stock if you choose or 
if you have your own stock, buffer tube, buffer, spring, castle nut and end plate 
I can take this one off and save you $65.00.

Be aware that this rifle is STILL considered a rifle but have posted as a parts gun.  The previous owner had attempted to mill the mag well (to take double stack mags) and in his attempt, appeared to have fallen asleep with the dremel in his hand and messed it up a bit.  It also appears that the front trunnion (feed ramp) was damaged as well.  The receiver may just be able to add metal to it to fix but will more than likely need a front trunnion.  Other than the obvious, this gun is in GREAT condition with minimal shots fired.  Ive fired around 5 single shots and the operation worked smoothly.
Given that this is a complete rifle, it is still considered this.  So if we agree on the sale, be prepared with a FFL dealer to handle the process.  I will also be in communication with you throughout the entire process.  Understand that I will take checks and money orders, but they will have to wait the timeframe to clear the bank before I ship the rifle.

If you are considering this press and want everything, please contact me right away. So price may be reduced, but not sure what or if I will return anything at this point.

I have had an overwhelming response to this ad, just everyone wants part or shipping or whatever, many issues.  Many want the #6 Shell plate only which I said I will not split up at this point.

I received this press for christmas this year.  Without having a mentor to teach me, youtube was working but not good enough.  I guess reloading is just not for me.  Now if I had a father, friend, uncle etc to teach me the ins and outs a lot of money can be saved here.
I have decided that I need repairs to my newly purchased house more than this press so it and all the dies, shell plates, scale, etc are for sale together only. Will not separate!

The Hornady Lock-N-Load A.P. Progressive Press was purchased in Dundee on 12/15/2012   Paid $423
I loaded exactly 1000 rounds of 9mm very slowly while watching videos and trying to teach myself.  I think I did pretty good for no instruction. Then I loaded 100 rounds of 45ACP.  Thats it exactally!  None of the other dies or crimping dies or shell plates etc were ever used.

Whats included:
-Hornady 9th Edition Handbook of Cartridge Reloading  Paid $32	
-Individual manuals for the following calibers: .38 Special, .357 Magnum, .45ACP,         9mm Luger, 10mm/.40 S&W, .44 Magnum    Paid $7.50 each or $45 total

-Hornady 9mm Luger #546515 3 piece Die Set  (used 1000 rounds)   Paid $46
-Hornady .44 Mag/.44 Special #546548 3 piece Die Set  (Brand New)   Paid  $46
-Hornady .38 Special/.357 Magnum #546527 3 piece Die Set  (Brand New)    Paid  $46
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for .45ACP (used 100 rounds)     Paid $20
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for 10mm/.40S&W (Brand New)    Paid $20
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for  9mm  (used approximately 600 rounds)   Paid $17
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for ..38 Special/.357 Magnum (Brand New)   Paid $17
-Lee Factory Crimp Die for .44 Special/.44 Magnum (Brand New)  Paid $17
-Hornady Shellplates - Each of these plates fit many more different calibers, too many to list. Reference Hornady's Shellplate Sheet for a complete list.
Hornady Shellplates  
#45  (.45ACP & 45 Winchester Magnum)    Paid $33
 #8   (9mm Luger, 30 Luger, 38 Super)    Paid $33
 #30   (.44 Special, .44 Remington Magnum, .445  Supermag)    Paid  $24
 #1   (25-06, 30.06, 270 Winchester, 7mm-08, 308 Winchester)    Paid   $35
 #6   (.357 Magnum, 7.62x39)      Paid   $35
 #10   (10mm, .40 S & W)     Paid $35
-Frankford Arsenal Quick-N-EZ Case Tumbler (used twice to clean to batches of brass)
  media in Tumbler is still good plus whats left in the cantainer of Corn Media I bought.
Can’t find receipt but I remember the tumbler was about $60 and corn media ?
-Black Media Sifting tray    Paid $9
-Hornady Lock-N-Load #050108 Bench Scale   Paid  $91
-RCBS Green Primer Flip Tray    Paid  $9
-Cabela's 6"" Electronic Calipers   Paid  $25
-Lyman Inertia Bullet Puller    Paid   $25
-Extra Lock-N-Load Die Bushings   2pack  Paid $11    &  10 pack  Paid $45
I purchased a 2-pack and a 10 pack plus the few that came with it.
These are what make the Lock-N-Load unique.  You can get your dies all set up for loading and with just a quick turn take those dies out and put in dies for a different caliber in minutes.
I also have a reaming case prep tool (never used)  Paid approx  $15  never used NEW

Optional but not included: I have many different gun powders, bullets, etc.
I have Hornady 10mm, 44MAG bullets for reloading
I have Berrys 45ACP, .40 S&W, .38or.357mag, and 9mm
I have 4= 100 bullet Winchester bags of 9mm for reloading
I have 4= 100 bullet Winchester bags of .38/.357mag for reloading
I have 2= 100 bullet Winchester bags of .380 Auto for reloading
Also have plenty of those plastic ammo holders for reloads, many calibers, most are new.
I am sure I am forgetting some things.  

Trades:
Colt Delta Elite 10mm in new condition, Bi-tone Springfield XDS plus cash 
Thats most likely all I am looking for.  Maybe a Crossbow 350FPS or better plus cash.  Not into old style relics, but make me an offer!

I don't expect this to last long since they are sold out everywhere.  I am not looking to double my money or anything but I am well over $1300 into this!  

I also went and bought a used table off of Craigslist that has metal around the edges to mount the reloader too.  This may be available.  I would really like to keep the table, but as they say, everything has a price.

Now one way to make this work on both ends is, since alot of the dies, shellplates, crimping dies, etc are brand new, I can just return them and that would bring the cost down for a potential buyer.
I am looking to get my money back at the least.
Make me an offer!
