-Sightmark Holograph Sight with 4 reticle selection ($160 one, not one of the $40 economy ones)

-The piece of mind that you can fight off the ""zombie invasion""when TSHTF
-The piece of mind that all the stores that I know of have plenty of cheap ammo for this IN STOCK
-A few stray ""Dremel"" marks where I modified the stock to accommodate the scope mount.
(not ugly-but then again, no one ever claimed an SKS was pretty to begin with)
-Shoots great! (did I mention Frosty?)
-The nice warm feeling of knowing that this isn't in the hands of a pinko commie anymore and is
now owned by a PATRIOT that'll use it for whatever he feels he/she must because the 2nd Amendment says it's your RIGHT!
If you think this costs more than you want to spend, that's fine. You can find plain ones on Armslist or in the stores for anywhere from $375-$500 depending on condition. But if you want this one, that's been well used and broke in, but has had a nice new stock kit, a really cool ""Holo-sight"" and a really big magazine AND 100 rounds of ammo,then it's gonna cost you $750. If you don't like it....you're free to write ""hate emails"" from yer mommy's basement because THIS IS AMERICA!!! I can then delete them and laugh at your sad, poor self.
Seriously....,if you want this, email me stating your intention to buy, a number that I can call or text, and be prepared to show a valid form of ID and sign a Bill of Sale, because I'm ONLY SELLING to a LEGAL, law-abiding CITIZEN! Thanks for playing....,and next time......get out and vote because this crap is getting ridiculous!"

Manufacturers Lifetime Warranty

A warranty. What else about a product says as much about how highly a maker values their own work? It’s a mark of integrity, an assurance that the person who built it believes in it enough to stand behind it. Lawyers, legalize and fine print have no place in it. And we feel ours both stands on its own and speaks for itself.
“The rifle you have just purchased has the simplest, most plainly written warranty you will ever read. This is no fine print. There are no exceptions. This CORE15 rifle has been manufactured and assembled with painstaking care and precision by proud US Veterans, trained by the best there is. If anything is not up to your standard, accuracy included, if anything goes wrong, gets bent, broken, cracked, misaligned, tweaked, snapped or otherwise, simply contact one
of our professionals and we will work to make it right. If you are the 5th owner and the rifle has seen 40k+ rounds, it simply….doesn’t….matter. We stand behind our products and we take care of our customers. That is our promise and your assurance.”
That is the Core Difference. See. Shoot. Believe."

From the manufacturer:
Manufactured by KCI of South Korea , Glock drop-free magazines for your Glock .40 handgun. These aftermarket Glock magazines have a hardened steel insert encased in high tech polymer (fully metal lined). This polymer coating protects the magazine and prevents deformation, even when dropped from a great height.

Fits all Glock .40 pistols such as the 35, 22, 23 & 27 models
Capacity: 31 Rounds
Caliber .40
Construction: Polymer/Steel
KCI manufactured and made to last.
This quality replacement magazine for a Glock .40 firearm is constructed from steel and polymer just like the factory Glock mags. Each will work with all generations of Glock's including those with ambidextrous magazine releases & can be rebuilt using factory magazine parts.

Like many new magazines, these have an extremely stiff springs from the factory. It may not be possible to initially load them to full capacity. Loading half of the listed capacity and leaving it loaded overnight before the first use will ease future loadings. These do take some break in time to get these to work in some cases.

Please note: This item is sold as is since it is an aftermarket Korean magazine and not a Glock factory OEM magazine. They are priced to sell no longer available and to most people are worth taking the plunge."

Second Mosin is a 1938 Tula with stamped matching numbers.  Very strong rifling, not counterbored.

Included is a sealed case of 880 rounds (2 sealed spam cans) of Bulgarian Factory 10 ammunition.  This stuff has a great reputation, and I personally have shot 4 to 5 cases of this same ammo with zero issues.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game."

It has a 1999 9.9hp 2stroke Yamaha outboard that runs like it is brand new. It is a very clean and reliable motor. It also has an on board battery charger for the trolling motor and fish finders. It keeps the trolling motor charged for days out on the water then just plug it in when you run out of juice so it maintains the battery life. The boat is aluminium and the shell has some dings in it which is the only problem with the boat but has been welded by a certified welder and doesn't leak at all and the performance isn't effected. It also has a bilge pump that works in case you take some waves. The boat is up to date on its registration because I take it out on the Columbia and it can handle to current. It is also great for trolling on any of the lakes around that have ramps. Price is $2100 but would be willing to take a trade for firearms in the same price ball park. If your interested or have any questions text or call Jay at 3zero7.3nine9.04one5 or shoot me an email. Can take out with you for test drive for serious buys or can show you motor running in tank.

Designed for 3rd generation night vision technology
The CompM4 sight can also be used by hunters and sport shooters who need night vision compatibility.
The performance of CompM4 sight is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation night vision technology.

The clearest, brightest image possible
Aimpoint’s unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot’s selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD).

Ready for use around the clock
With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4 sight is ready for round the clock use.

Unique features of the CompM4
High battery compartment

Unique features of the CompM4 and CompM4s
Compatible with every generation of NVD
ACET technology allows up to 80,000 hours (over 8 years) of daytime operation on one AA battery
Internal voltage regulator allows the CompM4 to be used with any AA size battery
7 NVD settings and 9 daylight settings
QRP2 mount has twice the clamping force of the original QRP, and the mounting knob is wider and shorter to improve operation and lower the risk of snagging on other gear
Mount base is keyed into to the body of the sight to absorb recoil
Mount base screws directly into the sight – no separate sight ring required.
500,000 hours of use on NVD setting
2 MOA dot for close combat and long distance engagement
Matches perfectly with Aimpoint® 3XMag
Unequalled light transmission
Front lens opening is threaded for addition of killFlash® anti-reflective device
Submersible to 150 feet (45 meters)
Vertical spacer included
Type classified as the U.S. Army’s new M68CCO
Improved adjustment caps are easier to remove and protected against impact
Can be used with a carry handle adapter for use on all M16 rifles
Mechanical switch for speed and reliability

The lower was from an upper I had previously sold, and worked flawlessly! The upper only has about 20 rounds through it, so is about as new as you can get! Also includes the original hardcase, paperwork, 2- 30rd magazines, and sling. I also have about 400 rounds that I would part with, and will discuss additional price with the buyer. Not looking for trades at this time. The only negative is it needs the bolt catch replaced to keep the bolt back after last shot (about $10), and there is a trigger ear broke, but does not effect function or reliability at all. Purely cosmetic, see pic."

If you have a nicer handgun I may throw in more items like a craftsman tool chest (top part only) and/or a good ol' American made Stevens double barrel 12 gauge. Make an offer, worst I can say is no thank you. Can email pics."

Check your local Bi-Mart, Wal-Mart, or your favorite gun shop. Support those who are bringing this into our community by hard work, not routinely cleaning out their stock, and ripping you off for double! Be patient folks, if we do not feed the beast, it will move on. Start a group of friends that can shop/trade for one another. This is out of hand.....we all deserve better."
