This rifle was built by Arizona Response System (ARS). These guys are the best in the business for building a better FAL, HK, or AK. This rifle is based off the FN FAL but much better and more accurate than any FAL could have ever been produced. ARS has the highest quality, and standards in the business and stand behind every gun the build.

A little about the FN FAL design:
The Fusil Automatique Léger (""Light Automatic Rifle"") or FAL is a self-loading, selective fire battle rifle produced by the Belgian armaments manufacturer Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN). During the Cold War it was adopted by many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, with the notable exception of the United States. It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by over 90 countries.

The FAL was predominantly chambered for the 7.62×51mm NATO round, and because of its prevalence and widespread use among the armed forces of many NATO countries during the Cold War it was nicknamed ""The right arm of the Free World"".

A British Commonwealth derivative of the FN FAL has been produced under licence as the L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle.

I am a FFL and will ship to any FFL in the lower 48 states. A postal money order or certified check is allowed,Please specify if you want insurance. Good luck.. If you want it shipped ASAP you can also pay me with a Wal-Mart moneygram. I hate walmart too but its the fastest reliable way."

I would love to be able to find .22 shells for normal retail prices.  And every other caliber for that matter. For whatever reason you choose to believe, there is currently a secondary (black market) for ammo that is thriving. It is the simplist explanation of capitalism. There are more people wanting to buy ammo than there is ammo for sale.... at retail prices anyway. Why is there no constant crying about .75 cent .223 ammo, or .50 cent 9mm?  I'm aware that it sucks and I wish it would all go back to normal, but let me break the bad news to you.... the entire global system is collapsing and the dollar will soon be a worthless piece of art.  When the dollar tanks and we are all hoping that a wal-mart truck will have some bread on it, ammo being for sale will be a thing of the past.  So I pose a question. When that time comes and you have two boxes of federal .22's left. How much will one of them cost me?  As a fellow gun loving American, will you give it to me for $25, or shoot me for getting close enough to your wife and daughter that I was able to knock on the door?  Odds are that you shoot me in the face!  None of my ammo is for sale and I advise you to hang onto what you have. I get on here to buy things that I'm looking for, at the best price I can find them. I am so tired of the crying!  Why don't you guys figure out a way to flag gunbroker. Pissing, moaning, and flagging adds seems to be a waste of time when the issue is nationwide!"

Do some research, these things are super dependable and have one of the nicest double action triggers on any handgun.  They are also very accurate.

I have the rear adjustable match sight that I will include with it, but right now it has mgw sights on it a flat black rear with horizontal operations and a white dot front. It isn't tritium but seems to glow a light green on the dark. I took out the shok buffer, recoil spring, firing pin spring, and replaced them with wolf springs the recoil spring being 16#. I still have the old springs ill throw in. I retensioned the extractor and polished the feed ramp. It will feed anything even empty casings. It came with an extended slide stop that would lock the slide back so I replaced the slide stop and will include the old one. The front strap isn't checkered so I put grip tape on that. I have si custom punisher grips on it now and will also include the pachmayer signature model wrap around grips that came with it. I bought it with no magazines but will include one chip mcormic 8 round magazine with extended removable base plate. There is also two holes tapped and threaded in front of the ejection port that were done by the previous owner. My only guess was that he had some sort of optic mount. I have the hex screws out of the slide ut will include them. I also have a flat black front sight from mgw that is new that ill throw in. This is a narrow tenon sight slide but I also have a flat black wide tenon I will throw in. The only thing this gun downstairs like seems to be reloaded speer brass from Georgia arms, but I'm sure that can be fixed by contouring the extractor."

I am asking $300 for everything.  Now about the gun... I purchased this gun from a guy at my work who had gotten the gun with the box lock and papers in a estate sale.  I guess the gun was in a tool box and the box and papers were in a box that was also inside of the garage.  The gun on the outside looks like it was in a toolbox lol.  The slide and outside of weapon has several small dings and wear, mechanically however this weapon is in great condition.  After I bought this gun and found the two extra mags and ordered the holster, I looked into them and can say I got very lucky.  Most of these guns won't fire accurately, consistently, ect. this gun IS very accurate for what and how small it is.  I can keep them all near the bullseye at around 15-20 yards.  I have heard of some of the J22s shooting bullets sideways and all kinds of horror stories.  I have cleaned this gun every time we have taken it out shooting and have found after awhile that if this gun is clean every single time shot it will cycle and function superb (mainly chamber/feeding ramp).

It will also come with the Henry Model Cantilever scope mount. Henry doesn't drill and tap nor do they cut scope grooves in the brass receiver of their Golden Boy, so they make and sell their own scope mount just for this rifle. The scope mount attaches to the top of the barrel by removing the rear site and bolting scope mount to top of barrel with the included screws. It's all new, it's all Henry. I intended on putting a scope on here, that's why I ordered their scope mount. I went through some pictures of Henry Golden Boys with scopes installed and found the scope that looks great on this cowboy rifle...it looks right- so I ordered it. It will likely be here after the rifle is sold. I'll put it on something else I guess. The wood is very dark and is beautiful on this rifle. I have the regular Henry, the ""blued"" .22 lever rifle and the wood on this Golden model is so much nicer. I have never had anything like this rifle; the lever action is smooth like butter, the brass gleams all over like it's made of gold...it will be hard for someone to shoot it because it is so incredible looking. It came with a velvet ""sock"" wrapped around the brass receiver, Henry shipped it that way. It's a piece of art. It's not cheap, but there's nothing else like it.
I've got $695.00 in it, with the scope mount... I want $600.00 for all of it, to sell it.  It is hard to find one of these right now. Henry Manufacturing experienced a Hurricane and then a fire at the plant over the last 10 months and production halted. That's made Henry .22's a little hard to get. But either way, I drove for a 5 hour round trip to get this one. Then ordered the scope mount from Henry. All total I've spent 695.00, I need 600.00 of it back in cash or trade.  I won't give it away. The pictures are with the Henry scope mount installed. You can see how it sits over top the receiver without touching the receiver. It's ready for a scope. The Henry box for this mount is in the picture too. I will take the mount off if you want...and put the site back on if you like. Or leave it the way it is and give you the rear site in a ziplock. However you like. Email if you want 10 or so more pictures.

The receiver is forged and after 8 years in the military I have never seen a receiver that looks so perfect. the lowers that are milled from a solid block of aircraft aluminum is nice but they don't know if there are impurities in the metal where as forged receivers are 100% flawless.  the receiver is marked multi-caliber which I know what is written on it makes no difference but its kinda cool as when I bought the receiver I bought 4 at the same time and only half of them said multi-cal. The best part of this lower is that while they are named Delaware machine and tool they are made locally right next door in Indiana.

Forged at a pressure of 67,000 PSI, these receivers are MIL-SPEC quality. All that you need to complete your lower is: fire control group, trigger and hammer pin slots, and the safety selector hole. These receivers DO NOT require an FFL and are not serialized. I can take either PayPal or money order. If you want to do PayPal, it will be as a gift or you can cover the fees, whatever you prefer

This is from Tucson. Arizona, and as long at your in the 48 states, Ill cover the shipping. Below is some information on the 80% lowers

What is an 80% receiver?

An 80% Receiver is a partially completed piece of material that requires special tooling and skills to be completed and considered a firearm. Unlike a firearm receiver it is not required to be transferred through a Federal Firearms Licensed holder (FFL).
Legalities

A lot of questions have been raised about how our 80% AR-15 Lower Receivers can be considered non-firearms. We've received a determination letter from the ATF stating that the ATF does not view this as a firearm because to complete the receiver it requires specialized skills and tooling.

Do I need an FFL to make a firearm?

In a short answer, no. As long as you can legally own the firearm in the state, county and city you reside in you are allowed to manufacture a firearm for your own personal use. No serial number is required however it is suggested to engrave a serial number, model and manufacturer on your receiver in case it is lost or stolen.

All National Firearms Act (NFA) regulations apply to your firearm. You may create a short-barreled rifle out of your firearm via a BATFE (Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosive) Form 1 after BATFE approval."

Forged at a pressure of 67,000 PSI, these receivers are MIL-SPEC quality. All that you need to complete your lower is: fire control group, trigger and hammer pin slots, and the safety selector hole. These receivers DO NOT require an FFL and are not serialized. I can take either PayPal or money order. If you want to do PayPal, it will be as a gift or you can cover the fees, whatever you prefer

This is from Tucson. Arizona

What is an 80% receiver?

An 80% Receiver is a partially completed piece of material that requires special tooling and skills to be completed and considered a firearm. Unlike a firearm receiver it is not required to be transferred through a Federal Firearms Licensed holder (FFL).
Legalities

A lot of questions have been raised about how our 80% AR-15 Lower Receivers can be considered non-firearms. We've received a determination letter from the ATF stating that the ATF does not view this as a firearm because to complete the receiver it requires specialized skills and tooling.

Do I need an FFL to make a firearm?

In a short answer, no. As long as you can legally own the firearm in the state, county and city you reside in you are allowed to manufacture a firearm for your own personal use.

These 80% AR-15 lower receivers are made from billeted Mil-Spec 7075-T6 Aluminum Alloy, making it the premier corrosion resistant metal. Forged at a pressure of 67,000 PSI, these receivers are MIL-SPEC quality. All that you need to complete your lower is: fire control group, trigger and hammer pin slots, and the safety selector hole. These receivers DO NOT require an FFL and are not serialized. I can take either PayPal or money order. If you want to do PayPal, it will be as a gift or you can cover the fees, whatever you prefer

This is from Tucson. Arizona, and as long at your in the 48 states, Ill cover the shipping. Below is some information on the 80% lowers

What is an 80% receiver?

An 80% Receiver is a partially completed piece of material that requires special tooling and skills to be completed and considered a firearm. Unlike a firearm receiver it is not required to be transferred through a Federal Firearms Licensed holder (FFL).
Legalities

A lot of questions have been raised about how our 80% AR-15 Lower Receivers can be considered non-firearms. We've received a determination letter from the ATF stating that the ATF does not view this as a firearm because to complete the receiver it requires specialized skills and tooling.

Do I need an FFL to make a firearm?

In a short answer, no. As long as you can legally own the firearm in the state, county and city you reside in you are allowed to manufacture a firearm for your own personal use. No serial number is required however it is suggested to engrave a serial number, model and manufacturer on your receiver in case it is lost or stolen.

We both sign receipts when we meet in person after the agreement has been made, I transfer ownership in writing for the Amount Agreed upon, we both sign our I.D numbers, signature, date of sale/purchase, and Address' along with the firearms Model and Serial #'s to prove that the information is correct on both sides. along with the Amount Paid in Legal Tender, it is witnessed, and kept just like when you buy a Firearm from an FFL, it's a Bill/Proof of sale. we both get a signature'd copy, and all of our email correspondence is saved to be kept in my private records.  It wasn't clear with the last few people, and one suspected criminal, so I felt the need to spell it out, in a walkthrough of my procedure and terms. The Records are kept to prove the legal transaction took place, dated, with the Buyer's and Seller's Signatures on both receipts, along with the Firearm model and Serial # and Amount paid. If it is too much ""Hoops"" to jump through then I am sorry, but try someone else, it doesn't take any more time than it does dealing with any other like-minded law abiding Gun Owner. Anyways, The price is $375 cash, I will wiggle with the cash price if you happen to have a Maxpedition LEO Jumbo Versipack (Or any Jumbo Versipack) to add in for a lower cash price, 9mm Hollowpoint Defensive ammunition (I am not buying into the Mumbo Jumbo Sandy Hook Bullcrap, and thus, I will not knock $60 off of the Cash price if you happen to have a $20 box of 25 9mm JHP's. I also do not accept a straight trade of just ammunition, I am looking for anywhere between 50-100 rounds, if you put the Brand, Grain, Loading (+P,+P+) I will be happy to let you know if that is what I would accept as trade. I am selling for a fair price, and I am not going to get ripped off by an ammo reseller. I know the real going rates on ammo, and what I am willing to knock off of the cash value if a ""Item+cash for Gun"" trade is offered. I am also looking for a Glock 17 Crimson Trace Laser Grip for a Gen 4, but I will not discount it as a brand new price for a used item. The Maxpedition Pack, or other similar style pack is a big+ with me and it is ontop of my list, but I know the price of the various models new, and I am not going to entertain a New Price for a used item, but I will offer a more than fair Cash Discount, as previously stated. A box or 2 of 9mm JHP Defensive ammunition (Depending on what kind it is, and the round count per box) is the second priority on my list. Sorry if that came across as rude, but there are some real Scumbags out there patrolling Armslist that for some reason, think this is the Black Market or something. I am a law abiding Citizen, a Nice, but currently annoyed person, and probably will entertain other trade offers as well if I am interested in it, if not the worst I can say is a polite No Thank you, but you know what they say, Cash is King."

I would love to be able to find .22 shells for normal retail prices. And every other caliber for that matter. For whatever reason you choose to believe, there is currently a secondary (black market) for ammo that is thriving. It is the simplist explanation of capitalism. There are more people wanting to buy ammo than there is ammo for sale.... at retail prices anyway. Why is there no constant crying about .75 cent .223 ammo, or .50 cent 9mm? I'm aware that it sucks and I wish it would all go back to normal, but let me break the bad news to you.... the entire global system is collapsing and the dollar will soon be a worthless piece of art. When the dollar tanks and we are all hoping that a wal-mart truck will have some bread on it, ammo being for sale will be a thing of the past. So I pose a question. When that time comes and you have two boxes of federal .22's left. How much will one of them cost me? As a fellow gun loving American, will you give it to me for $25, or shoot me for getting close enough to your wife and daughter that I was able to knock on the door? Odds are that you shoot me in the face! None of my ammo is for sale and I advise you to hang onto what you have. I get on here to buy things that I'm looking for, at the best price I can find them. I am so tired of the crying! Why don't you guys figure out a way to flag gunbroker. Pissing, moaning, and flagging adds seems to be a waste of time when the issue is nationwide!"

It doesn't get any finer than this. Original owner is an NRA Instructor and competition shooter - he put 30 logged rounds through this pistol. I took it in on trade and ran one cylinder (6 rounds) through it, so 36 rounds total down the barrel. Comes with all original swag from S&W (case, paperwork etc). Unless I told you it had been fired, you'd never know by inspecting it. This pistol is too much gun for me so I'm letting it go.

I will take $1,200 firm for the 629, or $1,400 in trade value. I also have around 150 rounds of 44 mag which I'll throw in since I don't have any other .44s so no need for the ammo. Most is high grade stuff.

Please no cash offers under $1,200 as I can easily sell it through the gun sale websites at that price - I just hate giving those guys commission.

This is NOT a beginners firearm. I don't suggest you purchase this unless you know what you're doing and have a need for a pistol of this quality.

More pictures available upon request and I'm happy to meet you so you can inspect the pistol prior to purchase, although you'll need to meet me in West Knoxville to view the weapon.

Will trade for:
No shotguns, bolt actions, or .22s - I try and be polite and respond to every inquiry, but not if they are in regards to the above listed weapons."

This auction is for a brand new FNH SCAR 17s in FDE (everything from the factory - paperwork, lock, FDE mag) w/ four (4) extra mags and two hundred and fifty (250) rounds of quality .308 ammunition. 

As you can see in the pictures this batch of anodizing gave the upper a beautiful shade of Olive Green which has been a bit harder to find than the lighter anodized colors. 

This has only been taken out of the box to verify the serial number and to take these pictures. The serial number has been blurred in the pictures. Unfortunately the 4 extra mags are black but you can easily trade them, paint them yourself, or have them cera/durakoted - the plus side is that all 5 mags are 20 rounders which have been relatively hard to find but keep popping up here and there if you're lucky. The ammunition is split into 3 50 count boxes of Magtech M80 and 5 20 count boxes of Winchester. 

I would prefer FTF w/ FL ID & CWP but will ship at buyer's expense to any FFL where this is 100% legal to own. 

If you have any questions at all please feel free to contact me and I will respond within 10 minutes - questions sent through here go directly to my phone that is on me at all times.

Trade info: At the moment I am currently looking for a trade. I would like to get my hands on a Colt M4 Carbine. I will put up cash for difference in value. I realize $1350 is a high price for this gun, but this is what I paid being that is not on the drop list. I bought it and converted it from a SSE. If I don't get any trade offers after a few weeks I will most likely make it eligible for cash sale.

After WWII the gun was proofed per English law, then shipped back to the USA. And here it is right now, 60 years later! The Parkerized finish is original, never arsenal redone, and is in wonderful condition! The bore is good with sharp rifling but has some pitting as well. The action is smooth and tight. The magazine is correctly ""G"" marked for General Shaver Co. Very unique and scarce magazine with the welded seam construction. This gun has a rack number ""58"" stamped on the base, so you know it served in the war! What a terrific find! British proofed Remington-Rand 1911-A1's don't come along very often! Don't let this one get away! It will be a wonderful addition to anyone's collection! ------

The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots.

XDM Features

XDM DESIGN

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.






(M)odel Contour Frame

The ideal grip angle of the XD has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.





(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations

Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.










(M)ega-Lock Texture

The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. 

The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.






XDM TECHNOLOGY

Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.






(M)elonite

Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 

The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M)is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.





(M)atch Grade Barrel

Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry










(M)inimal Reset Trigger

The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.




XDM INNOVATIONS

The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD is now captured in the all new XD(M) line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M) series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.






(M)inimal Error Disassembly


Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster.





(M)aximum Reach Mag Release


The modified contour of the new XD(M)grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.










(M)ega Capacity Magazine


The new XD(M) Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR Mag 
X-Tension (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the 
.40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.




XDM PERSONALIZATION

Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M), you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.






(M)ould-Tru Backstraps


With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.





(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System


A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position. 










(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case


Your total XD(M) experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M) it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M) pistols.





(M)agazine X-Tensions


With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions, SPRINGFIELD ARMORYhas added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)




XDM STANDARDS

In 2001, Springfield Armory set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. With the introduction of the XD polymer pistol, they did just that….






Loaded Chamber Indicator

The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.





Striker Status Indicator

The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position. 










USA Trigger System

The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.





Grip Safety

Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol."
