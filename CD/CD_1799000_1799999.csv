I got this gun before the wholesalers had them to sell to the stores because it was given by Ruger to a magazine columnist to do an article for review on a new gun. It's a stainless 8 shot single action pistol with a 5 1/2 barrel.This one is #413,anything #500 and below did not go out to the public . Gun has had maybe 100 rounds through it and still look as new. I have all the original papers ,books, test cartridge fired at the factory and box with it. Price is $1000.00 firm. I have plenty of .327 ammo if needed also ,at additional cost. The .327 is only 12% less than a .357 on the ballistics,with the recoil of a 38.Federal even makes a hydra-shock cartridge for it. Please include subject with Email and thanks for looking.

The gun itself is in excellent condition and has no function issues. It is an Armalite M15A2 w/ a 16'' barrel, flat top railed reciever, and adjustable spring loaded stock. If you haven't heard of the M15 (which is just an armalite ar-15) it's worth looking up. great reliability, acurracy, and reviews all around. 
The thing that I personally do not like about it though is that even though it seems to be mostly as interchangeable as any other AR, it seems to be somewhat proprietary w/ certain things and though it isn't a big deal it isn't what I'm looking for.
Great gun for somebody who wants a reliable one and done AR."

I purchased it about 3 months ago probably less than that. I have the receipt if the buyer wishes to view it. It has exactly 175 rounds through it, not a single issue with any of the various types of ammo I have used. Gun was made late last year according to the factory casing that comes with the firearm when purchased.

This firearm comes with the following:
-Case
-Fire arm with regular and extended magazines.
-All paperwork ( I did not fill out the lifetime warranty card so new buyer can do that if they wish)
-Factory casing and envelope stating born on date.
-Magazine holster
-Firearm holster
-Magazine loader
-Talon gun grips (Rubberized texture) perfect for added control and concealed carry as it won't rub you raw like sandpaper grips. I can remove these if buyer wishes before purchase. However they are a great addition feel free to google reviews on these.
-Mirror polished barrel/trigger lever/guide rode/pins not some cheap at home job professionally done and it shows.
- Firearm has been meticulously maintained in the short time I have had it. Stripped down bare every range trip cleaned and lubed. You would be hard pressed to find residue anywhere on this firearm.



Only reason for selling is I have purchased another pistol and do not need this one. I am in no rush so please do not waste my time with ridiculous offers, I will keep it. Btw this is not the essentials package it is the ""upgraded"" version with the extras that come in the case.

Face to face cash only. Buyer must be willing to sign bill of sale and I will need a copy of your drivers license, you can block out your address if you wish however your picture and license number must be visible and it must be valid not expired.

The person that owned it before me was a hardcore hoarder so there is a decent chance it hasn't ever been fire, but I am in no way able to say either way. It still had cosmoline crusted styrofoam pieces in the barrel when i bought it though. Super clean gun that comes with 5 30-round magazines. The magazines are all in plastic and covered in cosmoline or some kind of packing grease. Since i've never fired the weapon, I have never opened the magazines. The gun was originally owned by an avid collector of firearms who has since passed. I purchased it from his estate (consigned the collection through a family member's gun shop) and am now in the middle of an AK build that I would like to finish but cannot until I sell this rifle. I am accepting offers on the rifle for the week, if i hear something I like I'll take it, if not i'm going to consign it at a local shop. Thanks for your interest! Enjoy the pictures, if you have any questions you can text me at 918-three 6 one-six 2 7 eight.  

I will post current offers if any are received if I didn't accept them so that anyone interested has a reference point.   $500 so far."

This gun was purchased new in March 2013.  Since then I have put somewhere around 1000 flawless rounds through it (did not keep an exact count).  It has been cleaned and oiled after every trip to the range.  It does have an idiot scratch (my first 1911) and faint stain in the checkering on the housing.

Offering at $2400 which is a $500 savings over retail/pricing for a new Executive Target  either directly from Ed Brown or from gunbroker, gunsamerica or other online sellers (possibly more if you include potential costs for shipping, FFL, taxes).

Also included are an extra set of Timber Smith Grips (does come with original grips), 1 Ed Brown 7 round mag, 2 Chip McCormick 10 round power mags and the Ed Brown soft case.  
The extra grips and extra 2 mags are worth around $100, adding even more savings over the cost of purchasing new.

All 3 pictures were just taken for this listing.

Please no lowballs, crazy offers, or offers to trade.  I am only listing to put some money into another toy, if there are no reasonable offers to purchase the other toy will wait.

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W, the SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm.

This gun was purchased new in March 2013.  Since then I have put somewhere around 1000 flawless rounds through it (did not keep an exact count).  It has been cleaned and oiled after every trip to the range.  It does have an idiot scratch (my first 1911) and faint stain in the checkering on the housing.

Offering at $2400 which is a $500 savings over retail/pricing for a new Executive Target  either directly from Ed Brown or from gunbroker, gunsamerica or other online sellers (possibly more if you include potential costs for shipping, FFL, taxes).

Also included are an extra set of Timber Smith Grips (does come with original grips), 1 Ed Brown 7 round mag, 2 Chip McCormick 10 round power mags and the Ed Brown soft case.  
The extra grips and extra 2 mags are worth around $100, adding even more savings over the cost of purchasing new.

All 3 pictures were just taken for this listing.

Please no lowballs or offers to trade.  I am only listing to put some money into another toy, if there are no reasonable offers to purchase the other toy will wait.
Local FTF sales only at this time, must be willing to show Ohio ID and sign Bill of Sale.  If there is no local interest I may list on gunbroker at a later date."

I bought this shot gun new about 15 years ago and used it for dove hunting.  It has sat in my safe for about ten years unused.  I actually sold it on Armslist a few months ago but the guy returned it saying that it was jamming (I should have test fired it before trying to sell it).  When I got the gun back I took it out back and fired all the shells that I had. I fired 19 shells of which 3 got hung up while trying to eject.  I am not sure what is going on with this gun but I would assume it's probably something simple such as a spring or possibly it didn't like the cheap shells that I was using ( although I'm sure I would have used the same cheap shells back as a teenager and it always worked fine then). The gun is in near excellent condition but I do not feel like investing any money into the gun as I do not want wish to keep it. I would like to sell or trade the gun as is. I prefer to deal locally and buyer must have ccw and ID (or ffl transfer) and be willing to sign a bill of sale."

A hotly contested gun-control law that was passed in 2007 is finally ready to be implemented, Attorney General Kamala Harris said: a requirement that every new semiautomatic handgun contain ""micro-stamping"" technology that would allow police to trace a weapon from cartridges found at a crime scene.
The law, made California the first state to require micro-stamping, which engraves the gun's serial number on each cartridge. Gun manufacturers said the technology was expensive and ineffective. Harris announced that micro-stamping had cleared all technological and patenting hurdles and would be required on newly sold semiautomatics, effective immediately. The announcement should send a message to other states, the Obama administration and the gun industry that ""this is the future.
Worse yet, Manufacturers will be unwilling to add this expensive feature to guns sold in a single state, and will instead keep manufacturing weapons for the other states, where demand already far exceeds supply. The effect, would be a ban on new semiautomatic handguns in California. Get it now before it's too late.

This gun was purchased new in March 2013.  Since then I have put somewhere around 1000 flawless rounds through it (did not keep an exact count).  It has been cleaned and oiled after every trip to the range.  It does have an idiot scratch (my first 1911) and faint stain in the checkering on the housing.

Offering at $2400 which is a $500 savings over retail/pricing for a new Executive Target  either directly from Ed Brown or from other online sellers (possibly more if you include potential costs for shipping, FFL, taxes).

Also included are an extra set of Timber Smith Grips (does come with original grips), 1 Ed Brown 7 round mag, 2 Chip McCormick 10 round power mags and the Ed Brown soft case.  
The extra grips and extra 2 mags are worth around $100, adding even more savings over the cost of purchasing new.

Please no lowballs or offers to trade.  I am only listing to put some money into another toy, if there are no reasonable offers to purchase the other toy will wait.

These grips in black are sold out most anywhere you look online and locally. 

From their website:
The Magpul MOE pistol grip for AR-15 rifles is an inexpensive upgrade to the AR-15's ergonomics. I've found that for most people, the standard A2 grip is simply too small for maximum comfort and ideal trigger placement for precision shots. The Magpul MOE is more comfortable, durable, and ergonomic than the standard A2 pistol grip, and costs less than other after market options.

The MOE grip provides Magpul quality, feel, and durability in an economical, drop-in upgrade for the standard AR15/M16/M4 pistol grip. The ergonomic, hand filling design combines aggressive texturing with storage core capability. With a similar shape to a 'medium' sized MIAD, the one-piece reinforced polymer construction provides simplicity and a reduced cost while still maintaining the durability needed to withstand operational environments. The MOE Grip accepts optional storage cores for gear stowage and includes a basic grip cap. All mounting hardware included.

Made in U.S.A.

I bought this grip for $20.98 + tax. Just want to get my money back, so $22.00 is what I'm asking. FTF in Mustang/Moore.  Please call or text 405-923-4o4o if you're interested. Thanks."

Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights."

This gun was purchased new in March 2013.  Since then I have put somewhere around 1000 flawless rounds through it (did not keep an exact count).  It has been cleaned and oiled after every trip to the range.  It does have an idiot scratch (my first 1911) and faint stain in the checkering on the housing.

Offering at $2400 which is a $500 savings over retail/pricing for a new Exec. Target  either directly from Ed Brown or from other online sellers (possibly more if you include potential costs for shipping, FFL, taxes).

Also included are an extra set of Timber Smith Grips (does come with original grips), 1 Ed Brown 7 round mag, 2 Chip McCormick 10 round power mags and the Ed Brown soft case.  
The extra grips and extra 2 mags are worth around $100, adding even more savings over the cost of purchasing new.

5.56 NATO (223 Remington), 16 in, 6 Point Collapsible Stock, Black Finish, 30 Round Detachable Magazine

This rifle was built for the price conscious user who is looking for a good quality and inexpensive AR15 style rifle for range practice and/or home defense. They were able to do so by changing some features that should NOT upset the majority of target shooting users out there. The barrel used is made in house – 16″ without m203 cuts, melanite coated inside and out, 1:8 twist rate, and 5R rifled. The 5R rifled barrel designs have been in use by Thompson Center, a S&W owned company, for a long time in order to produce an inexpensive and very accurate product. Those looking for a milspec rifle, this isn’t the one for you, but melanite has proven itself a durable, corrosion resistant, uniform coating that can be considered more accurate than chrome lining. Other differences on the Sport models include: an upper receiver lacking a dusk cover and forward assist, a lower receiver with integral enhanced trigger guard, LMT style removable rear sight and A2 style front sight, chromed gas key and bolt carrier and other standard A2 styled parts. For those budget conscious shooters out there looking for a rifle that offers good quality with a low sticker price, the M&P15 Sport rifle may be just what you’re looking for.

WTO(obtain): .22 WIN MAG ammo

So, i'd like to make another video with my PMR-30, this time an ammo comparison for ""Self Defense"" purposes. I have CCI JHP, Winchester PDX1, and Regular FMJ. There are different ideas toward personal protection in a .22Magnum round, some say an FMJ tumbling is best, others say one that has some expansion and even penetration is better. There are those that swear to the FMJ as comparable to that of the big brother .223, others want as much expansion and less penetration. I would like to perform a test and record the findings for all to see, most tests out rigt now are with 2"" barrels, the PMR-30 has a 4.3"" barrel, is semi-auto, and holds 30+1rds!

I understand those of you that have your .22WMR ammo want to keep it, so do I, but I am looking to see who can send me one (1) round of each type .22WMR to me so I can test it in ballistics gel? Types I would really like to try is the Hornady series including the FTX bullet, and the Gold Dot .22wmr. Who would like to contribute to this comparison?
