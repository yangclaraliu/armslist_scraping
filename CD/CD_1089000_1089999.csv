This 1966 Diana has been unfired and in a climate controlled safe for the past 30+ years. Before 1980 this gun was RARELY shot at all and last year I only put (2) shells through her at the range to show off and to make sure she worked properly and she does! Provenance on Browning letterhead states gun was made for and delivered on December 23, 1966 to Abercrombie & Fitch, Madison Avenue, New York, New York which makes her even more rare.(Browning document comes with gun) One look, like me and you'll want this gun for your collection and even though the group of buyer for such a fine gun are small, this gun will NOT last long. Signed by master engraver Gino Cargnel with serial # S24XX S6. Pictures do not show just how gorgeous this gun is and with the purchase comes the original 1966 Browning case, also in excellent condition. Please see pictures and I can send as many more as you need, but please NO low ball offers as I do not need to sell this gun. I've had it for a while and like any collector, it's time to move on to the next thing that catches my eye. Thanks for looking and MAKE ME AN OFFER!"

You already know what a Saiga-12 is, so I won't bore you with info on the weapon. This one's been fired 20 times, the scope was zeroed using 2-3/4"" Winchester slugs at 50 yards & it will ""cloverleaf"" all 3 at that distance. I put this shotgun together to hunt dear here in Ohio, but never got to take into the woods. The magazine plugs can be installed in the standard capacity mags so the weapon can be legally hunted with. For those of you unfamiliar with the Russian Collimator sights, they are the best, non-magnified electronic ""dot"" scope made for the Kalashnikov series of weapons & they work fantastic on Saiga shotguns. These sights are TOUGH & are quickly mounted & removed from the weapon via its side rail. If you own a Kalashnikov, you already know this is the best way to scope one. The sight has multiple reticles (dot, pyramid, NATO dot w/pyramid, & cross) that can be cycled through by pressing a button on the side of the sight. The reticles are also adjustable for brightness. And this is all done while running on plain ol' AA batteries. I have one of these scopes on each of my AKs. The buttstock  has a raised cheek piece for use with the scope. When you remove the scope to use the vent rib & bead sight, you can shift the cheek piece over & out of the way. The only part of this weapon that is not original Russian is the tri-railed forearm. I believe it was made here in the states. Well, that's it. I never had anything mechanically modified because, well, it's a Kalashnikov, works! I put 20 slugs through it, cleaned it, & placed it in my safe. Now I need room for more toys, so it has to go. The first $900.00 gets it all. Thanks."

Multivault Biometric Description
            GVB2000 Bio uses biometrics, specifically fingerprint recognition, to access the safe contents. A high-performance algorithm is used to achieve speedy identification of enrolled fingerprints; and at the same time has a very low False Reject Rate (FRR) for a given False Accept Rate (FAR). This self-learning algorithm of the GunVault Bio adds new minutiae to the fingerprint templates each time a user touches the fingerprint sensor, which decreases the likelihood of FRR, updates slight changes that might occur over time to an enrolled fingerprint, as well as to help distinguish variations between the enrolled fingerprints. System can handle a maximum of thirty fingerprint templates.

He sent pictures, and I inquired further on any and all blemishes on the gun.  He informed me the wood was excellent, and there was only 1 spot of bluing rubbed under the lever.  When I picked up the rifle from my FFL it had a large scratch on the barrel which was easily felt with a fingernail, and 2 spots on the barrel where the bluing was nearly worn thru.  He never mentioned those issues in our initial negotiations.
Before I ever picked up the rifle, however, my FFL called me and said it was the worst packing he had ever seen.  Alarmed, I contacted Rick, who informed me if there was a problem, he'd take the rifle back and refund my money. Awesome!
Not awesome, because when I picked it up, and saw the scratch, and 2 spots of worn bluing, I contacted him and asked if he would take it back, or send me $40 towards me getting it reblued.  He refused both, and any attempts to make it right.  He is now accusing me of extorting him, and claims I'm crazy to expect a 40 year old rifle to not have some issues.  He also claims he owned the rifle for 20 years, but never knew of the scratch, or the 2 worn blued spots.  He doesnt understand my major gripe is that he omitted informing me of those issues, when in good faith he should have, and if he didnt know about them (highly unlikely), he should have done the right thing and taken the rifle back with a full refund upon receipt.
Buyer beware, do not deal with Rick Pickering.  Feel free to email me if you have other questions about Rick Pickering.

the bore is nice and shiny and it is in a camo pattern that i cant identify but it lookd like the old army woodland pattern kind of. (i think its ugly but beauty is in the eye of the beer holder, lol). it can chamber the 3 1/2"" 12 Gauge magnum loads for turkey and waterfoul hunting. I have not shot it yet, so i cant tell you how it shoots, but it has good reviews. the saftey is mounted on the top of the grip so it is a good gun for lefties (I am one) and the slide lock lever is by the back of the trigger guard so it is fast into action. it has a 24"" barrel and bead sights. it is drilled and tapped to mount a scope. i believe it has a turkey choke but am unsure. you probably know more about it than i do.

NOTE: this shotgun is USED not new. it is also apparently an older model of the 835 with an un ported barrel. it has some very light scratching on the stock that you have to look hard to see and the slide rails show a little wear. i have pictures of all the wear areas except the scratches on the stock because they will not show on the pictures.

I am pretty open to trades, tell me what you've got worst i can say is no. I am in the market for a shotgun so first pick goes to them, failing that old S&W revolvers, small CCW pistols, or any good rifle, especially a lefty rifle.

The HV-Eagle-30 proof on the right side of the trigger guard indicates the pistol was issued to Austrian police forces in 1930. During the Nazi era, in about 1940-1941, it was reworked for issue to the German Police forces. As part of the rework, the pistol received a new barrel chambered for 9mm Parabellum. To indicate the change, the slide was stamped with ""08"", the German designation for the 9mm service cartridge. The pistol was also marked with the Eagle/N test proof on the barrel and left side of the frame as well as the Eagle/L Police acceptance on the right. The frame, slide and barrel all have matching serial numbers and the Steyr ""K"" proof is present on all parts. There are NO import markings as this is likely a WWII ""bring-back"" pistol. The arsenal finish rates about 92-93% overall with some thinning to the grip straps and sharp edges. There is no significant rust or pitting.

They are fiber optic sights that glow brightly during the day and Tritium night sights that glow far brighter than Meprolights or Trijicon night sights. The HUGE draw to this package is that it includes TWO HIGH CAPACITY mags with the nearly impossible to find grip extensions on them as well as one regular 9 round mag with a +1 extension for an additional pinky grip on the pistol.

I have two of these pistols and this is my backup that is set exactly like my main carry pistol. I've fired thousands of +P .357 Sig rounds (basically a regular .357 magnum round then) through it with zero failures or ill effects. It is the ultimate in reliability and durability. It is a used pistol, but I cannot find any marks anywhere on the pistol, so it is in like new condition. I see no need to keep money tied up in a 2nd one when I'm clearly not going to need it.

I have fired exactly 50 rounds through this pistol to make sure there were no issues with it and then cleaned it to the point it looks like it hasn't been fired. It comes in the original box with the above listed items. It is simply shown in a padded case because that's what I have it stored in in my safe. You want 13 rounds of .357 in a pocket pistol? Here is your chance. With the current climate and administration, you may not get another chance to own this setup. Please do not bid if you are not allowed to have high capacity magazines in your state.

Feel free to ask any questions. The firearm must be sent to an FFL dealer and I must have a signed copy of his FFL license for my FFL dealer to ship the pistol. Winning bidder to pay $30 shipping to their FFL dealer. It will be shipped insured for the full amount and you will receive tracking numbers. Payment by certified funds. As usual for my auctions, I am pricing this pistol to sell for the 'buy it now' price. Thanks for looking and good luck!!"

In fact, just took it to PPGC today and shot a round of trap with it just to make sure everything working properly.  The wood is in 98% like-new condition with only a tiny couple of scratches that are hardly noticeable and the receiver is in good condition also with just a minor bit of wear on the top of the receiver.  On breakdown everything is nice and clean, everything that's supposed to be shiny is still very shiny :)  Makes a great semi-automatic shotgun for bird hunting.
