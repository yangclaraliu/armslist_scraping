This rifle is absolutely as new, not a mark on it anywhere, the finish is deep blue and is flawless, the wood is a beautiful walnut with a low luster satin finish. I bought it new 2 years ago, scoped it, bore sighted it with a laser at my kitchen table, fired 4 shots thru it in my backyard to confirm zero, then cleaned it, put it in a silicon impregnated gunsock, then into my climatically controlled vault where it has sat untouched since. It is as new in every way. The scope is a Burris Signature Series 3-9x50 and is also as new with a gloss finish that matches the rifle perfectly, the controls are smooth and function correctly, and the Burris glass is of course, brilliant. Burris scopes are fully warrantied by the Burris factory forever for any owner. It is set in matching Burris Signature Rings. This rifle retails for $1004 according to the Remington website, and they are very hard to find, like most semi autos now. My price is firm but very reasonable, considering that the scope and rings alone cost me $500. I will also include the box of Winchester ammo I bought with it, there are 16 rds remaining in it. I have the original Remington box and owner's manual. I will meet in a public place for a FTF cash and carry deal. I will not ship this rig out of state and the buyer must be a Maryland resident who is not prohibited in anyway from owning firearms. Please do not ask me to participate in any kind of strawman, third party, or out of state deal. Thanks for looking, pls email with any questions. I'll post some pictures this weekend, but the images at the Remington website are of a higher definition than this website can upload."

This is the closest you get to the Russian military's AK-47. Everything else is just a variant. This AK features the chrome lined barrel, and is able to accept standard 30 round magazines. It has only been used lightly, and cleaned thoroughly even though you could go through thousands of rounds and never need to clean it once. If you're looking for a rifle that'll never let you down in the worst conditions, you've found it.

Everyone wants to shoot it.  It's got some kick, but a bit less than my .44 for sale.  Chrome nickel plated, made in Israel, functions flawlessly and is surprisingly accurate.  Excellent for downing bears or unnaturally large zombies.

I've gotten quite a bit of interest in this piece but it seems that some of you out there are not really aware of this gun's true value.  Therefore, it's time for a short lesson.  Below is a link to a current auction on Gun Broker:

http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=339577027

With 23 hours left, this auction has received 18 bids and is currently at $1500.  The gun being auctioned is the exact model and finish that is for sale in my ad.  So, why am I asking $1300 instead of $1500? Well, I know how you collectors love boxes and because this firearm does not come with the original box, I've reduced the price.

So, let's do each other a favor and avoid wasting our respective times.  An offer of $900 is a low ball offer and will not be accepted.  I don't care what you think they're going for.  I've done my research.  I know what this gun is worth.  Either trade a quality full-size 9mm plus cash or make a REASONABLE cash offer.

If sold in CT I will obviously only include the 10rnd mag, and the price will reflect the lack of the 14rnd mag. I have more photos I can include since I'm only allowed to put 3 on here.

I have put about 50 rounds through it. It is clean and the metal finish is flawless. The stock is flawless except for a 3/16"" X 1/32"" dent in the underside of the wrist (where your fingers wrap around). The owners manual and trigger adjustment tool are included. I do not have the box. If you want the lock that came with it, I'll throw that in too.

The 12 currently is sporting a Seals 8-32 X 50 mm, 30mm tube scope with red & blue illuminated range finding reticle, side focus (parallax adjustment) and target knobs (1/8"" adjustments). It's mounted with Leupold standard rings and bases. The rifle is zeroed for 100 yds. It is capable of shooting sub - 1/2"" groups repeatedly. I know, I've seen me do it...

New, this rifle sold for $1100.00 retail. The scope sells for $450.00. Ring and bases retail at around $80.00. That would be a $1630 investment. If you'd like it as is, with the optics, the price is $1100.00. If you'd prefer to mount your own optics, the price would be $750.00 for the rifle alone. Shipping is $35.00 (It's heavy!)."

This rifle and scope are both in like new condition.  The finish is deep blue and is flawless, the wood is a beautiful walnut with a low luster satin finish. I purchased this rifle brand new 2 years ago, scoped it, bore sighted it with a laser at my kitchen table, fired 4 shots thru it in my backyard to confirm zero, then cleaned it, put it in a silicon impregnated gunsock, then placed it in my climatically controlled vault where it has sat untouched since. It is like new in every way. The scope is a Burris Signature Series 3-9x50 with a gloss finish that matches the rifle perfectly, the controls are smooth and function correctly, and the optics are crisp and brilliant. Burris scopes are fully warrantied by the Burris factory forever for any owner. It is mounted in matching Burris Signature Rings. GUN TESTS Magazine held a 'shootout' review between a Remington 750 the same as this model, and a Benelli R1 semi auto rifle and a Browning BAR II Safari semi auto rifle and the Remington 750 Woodsmaster beat them both hands down in every category; that is a pretty good recommendation for this rifle and what it is capable of. This rifle retails for $1004 according to the Remington website, and they are very hard to find like most semi autos now; there are also after-market 10 round magazines made for it. My price is firm but very reasonable, considering that the scope, rings, and base cost me $500. I will also include the box of Winchester ammo I bought with it, there are 16 rds remaining in it. I have the original Remington box and owner's manual. I will meet in a public place for a FTF cash and carry deal. I will not ship this rig out of state and the buyer must be a Maryland resident who is not prohibited in anyway from owning firearms. Please do not ask me to participate in any kind of strawman, third party, or out of state deal, and I am not interested in trades. Thanks for looking, pls email with any questions."

The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, folding front and rear sights for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability.

Fits great into the AR carry handle if you don't have a flat top.  The best thing about this scope that you won't find anyone mention online about is that it is BAC (bindon aiming concept) capable.

The barrel is 4.25” long and the pistol weighs 1.96# or 31.4 ounces. It comes with two 13 round magazines (blocked to 10 rounds professionally by a gunshop), hard case and operator’s manual.  These pistols were only available for a very short time and are hard to find.

I purchased this a few weeks ago from a Mainland dealer and discovered when it arrived that my hands were too big for the grip.  It has never been fired and never taken apart.  All I did was take it out of the box.  It is brand new, serial number indicates it was produced in 2012.  I also have a Houge rubber grip for it, still in the package.

The 92 series semiautomatic pistol operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and time-proven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. INOX version:

Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the magazine be lost or damaged.
Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block.
External Hammer Design.
Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever.
Sure, Firm Grip: The front and back of the grip are grooved on the 92FS and M9, while the M9A1 and 90-Two feature checkering. 
High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

I am located in Kona.  Gun is registered to me and will need to be transfered legally to you.  Price includes original owners manual, Beretta outer cardbox box, blue Beretta plastic case, plastic Beretta ""shot glass"", 2 13 round mags blocked to 10 rounds, and a Houge rubber grip new in boix."

Hands down the best AK made. Completely imported and customized by Arsenal Las Vegas. I wanted the best AK Platform, and this is it. AR's have already made a comeback in stores, but this rifle is not in any store across the country. Go look for yourself. This is the only TRUE Arsenal sgl-31 94 I have seen on armslist in the sate of NC. This is a highly valuable platform, made for a firearms enthusiast that understands what he is getting. It is not for your typical guy looking for a typical AK. Please look else where is you want a bargain, or an entry level CAI piece of junk. This rifle has only been touched by the best AK builders in the US, Arsenal Inc. You get what you pay for guys!! If you want to spend $800 on a CAI Romanian POS that was built from used parts and has canted sights and twisted receivers, then be my guest. But if you want a true AK that has been built by the best, then this is it!! This is a rifle you can trust your life with, a rifle that will increase in value over time, and a rifle that will make you happy every time you look at it. 

I'm going to be honest and straight forward, just so there is no misunderstanding. I will probably not negotiate much at all, nor will I even consider Low Ball offers! I can't even decide for sure if I want to let it leave my possession. I am honestly just seeing what kind of interest I get and any offers I receive. I have no problem hanging on to this beautiful rifle. 

Okay, now that you have an understanding from where 
I'm coming from. I will gladly talk about the rifle itself. First off, the rifle is in like new condition. I have only shot maybe 6-7 magazines through it. Perfect working condition!
I have upgraded this thing to be an operators dream! and it features:
**Ace Push button side folding stock (skeleton model)......................$200
**US Palm Battle Pistol Grip............................................................$25
**Midwest Industries Rail...............................................................$140
**XS Night Sights..........................................................................$120
**Magpul Angled Fore Grip (AFG)...................................................$30
**Tapco G2 Trigger.......................................................................$35
**Krebs Custom Hammer and Trigger Retainer Plate.......................$15
**Famous AK74 Muzzle Break........................................................$00
I will include 8 Bulgarian Circle 10 magazines if the offer is right. These are $50 each, straight from KVAR. That's $400 worth of magazines alone!

I also have a full spam can of 5.45x39 ammo (1080) rounds!

So, with the upgrades and the magazines, that's a total of $965 just by themselves!
Now you can see how much I have put into this rifle. Like I said, I will be just fine keeping this rifle and letting it increase in value. 

Like I said, it has been upgraded to an AK Enthusiasts Dream. 

I'm not putting pictures up, only because I want people to respond that are genuinely interested.

A high riding FBI forward tilt holster designed for wear on the strong side hip. The butt of the gun is tucked snugly into the body to aid concealment. A flawless rendition of the classic ""pancake"" design, well suited to undercover and general concealment, as well as range use.

There is also a Horsehide version and to tell you the truth, I don't know if this is cow or horse.  I bought it from a friend who had sold his Glock 22 and because I never carried the Glock, this just sat in my gun safe.  I pulled it out the other day to see how my Glock 26 fit, but decided I would buy one specifically for the Glock 26.

Anyway, here is an ""as new"" Kramer holster.  The website sells them for $118.80 or $126.50 depending on cow vs horsehide.

Shows NO wear.  $65 or make an offer."
