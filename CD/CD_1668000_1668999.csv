The gun shoots either 22 Long or 22 Long Rifle and is in great working order, VERY ACCURATE!  I love this gun and hate to get rid of it but I bought a few new guns in the past few months and did agree to sell one to get the new one.  ...well I got by now about 2 months and got rid of 1 now I have to get rid of this one.  I bought this gun when we first moved here a few years ago and have probably only shot 1 brick through it since I've had it.  I saw it online for $170 and was able to pick it up by itself for $160 which is more than I should have for a little 22 to go plinking but I do not regret it one bit.  I used to shoot one of these when I was younger and like the fact that it is has the wood stock, heavier feel and just reminds you of when you used to shoot as a kid.  It has a few scratches where it looks like somebody had rested the rifle to shoot and few random scratches here and here but overall is in good shape and this is an older gun, they were manufactured between 1974-1980.  Anyways, I will include the soft case I paid $25 for and 200 Rounds of Ammo- 100 Rounds Winchester T22 and 100 Rounds Remington Target Rounds.

Never thought I would put one of these for sale but I have wanted a sig 230 west German model for a while and my wife happened to get me one for a gift after I bought the gun below.
for sale or trade (trade preferred) is a sig p232sl .380acp with everything it comes with new, factory hard case, 2 mags, papers.
In addition to having all factory new stuff and looking factory new this comes with hogue rubber grips that are extremely comfortable and of course has the factory grips as well.
Gun also comes with 350-400 dollar brand new crimson trace grips with front of grip activation button which I put on and sighted in just last weekend. Warranty has not been filled out so the batteries for life and all of the things crimson trace offers will be yours, crimson trace box and contents just like you buy new included.

In addition to the two factory mags are 3 extra mags, all mags for the sig are 7 rounds, in the pic you can see a stainless mag, there are two of these and 3 black metal mags which run 40 or more each. I bought this gun from a guy I have done business with before and it has been fired very little by him and has under 40 rounds by me. shoots everything I tried from cheap white box to high end self defense hollow points of  at least 4 different brands of each type of fmj, hp, soft lead tipped..It eats it all. I have a Walther PPKS as well and this is that gun on steroids as far as comfort and accuracy/accepts any ammo. 

These run 600 or so new, mags 25 used if lucky on up to 50, crimson trace used if you can find it no less than 250 and 350-400 new which these are, Not to mention the new hogue grips. all together buying this new and getting everything wholesale or used would be 1000 dollars.....Not what I am asking just noting the cost of this kind of setup. The gentleman who sold me this gave me a great deal and I will return the favor to those who offer a fair trade or cash."

Asking $100 local pickup or $110 shipped.

HK USP Match Trigger Kit is a true drop in kit for USP full size pistols. Fits all full size HK USP 9mm, 40 & .45 pistols. This will fit all of the HK German USP 9mm, 40 & .45 Cal pistols. The Match Trigger Kit will adjust the trigger pull on single action (SA) to about 4 lbs. and the double action (DA) pull to roughly 7.5 lbs. All the while providing an overall smoother trigger with a better trigger reset.

Each kit Includes:
Match hammer
Match hammer spring
Match trigger with overtravel stop & tool
Match trigger return spring
Match nickel flat/sear spring

Please note: Although the match kit is designed for the full size USP pistols only. The installation on your USP compact models can be acheived as the trigger will need to be slightly modifed in order to be installed in your compact model if you want to use the match trigger in your USP compact models. Or you can use your existing USP compact trigger and not the trigger that comes with the Match kit. This ONLY applies to the USP Compact and NOT the full size. All of the other parts work and install the same way between the full size and compact models.

This kit goes for $129.95 + $8.99 shipping at hkparts.net/shop/pc/HK-USP-Match-Trigger-Conversion-Kit-p1039.htm if you can find it in stock.

Gun Looks brand new and has less than 30 down the tube. Comes with everything it did new a month ago when I bought it. Factory hard case with 2 mags and all paperwork. I tried all different types of ammo I have and it ate everything no problem unlike all the guns these days that need a 200 round break in period before they can handle hollow points or other types of ammo. One mag is flush with the bottom for better concealment and the other is a little longer with a pinky grip that makes for a very nice grip even for large hands, I am 6'2' and have larger hands and the grip feels great in my hands. As far as reliability you are not going to beat a M&P9 which is why so many officers carry them. I have a whole lot of rounds down my full size 9 and 40 and never have had a failure of any kind. 

Price lowered to as far as I will go. Otherwise I may as well trade it in for any less since the price will be around the same. 150 off the new gun price with 30 rounds through and never carried.

Description
This design, designated as the CompM4s, features a low-mounted battery compartment giving the sight a lower overall profile, and placing the switch and battery compartment in a more protected position while preserving all of the outstanding features of the standard CompM4 sight.

The electronic components in the CompM4 include Aimpoint's Super ACET diode circuitry, allowing the sight to run constantly for up to 8 years on a single AA battery. All CompM4 sights feature an internal voltage regulator that allows the sights to operate on any AA size battery available worldwide. These sights also feature a 2 minute-of-angle (MOA) dot size, making them perfectly suited for use with Aimpoint's 3XMagnifier and Concealed Engagement Unit (CEU).
The CompM4 is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices, and features an extremely rugged and easy to use 16-position manual switch with 7 night vision compatible settings and 9 daylight settings. The CompM4 sight body is designed to protect the optical and electronic components inside against hard use, and keeps the sight waterproof to 45 meters (150
feet).

Features:

- Compatible with every generation of Night Vision Devices (NVD) 
- Super ACET technology allows up to 80,000 hours (over 8 years) of daytime operation on one AA battery 
- Internal voltage regulator allows the CompM4 to be used with any AA size battery.
- Seven night vision compatible settings and 9 daylight settings
- QRP2 mount has twice the clamping force of the original QRP, and the mounting knob is wider and shorter to improve operation, and lessen the chance of becoming snagged on other gear.
- Mount base is “keyed” into to the body of the sight to absorb recoil.
- Mount base screws directly into the sight – no separate sight ring is required.
- 500,000 hours of use on NVD setting 
- 2 MOA dot for close combat and long distance engagement
- Matches perfectly with Aimpoint 3XMag, (magnifier module).
- Unequalled light transmission.
- Front lens opening is threaded for addition of killFlash anti-reflective device.
- Submersible to 150 feet (45 meters) 
- Vertical spacer included
- Standardized as the US Army's new M68CCO

I could strip it and sell it for 450 or 500 as looking at other Glock 23 3rd gens people are asking close to 600 for a stock gun...this is far from stock. 600 buys the gun with the laser grip and tritium sights, 25 more and you get the bright tactical light that was 60-75 and has a new battery. 600 is low as low will go. I have sold a few guns and this is the last of the ones I have that does not get carried enough anymore. I am looking at the adds with people asking 650 for a 23 gen 3. Come on folks that is 150 higher than factory. My gun is priced higher because it has something more to offer with the crimson trace laser grip and tritium sights that glow bright as the day they got dialed in. Perfect carry for most anyone and 13 rounds of 40 in a compact is a solid amount, I rarely ever carry the other mag when I take this with me. Gun is clean and the only wear is on the slide release. you have to look close to see even that. Has never failed and with a glock it prob never will unless you are using handmade loads that are not up to par. I have yet to have a malfunction of any kind and for a while I shot this gun every time I went to the range so with a few hundred rounds down the pipe I know I can rely on it."

It is flawless (no scratches, nicks, worn finish, etc.) in the factory original box with all paperwork and owner’s manual. It comes from the factory with a full quad rail that free-floats the barrel, Magpul folding sights, a Magpul 30-round magazine, and a 6-position telescoping stock. Although it does not have a match trigger, the trigger on this particular rifle has no noticeable creep and breaks very cleanly for a military spec trigger. With the M&P15T’s free-floated heavy barrel and this rifle’s relatively nice trigger, this particular rifle should shoot fairly accurately."

Cash is preferred, but can also accept a credit card.  If it is a credit card, I have to add a 3% charge to cover the fees.  

Specifics about the gun: 

In case you were wondering, yes, it is a heavy barrel for that sustained varmint hunting or shooting tons of rounds.  It is also more accurate than the standard barrel that comes on most AR15s.

As you can see in the pics, there is a 1/2 picatinny rail riser added when using the reticle.  Or, you can take off the riser and use the iron sights like traditionally seen on an AR15/M16.  The rail also has covers, but you can see what is looks like if you don't want to use them.  I'm sell everything you see in the pics with it and allowing you to make your own configuration.  

The reticle has 4 different settings.  It has the dot, circle with dot, cross hairs, and cross hairs with circle in the center.

I got a GREAT deal on this and am asking for nothing more than I paid minus tax.   Bought it to build out a new 3-gun shotty but now sticking to my Saiga instead. 

Looking for $550 for the rifle and factory accessories (choke, wrench, sling mounts, etc).   I also have a new Nordic Components +5 extension and clamp (still packaged) that will extend to the end of the barrel and take this gun up to holding 10 rounds.  Another $90 for the tube and clamp (less than I paid).

This gun is in great condition, always cleaned after shooting and stored in bedroom. I have all the original paperwork from my purchase including the factory fired 9mm round. 

The crossbreed holster is really solid, I have the same model for my other gun Kahr K9 and swear by them. It is full adjustable and comfortable to wear even with a large framed gun.

The Speer is top of the line defense ammo. It cycles perfectly through the XDm (everything does, zero jams since I purchased). 

I will sell the whole package for 600 cash or best offer if multiple requests come in. I am located here in Portland. If you are from out of state then we would need to use FFL Transfer, which is fine but I will pass the additional costs of shipping and FFL fee on to you. If I need to ship the weapon I will need to receive a money order made out to me ahead of shipping. If you are an Oregon resident we can meet for the face to face sale, CHL preferred but would sell to anyone with valid ODL.

I believe it to be ban proof if god forbid idiots get their way because of no bayonet lug or collapsible stock. It does have a pistol grip though. Benelli also makes 5 round clips for hunting. The gun has very few rounds put through it.  I bought the rifle and only shot twice since purchased no more than 300 rounds fired through it.

I have posted some photos taken a few days ago for reference on PhotoBucket...(http://s269.photobucket.com/user/Raiderftbl/library/Sig%20Sauer%20P220R-45-%20BSS%20SIGLITE?sort=3&page=1).

I paid $865 for the pistol, $103 for the magazines and $119 Rosewood grips. I cut the the Sig tag to put the new grips on the pistol. Lastly, included is a voucher for Sig Sauer for a free magazine with 10% off for a purchase from the Sig Sauer store due to the back order issue with magazines. With all that said; I know most dealers mark up the guns 15-20% and then I'd maybe lose another 10% for the pistol not being ""new"" so I have really lowered the price for this listing. Will only ship to an FFL if not local. Also, I play by the rules, so Please have a FOID permit before inquiring. The pistol is brand new and has never been fired... Everything listed and in photos is included in price. Thank you for checking it out!

- 600 rounds of Independence 5.56 ammunition
- 500 rounds of American Eagle AR .223 ammunition
- 60 rounds of Tulammo .223 ammunition


Everything is new except for the UTG and Weaver scopes.  If you buy the whole package I'll include a package of 20 zombie targets for free.  I prefer to sell the collection as one lot, or split the rifles up into packages, but I'm open to selling some of the stuff off individually (i.e. the extra mags as a lot, or a rifle and ammo).

I'm not looking to gouge anyone, but I am looking to get out near what this is all worth.  I can even give you itemized prices if you think this is too high and don't want to do the research yourself.  Keep in mind this is a chance to avoid sales taxes, fees, and putting down your information for the government to follow.  I'll knock a couple bucks off the individual prices if you buy the whole collection.

Face to face cash sales preferred, but I can ship the guns to your FFL dealer and the various components to you directly for an extra fee (no shipping on the ammo).  I prefer dealing with a CCW permit holder so I know you don't have a criminal record, but it's not absolutely necessary.  I'm willing to drive a little bit to meet you if you're coming from over an hour away.

I need some money to make a down payment on some work we're doing to our house since our family is growing.  Everything is brand new unless otherwise noted.

Do Not Ask:
If this is available – if you see this ad, this is still for sale
If I'll sell the ammo separately.  I know it's still hard to find ammo, but this stuff goes with these guns


The Guns:
1.  Bushmaster XM-15 (not the cheap Carbon model) with two Bushmaster 30 round mags (comes with 1 in store).  MSRP $1,391.48
2.  DPMS Panther Oracle with Magpul furniture and flip up sights (front and rear, not installed yet), Hogue pistol grip, 30 round Pmag with window, and 30 round DPMS mag.  Also includes a Magpul verticle foregrip (not installed) that attaches to the hand guard.  Base model (without Magpul extras) is around $1,000 from dealers
All rifles come with manuals, paperwork, locks, and whatever other accessories normally come with them (i.e. sling and rail risers for Bushmaster, etc).

The Accessories:
- Black Midway USA padded zippered rifle bag with room for 4 30-round mags, a velcro pocket, and a zippered pocket on the outside.  Has a carry handle and shoulder strap on the back.
- Green NCStar padded zippered rifle bag with outside pockets for 4 30-round mags covered by a velcro flap.  Has a carry handle on the side and a shoulder strap on the other.
- 4 Tapco 30-round magazines for the AR-15's
- CAA 30-round magazine
- CAA triple rail system to mount to standard AR 15 hand guard
- Laser/flashlight combination with rail mounting system and remote pressure switches.  Flashlight has a red flip-cap filter to preserve night vision.
- BSA red dot sight scope with built-in sun shade (42 mm)
- UTG CQB reticle intensified red/green dot scope sight (30 mm) (used once on one of my other rifles, but comes with battery, soft case, tool, etc)
- 4x Weaver Marksman scope with 1” rings (rings are new, scope is used and shows some wear and small spots of rust on the outside but has clean glass inside)
- 2 stacking 45 MTM ammo cans with rubber gaskets
- 2 M-16 bayonet's with leather sheathes

The Ammo (only available with purchase of a rifle!!!!):
- 600 rounds of Independence 5.56 ammunition
- 500 rounds of American Eagle AR .223 ammunition
- 60 rounds of Tulammo .223 ammunition


Everything is new except for the UTG and Weaver scopes.  If you buy the whole package I'll include a package of 20 zombie targets for free.  I prefer to sell the collection as one lot, or split the rifles up into packages, but I'm open to selling some of the stuff off individually (i.e. the extra mags as a lot, or a rifle and ammo).

I'm not looking to gouge anyone, but I am looking to get out near what this is all worth.  I can even give you itemized prices if you think this is too high and don't want to do the research yourself.  Keep in mind this is a chance to avoid sales taxes, fees, and putting down your information for the government to follow.  I'll knock a couple bucks off the individual prices if you buy the whole collection.

Description

The FastFire III Red Dot Reflex sight is the most versatile red dot sight on the market. Mount it on your favorite handgun, shotgun or hunting rifle for greater accuracy and faster target acquisition. You won't need to worry about sight alignment, eye dominance or finding your target. Just put the red dot on your target and pull the trigger.

Compact and lightweight, the FastFire III wont affect the balance or handling, plus it offers unlimited eye relief, parallax-free 1x magnification and simple operation.

The FastFire III offers upgraded features such as windage and elevation adjustments that don't require a special tool; a convenient power button with three levels of brightness and an automatic brightness setting and battery access on the top of the sight making it easier to change batteries. We've also added a low battery warning indicator and see-through protective cap.

Ideally suited for use on pistols and carbine's where fast target acquisition is desired, the FastFire III red dot sight will also match up well with carbines, lever guns and shotguns. The FastFire III is ruggedly designed, impervious to the elements and will hold up to years of punishing recoil.

This FastFire III model comes with a Picatinny mount. If you would like the one without the mount, search for the FastFire 300235
Features

    Strong and durable with a frame made of stainless steel, bronze and anodized aluminum
    Can be mounted directly on almost any weapon including on the slide of a semi-automatic pistol
    Since eye relief is unlimited, the FastFire can be used on handguns, rifles and shotguns
