The replica of the Israel Weapon Industries’ famous submachine gun is made by Carl Walther in Germany and comes in two variants: a rifle with a mock suppressor, and a pistol.

“The demand for .22 caliber guns continues to be strong,” said Richard Turner, vice president of sales and marketing for Umarex USA. “The addition of a .22 caliber UZI is a ‘natural’ add for us. It’s one of the most-recognized guns on the planet, yet few people have actually fired rounds through one. Shooting the UZI pistol is just pure, economical recreation with a ton of fun thrown in.”

Both feed rimfire cartridges in 20-round magazines. Both guns also feature grip safeties and adjustable sights.

The rifle features a folding stock, detachable sling swivel and the Uzi’s traditional handguard, which may be removed to reveal a Picatinny rail.

U.S. shipments are expected to arrive in mid-February, and additional inventory is expected this summer. The Uzi pistol will retail about $480, while the rifle will cost around $645.

From the MAGPUL website:

The Magpul UBR (Utility / Battle Rifle), U.S. Patent 6651371, is a fully-featured, adjustable buttstock for the AR15/M16. Unlike typical collapsing stocks, this modular design offers the stability of a fixed stock with consistent cheek weld in any position. Seven-position length-of-pull (LOP) adjustment is quickly executed with gross motor movement while the integral preset system allows direct access to a preferred position. A robust lock mechanism and multi-shell construction increase durability under severe impact conditions experienced during malfunction clearing and accommodates large-bore AR calibers with ease. The UBR also provides extra counterbalance weight to improve handling on full-length rifles and weapons with muzzle-heavy accessories or bull-barrels. Optional components such as dual-side sling mounts and metal strike plate allow the UBR to adapt to the mission at hand.

The GLOCK 27 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their offical backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.

Please read the entire listing before responding to it.
This Vintage JC Higgins rifle is a Marlin Model 81 made for Sears. It is bar none the best rifle I have ever owned. I shoot smaller than quarter sized groups using the open sights at 50yds and I'm not that great of a shot. I bought, installed using Leupold see-thru 1'rings, and laser bore-sighted the BSA Sweet 22 scope using the 40gr cam, but have not had it out to the range since to check it out. Bought the scope for 100yd shoots. It also comes with (IIRC) 36 and 38gr cams. Action is clean and functions flawlessly. Bluing is in very good + condition. The mag tube holds 17+1 LR rounds and over 20 shorts. Very accurate and very fun to shoot while not breaking the bank. Along with the rifle I am including 600rnds of 40gr SP CCI Mini-mags and an old box of Remington Hi-Speed Clean-bore 22 shorts.

I am wanting to sell this as a package deal as seen in the pics for $300. To break it down; The ammo is probably worth at least $80 and the scope is $55 including the Leupold rings which puts the rifle at $165 in the package. I may be willing to separate the rifle and scope from the ammo, but the rifle must sell first and I will not separate the rifle from the scope. For just the rifle and scope $230. If that sells then $90 on the ammo. Prices are firm. You can see it is best to buy the entire package. Even if you resell whatever you don't want.

Anyway, call REDACTED or hit the contact seller button. Give you name and a number so I can call you back if emailing or I may not respond. I am in SE KCMO between Raytown and I-470. Expect to meet somewhere relatively close to there. Thanks for looking."

Also included are an extra set of Timber Smith Grips (does come with original grips), 1 Ed Brown 7 round mag, 2 Chip McCormick 10 round power mags and the Ed Brown soft case.  

The extra grips and extra 2 mags are worth around $100, adding even more savings over the cost of purchasing new.

I have placed the gun on a Gunbroker Ad due to limited response on Armslist.  If you live in Ohio and wish to purchase I am willing to meet halfway from Lewis Center up to an hour of drive time.  If you are further away and wish to purchase I will drive an hour to meet if you cover the rest of the distance.  This would save significant shipping and FFL costs.  If you are interested please contact me about the details of meeting before placing a bid.  

Will sell for $2200 FTF and end auction if no bids have been placed.  Once a bid is placed on gunbroker will sell through auction only.
