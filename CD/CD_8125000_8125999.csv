These are fantastic 5.56 rifles. The action is extremely smooth for a military rifle and the trigger is very nice for a combat trigger. You will be very impressed if you haven't played with one before. This one is brand new and has just been fired at the factory. 16.2″ barrel, comes with the CZ factory folding & adjustable stock, it also has the factory flip-up adjustable iron sights. It is chambered in .223/5.56×45 and uses STANAG style magazines from the AR15/M16. It also easily accepts optics and lights on its top and bottom Picatinny rails. An effective two-port muzzle brake helps keep the Bren solidly on target and reduces recoil and muzzle flip. I have a SCAR 16s and the 805 Bren is very similar in function and I would say beats the FN SCAR in terms of fit and finish. These are very nice rifles. MSRP is $2,000 and most online dealers are currently at around $1700 with the low inventory still available for sale. I'm asking for $1,450 cash. Not looking for any trades currently."

Part of the 2016 Urban Grey Suppressor-Ready Series, this pistol is clad in urban grey (a mix of grey and FDE). With threaded barrels, high suppressor sights with tritium lamps and extended capacity magazines, our Urban Grey pistols are a direct response to the many requests we get from customers for more suppressor-ready options.
A further evolution of the 75 B Ω, the new Convertible version allows users to swap from decocker to safety operation in the same manner as the popular P-07/P-09 pistols. Using the same simplified, more robust variation of the 75’s trigger system as the previous Omega, trigger parts use an interlocking design that allows for easy disassembly and reassembly without the need for tools. Not only does this simplify maintenance, the trigger parts themselves are made of different materials to enhance durability, operation life and reliability."

I've had it for probably 15 years now. I've only put maybe 90 rounds through it at most. I originally bought it as a hunting rifle and only used it a couple times. I now have other rifles I use and it just sits in the safe taking up room. I am selling everything pictured as a package. I would rate the rifle at 97-98%. There are some minor handling marks from being in the safe. The scope is a 4.5-14 Nikon Buckmasters. The rifle has a Timney adjustable trigger. I have not been able to find the original trigger that was taken out when the Timney was installed. I have 5 and a half boxes(the half box is one of the Hornady boxes) of various 243 ammo as well. I also have the original box I can include of the buyer would like. I would like to sell everything pictured for $700 shipped or FTF.

It was originally developed by Colt for the Air Force as a survival pistol in case of a crash. Colt lost interest and bushmaster took over.  A couple thousands were delivered to the Air Force But They were rejected them because of the finish. The Air Force then abandoned the project  bushmaster then sold them to the general public. The pistol cannot be shot as a rifle because the ejection would hit the shooter in the facel. The mid section pistol grip and trigger rotates to the side and the gun is hel that way to use. Look at the “B” on the pistol grip and on the safety. It takes standard ar15/m16 mags. Read up on the model for more information. Looking for a reasonable trade.  I have more pictures. The pistol is semi automatic.

This is a gunsmith conversion of a percussion Colt, after the Civil War. The action works fine and visible serial numbers are matching. This is an uncleaned near relic condition revolver. We have commented before on the collectible aspect of relic guns, and our opinion that these guns have an attraction and charm of their own. How and where did the gun come from? What could have happened to it to arrive at this condition? The revolver has not only that “relic” appeal but is a collectible example of the gunsmith’s work. He cut the cylinder where the nipples go and welded in a “conversion plate”. Using the original percussion hammer, he reshaped the nose into a conical, almost nail like projection, to strike a rimfire cartridge. This is crude work, but you can’t help but smile in wonder at the creativeness or lack thereof. If you buy it please don’t clean it. Mother nature’s work (rush and corrosion) should be left alone in this case.http://www.collectorsfirearms.com/colt-1851-navy-36-caliber-revolver-with-hartford-address-barrel-c13680/"

I only need one.The gun is great. Slightly larger than a P938, easily pocket-carried in my pants pocket. Standard capacity is 10, so, you can carry it at 10+1 with your choice of 9mm rounds (I use HST). The gun is rated for +P. It has SIGLite night sights installed by the factory. It has no manual safety.I have closely compared this gun with a P938 and with a Kimber Solo, both of which are 6+1 pocket 9mm pistols. The 365 is a little bigger, but not that much. All three guns fit in my pocket just fine. The 365 is significantly smaller than a Shield.The gun comes with two magazines. One fits flush and is my preference for pocket carry. The other has a pinky extension and would be better for the range, or if you have room for it however you carry. SIG also sells a 12-round magazine for about $45.I've shot this particular gun enough to say it's weirdly accurate ... more accurate than makes sense to me. The sights are great. The trigger is great. SIG is onto something special with this model.
I paid $568 and change for the gun at Bass Pro, including tax. I paid about $20 for a BORAII holster, which I will include. Price shown is for a cash sale. $590 is approximately what I have in the gun and holster. Price is firm. If you can get it cheaper somewhere else, go for it. Trade value - $650."

IC-A5 SBR
Individual Carbine
Directly descended from the rifles developed by LWRCI to meet the requirements for the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program, the IC-A5 is built for high performance.  The IC-A5 SBR model delivers the same great features, fit and function of the full size IC-A5 in a compact 10.5"" barrel configuration

The IC-A5 SBR  is the latest model in the IC  Individual Carbine series. Customers called for an adjustable gas block and user configurable rail system on the same rifle. We listened- the IC-A5 SBR is designed with a low profile 2 position adjustable gas block allowing the shooter to compensate for running a suppressor with the added benefit of our longer modular rail system. 

The Monoforge upper receiver with LWRCI modular rail system is stronger and lighter.  Access to the gas piston system is quick and easy by loosening 2 thumb screws on the IC-A5 SBR.  This IC-A5 SBR brings together the best features of the IC Enhanced and IC-SPR in one compact SBR package.

Like all IC models the IC-A5 SBR is constructed using the highest quality materials, built on our patented self-regulating short-stroke gas piston system, machined from materials that belong to the super alloy family of steel alloys most often used in aerospace, LWRCI raises the bar on reliability and ease of maintenance- delivering the highest level of performance. 

Dual Control fully ambidextrous lower receiver includes bolt catch and release, magazine release and fire control access from both sides of the IC-A5 SBR.  LWRCI Enhanced Fire Control Group comes standard.  Our investment castings are x-rayed for imperfections and nickel-boron coated for a smooth crisp trigger pull with positive reset.  

Our IC-A5 SBR uses LWRCI manufactured- NiCorr treated cold Hammer Forged standard barrel.  The LWRCI Nickel-boron coated bolt carrier delivers unparalleled wear resistance, corrosion resistance and permanent lubricity.  



The LWRCI IC-A5 SBR comes complete with, LWRCI Skirmish Back Up Iron Sights, LWRCI Ambidextrous Charging Handle, LWRCI Adjustable Compact Stock, MagpulÃ�ï¿½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã�ï¿½Ã�Â® MOE+ Grip and LWRCI High Efficiency 4-Prong Flash Hider."
