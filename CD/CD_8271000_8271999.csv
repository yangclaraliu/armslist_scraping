I have put 20 rds. through it and since the day at the range I dismantled it, thoroughly cleaned it, put it in the holster and put it in my vehicle (it was carried in the back pocket of the passenger seat per easy access for me) since I have another weapon near my bed for my home protection. That is where it has been stored for the last 5 yrs. I have since acquired another weapon for myself, a 45cal., so my wife is going to get my 40cal., which she has informed me she would prefer a 9mm, so thus I'm selling my Ruger 40cal. I did purchase an ""Uncle Mike's Holster"" (at a cost of $30) designed specifically for the Ruger SR40C, which when the firearm is inserted into the holster it semi locks into place and has to be torqued to the right, slight right hand twist, to remove it, a really neat safety feature. I also purchased 2 additional 15 rd. magazines for this weapon when I got it and they have not even been removed from the packaging. These 2 additional 15 rd. magazines are made by the Ruger Corporation, not an after market, and they cost me $39 each. It came with 1-9rd. and 1-15rd. magazine new. So everything that came with this weapon is still intact and all is included. THe case still looks as new as the gun."

All of the Internals are Lonewolf including the Trigger, trigger is very nice. It comes with TruGlo TFO Green on Green Sights, and a  Surefire XC-1 Compact Weapon Light. The Lonewolf 19 did not come with Magazines, so I have 4-5 that I bought for it afterwards.Additionally it comes with a Tuctite OD Green Appendix Rig build specifically for the Glock 19 w/ Surefire XC-1. Also comes with another Holster without the Mag Caddy Attached, for the same set up. Also have a Holster for Hook and Loop for that exact set up I used for a Vertx Commuter Bag.I am open to offers, I paid over $800 for just the fun without the TFO Sights and XC-1, not including any of the Holsters as well, or the Magazines. So keep that in mind. Only looking for Trade wise, maybe a Sig P365 Plus Cash, or maybe a Glock 19 MOS Plus Cash. But feel free to offer any cash or trade offers I maybe can’t pass up.Phone Number is 513-814-6829. (P.S. I will be checking ID, also, I will be writing up a written contract showing the terms of the deal, that I am selling it to you, this agreement, this date, that your are allowed to own a Firearm and etc).
