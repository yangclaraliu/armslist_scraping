I will not piece-meal the parts. Again this is a bundle deal only. Everything listed above for $2250. Buy the rifle and you can do whatever you want with the parts. I think $ 2250 is fair and justified because the sum of its parts exceeds the price point that I have set. I have all the receipts for everything that I installed on this rifle so it really is a good deal! The EOTech and the Ammo alone makes it quite a bargain. I have been buying and putting away ammo for a while now......so do the math. How much is a 20 count of 5.56 at the store? Yeah that's what I thought. Well you know the drill by now. You need a long-gun permit to purchase this firearm. If you e-mail me please don't start the conversation with "" Would You....."", no I will not and that would be an insult. I find that by screening prospective buyers first, 98% of the time the people I e-mail back are usually the ones that are serious and they are the ones that will walking out my door with a good purchase. That is usually the first or second customer that I invite to my home. No hassles and no mind games when both parties are on the same page. Well that's it. Pretty straightforward and to the point.

Will feed all ammo both fmj and hp. Comes with box, papers and 1 Springfield 8 rnd mag. Grips on gun are hogue. Also have original black plastic grips. Excellent tight frame to slide fit.

I have put a hogue over-mold stock on it as well as a volquartsen target grade hammer and a volquartsen extractor. It comes mounted with a Simmons Whitetail Classic 6.5x20x50mm AO down to 10yds, with a mildot reticle. It has a nylon bolt buffer as well. Target hammer sets the trigger pull to right at a beautiful 3lbs. This gun is great. The only reason I'm selling it, is because I'm moving into a non gun friendly house.  It has the original barrel on it and it shoots perfect.  But the only real improvement I see left is a barrel upgrade. It is by no means needed anytime soon but is the obvious next step someday. Also comes with the factory 10 round mag, a Butler creek 25 round mag, and a Ruger BX-25x2 Mag which is 2 ruger 25 round mags permanently joined together. Roughly 750 rounds of .22lr ammo as well. Please email with offers. May except trade for the right road bike 58cm-60cm."

Some lots are crammed into the small flat rate box to keep your shipping costs down and it may not be possible to send the brass bagged by brand. If this is the case, I will let you know before shipping with the options but so far, we have made them all work out.

I honestly did not knwo much about this pistoll so i asked a friend...that sounds like an Exeter NH gun assembled with German parts. They sold those as they transitioned from German production to Exeter production. The slide is folded carbon steel, very desirable. The frame is anodized aluminum. Slide and frame are coated with Nitron, a sig propriatary coating. The newer slides are milled from stainless and are coated with Nitron. Many feel that the folded slides are more balanced to shoot. The folded slide was phased out for cost reasons.. Hope this helps!

I purchased this gun new a couple years ago, but have since moved to a different AR caliber, and no longer have a need for this one. It will be missed, as it is without a doubt, the most accurate AR platformed firearm in my safe. 

I just recently installed a Nikon P-223 3-9 scope on the rife via a Nikon M-223 one piece scope mount. The gun has less than 20 rounds through it since mounting the scope. If you are not familiar with the scope, it has a BDC reticle matched to polymer tipped 55 grain ammo. 

Here are the details of the firearm and what is included for the $1500 price:

18"", 1 in 8 twist, heavy, fluted barrel with flash hider
Magpul PRS stock
JP adjustable trigger
Quad rail, free floating handguard
ERGO grip
(2) 30 round magazines
Nikon p223 3-9 BDC scope

I would be willing to sell the firearm WITHOUT the scope and mount for $1200. I will include a set of DPMS flip up/mangonel sights as well. 

I also have 300 rounds of 55 grain, polymer tipped, factory NEW Hornady Ammo. It consists of V-max and Z-max. I will be looking to get rid of this too."

Product Information

Designed for volume production, the Lee 6-Cavity Bullet Mold blocks are machined from commercial quality aluminum and feature steel bushing and alignment pins. Lee mold blocks are machined from aluminum blocks making them rust resistant. Aluminum molds heat up and cool down faster than iron or steel molds so good bullets can usually be produced after only a few casts. In addition, they are one-third the weight of iron or steel mold blocks for less fatigue during extended casting sessions. To ensure the best possible bullets, mold block halves are CNC machined for unmatched roundness and size control. Lee 6-Cavity molds come with a cam operated, hard-anodized sprue plate which is held tightly with tempered spring washers at each end. Weights given are Lee's weights with suggested alloy; actual weight may vary due to alloy mixture used. Handles ARE NOT included (#117-892).

Lee 2-Cavity Bullet Mold TL309-230-5R 30 Caliber (309 Diameter) 230 Grain 300 AAC Blackout Tumble Lube 5 Ogive Radius 
Product Information

MidwayUSA teamed up with Lee Precision to custom design a cast bullet that would not only function from a suppressed AR-15 in 300 AAC Blackout subsonicly, but would not have problems feeding from a magazine and stabilize with the fast twist barrels. This bullet has a smaller meplat leading to a long gentle rounded tangent ogive to ensure that the bullet will feed from a magazine and be less sensitive to bullet seating depth. This bullet also has a boat-tail design to help increase the ballistic coefficient, reducing drag helping the bullet to overcome air resistance in flight. Some reloaders have even reported that they can seat gas checks on the boat-tail to help reduce leading when loading this bullet in other calibers. The tumble lube design of this mold is perfect for shooting subsonic loads out of the 300 AAC Blackout. 

Lee Bullet Molds are a great choice for reloaders looking for a quality mold at an affordable price. Lee machines their mold blocks from aluminum making them rust resistant. Aluminum molds heat up and cool down faster than iron or steel molds and good bullets can usually be produced only after a few casts. In addition, aluminum blocks are one-third the weight of iron or steel mold blocks offering the bullet caster less fatigue during extended casting sessions.

This is just a stunning .357 Colt Python, manufactured in 1978. Finished in Colt’s magnificent Royal Blue, the 4” barreled pistol has a pair of gorgeous, beautifully-grained custom wooden stocks (maker unknown) with gold-colored Colt medallions – these are really sharp-looking grips that compliment the Royal Blue finish. The pistol has slight turn marks on the cylinder, and that’s it – it has NO cosmetic issues whatsoever, the aforementioned grips look brand new, and overall condition of the gun is a NEAR-MINT 98%! The bore is shiny, and it’s a Python, so double action trigger pull is silky smooth! Pythons just continue to escalate in price – as nice as the custom grips are on this pistol, adding a set of factory grips should immediately add value to the gun, and if prices keep going up, who knows what this gun will be worth in a few years!

Please don't make any trade offers or half trade half cash offers. Bill of Sale IS required for my personal records. Please have a Valid State ID/DL to purchase this handgun.

I am selling my 5"" Kimber Warrior. I've had it for a few months and it's just collecting dust. I never have time to go to the range and I own 100 acres so whenever I have time, I just shoot my 22's (none of which are for sale). 

It's .45ACP, cleaned after every time I've finished firing it. They MSRP for $1,512 on Kimber's Site but I purchased mine from Vance's for $1,415 + Tax = $1,510.51. I've fired MAYBE 500 rounds through it. Kimber is an AMAZING handgun manufacturer and their Quality is unparalleled, if you can't afford a Wilson.

My asking Price is $1400 BECAUSE it comes with, in addition to all the stock items, 5 additional mags. Three 7+1's, One 10+1, and one 8+1. Not to mention it also comes with an open carry holster. The brand name of the holster escapes me, but it's VERY good. The grips are VZ Grips and are amazing, I put them on myself and I love them.

This is a package deal, so everything must be purchased. Seeing that each mag is roughly $25 and the Holster was $40, that brings my used Kimber's value at $1,235 which is actually a very good price for a Kimber Warrior in this condition.

Anyone who purchases this, can also purchase .45ACP target ammo from me. I have boxes of 50 and depends on how many boxes you want to buy, there are discounts involved. I have 750 rounds, so I have plenty upon request for sale.

Thank you."

This is just a stunning .357 Colt Python, manufactured in 1978. Finished in Colt’s magnificent Royal Blue, the 4” barreled pistol has a pair of gorgeous, beautifully-grained custom wooden stocks (maker unknown) with gold-colored Colt medallions – these are really sharp-looking grips that compliment the Royal Blue finish. The pistol has slight turn marks on the cylinder, and that’s it – it has NO cosmetic issues whatsoever, the aforementioned grips look brand new, and overall condition of the gun is a NEAR-MINT 98%! The bore is shiny, and it’s a Python, so double action trigger pull is silky smooth! Pythons just continue to escalate in price – as nice as the custom grips are on this pistol, adding a set of factory grips should immediately add value to the gun, and if prices keep going up, who knows what this gun will be worth in a few years!

This is just a stunning .357 Colt Python, manufactured in 1978. Finished in Colt’s magnificent Royal Blue, the 4” barreled pistol has a pair of gorgeous, beautifully-grained custom wooden stocks (maker unknown) with gold-colored Colt medallions – these are really sharp-looking grips that compliment the Royal Blue finish. The pistol has slight turn marks on the cylinder, and that’s it – it has NO cosmetic issues whatsoever, the aforementioned grips look brand new, and overall condition of the gun is a NEAR-MINT 98%! The bore is shiny, and it’s a Python, so double action trigger pull is silky smooth! Pythons just continue to escalate in price – as nice as the custom grips are on this pistol, adding a set of factory grips should immediately add value to the gun, and if prices keep going up, who knows what this gun will be worth in a few years!

This is just a stunning .357 Colt Python, manufactured in 1978. Finished in Colt’s magnificent Royal Blue, the 4” barreled pistol has a pair of gorgeous, beautifully-grained custom wooden stocks (maker unknown) with gold-colored Colt medallions – these are really sharp-looking grips that compliment the Royal Blue finish. The pistol has slight turn marks on the cylinder, and that’s it – it has NO cosmetic issues whatsoever, the aforementioned grips look brand new, and overall condition of the gun is a NEAR-MINT 98%! The bore is shiny, and it’s a Python, so double action trigger pull is silky smooth! Pythons just continue to escalate in price – as nice as the custom grips are on this pistol, adding a set of factory grips should immediately add value to the gun, and if prices keep going up, who knows what this gun will be worth in a few years!

Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Long Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo.

This is just a stunning .357 Colt Python, manufactured in 1978. Finished in Colt’s magnificent Royal Blue, the 4” barreled pistol has a pair of gorgeous, beautifully-grained custom wooden stocks (maker unknown) with gold-colored Colt medallions – these are really sharp-looking grips that compliment the Royal Blue finish. The pistol has slight turn marks on the cylinder, and that’s it – it has NO cosmetic issues whatsoever, the aforementioned grips look brand new, and overall condition of the gun is a NEAR-MINT 98%! The bore is shiny, and it’s a Python, so double action trigger pull is silky smooth! Pythons just continue to escalate in price – as nice as the custom grips are on this pistol, adding a set of factory grips should immediately add value to the gun, and if prices keep going up, who knows what this gun will be worth in a few years! We do not have the box or any accessories for this gun"

Will ship (Y/N): Yes to your FFL

Includes:

-199 Rounds of 223. Ships in seperate box via UPS. (Some is premium 75 and 77 grain ammo, Black Hills 50 rounds and Hornady TAP ~28 rounds)

-4x32 Barska Fixed Power Scope, Mounted and Zeroed at 100 yards. 30-30 Range-Finding Reticle. Finger-Adjustable Windage/Elevation. Strong Locktite-ed rings so holds zero strong (I've never lost zero, because the mount is so strong). Includes Clear Lens Covers and Allen Wrench (not that you will need the allen wrench but its good to have)

-Cartridge Carrier on Stock

-Soft Rifle Case. Snug Fit very little-wiggle.

-Nylon Sling, Attached to Rifle.

-Manual



Notes:
-Has had 61 rounds through it. 55grain Reimington and 75grain Hornady TAP. I recomend brass cased ammo with weights between 55 and 77 grains since this rifle is 1/8 barrel twist rate. 

-Tikka guarantees 1MOA accuracy with match ammo and I found this true. In fact, with 75 grain Hornady TAP I got .5 MOA though I don't guarantee that since human error must be factored in.

-holds 5 rounds in the Rifle (1 in chamber 4 in mag), 9 on the buttstock for a total of 14 on the rifle. Buttstock sleeve is hot-glued-tight at the front to fit even more securely (its very solid), it also is prevented from moving by the sling swivel. It is removable but I advise keeping it as it dramatically increases rounds count and is faster than loading from pocket. It also provides light/comfortable traction for more solid cheek weld.

-22.4"" inch barrel so its got more velocity than a 20 but its handier than a cumbersom 24. Can be shot offhand comfortably, unlike many sniper rifles.

-This is the most accurate rifle I've ever fired. Its also very light and handy for its accuracy class, weighs 6lb 3 ounces without scope and about 7lb 3 ounces with scope. 

-Price is well below retail for total of rifle, ammo, scope, case, cartidge holder, sling. And thats not counting the ammo you would waste sighting in a new build. (building this from scratch will run you about $930 retail and take several hours labor).

-Excellent Condition, like new.

-READY TO USE! No mounting, zeroing needed! 

Personal Check or Money Order Accepted, will ship to FFL once check clears. I have sold several items on Calguns already with no issues so buy with confidence. Can also provide facebook as reference if you do same.

Selling due to personal financial issues.
