There's no panic going on for muzzleloaders so I'm not looking to pay anything unreasonable. Kittery trading post has dozens for between $125 and $175. If I can get one there for cheaper than you're asking then chances are I'll pass since they have warranties on used guns.

 4.5 XDM 40S&W W/ Black Finish

 The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster.

XDM Features

 XDM DESIGN

 Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.






(M)odel Contour Frame

 The ideal grip angle of the XD has been carried over to the XD(M), but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you.





(M)ajor Grasp Slide Serrations

 Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp.










(M)ega-Lock Texture

 The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. 

The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally.






XDM TECHNOLOGY

 Moving beyond comfort and fit, Springfield Armory explores new territory in tactile response. With the introduction of The (M) Factor, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level.






(M)elonite

 Traditional black oxide finishes are a few millionths of an inch thick and offer no corrosion resistance. 

The rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M)is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface.





(M)atch Grade Barrel

 Rivaling aerospace manufacturing, the XD(M) match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry










(M)inimal Reset Trigger

 The new XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.




XDM INNOVATIONS

 The same spirit of innovation that fueled the success of the XD is now captured in the all new XD(M) line of polymer pistols. From subtle influences to industry firsts, the XD(M) series pushes the boundaries on what a polymer pistol should be.






(M)inimal Error Disassembly


Innovation doesn't always happen by adding to a product. Sometimes, it's what you simplify. By removing the need to pull the trigger during disassembly, we've made the process easier and faster.





(M)aximum Reach Mag Release


The modified contour of the new XD(M)grip is most evident near the magazine release. Operation of the magazine release is easily accomplished by virtually any size hand without twisting or adjusting from the shooting grip.










(M)ega Capacity Magazine


The new XD(M) Compact 9MM magazine holds an incredible 13 rounds in a flush fitting magazine and 19 rounds with the XD(M) GEAR Mag 
X-Tension (USPAT .7191556). The XD(M)is the largest capacity production polymer pistol in both the 
.40 caliber and 9MM, accommodating 16 + 1 and 19 + 1 rounds, respectively.




XDM PERSONALIZATION

 Usually, handgun customization is an after-market decision. With the XD(M), you get more personalized choices for a custom fit right out of the case.






(M)ould-Tru Backstraps


With our interchangeable backstraps, we've added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip by choosing one of three backstraps for a more custom fit.





(M)ulti-Adjust Rail System


A triple-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other accessories. More importantly, it allows them to be adjusted to the shooter's hand position. 










(M)ulti-Use Carrying Case


Your total XD(M) experience starts the day you open your case. In fact, it starts with your case. This rugged case is as durable as the XD(M) it houses and can be re-tasked to protect any number of items from a laptop to multiple XD(M) pistols.





(M)agazine X-Tensions


With interchangeable backstraps and Mag X-Tensions, SPRINGFIELD ARMORYhas added another level of comfort. Personalize your grip length to fit your capacity needs. (Compact model only)




XDM STANDARDS

 In 2001, Springfield Armory set out to show its customers, the firearms industry, and the rest of the world a whole new standard in ergonomic design and available features. With the introduction of the XD polymer pistol, they did just that….






Loaded Chamber Indicator

 The loaded chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify visually or by touch, and without a doubt, that there is a round in the chamber.





Striker Status Indicator

 The shooter can check the striker status indicator by sight or touch to verify the striker is in the cocked position. 










USA Trigger System

 The Ultra Safety Assurance USA Trigger System guards against accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the XD's trigger in place until direct, rearward pressure is applied.





Grip Safety

 Allows it to fire only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.









Will trade for:
 I am only looking for the following. FNP 45 or .223/5.56.
 I have not marked this gun up at all and will expect the same of your trade.
 I can still get .223 for .37 a round in bulk by being deligent, 5.56 is only slightly higher at .42 a round. 200 rounds through it, it is less that 6 weeks old. I purchased the third magazine for $50 and the Blackhawk holster for $30. So I would expect no less then 1000 rounds."

These sell for $1,699.00 new.  Willing to sell for $1,300.00  This is a good deal so I'm pretty firm on the price.  You would be buying this for less than retail, no sales tax, background check/fee, and no waiting.  Willing to entertain trades, but not for junk.  Don't waste my time with low ball offers, or crappy trades, I won't respond.  Face to Face sale only.  CCW holders will be given first consideration for the gun.  Need to be legal to buy guns in colorado.


A favorite among Benelli shotguns, the Benelli Super Black Eagle II sets the standard for styling, versatility and performance by which all other semi-auto shotguns are judged. If you’re looking for a 12-gauge shotgun with unfailing reliability—the kind of reliability that you can count on—your search is over. As the original 3-1/2"" semi-auto shotgun, the Super Black Eagle was on the cutting edge of shotgun development. The proven Benelli Inertia Driven® bolt mechanism allows the Super Black Eagle II to shoot 2-3/4"", 3"" and even 3-1/2"" magnum ammunition without adjustments."

The opening in the front of the slide makes for quicker slide action and weight reduction. This is a hard to find Glock, at an excellent price.
With its extended barrel and extended line of sight, the GLOCK 35 allows accurate hit patterns even with rapid firing.

Because of its unsurpassed reliability, above-average magazine capacity of 17 cartridges in the standard magazine and its low weight, it is trusted by law enforcement officers in their daily duties throughout the world. It is safe, easy and quick to use through the revolutionary “Safe Action” trigger system. GLOCK 35 – designed for tactical applications, proven in competition.

I own a pair of these exact waders in size 11 and they are truly a best buy for duck season. Due to the 1600 grams of thinsulate and durability of these waders. I have owned my pair for over three seasons now and literally hunt every single weekend. Climates from warm ducks in Arkansas, to cold Snow Geese  and Canadians in Illinois. I purchased these for my fiance in hopes she would share my passion she unfortunately does not like it very much. :( She is a 6'0"" tall ladies size 10 they fit her with plenty of room. She has only wore them getting in the boat to the blind back in the truck. TAGS STILL ON. The actual boot size is 7 mens believe me I didn't believe it without seeing it for my own eyes that they fit her. I truthfully believe they would fit up to a ten mens. Waders always run bigger than normal boot size. I don't have the receipt any longer and as you may guess they are a bit snug on me. So with that being said I would like for someone to get some use out of them. I realize I can't get full price which stinks but I am asking $125.00 for them."

- New, has a few scuffs from handling but has never had a round down it.
- Perfect to build an SBR (All NFA applies) or pin a flash for a shorter carbine.
- Uses Carbine gas tube.

The .223 Wylde chamber, which is a mix between .223 and 5.56. For those of you that do not know, the 5.56×45 NATO is NOT exactly the same as a .223 Rem. The 5.56 spec allows for slightly longer chambers for higher pressures. The .223 has a tighter chamber around the neck and is shorter which allows for a bit better accuracy. You can shoot .223 ammo in a 5.56 chamber, but it is DANGEROUS to shoot 5.56 (surplus for instance) ammo in a .223 chamber.   What the Wylde chamber does is allow for 5.56 ammo with slightly tighter chamber for better accuracy. So you can shoot both 5.56 and 223 safely with good accuracy. And to top it off this is a match grade barrel with even tighter tolerances."

This is a Springfield XDM Compact with 3.8"" barrell in Bi-Tone. I Bought this a few months ago and fired less than 50 rounds through it. It comes with all the regular Springfield items including 1 compact mag & 1 full size 19 rd mag, OTW Holster, Double Mag Holster, changable grip pieces, speed loader, etc, etc. Accurate pistol! Excellent condition! Bi-Tone with stainless slide.

The XD has taken on another design in the XDM Compact. The ""M"" stands for a Model contour frame, Major grasp slide serrations, Match-grade barrel, and Minimal reset trigger. The XDM has a whole other level in precision. With an incredible attention to detail, no handgun company approaches specification and precision engineering like Springfield Armory.

I purchased this in Feb 2013 from a company called ""Union Outfitters"".This BushMaster AR is unique because there is Red color fill on the BushMaster Snake logo(on the mag well), I have never seen a BushMaster with this. The rifle has never had a round through it,and has been kept in it's original packaging since I bought it. The barrel is a 1/7 twist and is chrome lined, it has a Magpul Moe grip with storage options, it also comes with an upgraded Magpul STR stock with battery storage and 6 position locking options. It has a Rifle length Black Magpul MOE hand guard along however, I can switch it out for an FDE Magpul rifle hand guard if you prefer or just include it for an extra $25.This package also includes a black Magpul RVG grip. In addition the rifle will include an EoTech XPS2 ""Zombie Stopper"" Red dot sight(includes original packaging) and the AR will come with a 2 brand new(1 still in original packaging) black 30 rd Pmags, there is also a Magpul trigger guard installed on the rifle, plastic rifle case,instruction manual, lock, and 1yr warranty from Bushmaster. I am asking $1400 cash for everything. Please serious inquirees only and don't email me several times about how you are going to buy it and all of a sudden stop. I'm not interested in trades. Thanks!(oh by the way, I originally paid $1700 shipped for the rifle and $450 for the EoTech. So I actually sunk $2150 into this thing and I have receipts)"

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. The SP2022 can easily be converted from a Double-Action/Single-Action to a Double-Action Only configuration through a unique integral fire control unit. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols

__________________________COPIED FROM SIG__________________________________

THE LEGEND CONTINUES, The legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic is a semi-automatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate. Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic features the original Swiss folding stock, as well as a polymer ergonomic forend.

The Classic’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ button rifled barrel.
SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor. The SIG 556 Classic brings back the look and feel of one of the world’s most sought after military rifles but on a platform available for law enforcement and responsible citizens

I would say that most of this brass is once fired judging by where it is collected and the type of shooters that frequent the location.  I cannot confirm anything besides the .44 special as 100%  once-fired because I am the one who fired it all.

I don't reload, so I have no immediate need.  At the same time, I get that there is some value there.  I know it's not gold and I don't pretend that what I've got is impossible to find.
