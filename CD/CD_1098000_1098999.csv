The best damned rifle I ever had. Does not get better.

This bad boy has 1,000 rounds down the tube. Nothing for her, she is a beast. This is a genuine milled receiver SA93. This is production serial number 165. That's not a typo. This is a serious rifle for a serious shooter. 

With a UTG front aluminim quad rail, a CAA metal AR style buttsock, and a CAA pinned AR style butt and custom finger molded grip with swappable spacers, this is the nicest shooting ak you can find.

She's a no shit tak driver. I have consistently tagged my targets, at range, without any sites. Go ahead, add a red dot, doesn't need it. This is the rifle you get if you want something that WILL NEVER FAIL. I've beem good to her, but this bad ass bitch doesn't need it. She can be put through mud, muck and mayhem, she'll still fire.

It really pains me to let her go, as there's been so many fond memories I could cry. I need the cash to fund other things, like getting a motorcycle so I can get around.

Comes with 4 pre ban 30 round mags, and one 10 rounds mag, all of which are made of metal. As well, I'll include all the parts and piece I have for her, old thumbhole wood stock, some other parts, etc. I've even got about 1000 rounds of ammo i'm willing to sell with it.

This is a private sale, face to face transaction. Cash only. I am a 100% legit seller, who is easy as they come to do business with. I am not coming to your house. I am not compromising with you and your spare lint and shit I don't want. I am not screwing around about my pricing. I know what I am loosing, and the price of what you're gaining.

If you've got a trade great, if not I'll take 600. 
If you've contacted me before offering the cash please mention that and I'll make sure I make good on your coming first. 

It is a Colt M4 Carbine AR15 weapon chambered in .22lr.
I actually think it makes a GREAT defense weapon, one that my wife feels very comfortable handling.
However its purpose is to familiarize yourself with ar15 combat.

.223/5.56 ammo is drying up and nobody can afford to blow through their stock pile at the range.
However if you expect to be confident handling your weapon you need to spend lots of time shooting it, 1000 rnds downrange or more.

It is the exact same size and weight of a Colt M4 chambered for .223 however shoots the much less expensive .22lr.

Colt comes with tactical forearm, adjustable stock and 30rnd magazine."

They do not make these anymore because during the economic downturn they started to compete the the kits from the higher end parent company DW drums, so now they just make low end stuff.

This is the perfect opportunity to have everything you need for one price and know that it is good quality equipment.

Everything here is in good shape, well taken care of by a serious and caring musician. They show very little wear on anything except the heads themselves.

This rifle has been fitted with an aftermarket shroud that reduces the sound of the shot dramatically. The round hitting it's target is usually louder than the actual shot. Don't let that fool you though. The Airforce Condor is the most powerful of all pellet guns that are either .177, .20,.22, and the mighty .25! An adjustable power wheel lets you control the velocity from 800-1200fps with 26 grain pellets. You get all the benefits of a silenced .22LR, but with the benefits of an airgun. This gun is absolutely devastating on small game out to 150 yards. The rifle uses a bottle of high pressure air that lasts about 40 shots before needing to be refilled back up to 3,000 psi. Don't worry, with this rifle comes with thousands of rounds of THE BEST pellets from a few different manufacturers. The prices of these guns run pretty high, but have lifetime warranties, and are built here in the USA. I will list everything that you will see in the pictures so you know exactly what you are buying. You will be all set and won't need a single upgrade other than your favorite scope. You will get a almost new pump and adapter to fill the rifle, and a lifetime supply of ammo to keep you shooting all day. I can sell the scope with the rifle, but expect to pay every penny I paid for it because high dollar scopes usually hold their value. ( Hawke Sidewinder Tac 30 6.5-20x42mm = $420 )
Everything you get in the package.
----------------------------------------------
Airforce Condor .25 PCP air rifle w/ 24"" lothar walther barrel
Airforce folding bipod
Airforce 3600 psi 3 stage hand pump
R&L Airgun's custom shroud for maximum sound reduction
Phillips pellet holder
--------
450 Beeman Crow Magnum hollow point pellets ( 26 grain)
450 JSB Exact King domed pellets ( 25 grain )
450 JSB Predator Polymags ( 26 grain )
160 Eun Jin hunting pellets ( 35 grain )
80 Beeman quick cleaning pellets
---------
Scope is optional. It is the most envied scope of airgun users abroad. If you are familiar with the YouTube channel for EDGUNUSA, then you probably know what I mean.
If you want the scope, it comes with the adjustment wheel, cleaning cloth, rings, and hard case that it came in. Just specify in your reply if you'll be wanting the scope with the rifle.
Since the rifle has very little recoil, I have been using the Orion Steady Pix Deluxe camera mount, which allows me to set up a digital camera behind the scope to record my shots, hunts, ect. If You purchase the scope with the rifle, I'll include this mount for free. ( $50 value)
-----------
Price of package without scope and rings = $700
--------
Package with scope, rings, and camera mount = $1100
--------
I am not desperate to sell this gun. No low ball offers will be replied to. Price I have listed is VERY FAIR! These guns last forever, and are cheaper to shoot than even a .22LR. 
This is a serious air rifle, that gets 1"" groups at 100 yards.
Would be able to travel for serious buyer, will not ship. Since this is an airgun, it is classified as a toy, thus allowing you to shoot practically anywhere as long as you don't damage property, or hit someone. These pellets go right through a 2x4 with ease, so always treat this gun as if you we're shooting a .22LR or any firearm for that matter.
This rifle is NOT back yard friendly without the shroud installed. The shroud is specifically made to attach to the frame of the rifle so as to not need special paperwork like an FFA silencer that would attach to the barrel of a firearm. Inside the shroud is 5 cone shaped plastic baffles that work in the same manner as the baffles in a silencer. In order to have full suppressed capability you don't need to buy a specific type of ammo, but rather adjust the power wheel on the rifle to drop the pellets below subsonic velocities. Feel free to email me if you are interested, or text me REDACTED and I can send you more pictures. I am willing to brief the buyer on how to operate the rifle and fill the rifle's high pressure air tank safely. I will also include the original box and instructions. I take care of all my guns extremely well, and will include the special gun oil that this rifle needs when you want to strip and clean the gun.
Text anytime. I am a creature of the night for sure and stay up late most of the time."
