Since, saigas have been banned from import. 
 
Ill start with the bad first. While the gun does fire, it jams every so often. Sometimes after 2 rounds, sometimes after 10. But dont be afraid, if youre familiar with the saiga 12, and do a little reasearch, youll know and find this is a common thing from the factory and is easily fixable, especially to someone knoledgeable about guns. Its a simple bolt plish shich can be found how to diy online, or the bolt can be sent off to be done professionally for around 100 bucks. As i took on this project, i have worked on the bolt myself throughout the years as a trial and error process and it has gone from jamming every 1 or 2 rounds, to the above mentioned. So it is getting better, however unfortunately, what i dont have is the ability to go shoot anymore as time, nor the location to do so permits. Its been about 2 years since I had it out last shooting and at this point has just been sitting in my safe and its time for it to move on. I could just send the bolt off to be done, but figured id leave it for the potential buyer to decide which route theyd rather take. It worth adding the gun does cycle low brass far better than standard shells, but i havent fired any low brass in awhile, so the above mentioned firing rates were all with 2 3/4 bird shot.  my loss, your gain.

Only 36 rounds down the pipe in this beauty. This is a real head turner at the range. You won't find this firearm in any local gun shops, you have to order one. It was an anniversary gift from my wife but it's proven to be a bit too much for a man my age. Included with the revolver are 400 rounds of .44 magnum ammunition (350 rds. American Eagle, 50 rds. Winchester) You also get a beautiful set of Tigerwood grips along with the original Hogue rubber grips. The cost of the ammunition alone was over $250. If you're familiar with this caliber you know that a box of 50 rounds can go for $35-$40. The beautiful grips pictured were another $75. We paid $1400 plus tax for the firearm which has an MSRP of $1619. So you'd be getting an incredible heirloom quality firearm at a very good price. This firearm can only increase in value over time. It has a top rail for mounting optics, a magna ported barrel, dovetailed ramp front sights, a PC trigger with a PC tuned action. The price is firma and the transaction will be completed at a local gun shop. That is for your security and my own. This is one very serious firearm. Trades are possible but not likely."

The safety, decocking lever, slide stop levers and magazine catch are completely ambidextrous making this a perfect fit for right or left handers. The Thunder Pro UC maintains the Bersa tradition of accuracy, reliability and durability and is an excellent choice for anyone needing a tough, reliable, compact sidearm.Like more expensive guns this one also had an integrated decock safety that works similar to an H&K. Ultra compact but double stack maintains a 7+1 Mag capacity of .45 acp. It also operates in double or single action with a trigger comparable to my Sig 226. This gun is in excellent shape and has performed flawlessley. I had a kimber pro carry 2 but switched to this gun due to it being bouble and singe action with a decock. This gun carries better than the kimber in my opinion and is just as reliable. Great gun im just looking to downsize to 9mm and would trade or cash $400 firm. Has 1 mag that it came with from the factory and a concealed carry tuckable leather holster."

The aggressive texture of the grip lets the shooter more easily operate the pistol. The large magazine catch allows for easy removal of the six round magazine. Engineered to the same standards, the G43 can withstand the same tortures as other GLOCK pistols. I am also including the holster pictured as well as the EMP magazine extender. The weapon has had 350 rounds through it and has been taken care of meticulously."

E. Evans, Philadelphia, Large Bore Sporting Percussion Double Barrel Shotgun, 7 Ga, mfg. ca. 1850's. Within the collector world of large bore shotguns those made by quality American manufacturers are the most highly sought after. Typically these big guns are associated with market hunters however a gun of this style and quality was more than likely made for a wealthy local sportsman or notable. J. E. Evans was a very high quality maker out of Philadelphia who is best known for his ""Philadelphia"" style derringers and fine sporting shotguns. This gun is an outstanding example of his work that remains in totally untouched original condition. The heavy Damascus barrels measure 34 5/16"" long and feature a brass bead front sight. Unlike nearly all ""American"" shotguns of the period which used imported English barrels, this gun bares no proofs whatsoever. Only Evans' serial number ""273"" can be seen stamped under the breech suggesting that he very well may have manufactured the entire gun. Inside diameter of bores measure exactly .875"". The upper rib is stamped ""J. E. EVANS PHILADA"" with both locks marked ""J. E. EVANS PHILA"". The barrels retain approximately 80% of their original browned finish which has turned a deep plum color with hints of Damascus pattern visible. The breech, barrel tang, locks, and hammers show mottled traces of case color turned silver, while the remainder of furniture has a silver/gray patina. The gun is very finely engraved throughout. The stock is beautifully figured and features a checkered wrist and double wedged forearm.. Serious buyer only"

With a contoured slide, the majority of the reciprocating mass is also centered on the bore, equating to less muzzle flip. It has a swappable mag release with an adjustable, extended button and three settings to allow shooters to set it in their most comfortable spot. Also included in the box is an extended ambidextrous safety set and a number of buffers for use with lighter springs and/or hotter rounds. The Shadow 2 has target sights - fiber optic on front and a serrated, black HAJO rear (click adjustable for elevation, drift adjustable for windage). Best of all, the trigger components give smooth DA and crisp, clean SA while drastically reducing trigger reset. A hardy nitride finish coats the entire pistol, leaving it nearly impervious to corrosion. This model has a black nitride slide, gray nitride frame and thin, black aluminum grip panels."

It is a 31st series rifle. Ser# 5735. Bolt mismatch. Bolt matches itself. Barrel is chrome lined. The bore is very nice. The rifling except at the very end of the muzzle is excellent. The pitting at the end of the muzzle should not affect accuracy much if at all. I have had rifle worse than this and they were fine. Stock is solid. NOW, for the best part. Looks like some soldier or sailor picked this up as they were stationed on or around  Midway Island on Oct.4, 1945. MY best guess is that it was picked up and brought onto a ship or to the armorer and refinished at that time. It sports the dark manganese parkerizing of the mid-late war finishes that the Military was using. Very cool piece here!$250 PLUS ACTUAL SHIPPING. I do NOT charge over my cost to ship!  Email me  at REDACTED or call Shawn at REDACTED. Must go to an 03 FFL or better.
