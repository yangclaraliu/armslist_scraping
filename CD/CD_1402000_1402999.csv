OVERVIEW:

Its speed, versatility, bone-crushing power and swift pointing characteristics couldn't be topped, so we added a host of upgrades to our Model 11-87 Sportsman Super Magnum to improve handling, sight acquisition and more. All models now feature rubber overmolded grip panels on the stock and fore-end for a sure hold in all weather conditions and a black padded sling, with other enhancements on individual configurations. These shotguns tame the biggest, baddest, 3 1/2"" 12-gauge rounds with a soft-shooting action and our revolutionary SuperCell™ recoil Pad.

Our new Model 11-87 Sportsman Super Magnum Waterfowl hides right along with you thanks to full Mossy Oak® Duck Blind™ camo coverage. It can be custom-fit to you build, clothing and shooting form; and includes Adjustable Length of Pull Kit, offering a full 1"" of adjustability. The 28"" barrel accepts Rem™ Chokes. And the included Wingmaster HD® Specialized Waterfowl Choke tubes are a lethal ticket when the birds are cupped and committed. It also comes with HiViz® sights featuring interchangeable light pipes.

Duck Creek Armory formed in 2010 with one goal in mind. We wanted to set ourselves apart by providing good customer service, fair pricing and honest old-fashioned values.

Each and every item we sell, service or build is backed by those same customer service principles. At Duck Creek Armory, we have decades of experience designing, building and shooting the AR-15 platform. In March 2012, we began manufacturing the AR-15.


Each rifle is fully customizable to meet customer specifications. Along with our base models, we can meet any needs our users may desire.

Our rifles are completely designed, milled, machined and assembled in Davenport Iowa. We keep our manufacturing jobs at home, here in the community that we support and love. We hold ourselves to the highest standards with these rifles. We use all billet receivers, milled from a solid piece of aluminum. We use components that are the finest the industry has to offer, such as White Oak, Yankee Hill Machine, Magpul, Troy Industries and Midwest Industries. Due to these standards, we guarantee each rifle by a Lifetime In-House Warranty.

The BP9CC’s barrel is 3.3 inches long, it is striker fired, with a crisp trigger and a “fast” trigger reset of just a few millimeters. Dovetailed sights are a standard 3-dot setup, the front dovetail being a Sig specification and the rear being a Glock specification, so it should be very easy for night sight manufacturers to “mix and match” parts from their existing product lines to sell night sights for the BP9CC. The frame features a standard Picatinny light rail mount up front, as we have come to expect. There is no external “active” safety, but the trigger has an M&P style cam safety built into it. Bersa included a firing pin safety to make the gun “drop safe,” and an integral locking system that makes the gun legal to sell in those states requiring it. Like all Bersas the BP9CC is rated for +P ammunition, despite weighing only 21.5 ounces.

I bought this rifle used and have never personally fired it. It is in nearly new condition and the previous owner said it had less than 50 rounds fired through it. You can see by the pictures (will post shortly) that it is wonderful condition. All the bluing is intact, and there only two tiny nicks in the wood stock. 

I will include the ammo I have which is a box of HORNADY CUSTOM 44MAG 240gr XTP. This is a full box (20) of new cartridges. (pic of label to soon)


Im not particularly looking for a trade, as Im looking to use the cash for a non-shooting sport item. However, Beretta PX4 compact or CZ SP-01 tactical are on my wanted list. I would also like to have a S&W Governor, and would add some cash to swing the deal.

It's about 15.5 inches long and I'd estimate is 7/8 inch in diameter.  It's probably a 4x and has a standard crosshair reticle.  It has no external windage or elevation adjustment so the mount that you put it in will need to be adjustable.  The optics are still good but it's a little dim in all but bright light.  This is a heavy old tube so you know there's quality built in.  It's been mounted on an old .22 rimfire rifle fore many years.  I'm asking $75.  I'll try to have some photos posted soon.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines. SureFire offers a heavy-duty magazine pouch specifically designed for the MAG5-60 that attaches to a MOLLE system vest."

chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.
The SR-556E also features an A2-style pistol grip,  two new 30-round Magpul PMAG gen 3™ magazines with covers, and is packed in a soft-sided carry case.

Excellent condition. Pistol: Taurus 'Raging Bull' nickel plated .444, 8 3/8"" barrel 5 Shot Revolver. Less than 15 rds fired. Great shooting gun with TONS of penetration and KNOCK-DOWN power! I bought this just a few months ago as my hunting gun. I can’t hit squat with it. At 70 I find I need a riffle with a POWERFUL scope to even get close. This pistol can be fitted with a scope or reflex sight for hunting or simply use the fixed sights for home defense. 8 3/8” barrel with muzzle porting. 5 shot 44 mag.  Factory box and security keys also included.

The Original Raging Bulls are still among America's favorite hunting handguns. Chambering the popular and powerful .44 Magnum rounds, the mighty 444 revolvers are built for a lifetime of tough use. Offering award-winning designs in four distinct barrel lengths, these monsters feature a crisp trigger break and smooth pull for accuracy, cushioned grips and factory porting to reduce felt recoil.

Dual lockup cylinder
Provides stability under extreme chamber pressures.
Cushioned insert grip
Exclusive on the RAGING ™ Series large frame revolvers, Cushioned insert grip pillows recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
Porting
Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

 Beretta 17 + 1 Round 9MM Pistol w/Picatinny Rail & Matte Black Finish

The Beretta Px4 Storm pistol is the most advanced expression of technological and aesthetic features in a semi-automatic sidearm. Built around a modular concept that a pistol can be adapted to different needs and modes of operations, without compromising on ergonomics and the renowned Beretta reliability and performance, the Px4 Storm emphasizes power, ease of handling, performance and reliability. Beretta designed innovative locked breech with rotating barrel system, the strongest action to date. The light yet durable frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of technopolymer reinforced fiberglass.

The Beretta Px4 Storm Pistol in F versions are equipped with an ambidextrous safety lever positioned on the slide that disconnects the linkage between the trigger and the sear, allowing to decock the hammer (if cocked or if positioned on the half-cock position) with maximum safety, thanks to the rotation of the rear part of the firing pin. The safety may be engaged also with the hammer decocked and with slide open."

Speer's Gold Dot Hollow Point is one of the best self-defense rounds available today. A top choice of law enforcement agencies across the country, the Gold Dot uses a patented process that forms the hollow point cavity in two stages. The core is pre-fluted to define the ""fault"" lines of expansion, controlling final diameter and retained weight. The second process finishes the cavity and controls the rate of expansion. Select, clean burning propellants deliver optimum velocity while ensuring consistent chamber pressures. Non-corrosive CCI primers are used for highly sensitive and reliable performance, as well as nickel plated brass cases for smooth feeding and durability. These technical features allow Speer's engineers to fine tune each specific caliber and bullet weight for maximum field performance.

Asking $2000.00, would prefer local buyer, but can arrange transfer to your dealer...  Shipping is extra...

Now the same Benelli M4 used by the U.S. Marine Corps can be your home defense shotgun of choice. When the U.S. Marine Corps went shopping for a shotgun, they bought the M4 — the 12-gauge shotgun that functions the first time, every time. Its unique Auto Regulating Gas Operated (A.R.G.O.) system developed by Benelli engineers has dual stainless steel, self-cleaning pistons located just ahead of the chamber that operate directly against the bolt assembly.The M4 Tactical comes standard with a Picatinny rail for optics, a fully adjustable ghost-ring rear sight and fixed-blade front sight and a black synthetic pistol-grip style stock. An optional standard stock is offered. With features and reliability that do it for the U.S. military, the Benelli M4 is an excellent choice for your own home defense plan."
868,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1402868,For Sale:  1905 Colt Police Positive Revolver MAKE OFFER,"Spartanburg, Greenville, South Carolina",$ 300,"Listed On: Tuesday, May 21, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is a genuine Colt Police Positive.  The patent date is 1905.  Some history on these guns below.  The first $300 buys it.  That is an awesome price on a piece of American history.  Tight lockup and beautiful antique patina.  The gun sports original grips and is fully functional.  

 The First issue of the Police Positive ran from the revolver’s introduction in 1907 until 1927. Sporting Colt’s standard hard rubber grips, it was offered with barrel lengths of 2.5 (available only in .32 caliber), 4, 5, and 6 inches, and was chambered for the .32 Long Colt (which would also fit the .32 Short Colt), .32 Colt New Police, and .38 Colt New Police cartridges.[1][2][3][6] Checkered Walnut grips became standard after 1923. The Second issue began in 1928 and ran until 1947, adding a somewhat heavier frame as well as a serrated topstrap to reduce sight glare, while retaining the wooden grips.[6] Both of Colt's “New Police” rounds were actually slight redesigns of existing S&W cartridges, the .32 S&W Long and .38 S&W with the bullet noses flattened, as Colt resisted providing its main competitor with any free advertising.[2] Colt's Positive Lock safety, the innovation responsible for the gun's introduction, functioned by preventing the firing pin from striking the primer of the cartridge unless the trigger was deliberately pulled. Intended to address deficiencies of earlier models such as the Single Action Army, the Positive Lock prevented an accidental discharge even if the hammer was struck or the pistol was dropped, allowing the revolver to be safely carried with all six chambers loaded.[7] The revolver’s sights consisted of a half-moon blade front with a fixed iron open rear sight, which was a simple V-notch shaped groove milled into the revolver’s topstrap.[2]"

Older piece but fires like a champ, never had any problems, its a fun lil gun to shoot, very accurate no recoil. It looks just like a Walther PP the ole James Bond gun. Sweet lil piece love the gun, just want something different, I can throw in some balistic plates to make trades more even, there Large size plates rated 7.62x39.
