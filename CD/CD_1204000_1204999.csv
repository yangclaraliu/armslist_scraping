With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters alike.

It is based on the 5.56mm NATO chambered PLR-16 pistol and shares many parts including the grip and front and rear sights. The PLR-22 is not a simple conversion kit, it is a standalone firearm chambered for the .22LR and is designed for target shooting, plinking, or small game hunting. The PLR-22 and SU-22 operate by blowback action and have a 4140 steel bolt that rides on steel guide rails inside the polymer receiver. The ejector is attached to one of the guide rails and the recoil spring is located above the barrel. The cross-bolt safety and magazine release operate identically to the PLR-16 and SU-16.

The PLR-22 accepts many of the PLR-16 accessories.  It has a threaded muzzle, and tactical suppressors will work very well on the Kel-Tec, greatly reducing the noise signature from the ten inch barrel, and just adding to the overall fun. Weighing just 45 ounces empty, and just about 13 ounces more with the handguards and an empty magazine, the PLR-22 is a handy little weapon, built for fun, but possessing the reliability and accuracy to fill other roles as well, such as hunting or defending the homestead from predators such as foxes and wild dogs. With packs of wild dogs becoming more of a problem each year in wilderness and camping areas, the PLR-22 would prove to be very handy and effective against such threats. While a .22 LR is not the best choice against criminal attacks, the PLR-22 could fill that role as well, unleashing a barrage of lead hollowpoints at one or more attackers, with speed and precision. Whatever the use, the PLR-22 is a dandy little weapon, possessing top-notch accuracy, and providing loads of inexpensive shooting fun.

Question:
FN Browning - 1922 - .32 - Blue - 49163 -
Queen Wilhelmina Crown on top of slide and rear of gun under slide 21 on left trigger guard, what looks to be D 7 5 on right of trigger guard...Lion figure(?) above P.V in various locations with letter Y with star above Y located below P.V under Lion figure(?) FN logo on black grips Have documentation of captured enemy equipment from Feb.15,1946(original and duplicate)...wondering age and round about value of gun, slightly worn, no holster

Answer:
The Browning designed, FN Model 1922 was initially produced for the Yugoslavian military. The pistol is an elongated FN Model 1910 with the additional length gained by adding a removal piece to the front of the slide.

As a gun community we need to come together to rid ourselves of one of the deadliest sins - greed. We are all tired of seeing $500 AK-47s listed at $2000, and $800 fully upgraded AR-15s posted for $4500. Guess what? As gun buyers and members on this and other forums, we are just as responsible for the state of our society as the price gougers and hoarders. We need to come together and do two thing: (1) STOP BUYING AT THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES and (2) click on the ad, go to ""Flag"" at the top, and press ""overpriced."" This whole process takes 1.3968 seconds.

These price criminals only have business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement. NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing but let's face it, do we really need 100 round drums or is that more of a want? Every time you skip over a $10,000 ad for a $3000 purchased SCAR 17, you have just became part of the problem. Send them a hate email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly flag their ad so we can get prices back under the 1000s where they all belong. For the uninformed or misinformed audience, I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy and paste it to another state's listing in the US. Add your own two cents in if you'd like or if I got anything wrong. The regularity will only return if we make it.

AR-15: $600-$1300 depending on brand and usage (shots fired, wear, etc..)
AK-47: $400-$900
SKS:$300-$500
SCAR 16/17: $2000/$2800
AR-10: $1000-1500
Glock: $400-600
10/22: $229
ACR: $2000
1911: $600-1100
9mm ammo: $0.25/round is on the higher end
223/5.56: $0.35/round
.308/7.62 NATO: maybe up to $1/round (on high side)
.22: $0.05/round is high

Again, feel free to add your $0.02, make changes, repost, and then get to the flagging of overpriced scams.

If you dont know how to use a weapon take a class or get rid of it. Stop trying to be gun-ho and buy a assault weapon just to look cool. You guys look like idiots posting a pic of you holding your toy .22 ""ar"" wearing airsoft gear. If you want to have that image be a man and join the military and stop pretending. If you cant pass the requirements to get in, you shouldnt be owning a gun."

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

New in box.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

I own a few Taurus 1911s, along with my high dollar Kimbers, Sigs, Springfields, and even got a Wilson- and I swore I'd never buy another high dollar 1911 again- but I still do- that's the only drawback to the Taurus- only a few finishes and options to choose from-  anyway....$500 takes her home.

So thus I'm back with an amazing rifle guaranteed to stop anyone dead in their tracks... Introducing the PTR91PDW .308... This gun is a beast an tremendously hard to find in today's market... Thanks alot Obama.... I just recently was lucky enough to snag one of these badboys at Cabellas, I was there when they opened and they had 1 in stock they just recieved  from last nights delivery... I asked the guy behind the counter how often they get them in and he simply said maybe 1 every 3 months because they have been on backorder for so long. I told him to ring it up... It was 1350 not Including tax. I have a nice hard case for it as u can see, and I added a set of custom rails because they only make one specific set that fits the original hardware and it is out of stock everywhere. A foregrip will be included, as well as a NEBO high lumen spotlight, and also a tactical quick release harness.. I have roughly 500 rnds of ammo as well. Only serious offers please, I would like to get 1250$ OBO out of the SBR and I will throw in the light and strap + all accessories. Also 400 round of .308 / 7.72 40$ for 50 rnds with rifle purchase. See specs below. Please call me at REDACTED or email me at REDACTED (however phonecall or text is easier way to reach me)...

I would like to trade a very nice example of the 1944 dated Mosin Nagant PU sniper rifle for an original matching New England Westinghouse M91.

The original WWII PU sniper that I offer up in trade is one of the better examples, this maker and model year is not currently available for purchase by any of the major importers, the only exceptions would be entirely luck of the draw with very long odds of getting a 1944 Tula.

This rifle is from the more desired and lower production Tula arsenal and has no visible [I], [X] or [/] refurbishment stamps on the barreled action, stock or scope, it's all stamped matching with the letter prefix's (no line-outs), has an excellent bore and the original crown.

The original and matching Progress factory scope is sharp and clear as well.

This rifle is not upgradeable within it's category and I would not consider trading it if it were not a duplicate model and year for me.

So... if you have an original and matching numbers New England Westinghouse Mosin Nagant you would be willing to trade for a pretty scarce, Tula PU sniper please send me a email and we'll talk.

Many detailed photographs available to ""NEW"" owners considering a trade.

TIA"

The DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.
