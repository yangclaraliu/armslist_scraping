This is a 9mm stainless kimber ultra carry 2, in GREAT condition, that I personally customized. I installed Kimbers 2 hole design trigger (had the regular 3 hole) they only use on certain custom models, TruGlo TFX fiber optic & night sight combo, Wilson Combats extended slide stop, new complete recoil assembly from Kimber, and of course the hogue grip. I have the original box with owners manual and everything you would get buying new. It will come with 2 kimber mag (8RD), Fobus paddle holster (made just for Kimbers w/ Kimber written vertically on it). I’m not exaggerating when I say this shoots insanely accurate and has been 100% reliable; she’s a beauty and a beast. If you can’t figure out where I get my sale price at, then this probably isn’t the gun for you. I have no reason to lie when I say I’m loosing money on this, the slide stop alone was $60 (worth it to be able to reach it with your shooting hand). Why 9mm instead of .45? It’s a small lightweight conceal carry gun for one, you can carry at least 2 extra rounds, and it shoots very easy with all 9mm brands and grains. I have a couple friends with .45s in this and similar models, there’s a noticeable difference in recoil, it’s kinda funny when they want to shoot mine more then theirs. The sights are set for point of impact which I LOVE and at 7-10 yards she’s a tack driver. She can shoot much further but the range I go to is maxed out at 10 yards. 9mm ammo is cheaper, AND 9mm defense rounds have proven themselves in ballistic testing time and time again against 40sw and 45acp. ALWAYS cleaned and lubed her after every range trip, she deserves the attention when outshooting my buddies Dan Wesson and shot for shot with his Nighthawk. I get complimented every time I go to the range “what model is that, where’d you buy it? I’ve never seen a Kimber like that”. It makes me feel good about making something in a unique image. Why am I selling? Believe me I don’t want to, but the world is full of surprises (some good & some bad). I apologize for the long post but just wanted to make things clear and straight for my potential selling of this Kimber, I call her “Kimmy”. I can be reached at REDACTED. Here’s a link of what they cost newhttps://www.sportsmansoutdoorsuperstore.com/products2.cfm/ID/28413Contact with a text please and can send more pictures if desired. Reasonable offers considered, only trades would be a XDS, Glock 26, Glock 19, CZ P07, any quality 9mm PLUS cash of course.Would sell for less with 1 mag and without the holster but for what I’m asking for it, it’s a steal of a deal. The first picture shows the upgrades better and the 2 other pictures show the new truglo TFX sights. Why some pictures post sideways on Armslist really sucks but I guess it is what it is?"

It has never had a malfunction. I am including a 30 round mag, a Blackhawk Gun Sling, the original box, paperwork and everything else that came with it. I am also including a Assault Gun Case so you don't need anything else except ammo! This gun comes with the removable handle that most guns don't. I also have the boxes and manuals for the scopes and mounts and they come with lifetime warranties. This gun sells new for over 1k and I would like to get $850 which I feel is a good deal especially considering all the extra's. You can take this gun out and be on target now and expect total reliability. Call Derek at REDACTED if interested."

These guns have some pretty cool historical reference as far as the 1968 weapons ban trying to eradicate cheap weapons such as these from entering the United States. This one was purchased by my grandfather in 50s based off the paperwork. For the age the gun is in great shape retaining over 90% of its original finish the only thing missing is the push rod which is missing on almost all of them. They were dubbed inferior guns and a lot of people say they're not even safe to shoot I have checked the tightness of the cylinder on this specific one and it is actually very tight and whines up so call me crazy but I have shot it several times for function testing but that is not a recommendation. These guns are mainly collected for their historical value, and not used ( although I know personally this one does function and doesn't spray let out the sides like the myths say!). I really have no sentimental value or use for the gun it will sit and be a good discussion piece or paperweight unless someone else can put it to use! 95 or best offer!"

This is the real deal and these are hard to find. There were originally 4 MOD auto knife models and the Tempest was one of them. MOD sold the company to Blackhawk in 2003 and quality went down from there. The original MOD blades were known for using superior materials and tight tolerances. They had a great reputation among the professional Mil and LE communities.This one is new old stock straight from my private collection. I've had it in the safe for well over a decade.No box. Never carried, sharpened, or used. Opens with authority. Locks up tight. Mint cond. These have a liner lock as opposed to pressing the button to release to fold.The pocket clip has a very small amount of play. I have not tightened it. Having slight play (movement) in the pocket clips was inherent to the early MOD blades - who knows why they didn't locktite them when they were built. Buyer is responsible for following any laws in their city/county."

Condition of the weapon, based on a condition evaluation at Cabelas roday, is 95‰. I was going to trade the piece for a different item, but am opting to sell it now instead. I only put around 50 rounds through the weapon, which aside from doing that, has just been spending time in my gun safe by her lonesome. It' a very popular firearm,  from a legendary German gun manufacturer. So she' about 450 rounds from even really being broke in yet.Shoots beautifully, point if aim/point of impact are dead on.Since your already looking at this ad, your probably already are interested in obtaining one. So here is just a bit more info on this firearm. It was purchased NIB from Osseo Gun Club late last year, and like I said, only has 50 rounds through it. I used only snytech rounds as part of the break in process to limit any fouling and junk, only primo ammo was used.Also, the gun is professionally cleaned and oiled, and this is the condition you will receive it.Finally, to sweeten the deal, I'll throw in 100 9mm rounds, free with the firearm.I dont need to sell it, so price is firm, please dont bombard me with ridiculous or insulting offers. Price includes too, the hard case, all paperwork, 2 larger back and side straps to adjust for comfort, and 2 magazines.I purchased this locally for $638. Another incentive to purchase this one is that you do not pay any sales tax (which saves ya about $50.). All in all, you save well over $100, and  get a hundred rounds of ammo, I also have a new premium Crossbreed holster, which I'd give you at a killer deal on. Cash and/or silver only payment method,and local pickup only please.  Buyer must have a current permit to purchase, carry, and sign a bill of sale..Im happy to answer any questions, but hopefully I've answered yours!"

The trigger is externally adjustable, the flat top is adjustable as well up to 20 moa, the furniture and handguard can be easily replaced with any standard AR stock pistol grip or hand guard and it has a folding stick that can be replaced and still fold. The scope is mounted with badger ordanance rings. Comes with 4, 10 round PMAGs but the rifle accepts 4 different types of magazines. A hard carry case that’s already cut. A level bubble on the scope. Atlas bipods and an atlas monopod all in perfect condition.  This is the new version with a smooth handguard and reinforced bolt shroud. I bought this rifle on JBLM for Christmas, same story for the glass. Since then I’ve fired exactly 70 rounds through the weapon. ZERO issues with the rifle. The only reason I’m interested in selling is because I’m looking to get an AR therefore, I’m open to considering trades. This is the .308 variant. Ask questions! Text or email.  REDACTED"

It's been well cleaned and taken care of, however, I bought it used and there is some wear on the bluing of the grip areas. The pistol functions just fine mechanically, but I noticed it prefers 124gr to 115gr. The rifling is crisp and it's much more accurate than I am. I'm including 2 magazines with the gun, both 14 rounders, with a parkerized finish. They have a slight bit of wear on the top from being well used. I'm also including a basic case, and 2 custom made kydex holsters, specifically for this gun. They're both in grey / black, for up to a 2"" belt. One is an IWB holster, and the other an OWB. I'm also throwing in a spring replacement kit I bought. I never got around to detail stripping the gun to replace the trigger / hammer / extractor springs, but they're all still there. This should give you two complete sets of springs. The magazine safety is still in place, so it's up to you whether you'd like to keep that, or remove it.If you've got a spare G19 or S&W M&P, I'd love to trade you this for it."

Please click link below to purchase.http://www.dealerease.net/catalog/product.asp?pid=95252&ret_id=140067 5 Flavor Variety 120 Pack Description: The secret to the Bradley Smoker are the Bradley smoker Bisquettes. To produce the bisquettes, hardwood smoker chips are bound together using precise quantities, at controlled pressures and densities. The flavor of the smoke is determined by the variety of smoker wood being burned. When smoker wood burns, the smoke flavor is produced in the initial minutes of the burn. Wood smoking chips or sawdust, burnt for too long, impart a distinct after-taste to smoked food. The flavor would also be affected by fluctuating high temperatures, gases and resins. However, with the Bradley flavor Bisquettes, you get perfect results every time you smoke. If you’re not sure how to use the bisquettes for a better smoke, be sure to check out Bradley smoker recipes to make some flavor packed food. Specifications: – 5 Flavor Variety – 120-pack – This variety pack contains 24 each of Apple, Alder, Mesquite, Hickory, and Maple for a variety of flavors. – Alder & Maple: These two flavors are commonly used for smoking seafood, hams and bacon – Apple: Light, sweet, delicate, and fruity flavored smoke, which is perfect for pork and poultry, and also great with beef, lamb and assorted. – Hickory: A distinctive taste mostly used when smoking beef and pork – Mesquite: Strong smoke, but sweeter than hickory; great with beef, pork, game, water fowl, and nuts"

Open to fair offers.It comes with two 15-Round Magazines, a chamber flag, original owner's manuals, factory case, and chamber lock.  All in factory new condition.Here is some information on it:The all-stainless construction of the P226 Elite Stainless provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this pistol an absolute pleasure to shoot. As the next generation P226, the Elite builds on the exceptional reputation of out-of-the-box accuracy with the addition of SIG's new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The SRT provides you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable short reset for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. Other key features include an ergonomic beavertail grip which allows you to obtain a confident grip from the holster even under stressful conditions. The beavertail also permits shooters to grip the pistol as high as possible without worrying about slide bite. Front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, SIGLITE Night Sights and custom wood grips complete the P226 Elite."
