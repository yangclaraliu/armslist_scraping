The following is from reference.com:The Colt Python was first introduced in 1955; models dated from 1955 through 1963 were handmade and featured either a Royal Blue or Bright Nickel finish. These are some of the most highly-prized guns for collectors.
Colt Pythons manufactured between 1955 and 1969 also feature numeral-based serial numbers.
Later-model Pythons such as those manufactured in the 1980s feature either the Bright Polish or Ultimate Polish finish.
Mass production of the Python line ended with the 2003-2004 year. The company completely ended production with a 50th year commemorative gun in 2005."
