I know the ones that this hits close to home with will flag it but thats ok i will post it again. Are we really going to take advantage of our own to try to make a buck? Really who have we become when we buy a 750 AR and try to sell it at 2000? we a suppose to be sportsman not scavengers and we are suppose to look out for are own but clearly this is not the case and buy doing so you can not even go into a store and buy one for its normal price any more they even started to inflate the prices thanks to everyones greed. There is no weapon ban and there will not be one. Okay i get if there was a ban then you go into ban prices but 1200 dollars more than what it sells for is fucking nuts. I wish i had a AR to sell to everyone for what they were 3 months ago because i would gladly do so and i am sorry for the ones that can not buy one now because of the crazy ass prices people want to charge and for those people charging those prices i hope they lose there asses on the ones they purchased and those are the people that should be banned from owning a firearm..it is people like you who give Americans a bad reputation. Please lets stop the madness and start acting like true sportsman once again.

I know the ones that this hits close to home with will flag it but thats ok i will post it again. Are we really going to take advantage of our own to try to make a buck? Really who have we become when we buy a 750 AR and try to sell it at 2000? we a suppose to be sportsman not scavengers and we are suppose to look out for are own but clearly this is not the case and buy doing so you can not even go into a store and buy one for its normal price any more they even started to inflate the prices thanks to everyones greed. There is no weapon ban and there will not be one. Okay i get if there was a ban then you go into ban prices but 1200 dollars more than what it sells for is fucking nuts. I wish i had a AR to sell to everyone for what they were 3 months ago because i would gladly do so and i am sorry for the ones that can not buy one now because of the crazy ass prices people want to charge and for those people charging those prices i hope they lose there asses on the ones they purchased and those are the people that should be banned from owning a firearm..it is people like you who give Americans a bad reputation.

F.A. MFG. Co. Single Action Army Artillery Model revolver 45 Colt, 5 1/2"" artillery length barrel with a mostly bright, very good plus bore which shows strong rifling and some sparse minor pitting. This is a rather nice revolver. The barrel retains perhaps 30% original blue in the protected areas, the balance faded to a pleasing smooth brown patina with the areas around the front sight still showing original feathering from the factory polish. The outer edge of the ejector housing is primarily a pewter and brown patina with the protected flutes showing nearly all their original blue. The frame is primarily a pleasing smoky mottled faded case-hardened patina retaining perhaps 30% original colors, most vivid in the pinched area at the front of the frame and beneath the recoil shields, the trigger guard and grip frame are primarily a pewter and softer brown patina with some minor sparse pinprick pitting. The hammer retains only traces of original colors and is mostly a deep mottled gray patina. The cylinder has flaked primarily to a pewter and brown with generous traces of original blue in the flutes. The one-piece walnut grip rates about very good showing perhaps an old light cleaning and with chips at the front and rear edges of the right side panel. Originally configured as a cavalry model delivered to the US Government Inspector at the Colt factory on Dec 14, 1885 and what is today commonly known as a “Late Military Model”. The frame is David F. Clark inspected from the 1884 contract and shows a very good ""US"" on the left side of the frame. The gun was returned to the Colt factory for refurbishing and returned to the Springfield Armory on August 3, 1903. A light cartouche of Rinaldo A. Carr and 1903 date can be seen faintly on the right panel, there is none on the left as-is correct for a 1903 inspected gun. Consistent with the Colt refurbished cavalry single action revolvers, it has a mix of serial numbered components. The trigger guard is numbered 116486, the back strap is 116488; the cylinder is unnumbered and is ""RAC"" marked on its rear edge showing replacement during the 1903 refurbish. The barrel shows small ""P"" and ""A"" inspectors markings and is numbered 2232 beneath the ejector rod housing; it retains its original barrel roll-marking. The gun times well and locks up mechanically. Includes Colt factory letter authenticating its original manufacture and return to the factory for conversion to the artillery model. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE: This is an excellent example of a nice old veteran of the late Apache Wars (1880-1889) that was hastily made ready for the Moro Rebellion (1899-1913) in the Philippines when the Army realized the ineffectiveness of the .38 caliber Model 1892.."

If derringer is real I can deal with some rust and or wear on blueing.


Also bought at gunshow, romanian 1969 m69 .22 clip fed rifle.
I need a parts gun or parts. the part is the hammer inside the bolt that acts as the sear as well.
the guy at gunshow new it was broke but oh well live and learn.
Just having some bad luck right now, thought maybe one of you guys out here might have what i'm looking for.
I will concider only american derringer corp derringers. I got hit hard on the one I bought $$$ its junk now with no replacment parts, same with romanian 22.
the derringer like i said would rather have blue as it will be displayed next to my grandpas colt .45 in curio. Will concider stainless or nickle or whatever else they come in.
In addition I am not knocking gunshows at all its just sometimes best to bring someone along that knows the internal workings of firearms.
THANKS GUYS.
P.S. Disregard the $30,00 in box not sure why its staying but I cannot modify that .

The rifle comes with a scope from the company, and the receiver is milled from the factory with a scope mount. The rifle comes from the factory to hold 15 rounds, but it will hold 17. This is the most beautiful rifle you will buy in the .22 rifle family. Check out the wood grain in the stock. It will shoot just as fast as the AR-22 and works 75% more efficiently. No cheap molded plastic here! This is a Cadillac.

lowballer disclaimer-- some people have an attitude that ""it doesn't hurt to ask"" regardless of how ridiculous an offer is. Fair enough, I guess, but if you're dealing with me, it does hurt. It hurts your reputation as a buyer and it hurts your ability to get a deal with me in the future. I'm not desperate and I will not fool with someone who has no concept of what current market prices are. 
P.S. I love it when this disclaimer ticks people off and I get ehatemail- The only type of person this disclaimer would infuriate is.... you guessed it... Lowballers...

Thanks for taking the time to click this ad. Im wondering, why does it appear that people are shying away from the SW 40 caliber rounds? I see alot of people gettting rid of theres and into other calibers and it seems like its the only round available in pistols in local guinshops. Like for example, I can find a new HK at a gunshop in 40 but when a 45 comes in its gone before you can blink. Thoughts?

I personally dont like them because I feel like the ""snappy ness and muzzel flip increase"" from a 9mm isnt worth the small extra size, and if it was Id go 45 or 10 MM. Does anyone else share this feeling? I am not a 40 cal virgin, I had a XD40 so I am familiar with the way they feel.  Thanks you for your thought guys."

Springfield Armory's Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used.

These bills have were rammed through their respective committees over the past few days in a veritable blitzkrieg to get them passed before gun owners could respond. All four will soon be heard by the senate.

 I urge you to contact your state senator as soon as possible and ask them to vote “no” on all of these bills. If you’re not sure who your local legislators are, you can find them here: http://votesmart.org/. You can also find your legislators’ contact information at http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLI...y?openFrameset for the House and http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLI...n?openframeset for the Senate. In addition to succinctly voicing your opinions on the bills, it may be helpful to remind your legislators that you will be keeping their actions in mind during the 2014 election.

 I would also encourage you to attend town hall meetings over the weekend. Such meetings are public forums where you can voice your opinions about issues affecting Colorado and your local community. We are trying to concentrate on the Senate townhalls, since the bills will be heard by the senate soon, but it would be great if you could let House members know how you feel. Also, if any of you are able to bring a video camera, we’d love to capture the meetings on film.

 Please call your local city council or Republican Party or do a Google search to find town hall meetings going on in your area. I’ve provided the times and locations of a few local meetings that will be going on soon:

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel
 (Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating.

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.


While supply lasts, Supply of these models are limited

For Sale: Raven MP-25, 25 caliber handgun.  Holds 6+1 rounds. Nickel plated, walnut grips; Weighs only 15 oz. overall length 4.5"", 3"" high, 7/8"" wide.  Made in the USA; full metal frame and slide. This little gem has been sitting in my safe for so long, I forgot I had it.  I still have 13 rounds left of the original box of 50 I purchased with the gun.  This gun has a round count of only 37 rounds!  I also have a small leather holster, which is included. This is an excellent choice for concealed carry in pocket, purse, also a great back-up-gun.
