They are both in near condition, with nothing wrong at all.
If you aren’t familiar with the Storm platform, they are both excellent Beretta products. The Italians wanted a robust carbine that could share ammo/magazines with a pistol, with both weapons being friendly to left and right handed shooters. So Beretta started developing a carbine/pistol to meet those requirements, and they did a spectacular job at it!
So here’s what you will be getting. Both a pistol and rifle chambered in 9MM, with (5) 17 round magazines, they are both very reliable, accurate, and absolutely bulletproof.
About the PX4 Storm Pistol - It’s a full size 9MM pistol, with a proven rotating barrel design that is extremely accurate. It has a safety/decocker mounted on the slide (like a Beretta 92) and has a reversible magazine release for fully ambidextrous manipulation. It’s in near mint condition, with just the common usage wear marks. The bore is bright and shiny, and is in perfect mechanical working condition.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_Px4_Storm
About the CX4 Storm Carbine - It’s also chambered in 9MM, and comes with a full rail on top for optics, and 3 forward rails, for lights/foregrips. It has a very good EOTech clone on it that works well, holds a zero, is non-parallax. The charging handle, and ejection port, and mag release  are reversible for fully ambidextrous manipulation. This is a very smooth shooting, super reliable, and extremely accurate carbine capable of, 200+ yard engagement with iron sights as seen in this video.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjYYrCzmCRA
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_Cx4_Storm
You get everything you see in the pictures. That’s a PX4 9MM pistol, CX4 9MM carbine, (6) 17 round magazines etc. First one with $1800.00 cash OBO takes them. If you are looking for the ultimate pistol/carbine combination, this is it. I don’t know of any other guns by any other maker that offers this kind of flexibility, versatility, reliability, or ambidextrous manipulation to this level!

They are both in near condition, with nothing wrong at all.
If you aren’t familiar with the Storm platform, they are both excellent Beretta products. The Italians wanted a robust carbine that could share ammo/magazines with a pistol, with both weapons being friendly to left and right handed shooters. So Beretta started developing a carbine/pistol to meet those requirements, and they did a spectacular job at it!
So here’s what you will be getting. Both a pistol and rifle chambered in 9MM, with (5) 17 round magazines, they are both very reliable, accurate, and absolutely bulletproof.
About the PX4 Storm Pistol - It’s a full size 9MM pistol, with a proven rotating barrel design that is extremely accurate. It has a safety/decocker mounted on the slide (like a Beretta 92) and has a reversible magazine release for fully ambidextrous manipulation. It’s in near mint condition, with just the common usage wear marks. The bore is bright and shiny, and is in perfect mechanical working condition.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_Px4_Storm
About the CX4 Storm Carbine - It’s also chambered in 9MM, and comes with a full rail on top for optics, and 3 forward rails, for lights/foregrips. It has a very good EOTech clone on it that works well, holds a zero, is non-parallax. The charging handle, and ejection port, and mag release  are reversible for fully ambidextrous manipulation. This is a very smooth shooting, super reliable, and extremely accurate carbine capable of, 200+ yard engagement with iron sights as seen in this video.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjYYrCzmCRA
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beretta_Cx4_Storm
You get everything you see in the pictures. That’s a PX4 9MM pistol, CX4 9MM carbine, (6) 17 round magazines etc. First one with $1800.00 cash OBO takes them. If you are looking for the ultimate pistol/carbine combination, this is it. I don’t know of any other guns by any other maker that offers this kind of flexibility, versatility, reliability, or ambidextrous manipulation to this level!

I have a four Chinese Type 53 bolt action rifles left.  These are licensed Chinese productions of the Mosin Nagant M44 Carbine with semi-permanently side folding bayonet.  They fire the 7.62x54R cartridge which can be found on the cheap.  These are not the abnormally length 48inch long Mosin Nagant M91/30, instead, they are the nice perfect 40 inch total carbine length.  That makes them much easier to maneuver and get to the range and back.  These have been poorly maintained and will show dings and chips in the stocks, blemishes in the metal and will be generally dirty.  I have checked all rifles and guarantee they will all fire and the firing pins have been adjusted to be in the safe zone.  Some steel wool, wood skills and a good clean could end up making these things look amazing.  Or keep it around as a rugged war trophy.



These do not come with cleaning rods as most T53's do not.  They do, however, have the attached bayonets.

These rifles are listed in NRA fair to good condition.  Some are pretty rough and some look pretty decent.

Pictures are accurate to the look of the rifle you will receive, but not the actual rifle.

Price is firm.  Shipping to West coast is $25 flat fee, shipping anywhere else is $20.

I can ship directly to you if you are a Georgia resident and the shipping address is in the state of Georgia.

The conversion was only used three times and has close to 300 rounds through it.  It runs great with two of the mags and one mag is somewhat finicky.  It’s a great trainer for your Glock and you can shoot more at a fraction of the price using 22LR ammo.  The only difference when shooting the conversion vs your original Glock is the weight and the recoil.  Advantage Arms only recommends certain type of ammo and I have only used Mini Mag 40g solids, which have worked fine.  This conversion kit will only fit gen 4 Glocks including G19gen4, G23gen4, G25gen4, and G32gen4.  I am asking $300 OBO (asking 250 for kit and 50 for both extra mags) and would prefer not to ship it, however if you pay the fees involved I will consider it.

The barrels are extremely nice and made by FN USA, the chrome lining will keep the barrel in top shape longer than you can afford to shoot it. The upper is built completely to mil-spec and features M4 feed ramps for more reliable feeding. And the bolt carrier groups are of the M16 variety, the gun is only semi-automatic but the bolts are built to be used in automatic weapons and will hold up much better than most which are only built to meet the .223 ar-15 semi-auto specs, they are also coated in nickel boron which reduces friction, requires less lubrication, lasts longer, and is incredibly easier to clean. These are not home brewn parts guns, they are barreled upper assemblies that have been factory assembled and headspaced, with a bolt carrier group installed, and pinned to a complete factory built lower, buy with confidence. PMAG in picture not included

The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. 
Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster. I will also include a high power aluminum LED flashlight, the laser sight to make for the perfect defensive pistol setup.

I installed a new Magpul handguard and a Hogue pistol grip. It comes with a nice hard case. I will include 2-30 round Magpul mags. The rifle pictures don't show the Magpul handguard but it is on the rifle, thanks. I'm asking $1250.00 for this sweet brand new unfired AR-15 M4 Carbine Semi Automatic Rifle.

Stock # MSH251416SP. Serial # 608xx. One of over a thousand Antique and Modern Collectible firearms, including Military, Sporting, Custom and Tactical guns, as well as Edged Weapons and Militaria we have for sale at Jackson Armory (see our other listings),This is a VERY RARE Smith & Wesson Pre-War Non-Registered .357 Magnum Revolver. Per “Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson” (Page 134-135) by Supica and Nahas, the definitive modern book on S&W history, the Prewar Non-Registered Magnums are even more rare than the Registered Magnums. Here is what they have to say: “These are even more rare than the Registered Magnum Models, with only about 1400 produced between 1935-1941. In general, they were more likely to be heavily used than the Registereds.” They go on to say that non-standard barrel lengths command substantial premiums. This gun has a non-standard, 4” barrel (see the aforementioned book for the standard barrel lengths). It has been re-finished in nickel, and it has a magnificent set of ivory grips, the left grip is a hand-cut steer-head grip. Per the serial number, this gun was produced in 1940. Although the “SMITH & WESSON” marking on the left side of the barrel is somewhat obscured by the re-finish, all other markings and the S&W logo on the receiver are crisp and legible. The grips have aged and yellowed a bit, but they have no cracks and they look great (that are also worth several hundred dollars in their own right!). The finish has many service marks, and overall condition is about 85-90%. The revolver has a shiny bore with fairly strong rifling, and double-action trigger pull is smooth. These guns were used by Lawmen, and used heavily, as per the book. Famous Handgunners like Bill Jordan and Skeeter Skelton loved these guns and wrote a lot about them. We can say with almost certainty that if you obtain a Smith & Wesson Factory Letter, it will add value to this already RARE pistol – especially if it was delivered to a Police Agency, or even to Wolf & Klar in Ft Worth (that would account for the ivory grips!). This Prewar Non-Registered .357 Magnum is a real find for the Advanced Smith & Wesson Collector!

Up for sale is my 1982 (JC date code) Sig P220 in 9mm. Triple serial'ed. This one is rather unique in that it has no import marks and is not marked ""made in Germany"" - it only has ""SWISS"" on the slide. Given the date and slide markings, I'd consider this more collectible than your average Sig. This gun is incredibly clean for a 31-year-old firearm. Very comfortable to shoot as well. Includes one magazine.

My ONLY trade considerations would be a 1982 (JC marked) Sig P225 or a Sig P6 with 5/82 date code. Not interested in anything else unless it is a crazy good deal in my favor.

This is considered by Sig enthusiasts as the ""Holy Grail"" of Sig collectables. Pistol comes in original plastic box along with owner's manual and two German factory ten round magazines. Also included is one after-market 13 round nickel magazine.

This gun is in excellent condition and has only had a few hundred rounds fired through it. Overall condition is excellent, both mechanically and finish wise.

Not only is this a rarity, but it has been sent to Sig to have the following installed;

Short Trigger - This trigger sits farther back in the trigger guard and reduces the trigger pull length. Trigger is thinner than the stock trigger to reduce the distance from the face of the trigger to the rear of the firearm. It is the same length top to bottom (vertically) and the same width as a stock trigger. The short trigger is also an advantage for those with smaller hands or who often wear gloves when shooting.

Short Reset Trigger (SRT) Kit - Short Reset Trigger kit dramatically reduces the length of travel needed for the trigger to reset in your Sig pistol.

E2 Enhanced Ergonomic grip – Sig’s latest grip technology that incorporates a reduced circumference, one-piece modular grip with improved texture. This grip comes on their newest P226’s.  It's hard to see in the pics, but ""Sig Sauer"" is on the grip.

All original parts are included as well.

This is truly “one-of-a-kind”. Don't miss out on this opportunity to buy such a quality Sig piece to add to your collection.

Trijicon TA31RCO Rifle Scope  is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for  the M16A4 weapon system (20"" barrel).  Trijicon TA31RCO-A4 ACOG 4x32 USMC Rifle Combat Optic for the A4 w/ TA51 Mount provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.  Trijicon TA31RCO-A4CP ACOG 4x32 Scope with BAC USMC Rifle Combat Optic (RCO) for A4  incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.  Trijicon TA31RCO A4CP 4 x 32mm ACOG Advanced Combat Optical Gunsights  hit fast in any light.  Trijicon ACOG 4 x 32 Riflescopes  are internally-adjustable, compact telescopic sights with tritium illuminated reticle patterns for use in low light or at night.  Trijicon 4x32 ACOGs  combine traditional, precise distance marksmanship with close-in aiming speed.

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 20"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer.

It sports rifle contour and length handguards with full heat shields, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of HBar contour (.750 under the front sight base) The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9"" twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullet weights."

This gun has had around 200-250 rounds fired through it and it's in perfect condition. This has some custom accessories also. I have added a Volquartsen trigger kit, Dawson Precision fiber optic front sight.

I also have the factory trigger parts and front sight. This is a very accurate gun especially with the 2.5lb trigger. I have not had a single FTF or FTE when firing it. I have cleaned it twice even with the low number of rounds I've put through it. The buyer must be someone local that can prove they can legally own a firearm."

A native of Jamaica, Arthur led a romantic life, having been schooled in England and the United States. In his thirties, he explored the interior of Australia and was held captive for a year by Aborigines. Later, he became the owner of the largest cattle ranch in Australia.

After moving to Utica, New York, he developed the Savage Halpine torpedo, became the Superintendent of the Utica Belt Line Railroad, and invented the first ""hammerless"" lever action rifle with the entire mechanism enclosed in a steel receiver. This remarkable rifle featured a rotary magazine with a unique counter that visually displayed the number of bullets remaining in the receiver. The Model 99, as it became known, advanced firearm technology, offered the average person an affordable rifle, and started a business that has stood the test of time. In 1919, Chief Lame Deer (above) approached Arthur to purchase lever-action rifles for the Indian reservation and the two men struck a deal. The tribe would get discounted rifles and Savage would get their support and endorsement. It was at this time in the company's history, that Arthur Savage added the Indian head logo--a direct gift from the Chief--to the company name. By 1919, Savage Arms was manufacturing high power rifles, 22 caliber rifles, pistols and ammunition."

Whatever. I just won't play that game. That being said, I am not going to just give away my weapons either. Now that I have that out of my system, on to business!

I have a Romanian Draco AK style pistol.  Here is what's included:

What else can I say? It runs good. I bought it new a few years ago and only ever put a few mags through it.  Now with ammo prices being what they are, I prefer to practice with other weapons. I am open to any offer.  I won't get mad at anyone even if I think their offer is crazy.  Mostly, I am would prefer to trade for something else. Let me know what you have."
