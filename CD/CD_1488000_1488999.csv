This one is in two tone with a black frame and stainless slide. This gun is very clean and scratch, wear, rust free. Fit and finish are excellent. I am the 2nd owner so I am not sure what the round count is but the first owner maintained it very well and I have not shot it. Comes with 3 mags. DA/SA with slide mounted decocker/safety. Anyone who is familiar with 3rd gen S&W semi autos knows how well they shoot and the quality that went into making them. Here is your chance to own a rare example of that generation of pistols.

It accepts all Glock Model 22 magazines, and comes with one 10-round G22 mag. This gun is idea when you need the firepower of a long gun but need something light weight and very compact. It can be carried/concealed in just about anything and deployed instantly. Using readily available Glock 22 mags, this carbine makes for an ideal self-defense gun that can be taken just about anywhere with ease.

The SUB-2000 has a greatly extended range compared to a handgun.  The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range.  The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun.  This is an excellent choice for a vehicle gun, backpack gun, or anytime you might need something more than a handgun but do not have a lot of room and need something light and compact.

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle.  The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear.  By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB 2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key.  The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation.  The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled without tools for cleaning or inspection.

Designed to be the favored back up or last resort option for both civilian and law enforcement use, this subcompact slimline design is the perfectly balanced answer to your everyday concealed carry needs. It is ultra-concealable, accurate and comfortable for all shooters regardless of hand size.When it comes to size and comfort, the all new G43 provides the best of both worlds. Typically, with handguns of this dimension, the design of the pistol does a poor job of resolving issues concerning felt recoil. This can cause discomfort for shooters who are not familiar with shooting smaller framed pistols. Seasoned shooters are familiar with this and adjust their grip, but have to work harder to keep the pistol on target for follow-up shots. The design of the new G43 allow for a more comfortable and confident shooting experience for all types of users.UPC_Code: REDACTED33Description: GLK 43 9MM PST 6RD FSManufacturer: GlockModel #: 43Type: Pistol: Semi-AutoFinish: Black MatteStock: Black PolymerSights: FT: White Dot RR: White OutlineBarrel: 3.39Overall Length: 6.26Weight: 16.19 ozCaliber: 9mmCapacity: 6+1Action: Safe Action# of Mags: 2Packaging: Black Plastic CaseReceiver: Black PolymerFeatures: Width 1.02MSRP: $580.00Cash Price, Card add 4% DEALER TRANSACTION, NICS check and AL sales tax applies. $25 shipping to your FFL.

I believe this falls in the ""Chief's"" line of Smith and Wesson wheelies but I'm not sure. This gun is in excellent shape and shoots great. The wheel turns great and is very snappy. Guns is used and shows so me slight holster wear but not easy to find. The Hogue grips will come with the gun. I do have the original wooden grips but those will be extra if you want them. Just for show unless you want to buy them

You will like this little snubbie. I love these revolvers. Get a Smith for the price or a little more than a Taurus and have a gun you can trust your life with. Easy to train your wife, girl friend or daughter to use for protection. No jam worries here. Get her shooting right a the range and 5 shots is all she'll need to protect herself. Of, you can use it as an inside the pant, pocket or ankle gun. Works either way. 

I would like to trade this for a .357 2"" Smith if you have one you want to work a deal for. Of course both sets of grips would be included in a deal for the .357 S&W.

Will also trade for a fair amount of .38 special ammo.

Not ""brand new with only 100 rounds through it"" but totally new. I've never even loaded it! This is a quality factory-built Bushmaster, and not a cheaper DPMS product, or a plastic Carbon 15, or someone's garage build, and a complete ready-to-use package for less than some are selling their used, base model rifle.

Gun comes with:
-Factory box (if you want it)
-2 metal 30-round Bushmaster magazines (comes with 1 in store)
-Empty chamber indicator flag
-Lock and key
-Sling
-2 rail risers in case you want to use a big scope
-Warranty
-Owner's manual
-and whatever extra paperwork/coupons/etc are included normally

It is factory built with the receiver-length picatinny rail, 6-position adjustable stock, A2 flash suppressor on a threaded barrel, bayonet lug, and sling swivels. And unlike most modern AR's, the calibers are stamped on the mag well so you know it accepts BOTH .223 AND 5.56 ammunition, whatever you can find to use - no guessing that the NATO rounds MIGHT go boom without your gun going BOOM!

Also included is:
-A brand new (in the unopened box) BSA 42 mm red-dot scope sight with built-on sun shade (can include UTG red dot if you prefer)
-60 rounds of new brass PMC X-tac 5.56 55 gr FMJ (perfect military round for this barrel)
-A brand new Tapco Intrafuse AR spanner wrench with a mil-spec castle wrench, receiver extension removal wrench, and A1/A2 flash suppressor wrench. It is manganese phosphate coated for durability, and has a lifetime warranty
-A brand new weather-resistant ammo box large enough for all the extras to fit in
-A brand new Midway USA padded tactical range bag with 4 velcro pockets to hold 30 round magazines, a middle velcro pocket, and a long zipper pocket.  It has handles and an adjustable strap on the back to carry by hand or over your shoulder.

With this complete AR 15 package you have everything you need, and can get it sighted in on the range and have some fun banging away without having to wait a couple months to find some clean ammo, or pay $1 a round.

The base model MSRP on the rifle is $1,391.48, and with this deal you avoid taxes, fees, and snoopy government agents.  I saw these at the last gun show going for around $1600 without any extras, so I'm listing it at $1500 (with ammo, red dot, wrench, bag, and ammo box included).  Face-to-face cash sale, prefer you have a CCW but not required.

I have a brand new rail-mountable tactical laser/light combo with pressure switches I can throw in for an extra $40 (normally $50 plus tax).

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.  However, do not ask if this is still available.  If the ad is up, the gun is still for sale.  Do not e-mail me telling me you saw this at Cabella's for $850 two days ago – you're lying and we both know it.  I'll just laugh at you, and probably put your idiocy and name on display in my next gun article for the world to laugh at you.  Ditto if you e-mail me with any other complaints or gripes without actually displaying any interest in the rifle."

This holster uses belt loops at the front and rear to pull your handgun tight against your body for better concealment. The angle this holster positions your handgun allows faster drawing with full combat grip, more comfortable wearing, and much safer use.
A regular Small of the Back (SOB) holster places your gun over the base of the spine. A fall or hard blow with your gun in that position could cause serious spinal cord injury. Our holster is engineered for kidney carry to avoid that danger.
Made of waterproof foam for a comfortable carry and to protect gun from moisture. Lined on both sides with rugged Cordura® nylon for durability and a smooth, fast draw. Webbing inside the holster protects your gun’s sights and keeps holster partially open for easier reholstering. Great for use while driving. Comes with an adjustable thumb break to keep gun secure. Fits belts up to 1½” wide. Available for right or left hand draw. Black. Made in the USA."

Description:
Introducing the XD-S. Superior innovation in the palm of your hand. This slim, powerful addition to the XD line delivers all the performance of a .45 expertly engineered to fit in any size hand. At only 1 wide, the XD-S fits as perfectly into your concealed-carry strategy as it does in the palm of your hand. And with it, you get the power of a .45 with superior control and comfort without sacrificing important safety features. The unique combination of an ultra-slim profile paired with enhanced performance point-and-shoot features allows you to shoot accurately without having to adjust your wrist giving you greater control. Prepare to be impressed with the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on your target. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, loaded chamber indicator and grip safety. In addition, the XD-S offers a top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and usability. The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

1,000 Watt Maximum AC Output/900 Watt Rated AC Output
Noise Block Acoustically designed sound reduction system
Long Run Time - Runs continuously for up to 12 hours without refueling
Smart Throttle Load sensing throttle control
CARB Compliant


Powerful, portable, and efficient, the Yamaha EF1000iS Gas-Powered Portable Inverter delivers maximum electrical output without sacrificing portability. Thanks to its innovative inverter system, the generator is able to generate up to 1,000 watts of clean AC power. It can run up to 12 hours continuously without refueling and uses premium technologies to maximize fuel efficiency

The EF1000iS is built around an innovative inverter system, which is able to deliver higher-quality, cleaner electricity than competing generators. It produces energy in the form of pure sine waves, which are cleaner and more reliable than most commercial power sources.

In simpler terms, this means that you'll be able to confidently power delicate machinery without having to worry about the damage caused by unrefined energy.

Smart Technologies for Optimal Fuel Efficiency
The EF1000iS is exceptionally fuel efficient, able to run for up to 12 hours without refueling when in Economy mode. With its Smart Throttle Load feature, the generator is able to dynamically adjust engine speed depending on output, resulting in greater overall fuel efficiency. The generator also features an exclusive dual coil alternator stator, which lowers engine speed and reduces total fuel consumption.

Ergonomic, User-Friendly Design
At only 27.6 pounds, this generator is also ultra-portable and features an easy-to-carry design. It has a convenient, centralized control panel, which allows you to easily access all of the generator's features at the push of a button. For added convenience, the EF1000iS is even able to recharge 12-volt batteries with its 12-volt DC output, making it ideal for RV, auto, and boat owners.

Noise Reduction for Quiet Operation
The EF1000iS uses noise reduction technologies to ensure the quietest operation possible. Featuring a special sound-blocking design, the generator has a noise-absorbing glass wool construction, which helps dampen noise even during heavy operation. Along with the EF1000iS' super-quiet muffler."

If it is found that a person has any full auto parts and a receiver or rifle they are in violation and the penalty is 10 years and or $10,000 fine for each part, that puts your count at 9 federal felonies unless your rifle is a title 2 class 3 registered full auto weapon.

I have over 1000 rounds of various boxed, factory 9mm ammo that I am interested in trading for factory loaded .223/5.56 ammo. Brass cased, non-penetrator preferred, but will trade for some green tipped as well. Loose or boxed is fine, but NO reloads, NO steel cased, and recent production preferred. 

So to make it easier, I figure that when it's in stock, Walmart has 9mm for about $15/box of 50, and XM183 for about $8/box of 20. So, per round, that's .30/round for 9mm, and .40/round for XM183. If that sounds fair to you, we can use that to determine trade amounts.

Known officially as: M3, sniperscope, infrared, set no. 1, 20,000 volts. Made by american optical co. Buffalo, NY 6-23-51. Made to be mounted on a special M1 carbine known as the M2 carbine making the whole setup a M3. 

Very good condition. Really nice for how old it is. How does it compare to others? I don't know. I've never seen one that wasn't in a book or on the internet. This is the only one I have ever seen. Very rare, very cool piece of American Military History.

What is there and what isn't. This comes with the IR scope, IR Light, Foregrip/ Handle with the trigger, power transformer box, all necessary original wiring, 1 tube, original rubberized backpack(nice), and original chest. As far as what is missing? I'm really no expert but I think there was a tool set and more tubes. These are not there. And of course no .30 carbine. No rust anywhere and looks to be the original finish. Some scratches on the scope but not bad. A little corrosion on a small copper piece behind the light source. And it looks like the red filter is a little rough. The outside plastic of the light source is fine, its the red filter inside. I have not taken this apart or tried to clean any of it. 

Because this is so rare I did not want auction it, I wanted a lot of people to have a shot at owning it. Same with gun broker. I found it in Mn I would like a collector in MN to give it a good home. So I figured the only fair way to do it would be to take offers. So, if you want it, take a shot at it and email me your best offer. If you know what it is, you know what its worth, and how often you can find one.

As far as trades go... I might, might, take one of the following as partial trade with cash. 1. Ruger .44 carbine semi-auto. Prefer older tube fed. 2. Ruger No. 1 in 270 win, 280 rem, 30.06 or 303 brit. 3. HK usp Tactical all black. Of course these guns must be nice.

Of course all cash is always nice. FTF meet. Leave your name and number or I will not get back to you.

Thanks for looking."

Just bought a Remington R1, and decided I need a hunting rifle instead. The Model 1911 semiautomatic pistol is one of the most popular handgun designs ever made. More than a century after its introduction, it remains the firearm of choice for many law-enforcement and military personnel, competition shooters and gun owners wanting a reliable firearm for personal protection. Remington’s take on this legendary pistol is packed with standard features you’d expect on a custom-made 1911 costing far more. Every element is crafted with utmost precision and to exacting tolerances, including the machined blued steel slide and frame. Remington’s 1911 is an outstanding value and exceptional shooter. Custom carry case included. Made in USA.

Known officially as: M3, sniperscope, infrared, set no. 1, 20,000 volts. Made by american optical co. Buffalo, NY 6-23-51. Made to be mounted on a special M1 carbine known as the M2 carbine making the whole setup a M3. 

Very good condition. Really nice for how old it is. How does it compare to others? I don't know. I've never seen one that wasn't in a book or on the internet. This is the only one I have ever seen. Very rare, very cool piece of American Military History.

What is there and what isn't. This comes with the IR scope, IR Light, Foregrip/ Handle with the trigger, power transformer box, all necessary original wiring, 1 tube, original rubberized backpack(nice), and original chest. As far as what is missing? I'm really no expert but I think there was a tool set and more tubes. These are not there. And of course no .30 carbine. No rust anywhere and looks to be the original finish. Some scratches on the scope but not bad. A little corrosion on a small copper piece behind the light source. And it looks like the red filter is a little rough. The outside plastic of the light source is fine, its the red filter inside. I have not taken this apart or tried to clean any of it. 

Because this is so rare I did not want auction it, I wanted a lot of people to have a shot at owning it. Same with gun broker. I found it in Mn I would like a collector in MN to give it a good home. So I figured the only fair way to do it would be to take offers. So, if you want it, take a shot at it and email me your best offer. If you know what it is, you know what its worth, and how often you can find one.

As far as trades go... I might, might, take one of the following as partial trade with cash. 1. Ruger .44 carbine semi-auto. Prefer older tube fed. 2. Ruger No. 1 in 270 win, 280 rem, 30.06 or 303 brit. 3. HK usp Tactical all black. Of course these guns must be nice.

Of course all cash is always nice. FTF meet. Leave your name and number or I will not get back to you.

The fixed 10 round magazine can easily be converted to removable high capacity magazines if you would like. The $450 asking price includes 100 rounds of 122 grain hollow point 7.62x39 ammo to get you started. (a $40 value) Gun is in Rapid City area but can be delivered to Sioux Falls area as I will be headed that way May 3rd.
