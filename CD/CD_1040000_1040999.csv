Made in factory 31, this is the real deal. The Feds banned the importation of these cartridges years ago and it's illegal for dealers to sell them. But you can still buy from private parties, such as myself. I believe that it comes on 10 round stripper clips but having not opened the tin I can't vouch for that.

I prefer to sell the whole tin unopened but might be willing to open it and sell smaller quantities, so if you're interested in that let me know. I'd still be looking for a dollar a round but if you don't need 550 of them then this might be a good solution. I live at 101 and Shea and probably don't want to drive too far for less than the whole tin but if you can meet near me then hopefully we can work something out. I'm asking $1 round.

So if you have something like that laying around, let me know.  Before you do though, keep in mind that I'm not looking to pay your mortgage or your child's college tuition.   MSRP is fine for a NEW firearm; if its used and you want more than 80% of its original cost it should be in extremely good condition or come with extras.

(I'll take an older fading and scratched Wingmaster over a new Express any day, ask around why, I've left the bluing as it is rather than strip the blue and redo it since factory bluing is irreplaceable in quality and durability, whether you DIY or professional)
