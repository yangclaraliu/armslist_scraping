Stick it in your waistband, and your pants will fall down. Great for truck and/or home defense. Shoots the one shot disabling .45acp round. Extremely clean for an older gun. My understanding is that Hipoint will honor its lifetime warranty on this gun. While I don't think they will fix it, if there is a problem, they have been replacing damaged Haskell pistols with new Hi-points. If this is an issue with you, check with Hi-point as to whether they will honor their lifetime warranty on Haskel pistols. This says alot for the company. Go ahead and see if Keltec will honor its warranty on a broken Grendel pistol (predecessor to Keltec). Good luck with that. Appears to be in good working order and passes the function test with flying colors. Believe this has a 8 round magazine. If you are building a cabin in the woods, it would be great to have nearby in case Mrs. Grizzly paid a visit. Can probably also double as a heavy hammer to drive those big pegs into the logs (kidding). Way UGLY design, but also WAY overbuilt, and that is a good thing. Would be great for a Hi-Point collector."

I do not know much about it and have fired it very little, but I will try to answer any questions as best I can. I am thinning my collection, so no trades. If the ad is still up, it is still available. I don't typical respond to emails asking for trades, what my ""bottom dollar"" is, or if it is still available. I will not break any laws by selling to a non-Missouri resident, felon, or underage buyer. I do not make it to the St. Louis area very often, so the buyer will have to plan to pick up in the Desloge / Park Hills / Farmington area. I will write up a bill of sale for myself and the buyer at time of purchase. Thank you."
