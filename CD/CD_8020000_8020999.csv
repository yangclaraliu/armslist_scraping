The PredatAR takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 1 pound from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle.Does NOT include after market add on’s such as: optics, optic rail/rings, Precision Armament flash hider, Raptor charging handle.WILL include: standard factory A2 flash hider, standard factory charging handle, Noveske single point sling attachment (after market add on), 2 sets of rail covers (FDE and Black), factory case, owners manual, copy of the constitution, and 1 factory 30 round magazine.WILL SHIP only to licensed FFL from my local FFL. Buyer pays all transfer fees and shipping costs.READ CAREFULLY!!!I’m pro 2nd amendment, but I’m also pro responsibility. Therefore individuals paying cash must provide a valid identification, preferably a valid CCW. A bill of sale/trade will be required. I am a retired LEO, so all of you pseudo jail house lawyers (aka convicts) and self proclaimed anti establishment folks that may be offended by my being a responsible gun owner should probably look elsewhere. In order to mitigate risk all transactions will take place at a public service location, such as a Police or Fire Department. For more details/specs on these firearms visit Larue’s website."

This revolver is solid stainless steel with a soft luster finish. The revolver has a dual pinned, ramped front sight with HI-VIS orange insert and an adjustable white outline notch rear sight. It features light floral scroll engraving on both sides of the barrel near the muzzle and at the breech. Colt equipped this Anaconda with a serrated trigger and a wide serrated hammer and fitted it with checkered walnut grips with gold Colt 150th Anniversary medallions. Complete with blue plastic Colt factory hardcase, blue Colt factory box, hang tag and owner’s manual. The trigger actions on the Anacondas are rated as very high-quality, and the heavy-duty solid construction and weight tends to absorb recoil, making the Anaconda relatively easy to shoot with heavy loads We believe this Anaconda to be new. It is in Excellent condition with 99% of the original stainless steel finish with slight handling marks, some light handling scratches near the Rampant Colt and a light cylinder drag line. No powder rings at chamber faces or indications of firing at barrel breech or muzzle or around firing pin. The engravings and stampings are crisp and clear. The grips are excellent with sharp checkering. The case and box are excellent. Mechanically, this revolver is excellent."

Call it 80% done from what I initially envisioned. First off, I had PRI (Precision Reflex Inc.) do some custom ""one off"" work for me. They are about 30 minutes down the road, and they do solid work. -Chopped barrel down to 16""and re-threaded to 1/2x28 to accept any AR15 muzzle device. (currently wearing a thread protector). -I planned to SBR this, so the gas system is set to continue to chop the barrel off right in front of the gas block. -Golani handguard was discarded, and a machine shop buddy machined a washer if you will, so i could put an AR15 hand guard and plate on it. -Currently wearing a hand fitted Magpul MOE mid-length FDE hand guard. -The original charging handle was machined off on the right side (because with the below listed rail/optic, you could not charge the weapon without losing skin). -Benelli M4 style rolling knob charging handle fitted onto the left side of the gun, and the dust cover cut out to accommodate. -PRI also mounted a rail section onto the dust cover, which I have a T1 clone currently mounted and zero'd (will be included). -I added a US Palm AK47 grip to this, and went through the hassle of fitting it to this. Looks clean, and as if it were designed for this gun. (also allows free function of thumb safety). -Lastly i chopped the folding stock down to 8"" about 2-3"" from factory making it a ""smaller package"" gun. The stock is currently raw. Measurements: Barrel 16"" Stock 8"" Receiver 10"" Sidefolder 1.5"" Total length 35.5."" To close this out, i have four (4), 30 or 35 (cant remember) round .223 factory magazines for this.This really needs nothing, functions 100% as is. However, I would cerakote this weapon (because I am OCD). I have had this sitting in the safe for probably 5-6 years now, and have lost interest and moved on to other toys. This was going to be a sweet little SBR, and still will be if you choose to finish the project. I really am open to trade offers, I know i will not get back out what i have in this included machine shop work and the work done at PRI, but nonetheless, my loss is your gain. Id like to recoup $1100 out of this, which is well below what is invested into it. Not firm, make offers for trades as well. I know these are rare, and no longer made.More photos upon request"

Not interested in non functional extras like alloy slide cover plates. Know everyone wants pre-bans but I'm not really interested in ones for a 21 cause I can't justify the premium for only +3, don't use 13rd mags for my 23 either. Let me know which one you have, the condition but again really only looking for like new, all that's included and the price of course. If your interested in trades feel free to check out my SIG under ""listings by this user"" but would need some cash. MA only please. All laws will be followed."

I've never checked it's headspace, but I have fired the rifle in the past.  Originally I got it for a sporter conversion, but just never really did it.  The stock is the correct type as well, and has been cleaned and finished over with some tung oil, but was never sanded - so all the scrapes and bumps and numbers are still there.  The bluing is decent.  Just a great, solid old mauser.  $300Thanks for looking!"

I put less than 300 rounds through it total, no telling how many were fired before I owned it. The barrel looks perfect as far as I can tell. I’ve included as many pics as I could to show the true condition. I don't really want to part with this gun, I love it! Only selling because it’s too large for CCW, looking to invest in a carry gun. I hope whoever buys it enjoys it as much as I do...If using PayPal to pay, PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT use any language that indicates a gun purchase, PayPal is weird about such things! Contact me for more pictures, I took a bunch. By the way, this is my first listing and I apparently didn't do it correctly as it shows not available for shipping...

I appreciate all different kinds of History because it is important to learn from it so it does not happen again. That being said please do not flag this as inappropriate because it is a part of history and I refuse to sell this to anyone who is a racist or supports the Nazi belief system. Now on to the description. This is a German swastika flag from World War II. Here is the provenance to this flag. It was taken from Buchenwald concentration camp. My buddy's grandfather was in the 8th Infantry Division which liberated the camp in 1945. This flag was auctioned in the estate of his grandfather who passed away to help pay for funeral cost. I am selling this for cheap because my wife quite frankly just wants to get it out of the house. The flag is 69x45 inches so it's rather large.
