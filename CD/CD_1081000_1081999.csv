Lighter - More Durable - More Reliable (also more expensive, but you get what you pay for)
These are arguably the best AK mags out there. If you're serious about your AK then you ought to have at least one. They are a light-weight polymer that is steel reinforced where it matters. WAY BETTER THAN THE TAPCO JUNK! There is a reason these are staying sold out everywhere. I have two available for $50 each or both for $90
**Think about the math...Steel AK mags went from being $10-15 all the way up to being $25-40 when everyone went gun crazy.  The Bulgarian Circle 10 mags were already $36-40 before the madness, and now you just can't find them.

These Bulgarian-made AK-47 magazines from Arsenal, Inc. follow the original Bulgarian military pattern, featuring a ""waffle"" textured, polymer magazine body for increased rigidity, longevity, and the utmost in reliable function. Compatible with most AK-47/AKM-pattern rifles in 7.62x39mm.

After failing to make it into the seals, this gun became an eyesore for my brother, and he asked my father to sell it. It was never fired, never loaded, never oiled, comes with the original box and paperwork including the warranty.

     Asking 1200. This gun will be sold through an FFL of my choosing, he is located at 75 and Arapaho (charges 15 bucks). Will not ship to FFL. If you can't pass a background check do not bother. All sales final. I do not have any pictures at the moment because the gun is locked up, text me and I will send them.

The more you buy, the more I will discount the price. Just tell me what you want and we will work it out from there.

I also have 20 and 40 round magazines available. The 20 rounders are Wilson all black polymer coupled magazines. I am selling them coupled (sets of 2 for a total of 40 round capacity) These are NOT anti-tilt, but they ARE awesome magazines. If you've never shot 20 rounders before, don't give up on it. These are (in my opinion) the most fun and easiest magazines to use. $45 a pair.

40 rounders are Charles Daly with the orange Anti tilt - also awesome. I'll sell those for best offer.

Subject: Gun Control and the House

I read these comments this morning: 

Rep. Max Tyler, D-Lakewood, countered that every issue is fodder in his Jefferson County swing district. ""I have to stand up and do what I think is right,"" he said. ""I'm not going to worry about what they're going to slice and dice and run against me. I have to vote for what I think is correct, what I think my district supports and what my conscience supports.""

""Limiting the number of bullets will save lives,"" countered Rep. Lois Court, D-Denver. ""It's intuitive ... more bullets, more weapons, more killing. Less bullets, less weapons, less killing.""

""We proposed reasonable gun-safety and public-safety legislation, and we've had a vigorous debate over it,"" said House Speaker Mark Ferrandino, D-Denver. ""I'm confident it will reduce the level of gun violence in communities across the state.""

These comments unfortunately are not surprising. The level of ignorance to the actual cause of violence is alarming. Rep Court, limiting bullets saves lives? Intuitive? I think not. Bullets are not the reason for the levels of violence in our state – attacking our 2nd Amendment rights (for law abiding citizens) is not going to help resolve the issue. James Holmes did use non-OEM magazines (NOT 30-round AR-magazines, he reportedly used a 75 or 100 round drum magazine). My question to you - how many more .223 caliber rifles were used in crime last year in Colorado? The answer is pretty clear. 

Rep Salazar amended the limit from 10 to -15 rounds (a step in the right direction Sir, but not quite the answer). 15-rounds vs. 17 rounds and this will save lives? 30-round magazines are standard in the .223 rifles that many sportsmen use for 3-gun and other Colorado sports. How many 30-round magazines were used in Colorado last year in violent crime? Do the research PLEASE. The answer should astound you. Rep Salazar is the only Democrat who tried to strike any balance, but I have to wonder what research lead to 15 vs. 10? I’d like a sound answer as to what data points to 30-round magazines being the reason for violent crime in our state. What data supports your views that any limit is the answer. If not 10-rounds, why not 30-rounds? You could’ve kept Magpul in our state (jobs and revenue), you can say you were able to limit violent crime (which I completely disagree with – we know this is not true), and you can tell VP Biden you did something. But you chose to attack our 2nd Amendment rights without any factual basis for your proposal. 

The murderer in CT reportedly used an AR-15 in some reports, and didn’t in others. Again – how many crimes nationally were committed with a 30-round magazine last year? Compare that extremely LOW number to how many die from drunk driving EVERY DAY (27 on average). 

You cannot base legislation on emotion – you should be using factual information. 

House Speaker Ferrandino – I disagree – this is NOT reasonable and it WILL NOT reduce the level of gun violence. Where is the factual information that this has worked in the past? We KNOW several states have similar bans on the east coast (and in California as well). Has this lowered their violent crime? The answer is no. Believe me, the Pro-Gun establishment will make great use of this information – and I applaud them. You say you are making “reasonable” gun legislation? I think the information already proves you wrong, and I believe the voters of our state will make the necessary changes. 

Rep Tyler – I believe you have made a major error in your judgment Sir – Lakewood will make a change. 

""I think it's going to produce incredible results for us in 2014,"" said Rep. Amy Stephens, R-Monument. I believe based on historical factual information, this will be a reality. You have all played into the emotion of this situation, and so far, have submitted absolutely nothing which will actually reduce violence in our state. You have directly attacked law abiding gun owners. 

I want to personally thank those of you who support our 2nd Amendment rights. You have stood your ground against this emotional ignorance. Speaking for myself and the great many people that I have spoken with about these issues – we will not forget what you have done for us. I want to THANK Senator Marble, and Representatives Humphrey, Wright, Nordberg, and Saine, Rep Priola, Representative Holbert, Senator Crowder, Senator Harvey, Representatives Waller, Sonnenberg, Landgraf, Swalm, Dore, Senator Lundberg, Senator Brophy, and others who have written me back telling me they will protect our 2nd Amendment rights. You are my heroes in this struggle, and I will be one of your MANY strong supports in the coming years. 

To those who vote to approve the 15-magazine limit, the conceal carry restriction for college students, and the background check tax, we will do our best to ensure you do not run another term in our state. You do realize that you have sent NOTHING through about mental illness? To date you have sent forth NO legislation that will actually lower the violent crime in our state. I encourage you to prove otherwise to me. In fact, you have done nothing but show your willingness to violate our rights under the 2nd Amendment. 

You will place Colorado voters at risk by limiting our ability to defend ourselves, taxing us for our right, and taking freedom from our college age students. 

To say I am disgusted is a gross understatement."

You've been reading in the news, you know the assault weapons ban has already been introduced.  Better buy now, because if it goes into effect as written this version of the venerable SIG556 will no longer be available!

I have only fired around 100 rounds through this rifle since I bought it new. This rifle features a factory collapsible folding stock, a flip-up rear sight, and I have also installed the Sig Sauer Red-Dot sight, which co-witnesses perfectly with the fixed sights. I also installed a Grip-Pod fore-grip that converts to a bi-pod with the push of a button.

Everything you see in the photos goes with the rifle, including the SIG hard case, lock, and owner’s manual.

I'm also including 2 additional 30-round steel mags from Brownell, 60 rounds of ammo, and a TAC Force case.

I got this rifle as a deer gun but i decided to stick with a slug gun instead. This rifle makes a perfect hunting or truck gun due to its stainless finish which is rust resistant.  The fit and finish on these lever guns is not completely up to par with the winchester which it is modeled after but it is still really good.  The only thing keeping this gun from looking new is a small dent on the wood handguard.  I payed well over $600 for this gun so im firm at $450 cash."

 DetailsSpecificationsDownloadsReviews The 92 series of semiautomatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed blowback system, which yields; faster cycle times, exceptional accuracy and greater reliability. Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

Manufacturer info: 

MUR at a glance: 

Construction 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved; heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. Compatibility Fits all AR-type lower receivers made to Milspec standards. Will fit all select-fire AR-15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. Will fit most of the semi-auto AR-type lower receivers (currently available). Weight MUR-1A (with assist) weighs less than 10 oz. The MUR-1S (shell deflector only) weighs less than 8 oz. Dimensions Height of rail (from the centerline of the bore): 1.215”. Color/Finish Black matte (anti-reflection/glare) Hard coat anodized (Type-III, Class 2). Bore’s surface in coated with dry film lube, over the anodized surface. Special Features Improved strength over conventional forged “flat-top” upper receivers. Stronger than any “billet” upper receiver with similar material and dimensional characteristics. Tighter manufacturing tolerances, when compared to the competition. The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly. MUR-1A (with bolt assist) showing the right side. Mounted to the MUR-1A is a CASV-S rail/handguard system. The MUR comes in two models: one with Bolt-Assist/Shell-Deflector (part# MUR-1A) and the second with Shell Deflector only (part# MUR-1S). Vltor offers the selection at the time of purchase, but does not offer a service to exchange the Bolt Assist or Shell Deflector. The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available. The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures the reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today. All MURs feature a MilStd-1913 scope mounting rail and come equipped with an Ejection-Port, Dust Cover Door."

This is the perfect gun for you. Whats great about this gun is that its by Beretta a military brand gun so you know its strong, durable, and reliable.

impervious to moisture, rust or corrosion and offer a 40% increase in strength over aluminum. The Carbon 15 material 

is the same throughout, so there is no surface finish to wear off or require maintenance.
