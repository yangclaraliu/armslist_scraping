This buffer is one of the softest shooting, smoothest and quietest buffers on the market not to mention it looks awesome. It doesn't have any weights to move around or fluids to leak out, it's 100% maintenance free!

It weighs in at 4.3oz. (Depending on the density and size of the HDTP, the weight can vary slightly.)

It's CNC machined from Solid Billet Aluminum Bar Stock.

It's Anodized Matte Black and Laser engraved with Spike's Logo.

So you're probably wondering what's inside to make this thing so great and different?

Each buffer is filled with HDTP ""High Density Tungsten Powder"" so there is No reciprocating weights inside to make a lot of noise. It also makes for a Very Smooth cycling rifle. It eliminates the chance of bolt bounce and muzzle rise in full-auto. It also cuts down on Felt Recoil. It's a HUGE upgrade from a Standard Carbine buffer! It's designed for .223/5.56 but it works in all Calibers!

After its filled with HDTP it's topped off with a mil spec bumper!"

The Geco is made in Germany and was imported into the US in fairly limited quantities in the early 2000's. Sportsman's Guide and several other retailers sold them inexpensively then. However today they are nearly impossible to find. In my opinion the Geco is the highest quality, strongest and most interesting of all of these type pistols brought to US during the last 20 years. Many feel that the HK is a better pistol however I've owned both and unlike the Geco - the only steel part on the HK is the barrel as the entire frame is plastic.

This Geco is in original UNFIRED condition. Also included in this package is:

26.5 mm to .410/.45 Long Colt adapter that allows 2.5"" & 3"" .410 shotgun ammo or .45LC ammo to be safely fired.

26.5mm to 12 gauge adapter that allows the less expensive 12 gauge flares to be fired. This adapter cannot be used with regular 12 gauge shotgun shells and must never be attempted as the results would be catastrophic.

Original German flap holster that is weather resistant and has room to store the pistol, cleaning brush, 26.5mm ammo, .410 or.45 ammo & one or both adapters. Holster also has a shoulder carry strap attached.

26.5mm cleaning brush and nylon lanyard strap for pistol

(3) 5 round boxes 2.5"" .410 rifled slug ammo. (1) 25 round box of 3"" - 00 buck with 5 pellets per shell, & (1) 25 round box 3"" #7.5 shot (devastating close range defense load).

(2) 26.5mm white parachute illumination shells, (2) 26.5 mm Red Rain shells & (2) 26.5mm orange smoke shells.

(1) sealed 4 round package of Orion 12 gauge super red flares - expire July 2016

The last Geco I saw on Gunbroker was before Christmas and it sold for over $200 without accessories similar to what the HK's do when they come up for sale. So if you investigate and price everything included in this set - you'll see that my asking price is a bargain.

Price: $350 obo. Also this is a pickup item as shipping live flare shells is a hassle and it's costly. Also because this flare pistol becomes a real firearm if the .410 adapter is inserted you must be at least 21 to purchase."

This custom shotgun is a must see. With its single-digit serial number, it is from a limited production run of only ten made. It has 20"" barrels with 3-inch chambers and is made of 18-2 polished stainless steel - and so marked. It has a gorgeous, Grade 2 wood stock set with engravings. It's slim and nimble, and an absolute pleasure to handle. Please don't confuse this one with what passes as ""coach guns"" these days. This one is up to the quality guns of the past - with some added benefits from the modern age.  German-made quality, throughout. 

The Coach gun style of shotgun will probably be one of the very last types to be included in any new, mindless anti-gun legislation. It's also one of the most effective and history-proven personal defense weapons ever designed. This particular one should last several lifetimes of serious use due to its superior craftsmanship and the material from which it is made.  

Maybe the ultimate SHTF firearm . . . ?

It will fire any .22LR and .410 up to 3inches. It can even fire the rare .22short. It was purchased at Sears in 1953 by one of my mentors upon his return from the Korean War. Shows classic signs of wear as it was his varmint gun to feed his family in the 50's and 60's. Left to me upon his passing. It is a pre-erialized era firearm which means it has no serial number. A bill of sale with photos of the patent number and proof marks will have to be made. It is in pretty good shape for it's age and has been kept clean and oiled every year and stored in its bag. Last test fired in 2012. Own this piece of American history before it's gone forever.

(2)This also has been upgraded to a newer slide with the more reliable external extractor as well as an adjustable rear sight. (The original slide is no longer available). It truly is the best of both worlds. A great piece of history with matching serial numbers and the shootability and reliability of a newer slide! What a conversation piece!

BROWNING HISTORIAN: After contacting Glen, the Browning historian it was determined this exact pistol was produced for the German Occupational Army between 1940-1944. By the serial number the best info we can determine this was made approximately in 1941. With limited records, it is difficult to determine the exact date. If this pistol could talk I bet it would have some great stories to tell!

PROOF MARKINGS: The frame is marked with the German Eagle over swastika, the WaA140 acceptance mark, the front left side of the trigger guard is marked “MP” and the right side has the serial number “133019”. The barrel is marked with an “Eagle” and “133019”. The bottom of the frame next to the magazine well is marked “L”, “8”, “r”, and what appears to be a triangle. These are difficult to see, however if they are important, please request more details and we can try to view it with a jewelers loops.

SERIAL AND DATING: Belgium Browning manufactured approximately in 1941, a very low serial number with no prefix or suffix. The “133019” serial number is the lowest serial number I have viewed on Gunbroker or anywhere else!

SIGHTS: Improved newer slide with external extractor and adjustable rear sight. Blade front sight.

GRIPS: Original walnut grips in good condition. No cracks. Checkering still present and in good condition.

FINISH: It appears to have the original 70+ year old finish. Some holster wear. Back strap and underneath show more wear.

BARREL: Approximately 4 3/4"" barrel with good bore and rifling.

ACTION: Very smooth and crisp action. This was not test fired, however we did fire it with a snap cap and the trigger feels good and sounds like the hammer hit the snap cap appropriately.

MAGAZINE: Not certain if this is the original magazine.

HISTORY: FN commissioned John Browning to design a new military sidearm conforming to this specification. Browning had previously sold the rights to his successful M1911 U.S. Army automatic pistol to Colt's Patent Firearms, and was therefore forced to design an entirely new pistol while working around the M1911 patents. Browning built two different prototypes for the project in Utah and filed the patent for this pistol in the United States on June 28, 1923 and granted on February 22, 1927.[5][6] One was a simple blowback design, while the other was operated with a locked-breech recoil system. Both prototypes utilized the new staggered magazine design (by designer Dieudonné Saive) to increase capacity without unduly increasing the pistol's grip size or magazine length. By 1931, the Hi-Power design incorporated a shortened 13-round magazine, a curved rear grip strap, and a barrel bushing that was integral to the slide assembly. By 1934, the Hi-Power design was complete and ready to be produced. It was first adopted by Belgium for military service in 1935 as the Browning P-35. Ultimately, France decided not to adopt the pistol, instead selecting the conceptually similar but lower-capacity Modèle 1935 pistol. Though many governments, the world wide and for decades have used this fantastic arm as a primary sidearm. (source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browning_Hi-Power)

Original Poly Choke (Hartford, Conn), and round knob stock & buttplate. Belgian (FN) made in 1954. All numbers I saw match, and barrel top reads: “Browning Arms Company, St. Louis, Mo.” In condition as you see it, not a show piece, but also not a bad looking gun. I disassembled, cleaned, oiled, and replaced the recoil and action springs (no problems were apparent but since the springs were probably original, and nearly 60 years old, it seemed like a good idea). Bore is bright and shiney, and I measure it at 27 1/2” from end of poly choke to where barrel meets receiver. Back stock is solid, front looks good as well with a small split that looks like it was repaired some time ago. This came to me as part of a multi-gun deal, since then I have had spinal fusion surgery and my docs have advised against any further shooting of higher recoil guns. I have not fired this, but see nothing that tells me it won’t shoot well and reliably, but it was made in 1954, so you should not expect NIB. Pictures tell the story.  This gun is C&R so I can sell it on premises to and Ohio or Indiana buyer."

 Thompson center venture 5438 .308 caliber bolt action rifle. I have put 26 rounds through this gun and realized that I'm not going to shoot it as much as I thought. It is only 3-4 months old and in pristine shape. It's a darker blueish stock with grey gripping pads. The barrel is a free floating bull barrel. Im not sure on the length, but either way the gun is immaculate. I have also added a redfeild scope thats 4x12x42 with the accu-range ability to allow you to gauge yardage. Also added a nc star bipod and have not used it yet. It comes with all just mentioned, plus a full length hard plastic case, a laser bore sight, and about 48-60 rounds of ammo. I'd like to get what I have into it, but Im prepared to negotiate a little. This Is practically a brand new gun and I really dont want to get rid of it, but just don't want to see it continue to sit in the closet. $1000 obo. I Forgot to mention that I have a bore snake for cleaning the rifle and it comes with a 3 round clip that was sent from the factory. Don't be afraid to shoot me some offers. Thanks."

A decent example of the “Made in Belgium”, FN Browning Auto-5, A5, standard (not Sweet 16), 16 ga semi-auto shotgun. Original Poly Choke (Hartford, Conn), and round knob stock & buttplate. Belgian (FN) made in 1954. All numbers I saw match, and barrel top reads: “Browning Arms Company, St. Louis, Mo.” In condition as you see it, not a show piece, but also not a bad looking gun. I disassembled, cleaned, oiled, and replaced the recoil and action springs (no problems were apparent but since the springs were probably original, and nearly 60 years old, it seemed like a good idea). Bore is bright and shiney, and I measure it at 27 1/2” from end of poly choke to where barrel meets receiver. Back stock is solid, front looks good as well with a small split that looks like it was repaired some time ago. This came to me as part of a multi-gun deal, since then I have had spinal fusion surgery and my docs have advised against any further shooting of higher recoil guns. I have not fired this, but see nothing that tells me it won’t shoot well and reliably, but it was made in 1954, so you should not expect NIB. Pictures tell the story."

Save money and stop shooting that overpriced .22lr ammo. This is a precission air rifle with match grade accuracy. Velocities match .22lr! Plus you can shoot anywhere...EVEN INDOORS!

INCLUDES
 Mounted Beeman Blue Ribbon 3x9 variable match grade scope

When RWS first introduced the Model 48, we expected it to become a classic. What was unexpected was its rapid rise to classic status among knowledgeable air gunners. At 1110fps in .177 (750 mps), this rifle propels pellets at .22 rim-fire velocities! This tremendous power is generated by the use of a very robust spring piston power plant cocked by a side lever action. The action is mounted into an extended beech stock to reduce felt recoil and to aid in achieving accuracy potential. Not designed for the faint hearted, this is one impressive air arm, both in performance and presence. It fulfills its purpose as a potent, full-size sporting airgun suitable for either pest control or field target shooting, yet it does so with both balance and grace. The substantial one-piece stock allows for comfortable offhand shooting and adds to the overall sensation that the Model 48 is a force to be reckoned with. The rifle is fitted with a finely rifled, fixed barrel system loaded via sliding breech opening. Its full accuracy potential can be realized by the use of a quality RWS airgun scope mounted to the scope rail. Other standard features include an adjustable trigger, an adjustable rear sight, and an automatic safety."

Large companies like Cabelas, Midway and such are raising prices to compete against these shade tree wanna be ammo dealers.

S&W made 10,270 of these from 1980-1985; 6486 round with butt (and 3"" barrel), and 3784 with a square butt and 4"" barrel (as pictured below).

This one is like new with the box with and cleaning kit (copy of owners manual), This is the scarce one with the square butt and the 4 inch heavy barrel there were 3784 made of these in the early to mid 80's. I am the second owner and I have not fired it and I was told by the first owner that it had a total of 6 rounds fired.

The rifle was produced in early 1915, so it has the magazine cutoff the Brits did away with later that year to make production cheaper. This firearm was purchased via magazine add in the 70s (according to previous owner), then unfortunately was sporterized, then sold to myself. Despite the lack of taste the previous owner displayed in chopping up the wood on the beautiful old war horse it has been well taken care of. The bore seems good, only visible wear is on the buttplate and is fixable with 10 minutes of scotch brite and tlc. Rifle shoots very well and is accurate in my limited experience shooting it (100 or so rounds).

Top of the line S&W .44 magnum - Performance center is S&Ws premier in house build shop, so the performance center pistols are the finest models they put out. Purchased by a buddy of mine who is a NRA instructor and shooting coach - its had maybe 30rds down the barrel. Looks brand spanking new.

Comes with all the original stuff (box, paperwork, lock etc). I'll also throw in a box of 50 high end defense rounds and another box of target shells.

Price is $1,200 firm....a simple fair number, so no haggling accepted. Picture is stock but looks exactly like the one you'll get. Ask for additional pictures and I'll email or text them.

Might accept trades, but if your trade does not have a value equal to the asking price please don't bother.

Please note this is not a beginner's pistol. Not being a jerk just trying to save you the pain of making a bad purchase. You need to have experience firing pistols and an appreciation for what this is in order to enjoy what you're buying. If you're just looking for a run of the mill .44, you can buy a nice one for a lot less than this. If you haven't heard of the performance center line from S&W, you probably don't need one.

Will meet within half an hour radius of West Knoxville.

Shoot me a text (727 417 9818) for additional pictures.
