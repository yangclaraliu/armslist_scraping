And in person you can find tiny little nicks in the anodizing here and there, but nothing big, and nothing eye catching. I tried to photograph them, but with the camera, and lighting, it's hard to tell what's a nick and what's just oil. I gave it an oil bath and went over every detail of it to verify everything is good on it.

Co. of Hollywood, California, and marketed as the Frontier ""45"".  On much of it's literature it was also referred to as the ""Little 45"".  A difficult to classify miniature, although modeled after the Colt Frontier Single Action revolver, it is not a true miniature of that gun.  The Frontier ""45"" is a six shot, single action, revolver with a hand rotated barrel (cylinder).  At 3 1/2″ OAL, this little beauty is much nicer than a toy, but not quite a true miniature.  Manufactured in the 1950's it has more detail, and is more functional than the best of the toy miniatures.  It's cylinder rotates.  It has full and half cock.  It has a flip down side loading gate, and fires brass, percussion cap-like ammunition.  Expended shells are ejected with a functioning spring loaded ejector, just like on the real thing.  It is unusual in that the complete trigger guard acts as its trigger and is pulled back to fire.  This part is delicate and many of these guns are found with the tab that holds the trigger assembly in place broken.  The clean finish on these guns suggest that they are sturdy little pieces.  They were however, cast in a pot metal.  It is the care that was taken in finishing these guns that makes them look more substantial than they actually are. This is a popular gun with collectors and a relatively difficult gun to find.  Prices are considerably higher than for even the best of the toy miniatures such as Armodelli or Hubley guns.""These sets sold for $27.50 back in the late 1950's, which was a large sum to pay for a toy.  This example is serial number 4012.  The set is in mint condition, the trigger is still functional as is the loading gate, another piece that is often broken or missing.  The nickel finish retains 100% original nickle plating.  The two piece pearl grips with a single screw entering from the left side are excellent with no cracks or chips. The original case is walnut, has a slide latch, and a rectangular plaque mounted to the case top by two small brass nails.  The case is in nice condition.  The interior bottom of the case French fit and lined in a dark burgundy velour.  It is rare to find one of these complete and in this kind of condition.This one has an authentic 45 cartridge instead of the plastic one it usually comes with and intials on plaque.$400 OBO."

It's in fantastic shape, and the serial number dates it to 1990 and is one of the rarer ones that's marked Heckler & Koch on the side of the receiver. What's unique about this gun is that you can run it in BOTH semi auto and pump action because of its unique design, and that allows you to run anything from blanks to full power 3"" magnum buckshot with no hiccups. It's also in the ""law enforcement/military"" configuration, which gives it the pistol grip stock, as well as the full length magazine tube. The tube holds 7 rounds, plus one in the chamber, plus one ""ghost loaded"" by thumbing the round under the bolt, giving you a total of 9 rounds on tap. It also comes with your standard shotgun/rifle stock without the pistol grip, though I keep the pistol grip stock on for home defense.Asking $1300, or I'm open to any trades. Worst I can say is no!

I chose the Diamondback Tactical scope for it's lifetime warranty which transfers with the scope and the crystal clear 12X it offers. I side mounted the sling because I'm prior infantry and needed a sling that you can actually use as a shooting platform, unlike most slings which are completely worthless.  The sling you see in the pictures is my deployment sling and it does not come with the rifle.  Get yourself a Vtac sling like the one in the pictures and you'll be a bad ass looking dude out deer hunting this fall.
