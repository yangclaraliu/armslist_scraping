This is a Chinese SKS. marked MC-5D
It is a factory shorter barreled, no bayonet, AK magazine model.
This was not modified to take AK mags, it was built this way.
Has the factory 'blond' monte-carlo stock.

Included a 30rd & a 10rd magazine, both metal.

It is all numbers matching, only modification is the scope mount on the reciever cover.

Now for the price.. I see so many people trying to get 800 for an SKS in a 80 dollar tapco stock, Im not going to try this technique.
Im asking $550 for the rifle, and I am going to stay firm on it.
I have ammo available, but it is not included at this price.
This is a rare model these days, and it is a totally different feeling rifle than a regular type 56 rifle, it doenst feel so front heavy..

Not really looking for any trades at this time... I might consider a reasonably priced AK, like a romanian WASR, but Im not going to give a grand for one.. If its new, Ill go to 800.

Im wanting to build a 'tacticool' rifle, and it would be a real shame to hack & modify on this one.."

The rifle was bought as a backup to my existing 6940 because of the current political climate. Unfortunately, the wife does not have the same desire to keep it as I do. Please read reviews of this rifle because it is an outstanding firearm. They do not jam and has most of the upgrades AR owners desire.

Please only serious offers. Unfortunately I do require some form of background check verification. This can be through a conceal weapons carry permit or a pistol purchase permit from the sheriff’s office (they cost 5 dollars each). If you make an offer that I accept I am willing to wait for your permit to go through. Payment will be cash only and will include a signed purchase receipt with serial number annotated.

Stock weapon includes: Magpul folding sights, M4 style collapsible stock, Quad rail, True free floating barrel, 1:7 inch twist allows for high grain rounds...etc. Accessory Kit includes cleaning kit, rail covers, 2 x 20rnd mags and Sling.

I am willing to drive to Fayetteville, Raleigh, Wilson, Greenville, Kinston and Areas in between..only for serious offers.

Colt Website Overview:
The advantage of the LE6940 is unmatched. The LE6940 displays fresh ingenuity with Mil-Spec hammer and trigger pivot pins, a Magpul MBUS backup sight and a folding front sight for enhanced optical solutions, a straight gas tube and a removable lower rail which provides modularity for under mounting accessories. The patented one-piece monolithic upper receiver incorporates a continuous Mil-Spec rail from the rear of the upper receiver to the front sight. This feature affords unmatched repeatability for mounting optical systems, not found with separate handguard rail systems. Designed with accuracy in mind, its true free-floating barrel provides the enhanced accuracy necessary for long-range acquisition capability.

Will also crimp 5.56 NATO rounds as well.

Lee 223 Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet in place more firmly than any other tool. Tests demonstrate that even bullets which have no crimp groove will shoot more accurately. A firm crimp improves accuracy because pressure must build to a higher level before the bullet begins to move. This higher start pressure insures a more uniform pressure curve and less velocity variation.

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

Designed specifically for lightweight mobility, speed of target acquisition, and potent firepower capability - the Colt Law Enforcement Carbine delivers. This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military Colt M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Colt Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30.5 in (77.5 cm) in length and weighs only 6.8 lb (3.08 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's Law Enforcement Carbine comes with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. LE6920 comes equipped with a Magpul MBUS backup sight.

Light enough to be powered by a small outboard or just an electric trolling motor. It's easy to see why the BassHound is becoming America's favorite. It has a long list of big boat features in a compact size and price.

Very great tool that is dependable and I have put 500 rounds through it. Wanted to get another .45ACP, prefer a Glock 30. I will include 75 rounds of 230 grain FMJ I have left and 24 rounds of Federal Hydra Shok JHP 230 grain. I will also include a Remington 20"" fully rifled barrel that I have put 5 sabot slugs through it and no use for it anymore since I just got a 20"" cylinder bore barrel that I can use for any shell minus sabot slugs with no choke. Must be able to own a firearm and have a CO license or CO CHP."
