99,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1958099,For Sale:  LNIB Burris Eliminator II Laser rangefinding scope,"NorthWest, Austin, Texas",$ 700,"Listed On: Friday, August 16, 2013",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Price drop to $700

Details: http://www.eliminatorlaserscope.com/eliminatorII.html

Looking to maybe sell my Eliminator II. It's only five months old, and comes with the box, caps, and all the manuals and such (including a (not pictured) 4 inch screw-on sun shade for the front that makes it HUGE ;) , along with 2 brand new batteries for it (you'll need these if your range bag is tight and hits the ON button on you...or you can just take out the battery when transporting it). This is a variable 4-12x42 scope with a built in laser rangefinder that works out to 1000 yards, which is very cool. Your lase your target and the distance is displayed at the top and a little illuminated orange dot appears partway down the vertical retical showing the proper holdover at that distance for the specific round you're firing (which you program in beforehand). 

When you're shooting 250 yds with a 223 or 308 and zeroed at 100 yds, you really don't need the laser, but when you move out to 500 or more, its like cheating. :)

See the link above for details and pictures showing how it works.

I paid 899 + shipping. I'm looking to get $700 which is a nice discount. It is in beautiful shape and perfect working order.

I will throw in the 1"" quick release riser rail that you see near the bottom of the picture, which I paid $28 for on amazon. Disclaimer: it works fine, but is a bit cheap and a PITA to adjust the tension on, plus it tends to loosen up over time and need to be tightened again (and thus slightly rezeroed). However, I didn't try really *cranking* the adjuster lock nut down or using locktite on it. When it's tight, it does re-zero pretty well when detached and reattached though. Details here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024ZS53S/

I also have a Larue QD 5/8"" riser rail which you see it mounted on now, but that was like $135 + tax, and it's brand new top quality, so I'd want $130 for that. It's awesome, no creep at all, rezeros perfectly when taken off and reattached. Details here: http://www.laruetactical.com/larue-tactical-picatinny-riser-qd-lt-101

A note about AR-15/AR-10: A riser rail is required if mounting on and AR type rifle because the front lens is huge and protrudes below the mounting rail on the scope (as you can see in the pic). You can tell it was designed to go on a normal hunting rifle like a Remington 700. This also means you'll probably want a 0.75"" cheek riser to go with it. You can get one for a Magpul  stock on amazon for $25, or I could maybe be talked out of mine if you need it.

It comes with mounting hardware for a standard rifle though.

I'm selling it because I don't really need it and I kind of want to move to a higher power normal scope, but I do like it and I'm not in a hurry or hurting so DON'T BOTHER with lowball bullshit offers.

I would consider trading for a high quality scope + a bit of cash depending on the value and condition of the trade.

I would be willing to ship if you're willing to risk sending me payment first, but FTF is much preferred for convenience. I have a flexible schedule and can meet almost any time. I will not drive through heavy traffic all the way to South Austin though, we'd have to meet in the middle somewhere. If you're coming from really far, I could maybe be talked into meeting partway for a few bucks more to cover the trouble, depending on the distance."

This Glock is in 9MM, and meant to compete. It has a lighter trigger pull than other model glocks, has Tru-Glu fiber optic sights (rear are green, front is red), flared magazine well attachment, and an extended beaver tail to prevent one's hand from getting in front of the slide when it cycles. Unique about this model is from the factory, the top section of the slide has been milled away to keep the pistol balanced as its barrel is noticeably longer. The slide catch is slightly larger to give the user an easier slide release under pressure, as well as a more pronounced mag release. 

This pistol comes with 2 17 round mags, and one 10 round mag. Has some minor wear on the slide from use, nothing obscene. I have no box or papers as it didn't come with them in the trade. Emails will be replied to in a speedy manner. I don't want to drive any farther than say 30 miles from Columbus."

I would say the gun is somewhere between good and very good condition. There are some small bumps and scrape on the wood stock nothing major and no gouges there is some very light pitting on a small portion of the receiver. Its small enough and light enough that you have to look for it to see it. It is pictured below will light will reflect and can be more easily seen.  lastly some of the finish is worn on the trigger guard. The shotgun loads and feeds fine as long as its operated with authority but can jam if racked slowly.

This is a .357 Magnum Mark I pistol from 1985. It has a 6"" Magnaported barrel and Millet adjustable sights (white outline rear and bright orange front). It comes with one stainless mag and one blued mag. Comes with the original box, literature, cleaning rod, brush and gas system scraping tool. The gun has a ""stainless' appearance and that's where the story gets interesting.

The Desert Eagle serial numbers began at ""3000."" The suffix ""S"" was used for ""stainless guns."" This pistol is serial 309x - S, making it one of the first 100 ""stainless"" Desert Eagles to ever be imported into this country. According to Magnum Research, these old guns that were catalogued as ""stainless"" were actually stainless steel cast frames along with Satin Nickel plated barrels and slides (made of Chromoly steel). This one has black accents and it looks sharp. It handles screaming full-power .357 loads like a champ and recoils like a 9mm pistol. It's a ton of fun to shoot; nobody has shot it without having a huge smile on their face afterwards. Someone in the past 30 years ground down the sharp edge inside the trigger guard on the right side of the frame.

If you're looking for a solid shooter that looks great, this is it! It isn't very common to come across the ""stainless"" MKI in .357MAG, let alone one with the Millet sights and Magnaport factory upgrades. In fact, it was several years before I came across this one. I think it's safe to call it ""rare"" but this one is a shooting piece, not a collector's piece.

Sale price of $1200 is FIRM. Sorry, but $1,000 won't cut it. That's the going rate for a regular blued model... WITHOUT adjustable sights or Magnaports! I was born at night, but it wasn't last night!

Always cleaned after shooting.  I have accented the lettering with melted white crayon that can certainly be removed if you so wish, but I liked the contrast.  Great carry pistol, but need to recoup some cost toward my latest toy.

Looking for $380 for pistol with both mags, case and instructions. Yes, I know you can buy a new Nano online for that but that’s before shipping and background fees. Looking for local sale as I'd rather not deal with shipping. Can travel a short distance from Oshkosh and will require at least a Driver License & prefer CCW. Must be at least 21.

Email or call/text REDACTED.

Also have the following available with pistol purchase. If buyer doesn’t want them I’ll entertain offers on the holsters though.

High Noon Split Decision IWB leather holster , includes shirt tuck & 15 degree cant. Works well at 3,4,5 & 6 position. This has been formed to fit the Nano. Sells for $40 new plus shipping. Asking $30.

Remora “No Clip” series  4ART. Upgraded with sweat shield & tuck option. The outside is a rubber-like material that keeps the holster in place. I prefer this for warm weather carry due to the sweat shield. Also very handy if I’m going to be going anywhere that prohibits carry such as picking up the kids from school. It’s easily and quickly removed before leaving the vehicle and easily put back in place when you leave. No clip getting stuck on your belt. Can fit other similar size pistols as well. Sells for $42 new with above options plus shipping. Asking $30

I Can also provide 50 rounds of 115 grain FMJ ammo to get you shooting for $15.

his post:  asking $185
I have 1555 RDS of .22LR ammo. (1) 1000 RD box of M-22 Winchester 40GR, and (1) 555 RD box of Winchester 36GR. Got rid of 22 rifle dont need this much .22 anymore. Can meet in Cape Carteret or Swansboro. If have to drive farther to meet such as Morehead City or Jax its $10 more. Do not want to break up amount unless you want to pay more.

REMEMBER: Avoid scams by dealing locally and NEVER send money to sellers without using a trusted escrow service.


More like 90 that is if they ever have it. I will buy it from u for 70 if u got some. I have 10 emails crying for it. That I have it priced for .12 cents a round is exactly what I paid for it online with shipping from the cheapest site. Sorry u feel that way

Sent from my iPod

i dont even know why you sent a email back but, i don't believe that for one second, would you pay $185 even if you needed it for a match or to go hunting or because your son or daughter want to go shooting and you live pay check to pay check, i payed $100 and some change for both of these 1000rd boxes a couple of weeks ago and its not just me that feel that way, its everyone who shoots the stuff, there is nothing wrong with making a couple bucks but please treat others the way you want to be treated

Where did u get it at that price, do they have anymore. Ok here I go, listen I honesty paid 11.7 cent a round for this ammo after shipping.  I am charging .12 cent a rd that is a grand profit of 4.665 dollars that don't include my gas to deliver it to someone who buys it. I had to sell my .22 rifle because I got bills tried of looking for ammo. I guess I am stupid and can't get ammo at Walmart at 8:00 because I am working then.

The Model 700 Varmint-Tactical Rifle is a revolutionary system optimized for extended range precision and mobility. Its triangular barrel contour is a product of years of rigorous research and development focused on reducing weight, enhancing rigidity and promoting rapid heat dissipation. To decrease recoil and muzzle jump, this uniquely contoured 22"" barrel has an integral muzzle brake that's machined in during production. Along with the barrel design, brought together a host of other cutting edge features on this super accurate Model 700 platform. The results are nothing short of astounding. Chambered for the inherently tight grouping 223 and 308 calibers, each model engineered with a rate of twist optimized for tactical style bullets, the Model 700 VTR is compact and swift handling thanks to its sleek lines and short action. The legendary ""three-rings-of-steel"" and the many other superior design elements of this rifle deliver the highest degree of out-of-the-box accuracy available today. Plus, it's matched with the X-Mark Pro Trigger system for the ultimate in crispness and shot control. For improved consistency, the green synthetic stock has a vented beavertail forend that promotes rapid cooling. Its overmold accents provide a firm gripping surface and the dual sling swivel studs permit convenient attachment of a bipod and a sling."

See description below:

The Laser Genetics ND-5 Long Distance Hand-Held Green Laser Designator is the first high powered, hand held laser light built for civilian use. The patented design integrates a state of the art microimage green laser pump with a hand controlled Linear Optical Collimator to create the ultimate lighting instrument. One hand, thumb control quickly adjusts laser beam diameter and illumination intensity. The high power laser beam may be collimated down and concentrated to cast an intense, highly visible beam of light able to be seen at distances up to 3 miles for signaling or search and rescue operations. Adjusting the collimator of the Laser Genetics ND-5 Long Distance Hand-Held Green Laser Tactical Light more open increases the diameter of the beam to fully illuminate objects up to 400 yards or even a trail for night hiking. The Laser Genetics ND-5 Green Laser Illuminator Flashlight uses green laser technology because research has proven that green light is the most visible to the human eye and requires the least amount of eye adjustment at night."
