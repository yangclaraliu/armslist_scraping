This is a rare and unique model as opposed to more common models of the PX4 Storm. This is a Type C which uses Beretta's constant action and has no external safety.

This model is extremely accurate but is not designed for the common conception of ""accuracy""; that being, punching holes in paper at the range. This model is designed for true self defense. The trigger pull is designed to prevent the shooter from putting holes in things that he or she doesn't want holes in. 

The half cocked closed hammer allows for proper evaluation of a target, with action that is not as short as single but not as long as double. 

This gun also utilizes Beretta's rotating barrel system which greatly reduces recoil. For a 40, the snap is very minimal.

The PX4 Storm was designed to replaced the current military side arm and was the only pistol to pass all the tests to do so; unfortunately Uncle Sam decided not to spend the money. 

Comes with:

Padded case
3 Back straps for a custom grip
3 14 round magazines (Normally only comes with 2)
Gun lock with cable

This handgun is a limited run Ruger re-production of their GP100 .357 magnum.  This handgun was inspired by the infamous Wiley Clapp and is therefore known as the ""Wiley Clapp Edition"".  These guns are designed specifically as a COMBAT .357 and as such have many features not found on the standard GP100's.  
This combat style revolver features a 3 inch full underlug barrel (which in my humble opinion is the MINIMUM barrel length necessary for tapping into the .357 magnums power) and has NOVAK sights factory installed. 
The Standard GP100 in the 3 in. model does not come with a rear sight.  This model comes with dovetailed Novak sights and the Front sight has the highly visible fiber optic rod for quick target acquisition.  The standard GP100 has a reflective stainless finish.  This gun has a specialized non-reflective matte finish called the ""Hawkeye finish"".  These are just a few of the UPGRADES made only to this model GP100.  Please see the Generic specs listed below as taken from Ruger's website:

Material: 	Stainless Steel 	Finish: 	Matte Stainless
Front Sight: 	Fiber Optic Novak 	Rear Sight: 	Lo-Mount Novak
Barrel Length: 	3.00"" 	Overall Length: 	8.50""
Weight: 	36.00 oz. 	Grips: 	Black Rubber

This revolver is Like New in box (as I am the original owner and fired less than 25 INCREDIBLY accurate rounds through it).  It comes with EVERYTHING as new, including paperwork, fired casing, lock, and Ruger Plastic Box.  Get this AWESOME revolver without a wait and the soon to be MANDATORY paper TRAIL......  This revolver is considerably light weight (only 36 oz.) for an all stainless gun that is designed for a lifetime of the hottest .357 rounds.  This revolver is considered a Limitted edition and as such, these are investments that will only increase in value.  I am not thrilled to let it go....  but need to fund other things...

Pistol CZ999 Scorpion is a modern weapon used as a service gun or a personal defense gun. Due to excellent design solutions, ergonomics, state-of-the art technology in production, this weapon stands out with its precision, accuracy and functionality.

The pistol is a semi-automatic weapon, functioning on the short recoil of the barrel principle.

Locking is achieved by vertical oscillation of the barrel, that comes into the hole on the slide.

The pistol can function as a single action or double action gun.

The pistol is fed from a double-stack detachable magazine.

The pistol has ambidextrous controls - it can be operated with rigt or left hand.

The design of the pistol is such that the same controls have several functions.

Loaded chamber indicator shows whether there is a cartridge in the chamber.

Sights are square, with white dots and they facilitate aiming at low visibility conditions.

The slide is made of high quality alloy steel. The frame is made of aluminium alloy. Handgrip covers are made of high impact polymer.

275,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1487275,For Sale/Trade:  Avon RIB w/Mercury,"Smithfield, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina","$ 4,500","Listed On: Friday, April 19, 2013",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"The RIB is a 2009 Avon Rover 310 Lite, it is made of Hypalon and will last 30 years if taken care of. It is loaded with everything you need to hit the water., 2009 Mercury 9.9 motor, as new, pump, oars, tank, everything. It is a BLAST !!! 
There’s a reason the Navy SEALS use Hypalon RIB’s as does the Coast Guard for rescue missions,,,,,they are TOUGH, they are nearly unsinkable and draft very little water. They can carry a ton of weight and go anywhere. This RIB is carried to the water in my Yukon, in it’s own bag, or on it’s trailer. The floor is rigid, just like a boat, so it’s very tough, easily beached without harm. I use this on local lakes and also down at the beach on the ICW and on nice days you can hit the open ocean !!! Fishing off the RIB is easy. You can go where no one else can, explore remote locations and beach at secluded beaches no one else can get to!
 This set up was  $5,520.00 new, WITHOUT the trailer and used less than 15 times. About $6,300.00 WITH the trailer !

 Again, look at the Navy SEAL and Rescue boats, they use RIB’s !!!

I bought a trailer to make transport even easier ! Then I customized it to also haul the Mercury 9.9 so as to avoid the hassle of putting it in the car trunk, the motor just mounts to the front of the trailer. 

Price is $4,500.00, no less, for everything. I’m looking at any guns, ammo or a huge safe!

If the RIB is so great, why am I selling it ???? Simple, I have a 22’ Stingray and I just inherited an 18” 1964 Chris Craft and a 16’ Bass boat. I only have so much room /time for boating."

Known officially as: M3, sniperscope, infrared, set no. 1, 20,000 volts. Made by american optical co. Buffalo, NY 6-23-51. Made to be mounted on a special M1 carbine known as the M2 carbine making the whole setup a M3. 

Very good condition. Really nice for how old it is. How does it compare to others? I don't know. I've never seen one that wasn't in a book or on the internet. This is the only one I have ever seen. Very rare, very cool piece of American Military History.

What is there and what isn't. This comes with the IR scope, IR Light, Foregrip/ Handle with the trigger, power transformer box, all necessary original wiring, 1 tube, original rubberized backpack (nice), and original chest. As far as what is missing? I'm really no expert but I think there was a tool set and more tubes. These are not there. And of course no .30 carbine. No rust anywhere and looks to be the original finish. Some scratches on the scope but not bad. A little corrosion on a small copper piece behind the light source. And it looks like the red filter is a little rough. The outside plastic of the light source is fine, its the red filter inside. I have not taken this apart or tried to clean any of it. 

Because this is so rare I did not want auction it, I wanted a lot of people to have a shot at owning it. Same with gun broker. I found it in Mn I would like a collector in MN to give it a good home. So I figured the only fair way to do it would be to take offers. So, if you want it, take a shot at it and email me your best offer. If you know what it is, you know what its worth, and how often you can find one.

As far as trades go... I might, might, take one of the following as partial trade with cash. 1. Ruger .44 carbine semi-auto. Prefer older tube fed. 2. Ruger No. 1 in 270 win, 280 rem, 30.06 or 303 brit. 3. HK usp Tactical all black. Of course these guns must be nice.

This slide came directly off of a brand-new Glock 23 Gen 4.  This slide is 100% compatible with the slide on a Glock 19 Gen 4 which will allow you to shoot .40 s&w ammo along with the original 9 mm slide on the Glock 19 Gen 4.  All you have to do is buy magazines for the Glock 23 which works with the .40 s&w ammo.  I also have for sale a new Lone Wolf Distributors (LWD 239N) conversion barrel that will fit in this Glock 23 Gen 4 slide and allow you to fire 9 mm ammo from this .40 s&w slide on a Glock 23 Gen 4.  You will need to buy Glock 19 magazines which are 9 mm to work with the conversion barrel.  The conversion barrel is a chrome barrel so an option would be to send this slide to someone like rockyourglock.com to have this slide hard chromed so it would match the barrel. They charge $75 and the turnaround time is less than two weeks.
My first option is to sell both of these items at the same time so if you only want one of these items I would ask that you give me a little time so I can try to sell them as a set. But of course if the price is right I will absolutely sell them separately.
I am asking $600.00 for the pair.  Both items are brand-new and have never been fired. No FFL is required for this transaction because a slide is considered a part whereas the frame would require an FFL.
Serious inquiries only, text me on my cell at REDACTED. I have more photos just text me your e-mail address and I'll send them to you.

My FAL was designed for 147 gr and my Ishapore 2A1 was designed for 144gr, both shot terrible and wouldn't stabilize with any 168gr or heavier, the Ishy would even keyhole with some of the 155gr stuff, but they both shot great with this 150gr stuff. Should shoot ok in the later M1As and such that were designed for 168gr. If you've got an older rifle in .308, and it just doesnt seem to shoot right with the heavier hunting type ammo, then this is probably the stuff you need.

Known officially as: M3, sniperscope, infrared, set no. 1, 20,000 volts. Made by american optical co. Buffalo, NY 6-23-51. Made to be mounted on a special M1 carbine known as the M2 carbine making the whole setup a M3. 

Very good condition. Really nice for how old it is. How does it compare to others? I don't know. I've never seen one that wasn't in a book or on the internet. This is the only one I have ever seen. Very rare, very cool piece of American Military History.

What is there and what isn't. This comes with the IR scope, IR Light, Foregrip/ Handle with the trigger, power transformer box, all necessary original wiring, 1 tube, original rubberized backpack(nice), and original chest. As far as what is missing? I'm really no expert but I think there was a tool set and more tubes. These are not there. And of course no .30 carbine. No rust anywhere and looks to be the original finish. Some scratches on the scope but not bad. A little corrosion on a small copper piece behind the light source. And it looks like the red filter is a little rough. The outside plastic of the light source is fine, its the red filter inside. I have not taken this apart or tried to clean any of it. 

Because this is so rare I did not want auction it, I wanted a lot of people to have a shot at owning it. Same with gun broker. I found it in Mn I would like a collector in MN to give it a good home. So I figured the only fair way to do it wold be to take offers. So, if you want it, take a shot at it and email me your best offer. If you know what it is, you know what its worth, and how often you can find one.

As far as trades go... I might, might, take one of the following as partial trade with cash. 1. Ruger .44 carbine semi-auto. Prefer older tube fed. 2. Ruger No. 1 in 270 win, 280 rem, 30.06 or 303 brit. 3. HK usp Tactical all black. Of course these guns must be nice.

Of course all cash is always nice. FTF meet. Leave your name and number or I will not get back to you.

Thanks for looking."

AKDAL MKA 1919, 12ga Semi Auto Shotgun, BLACK w/ two 5 round magazines, three internal chokes and the Owners Guide.
The Akdal MKA 1919 is a gas operated, semi-automatic shotgun manufactured in Turkey by Ucyildiz Arms. The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle but the control and function are similar. The MKA 1919 is unlike any other 12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine fed. The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated action. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip, and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer. The MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round (one 3” and one 2 ¾”) metal detachable magazines, and 3 internal chokes. The magazine release button mimics the AR15/M16 rifle location. The manual safety also duplicates the M16 style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip. The top of the receiver has a carrying handle and integral picatinny rail for mounting rear sights, or any optical accessories. 
Tooth and Nail Armory and Firebird Precision have great products to customize and modify the MKA 1919.

These would make great show and conversation pieces for anyone!
