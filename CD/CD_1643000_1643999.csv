It is unfired. May also consider preferably a reverse limb crossbow but might consider a standard crossbow but must be 350FPS or faster.  I am partial to the Barnett Vengeance and Horton Fury. And obviously there would have to be cash on your end.  The TRP if it is new Would be a straight up trade.

Ruger Blackhawk is the most advanced single action revolvers ever made.
While retaining the solid frame, feel and comfortable grip of the classic
single actions, they feature Ruger's patented transfer bar ignition system
with loading gate interlock and reverse indexing pawl, together with an all
coil spring mechanism, adjustable sights, and frame mounted firing grip.
Factor in the Ruger reliability and they are the best value on the market.

Convertible models come equipped with an extra cylinder and are popular 
with shooters who appreciate the classic single-action revolver but opt 
for the versatility of being able to use more than one caliber in their 
handgun. With its interchangeable cylinder, Convertible models can be 
easily converted from one caliber to another without the use of tools. 
This versatility allows avid shooters of autoloading pistols to enjoy 
shooting a classic American single-action sidearm with their favorite 
pistol cartridge.

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

Caliber: 45 ACP

Location (city or county): Mokena

Price: $1400.00

Will ship (Y/N): Yes, plus actual shipping to your FFL (If you are an IL resident, we can do a FTF with valid FOID card)

Other info: Up for sale is my Kimber Grand Raptor II. I am the second owner of this remarkable pistol... I personally have shot a total of 15 rounds total through it. The previous owner who is a friend of mine  told me he had shot 1500 or so... very little use! That is an honest 1500... the only reason I am selling this one is because I own 3 of this exact same pistol and the wife is in my ear about it.

This Specific Kimber has the Dark Grand Raptor Kimber grips (the better of the grips IMHO) and the trigger pull breaks like glass... it is extremely crisp and snaps right at 3-3.5 lbs. This thing shoots like a dream. The pictures of the gun do not even come close to doing it justice. The buffed blue slide are stunning and the polished stainless is pure art.  The only mark on the entire pistol is a small idiot mark which the previous owner put on it.  As you can see from the pictures though, its very light and can probably be taken out fairly easy with scotch bright or very fine sand paper. It did not bug me to the point to even try though.

I am asking $1350.00 on this plus the actual shipping. 

As always, if you want more detailed pics, feel free to ask and I can email them to you!

All of this ammo I have had for approximately a year or two that I bought during the previous shortages for personal stock.  I don't think you can even get some of these packs anymore as I have not seen them being offered.  They have shrunk.  It has all been stored in a climate controlled home, inside of sealed ammo cans with silica packs as seen in the pics.  the ammo cans are not for sale.  Sorry.

If you don't want them at the prices I have listed, please don't respond and waste either of our times.

I do have the seats for it as well so all the hard work is done. This is a salvage title bike due to the wreck. but for the price and maybe another $50 or so to finish it off and you'll be riding. if no one takes it soon i'm going to finish getting it running and ask $2500-2800

The infamous Winchester Black Talon in 9mm!
There was quite a fuss raised over these rounds a few years back...  Winchester pulled them from the market and later basically changed the name and cosmetics and re-released them as as the Winchester ""SXT"" (and stopped coloring them black).  Yes, the bullet is actually black!  6 razor sharp claws deploy on impact.

This box is missing one of the 20 rounds- in other words, there are 19 in the box.

I bought this antique Apple Mac computer a year or so ago for basically a decorative addition to my office and to read emails. I have too many modern computers and a shortage of space so I will sell it for $100. I paid $200 so this is a bargain for someone.

I took it to the Apple Store upon purchase and in a genius bar appointment, they updated it with the latest software that its processor will take.

The computer shows: Machine Name: iMac; Machine Model Powermac 4, 2; CPU Type: PowermacPC G4 (2.1); Number of CPUs: 1; CPU Speed: 800 MHz; L2 Cache (per CPU)L 256 KB; Memory: 512 MB; Bus Speed: 100 MHz; Boot ROM Version: 4.40f1; Serial No: QT2172GLLF4.

It is perfect for having open on your desk for Emails, or for reading. Its technology will not handle the modern word process programs or video streaming, but for its time, it was the best of the best and was a timeless design.

I will include the generic keyboard and mouse that I bought for this. The computer  operates only on cable; it will not handle the wireless we have today, so you need to use a standard cable for your modem or route slots. I will include a cable too.

Face to face picked up in Mayflower: a trade or $100 cash only.

NOTE: You must include both your name and your telephone number in your email. I will not reply to any email lacking these and will immediately delete any which do not contain this information. The reason I operate in this fashion is that I do not want to waste my time on those seeking to con others.

It is a classic. I cannot positively remember what this model is but here is an article with a link to its source on the web. I think this is a G4 but am not positive.

Here are photos I took today with my I-phone 5.

For sale is a 9mm Just Right carbine. The rifle comes with the JR disassembly/assembly tool and a mid-quality reflex sight.

For those unfamiliar with JR carbines, they can be set up to fire 9mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP, and are blowback operated. They use Glock magazines, two of which come with the weapon. The collapsible stock, handle, and trigger group are all AR-15 sourced, leaving you with some easy-to find parts. The gun can be set up in about 2 minutes for either right or left handed fire.

I love the thing, but I have to make some hard choices about what to keep and sell.

VA residents only (unless you're doing an FFL transfer), and I prefer to deal with a CCW holder or LEO. Being able to use your pistol carry ammo in a more powerful, more accurate package is really handy -- my glock magazines interchange with my pistol, which is nice."

667,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1643667,For Sale:  iPod Nano 16GB 7th Gen NEW,"NE, Cedar Rapids, Iowa",$ 130,"Listed On: Sunday, May 19, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I recently won a 7th Generation iPod Nano at a technology conference. This is the latest generation of iPod Nano just released in October 2012. It has 16GB of storage space, black, and has the new smaller USB lightning connector. I opened it to take a look at it, and quickly realized I had no use for it. I have all the music I need on my smart phone. There is no use for me to carry around yet another device in my pocket. This puppy can play back videos, has Bluetooth, and is only 5.4mm thin.

 Comes with everything from original box, including skull candy ear buds, USB cable, and manual.

 Device retails for $149, but I'd be interesting in trading this to someone that could use it. I'm interested in any firearm, but would prefer something in .22LR, or shotgun.  Break action .12 gauge?  Any other reasonable trade will be considered. I would also consider precious metals, jewelry, or old coins."

With the red dot mount and the gunsmiths work to securely mount the red dot I have $800 into the gun. From the pictures you can see it's like new. All the new SP01's that are available are $800 plus. Seems like $650 is fair. If you have any justification for a lower price I might consider it.

The carbines are in great shape for being almost 70yrs old. Both are 1944 ""Izzy"" (?) manufacture. I also have one spam can of Russian silver tip ammo in an un-opened spam cam and one spam can of Bulgarian silver tip that has been opened. The cans will come with a can opener.

Breakdown of my pricing is as follows-$225 per carbine and $75 per can of ammo. Considering current prices of these (around $250 for the rifles after ordering and ffi fees/taxes and $100 at least for the ammo) I'm firm on the prices. Everything together for $600, if you want one carbine and ammo can, I'll sell for $325. 

I'm not interested in selling just a carbine or the just a tin of ammo. If I don't sell them together or 1 rifle with spam can, I don't have a problem just keeping them.

Rifle is in excellent shape and has had less than 400 rounds through it.  This is not a pieced together rifle from different websites or gun shows.  Smith & Wesson quality and reliability.  All accessories are in excellent shape as well.  Will sell ammo seperate for $350 but would really like to keep it all together.  This is a great deal for someone wanting to get litterally everything you need all in one shot.  If you find a better deal with ammo and accesories jump on it!  Only reason I'm selling is because my 10 year wedding anniversary is coming up and I'm trying to pay for 9 previous years worth of crappy anniversary gifts!   $1600 firm"
