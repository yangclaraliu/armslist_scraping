This is a Century CETME rifle which is an early variation of the HK91/G3 and PTR-91 clone. Later runs of the CETME rifles from Century, with the stamped receivers and tack welded sights are JUNK! This was built on an early cast stainless steel (St. Albans stamped) receiver which are widely known to be a much higher quality build using only excellent condition parts. Just do some searches online, they're highly regarded and much more valuable than other CETME rifles. 

A widely held opinion is that properly built CETME, within specs, is comparable to an AK in reliability. Plus, you have the bonus of it being a .308. They only got a bad reputation because buying a CETME is usually a crapshoot due to Century's awful build quality on their later rifles.

Note:
 - The bolt has not been ground and the bolt gap is well within specs at 0.014""
 - This has Bill Springfield trigger job (huge improvement for about $80)
 - The factory Century muzzle brake was replaced with a flash hider ($40)

These semiautomatic pistols from Browning have set what most people would call the highest standard of handgun excellence when it comes to .22-caliber LR rimfire firearms. Each one is CNC-machined and this is to ensure exact tolerances. Each crisp, single-action trigger teams up with a hand-reamed chamber along with a target crown on a smooth barrel which enhances accuracy. The grips incorporate a technology called Ergonomic Interactive Surface for optimal comfort, consistent aim and control. Browning Buckmark is renowned for their accuracy and these pistols will deliver exceptional performance especially for all of you small-game hunters or target shooters.

Standard URX – This features the “Wraparound Ultragrip RX” and represents the very latest in handgun-grip technology. The finger grooves are very well placed and there is a nice stylish wave pattern that combines for a simple Ergonomic Interactive Surface which ensures a consistent grip positioning for optimal aiming. The textured rubber construction also results in tight grips that are very comfortable in any almost any condition. It has fully adjustable sights."

Truck has over 233k miles on it, the speedometer stopped working on it when I originally test drove it so I don't know if it worked on and off, just know it is over 233k. Truck has some rust, rust on cab corner with foil tape covering it up (can't tell there is rust from a distance), the Flareside bed is fiberglass so it is not all rusted out. Needs a shift tube for the column shifter (shifter is sloppy). Windshield has a crack in it. Rear shock mount broke off of axle so it needs welded back on. Emergency brake needs hooked back up. I just put gas in the rear tank to see if the fuel pump works, it does, however the tank leaks. I purchased the truck back in August to use as a hunting truck and shortly after injured my back, and it looks like I am going to need surgery to fix it. Purchased the truck in the same condition it is in now only thing that I did was replace a brake line and put in a newer battery. I really like the truck and style, it runs good but have no need for it now and I am unable to work on it if anything does happen to it due to my back. Would make someone who knows how to work on an older vehicle a very nice hunting/wood/beater truck. A couple buddies said I should keep it and use as a tough truck for fair season, had to remind them of my back. Asking $1,300 firm, possible trade or partial trade and cash, let us know what you have. Please remember it is a 20 year old $1,300 truck that is not in perfect condition, but it is a $1,300 4wd truck. We do not need the money, just do not need the truck, so no point for us to keep it, $1,300 is a firm price we will not take less unless it is cash and trade. You can call or text REDACTED or email us."

16"" 7.62 NATO

Brand New & In Stock!! NO credit card fees!!

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper (not included). The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

The revolutionary LWRC International R.E.P.R. rifle is truly a force to be reckoned with.

The supplies of cerakoted LWRC's are almost non-existent right now because they increase production time. We were able to get our hands on one of the last cerakoted REPR's. We've been told by LWRC that it will likely be 2014 before more of colored versions will be available (if they'll even still be legal to be produced and sold to the civilian market at that time.)

Oregon gun control bill attracts national publicity; sponsor says it appears dead on arrival
 By Jeff Mapes, The Oregonian OregonLive.com 
on February 25, 2013 at 1:53 PM, updated February 25, 2013 at 8:23 PM Print View/Post Comments 

Rep. Mitch Greenlick, D-Portland
 Mike Lloyd/The Oregonian   A bill promoted by Ceasefire Oregon to ban many semi-automatic firearms and high-capacity gun magazines generated a national outcry over the weekend from angry pro-gun activists. 
Even Rep. Mitch Greenlick, D-Portland, the chief sponsor of House Bill 3200, said the bill as introduced goes too far in not only banning the sale of these weapons but in limiting each gun owner to continue possessing just one of these firearms.  

Greenlick said he also disagrees with a provision that would allow the state police to investigate gun owners who possess one of these weapons to make sure they are safely stored.

""In its current form, it's a pretty flawed bill,"" said Greenlick, adding that ""I don't think [the bill] is in play.""

Senate Judiciary Chairman Floyd Prozanski, D-Eugene, said last week that he didn't intend to proceed with any bills that would ban assault weapons or large-capacity magazines. House Judiciary Chairman Jeff Barker, D-Aloha, also said he opposed bans of this nature.

Penny Okamoto, executive director of Ceasefire Oregon, said she thought the bill could still gain a favorable hearing at the Legislature because of public anger with gun violence in the wake of the shootings at Newtown, Conn. and the Clackamas Mall.

""I think legislators are really going to hear from the majority of Oregonians who want an assault weapons ban,"" she said.

At this point, legislators are hearing an outpouring of criticism for HB 3200 from opponents of gun control.  Greenlick said he was peppered with as many as 1,000 emails over the weekend criticizing him and the bill.

Several conservative web sites from around the country have portrayed the bill harshly, and some have also left the casual reader with the impression it is close to becoming law.

""Oregon drafts invasive gun law,"" was the headline over a story on Breitbart.com, a popular conservative web site.  It went on to describe the bill as giving the government the power to confiscate guns since no one would allow to keep more than one of these guns or three magazines containing more than 10 rounds of ammunition.

Kevin Starrett, executive director of the Oregon Firearms Federation, helped stoke concern about the bill by sending out an email alert Friday just after it was introduced stating:

HB 3200 not only bans most modern guns and magazines, it allows warrantless searches of your home, requires background checks and registration for a firearm you already own and as-of-yet undefined storage requirements. We say “a firearm” because even if you comply with the restrictions in this bill you may still only own one.

""It's more extreme than what I expected"" when the bill was still in the concept stage, said Starrett.  He argued that most pistols and rifles sold in the country now are semi-automatics and would fall under the proposed ban. 
Okamoto said that her group believed that gun owners didn't need the guns covered by HB 3200  for such purposes as hunting and self defense.  And she argued that gun owners who kept one of the guns under the proposed ban in the bill would be ""agreeing to allow this search.""

Greenlick said he would want to greatly amend the bill if it started to move through the process.  For now, he said, it's mostly stimulating debate.

""It's not where they [most legislators] want to go and it's not where I think we're going to go,"" said Greenlick, ""but it's where we should be going.""

This gun started life as a 32-20.  It was later converted to 44 Russian/S&W Special with a Colt barrel and cylinder.  As you can see, at some point in the last 115 years a hole was drilled and tapped in the left side of the frame.  Can't be sure why.  It will come with the Colt letter that I paid $100 for.  Here are a few links to some threads about it.  Thanks

The Gentleman that bought it fell on hard times and I purchased from him to help out. I have done little research on this item but have found that they are pretty much nonexistent anymore. With that being said, what I do know, is that all it needs is a receiver and a barrel (should set you back about $150-$200 total). It has the under folding rear stock, but can easily be changed to side folder, fixed, adjustable and so on. From my perspective, everything is brand new, just a little dirty from sitting around for years, but no rust. All I would like to get out of it is what I put into it, ~$600. I know that the kits were going for much more than that, and when fully built they go for $1700-$2500.

For a collector, this is something that you can be sure that very few people have ever seen. It's basically a DA/SA version of a Hi-Power.

Previous owner claimed to have shot 250 rounds.

Price is $1,150 firm. I paid $46 per mag, I can show the receipt.  Minus the 4 extra mags and leg holster puts the price of the pistol and original mag below $900.  The leg holster is new/never used, is a made in the U.S.A, constructed from cordura nylon leg holster, these cost over $70.

Sale is FTF only, I'll meet halfway for a sale, up to a 1 hour drive from my house. If you just want to inspect you need to come to me. I've included lots of pics in the photobucket album so the condition is easily ascertained.

Many more pictures here.

I'm not doing like the goofy ones pricing them at 350 bucks; which is insane.  I'm only asking what I have in it as it is only 2 weeks old (purchased Feb 15).  I have ran maybe 40 shells out of it; 25 being 7.5 birdshot, 10 being slugs and the other 5 being zombie max buckshot.  I also drilled a couple holes in the buttstock to run paracord through it for a sling attachment.  It has sling attachments but the back one doesn't work great with the shell holder.  They are both still on there though.  It hasn't had one problem and I would stake my families life on it.  I unfortunately need the money more than the weapon so it's up for grabs.  I live just outside of Mitchell, IN and I would be willing to meet around Bedford or Paoli.  I drive to Bloomington a few times a week as well.  I'm still in shock over people trying to almost double the price of these on here.  You can call or text my number at REDACTED; if it's after 2200 please just text.

Nearly impossible to find - near new - G19 Gen4 up for sale or trade.  Pistol has had just under 150 of FMJ rounds through her.  Immaculate shape - looks the same as if it were off the shelf.  Comes with 3 mags, box, extra grips all the stuff that comes with it new.  

Also included in the sale is 350 rounds of factory FMJ 115 grain 9mm ammo so you can actually shoot the thing. 9mm ammo is getting tough to come across these days - so this should get you started. Could be willing to sell the pistol alone if you have your own supply.

I have for sale a new and un-fired Bushmaster XM-15 Series M4 carbine rifle chambered in 5.56mm/.223 Rem. It has the A3 style flat top upper receiver with a Picatinny rail for sight mounting, forged lower receiver, plastic two piece hand guards and a six position collapsible stock. The barrel is 14.5"" with a permanently attached 'Izzy' flash suppressor that makes it a legal 16"", and is hard chrome lined in the bore and chamber for durability and easy cleaning with a 1:9 twist ratio and a fixed adjustable front sight with bayonet lug. It's all black with matte black phosphate coating to reduce glare and resist corrosion. One steel 30-round magazine is included. 

Known for accuracy and versatility, the M4 is a top choice for military and law enforcement. These rifles are quickly becoming more valuable and harder to get.

Sorry to be part of the folks who are jacking up prices but I have taken a hit from the Obama plan that wasn't going to effect the middle class  and have to try and pay down some bills fast. I tried to keep this price lower than most. If you don't HAVE to have ammo right now, wait three or four months and you won't have to deal with these prices. If you must have it now then you can buy it from me for a price that is better than most.

I am selling Rem 55 grain .223 at $75 / 100 rounds. I live in Cottage Grove and will not deliver."
