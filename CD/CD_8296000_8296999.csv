This rifle started out as a long range but was a pain to haul around. I had a lighter barrel installed, and it has only five rounds shot out of it and looks new. It has a Timney trigger, and the stock was fitted with a Magpul LA Mag well.  The scope is a Vortex Diamondback 4x16x42 and is sitting on Leupold mounts. I never got around to reloading for it, so there are fifty rounds of Hornady brass and a couple of hundred projectiles in 160 and 170 grain. There are five boxes of Hornady Whitetail, one box minus five rounds of Remington, and a few misc rounds from when I had the heavier barrel. The rifle is in excellent condition and is accurate; it only took three shots to get in the red at one hundred yards, and the last two shots were within an inch. I have a lot of money in all of this and will be asking what I feel is a fair price."

Since the 10mm round is also 40 cal. just springs and barrel cartridge depth are all they had to change. This pistol barrel was reamed for the longer 10mm cartridge and frame bored out to accept a wider guide rod for a single heavy duty sping set-up. No buffer necessary. The spacer spot welds were cut out of the 4 included mags and 10mm mag followers put in.The 1013 provides maximum firepower in a compact semi-auto and with the resurgence of the 10mm cartridge they are highly sought by collectors in this condition and extremely rare since only conversions are available. This is the ultimate carry gun but I enjoy it at the range since this one was put together by an experienced converter and the spring set-up makes felt recoil the same or less than a 40 with standard 1100 to 1200 fps 10mm loads. The Hogue Grips help there as well and accuracy with the Novak Lo-Mount 3 white dot sights is every bit as good as any of my 3.5"" barrel S&W 3rd Gen compacts. The 10mm fireball is simply awesome! The action is called Traditional Double Action (TDA) which describes a longer 1st shot trigger pull which cocks the hammer, and single action short crisp trigger pull on subsequent shots.  An ambidextrous safety/decocker is featured for convenience and ultimate safety especially when keeping a round chambered. The internals show little wear and have been polished for smoother action and well lubricated to preserve the aluminum alloy frame. Even with the stainless steel slide, weight is just 28.8 ozs. unloaded, perfect for concealed carry.The full 3 finger grip houses 8 round curved buttplate magazines suitable for even large hands. The pistol is shown with the cocked factory bobbed hammer many prefer for concealed carry. The grooved top makes it easy to grip for manual cocking  I'm a S&W 3rd Gen collector so I've pnly put about 250 rounds through this pistol and have had absolutely no function issues whatsoever over the year I've owned it. The 3rd Gens are well known for reliability and were popular duty weapons until phased out due to production cost.  The S&W case is new and not labeled. More pictures available upon request. Cash deal offers only - No trades. Valid driver's license must be presented. I'm willing to meet anywhere in the Tampa - St.Pete area to show this impressive pistol. Shipping to an FFL available. Send a message for more info or to request a call or text."

As you start taking closeups the flaws start popping out showing that it was holster carried some but not a lot and looking at the back of cylinder frame it apparently wasn’t shot a lot. It’s in the high 90’s condition wise. The worse area is probably the back part of the grips frame where it still has most of its bluing but some scratches. There are some marks and other spots on the gun and should show in the photos, but you would have a hard time upgrading this one. No box, but comes with factory letter.

The frame has extensive, but refined, floral and scroll decoration that will make this shotgun a source of pride for years to come. The oil-finished stock is select walnut finish. It has the same dual-conical locking mechanism that lets Beretta over-unders stand up to years of constant shooting and to be passed on from generation to generation. Placing the locks between the barrels allows a low frame profile that gives Beretta over-unders an unmatched lively feel and natural pointability. Befitting of a field gun that will be used in exciting hunting situations, the safety is automatic, resetting each time the Silver Pigeon is opened for reloading.

The all-new Riptide SF features fewer moving parts, tighter tolerances, advanced corrosion protection and our revolutionary new Mono-Arm. You get no-nonsense power, stealth operation and rugged, reliable performance – everything you need to put saltwater in its place. Mono-Arm Design Sometimes, the simplest solution is best. In this case, it’s a revolution. Riptide SF’s innovative Mono-Arm Design features an extruded, anodized aluminum, structural beam that operates with no metal-to-metal contact and 75% less torsion. A single hinge point and rear pivot bearing with 20% more surface area deliver less wear, longer life, and quieter operation than traditional motor mounts. Counter-Tension Stabilizer (CTS) CTS uses an integrated spring that applies force whether the motor’s stowed or deployed. On the water, that translates to a motor with no play, no give, reduced steering torque and silent operation. Lift-Assist Riptide SF’s Lift-Assist design cuts the weight of stow and deploy in half, making it as easy as lifting your SUV tailgate. It features a stainless steel, nitrogen-charged gas spring to get you in and out of the water with ease.   Two-Year Warranty This motor is backed up with Minn Kota’s two-year warranty Specifications Control: Tilt/Extend Tiller  Volts: 24  Max Thrust: 80 lbs.
