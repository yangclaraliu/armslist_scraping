The Rossi revolution started with the founding of the company in 1889 by Amadeo Rossi and over the last 115 years that tradition has grown. The Rossi name represents a piece of firearm history and a tradition of excellence. Over the years Rossi has led the way in design and engineering, while at the same time, stressing the importance of producing an affordable product without sacrificing quality or accuracy. In December of 1997 BrazTech International was created as the exclusive importer of Rossi firearms in North America. Rossi manufactures its classic rifles in a plant in Sa Leopoldo, Brazil selling many firearms outside the United States and North America. Rossi manufactures three models of Taurus handguns including the .38 Special as well as four models of .357 Magnum revolvers under contract. Today's Rossi is still family run and they put the same dedication and innovation into every firearm. At Rossi, it is more than just building guns...it is a family's history and tradition. As a perfect example, this 44 Magnum R92 is the ideal rifle for hunting in heavy bush and is a tried and true “Piece of the Old West” with all the beauty and functionality of the original at a fraction of the cost.

Individual Carbine
16"" Black

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!
The new M6 Individual Carbine family is the direct descendant of the rifles developed by LWRCI™ to meet the requirements of the U.S. Army Individual Carbine program. It includes some revolutionary new features while maintaining the basic M4/AR15/M16 architecture that has served our nation’s armed forces well for the past 40 years.

All members of the IC family feature our new fully ambidextrous lower receiver. Dual controls for bolt catch and release, magazine release, and fire control mean that both right- and left- handed shooters can use the rifle to its full effectiveness. In addition, dual controls give shooters the option of using their offhand side to accommodate barriers or injury. They can effectively manipulate the controls without having to switch hands. Despite its dramatically improved functionality, this new dual control lower receiver is compatible with all legacy AR15 pattern upper receivers.

The Monoforge™ upper receiver used in all members of the IC family is a further evolution of the M6A2-SPR platform introduced by LWRCI™ in 2011. It features a user-configurable rail system. Moreover, the mounting base for the handguard is machined as part of the upper receiver for added strength and reduced weight.

The new Individual Carbine family from LWRCI shows that, at times, evolution takes a giant leap forward.

Comes with 2 Magazines, Case and Kydex Holster (More Magazines can be bought with gun or traded with it) Also, I'm looking to stay within 1hr drive from Trinity, FL but prefer closer.

The P6 was the West German Police sidearm for decades. In America, it was designated as the P225. The West German police used full metal jacket ammunition and had no feeding problems but they did with hollow points. When the P225 was introduced in America, the feed ramp was changed to allow use of hollow point ammo. In the fall of 1987, the P6 barrel was changed so that its feed ramp was identical to the P225. 

 When buying a P6, you should try to get one made after late 1987. This one was made in April of 1991 and has the improved feed ramp.  I have also added Sig night sights to weapon and have changed the grips to Pachmyer rubber grips. The original factory plastic grips are also included. 

 The pistol normally comes with two magazines but I am selling a total of four with the gun.  This is an outstanding shooter. I have often used it as a demonstration gun when teaching new shooters because it made me look so good. It is incredibly accurate and because of the all steel construction, it is absolutely stable during rapid fire. This is the consummate all steel double action/single action concealed carry weapon. It is a single stack 8+1 gun that is absolutely flat and highly concealable. Because it is a Sig, it will last forever. Neither the P225 or the P6 is still manufactured by Sig Sauer. It comes with the original Sig Sauer cardboard box.
Because the night sights cost $100.00 and the two extra magazines were $25.00 each, I am asking $550.00"

The 20 guage barrel will take up to 3 inch shells.
Looking for 375.00. I don't think this is too high considering what I have seen some sell for lately. 

The 835 has the woodland camo finish. Ported 24 inch barrel. Great gun in great shape. Less than 200 rounds through it. Comes with sling, 2 chokes (ulti-full and semi-modified), and a couple boxes of 3 1/2 inch turkey loads (about 25 rounds). Looking for 350.00.

With the introduction of the P938, Sig Sauer now offers the ballistic
advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the
best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with
full-size Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger
pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly
larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger
gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the 1911
will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in
familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and
right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine will be available
separately. The most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line, the P938
will be available in five configurations.

I only made it to the range once with this beauty and I put about 150 flawless rounds through it. It is super accurate and a blast to shoot, trigger breaks very nicely. I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it, plus a complete set of snap on rail covers in case you want to hold the rifle by the quad rail. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 ALSO INCLUDED BUT IS A MAGPUL FOREGRIP WITH A LASER SIGHT MOUNTED TO THE SIDE OF THE RAIL, THE BUTTON FOR THE LASER IS ON THE FOREGRIP AND IT MAKES FOR A NICE TACTICAL TOOL OR EASY ACQUISITION ON A TARGET.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

I bought this and customized it with a 3rd generation stainless steel recoil adaption kit which helps to prevent any failure to feed, or failure to eject, a common problem among gen4 glocks due to their heavy double springs. I hate the Gen4 grips so I had the gun stippled which I understand will be a turn off for a few die hard glock fans but it is something you have to hold to appreciate, it is like the gun is velcroed to your hand as soon as you touch it. I bought this then found a great deal on a Gen3 19 so I am looking to pass a good deal on to someone else. Round count is right about 25 which you will be able to tell. Gun shows no signs of wear. also comes with Glock tupperware, alternate backstraps (4), 2 magazines, lock and papers, and original recoil spring as well as 4 backstraps.

Im asking 525 O.B.O dont be afraid to ask me to meet up so you can feel the grip before you make your decision.

It comes with the original plastic grips, all factory/stock parts are included with the (3) mags - LE/MIL marked 15rd capacity original Italian Mecgar mags - and manual in the box.

This hasn't seen a shot fired outside the factory, as can be seen in the photo of the barrel hood. Sigs mark up pretty quick in that area, so it's easier to tell that this one hasn't been fired or played with. It's as a NIB/NOS pistol should be.

That allows the Montefeltro’s forend to be slim and graceful, while the lightweight, anodized aluminum receiver keeps weight to a minimum. The 12-gauge and the 20-gauge shotgun are chambered for 3"" magnum loads, making the Montefeltro equally at home in New England woodcock cover and a Louisiana duck blind. This is one gun that looks as good as it shoots. Stocked with beautifully finished satin walnut, the Montefeltro is the gun for the wingshooting purist who wants the feel of a classic game gun with the added advantage of a semi-auto

I bought this earlier this year, rather spontaneously, and put 25 rounds of hollow point through it at the range.

Four holsters: a Don Hume IWB clip-on style, a Galco pocket holster, a custom  Remora IWB holster with leather lining and full sweat shield that fits the Sig while the laser is attached, and a Sig brand wallet style holster that came included with the gun. Comes with one factory Sig mag and two Metalform mags that all functioned flawlessly for me. I'll also throw in a box of Buffalo Bore 380+p hardcast.

It needs stuff here and there,mostly cosmetic,but it does have a solid,straight body.
Will need a battery to start and run,and will need some tires to drive everyday.
I have drove this old car daily about 90 miles to work for a year,so I know its a good reliable car and not easy to find in a V8/5 speed.
I may have tires and a battery in the car in the next few days,but its cheap at 1800 cash,so if I do,the price will reflect the addition of any parts I add.
I would take a partial trade on an AK for up to half of the price of the car.I've gotten a lot of interest in the car.Everybody wants to trade straight up.I know the economy is rough right now,but in order to trade with no cash involved,it would take multiple guns,I.e. two very nice AKs,an AK and a couple of nice semi auto handguns,etc.
The car is located in NE Ky,about a half hour from Ashland.It would have to be picked up there.I will not deliver it anywhere for any deal,only due to the car not currently having insurance and the tags being expired,but it will reliably drive anywhere.

I would say the wood overall is in good condition except for a gouge right under the end mental barrel strap. The bore looks like it has some lead deposit but the rifleing can still be seen. The bottom of the rifle where the brass plate is shows 32 although faint but still readable. It still has the dust cover, it slides like it was designed to do but it is not tight, it comes off easily. Because the rifle is historical I don't want to try tightening the dust cover only to make it worse. A couple screws SLOTS on the barrel strap have been beat up by a careless cowbiy  because I seriously doubt he had gunsmith screwdrivers. .The mechanics seem to work okay, I would not be afraid to fire it.  What I am asking for this piece of history is more than fair.  I will not ship or travel a long distance to show the rifle. I will meet you right off the freeway in Auburn but that is about it.

The grip frame and ejector rod housing are steel not Aluminum which add to it balance.  It comes with “gunfighter” style simulated ivory grips.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breach and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge.

It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. 
The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. 
The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). 
The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Ruger says this about the decocking option:
SPECIAL FEATURE - DECOCKING LEVER
The model you have selected is equipped with a special manual decocking lever
that also allows you to decock (uncock) a cocked pistol without manipulating the
trigger.
To decock the pistol depress the decocking
lever until the hammer drops. The decocking lever first moves the firing pin into
the slide far enough so that the rear end of the firing pin cannot be struck by the
hammer. Only then will continued depression of the decocking lever safely drop
the hammer to an uncocked position. To return the pistol to firing
condition, simply release the decocking lever. It will spring
upward to its original position. The pistol is then ready to fire by a “double-
action” pull of the trigger. The hammer can also be manually cocked immediate-
ly before shooting a “single-action” firing. The trigger pull is both shorter and
relatively lighter in the “single-action” mode, which is preferred for more accu-
rate shooting.
Additionally, the pistol has a separate internal firing pin block that will not allow
the firing pin to move forward until the operator pulls the trigger.
