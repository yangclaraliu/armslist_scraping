This is essentially a doublestack government 1911. You can see more at stiguns.com They are well known for making gun used in racing and competition but this is a variant intended for LEO and carry, etc. It has Dawson 3-dot Night Sights (~9 months old) with bull barrel and 3/4 rail. It has also been professionally hard chromed by Metaloy (it is not shiny/glossy chrome plating but more of a matte finish that is ultra hard for durability).
Included are 5 magazines, kydex IWB holster and kydex double mag pouch. This weapon is extremely accurate and have very low muzzle flip. The grip is the same angle and width as a standard 1911 and the upper half is, in fact, 1911A1 compliant. Weight is saved by employing a (changeable) polymer grip such that the loaded gun (12+1) weighs about the same as a railed bull barrel 1911 with 8+1. I have owned it for about 1.5~2 years and put about 400 rounds through it.
I can ship from FFL to FFL or do a FTF transaction after looking at your CCW ID. The gun, new, runs about $1900 plus $60 per mag and $85 for night sights, $75 for holster, etc.
I will also entertain trades plus cash for lower end stuff that I am interested in, such as a .308 Rem 700 SPS, a basic semi or pump hunting shotgun with exchangeable chokes, etc.. Thanks for looking!"

This is not the normal 625.  The regular production model of the Model 625 was introduced in 1989. In 1991–1992, a few were made with 3-inch barrels in .45ACP.  You’ll find plenty with 4” barrels, on up, but very few with 3” and none that I’ve found with the Eagle engraving.  I requested the research through S&W and have the paper history.  It will come with Holster, Clips and 50 rds of ammo.  It is very accurate (notice sample of a 625-3 @15yds).

This is the same rifle as the PSA 16"" M4 Premium Carbine. It was purchased as a separate flat top upper assembly and a separate lower receiver and parts kit with all components being purchased brand new. I assembled it myself. The lower receiver is marked ""multi"" and can fire both 5.56 Nato and .223 Rem ammo. It comes with a Rock River Arms chrome bolt carrier group. This rifle has 200 rounds through it (170 rounds of .223 with 40 rounds being steel cased ammo, and 30 rounds of XM855 5.56x45 62 grain ammo.) without a single malfunction of any sort. It comes with 430 rounds of ammo (390 rounds of Federal XM855 5.56x45mm 62 grain FMJ ball ammo in the ammo can, 1 box of Winchester Ranger 60 grain .223, and 1 box of Herter's 55 grain steel cased .223) along with 6 magazines (3 steel magazines with gray magpul followers, 2 steel magazines with green followers, and one Gen2 PMAG). This rifle comes with an A2 rear sight with dual aperture for both close range and longer range shooting. The rifle will come in a US PeaceKeeper nylon zip case with 4 pouches for magazines and a zip-shut pocket for other necessities while you are at the range.

 There was a spot on the ejection port side (right side) where tool marks were left while installing the roll pin while assembling the trigger guard. The spot was touched up with an off brand (not birchwood casey) gun bluing by a buddy of mine....but it is still able to be seen. I've attempted to show the spot in the last picture. It could be touched up with some aluminum black for a better match with the rest of the finish. In no way does this compromise the safety or function of the firearm. Other than that, this rifle is in fantastic shape with very few other handling marks (one on the opposite side of the trigger guard, and one by the bolt catch from my ring). More pictures are available if you are interested.

 I have over $1,600 into this package. That said, I don't expect anybody to pay what I paid for it. $1,000 Cash only. $1,100 trade value (my original selling price). The only trades I would consider are a Ruger 10/22 model 1168 or 1102 in good shape, A Glock 19 with night sights, or a XDS in 9mm. All State and Federal laws apply (24 hour wait or 72 hours if a handgun is part of the trade, valid FOID card, record of transfer, etc). I am not looking to travel a great distance for this sale, but with that said I go to the IL QC's 5 days a week for work. Would also travel as far east as Rockford...possibly DeKalb if you are from a suburb where this firearm is legal to own. I would consider selling to an Iowa or Wisconsin resident if you are willing to cover half of the ffl costs. The only trades I would consider are a Ruger 10/22 model 1168 or 1102 in good shape, a ""budget"" 1911 in 9mm (i.e. $500 Rock Island Armory 1911 Tactical 9mm, Remington, Citadel....no Taurus) with a skeletonized trigger and hammer, or possibly a XDS in 9mm or 1911 in .22lr with the balance to be covered in cash. All State and Federal laws apply (24 hour wait or 72 hours if a handgun is part of the trade, valid FOID card, record of transfer, ffl transfer for non-residents, etc)."

Don't really want to sell it, but I'm not using it nearly as much as I thought I would, and can use the money toward other things. I bought this gun brand new last fall, and have fired exactly 40 rounds through it in one range session. The gun is set up as follows:

-Remington 700 SPS Varmint .223 Rem. BDL setup (hinged floorplate), matte finished metal. 26"" bull barrel, 1-12"" twist rate

-Timney 510 trigger. Adjustable from 1.5lb to 4lb. This specific trigger was custom tuned by Timney, so its a little bit nicer than one you'd get directly out of the package.

This gun would cost well over $700 to replicate, and is close to a new gun as you could get without buying it new.

I'm happy to take additional pictures at your request or answer any questions.

 •May have low limits on payments, sometimes as low as $5,000 total (which may barely cover a lawyer's retainer fee).
 •Offer no coverage for bail, so you may have to pay this yourself or spend considerable time in jail.
 •Offer no reimbursement for lost wages, so you may find it difficult to pay bills while you're in court defending yourself.
 •May be a rider on another expensive policy you are forced to buy before you get any coverage.

Will sell or trade:   Rare Winchester tube-fed semi-auto .22 rifle. There are a few of these floating around, but not many. They made 210,000 Winchester model 77's in the 1950's and 60's, which is quite a few.. But only 10 percent of those were tube-fed...that's 21,000. This is one of those Tube-fed models. I saw one sell on GunBroker last week for $455.00.
This one is in very good condition...very good, and it functions perfect and has every modern feature. They stopped making the Model 77 in the 1960's.
It is grooved for mounting a scope. (same size groove that is on the Ruger 10/22 and all .22 rifles). It has fully adjustable iron sites also. The bolt is on the left side, which is one of the tell-tale model 77 characteristics. It functions flawless and looks great. It will shoot cheap bulk ammo as fast as you can pull the trigger without a hiccup. This is a collector's gun BUT, it is ready to be an everyday shooter also. It looks and feels better than a Ruger. It is a Winchester, back when they were the best. It's not overly heavy and it lacks nothing that a brand new .22 rifle has. You don't feel like your holding or looking at an old, outdated gun.. Model number is 160694"

Compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles. The eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of many full size scopes, but because of their short length they have to be mounted further back on the receiver to maintain proper eye relief. 

We have a Picatinny rail top mount for the Ruger 10/22 rifle that mounts further back on the receiver to accommodate mini-scopes in obtaining a full field of view. This four power scope, with it’s Range Finder reticle, can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

This mini-scope kit is an economical and functional accessory for Ruger 10/22 rifles and especially for the Ruger Take-Apart rifle as the scope does not need to be removed when the rifle is disassembled and stored.

The rifle we have up for auction today is a new in box, unfired (except at the factory) Colt model R6600DH. The Delta HBars are incredibly accurate due to their 20"" heavy barrels and the fact that they were hand picked at the test range because they shot better groupings than the other Colt AR's. This rifle has all the original Colt packaging and comes with the original aluminum carrying case. Bundled in the case is all the factory packaging, including the original sling, all the original colt paperwork, original mags, cleaning rods, Tasco scope paperwork, etc. When we say factory packaging, we mean all the way down to the factory cardboard plug that Colt placed in the barrels before shipping. Stored in a climate-controlled warehouse for over 20 years, this Delta HBar is a true treasure. Also, the gun in the photos may not be the exact gun that you receive.

Here is a detailed description of the shotgun from the Stoeger website:  http://www.stoegerindustries.com/firearms/stoeger-defense.php

The gun I have is the Stoeger P-350 Pistol Grip Home Defense shotgun. It is a 12 gauge pump shotgun. I have fired the gun once when I bought it to test it (worked perfectly) and it has been sitting in my closet since. It is in excellent shape except that in one of my moves, it slide down the wall in the closet and got some drywall scuff only on the barrel - but there are no metal scratches or dinks anywhere on the gun. You can probably polish off the drywall scuff.

The pistol grip version of this gun sells for about $350, I'm selling it for $285 with the ammo carrier on the butt and 10 rounds. I'm also down for trades and I'll pay the cash difference, the guns I'm interested in are Bersa Thunder Plus, Bersa Ultra Compact 9mm, Beretta 84FS Cheetah. 

In the attached pic, the shotgun is obviously the gun on top. The AR on the bottom was already sold.  I'm out of town until Sunday, July 28, but when I get back I can take more photos of the shotgun.

Only for face to face, I don't feel like shipping the gun.  If you're interested, message me."

It comes with one magazine (6 round capacity). So, one in the chamber and that equals 7 (6+1) total capacity. Yes, it has a safety. And, I'll throw in an IWB holster that fits it very well.

Unknown round count throughout it's lifetime. Hey, I fired it and it works. Yes, I cleaned it after that session. The barrel's rifling is nice (no pitts).

I'll also throw in ammo. A total of 145 rounds of 25 ACP. So, you can start your fun at the range w/o having to track down ammo. That's 50 rounds of Sellier & Bellot 50 gr FMJs and 95 rounds of UMC 50 gr FMJs.

If you're interested, call me at 503-875-seven seven six nine. Yes, it's a Portland phone number but, I'm actually a Vancouver, WA resident. So, no out of state sales and no sales to OR residents (unless you're w/in a reasonable distance and want to pay for the FFL fees in OR).

You can own it all for $160 cash. The ammo alone is close to $60 at retail. A quick and easy way to show me that you're a WA resident and NOT a ""prohibited person"" will be to show me your WA DL and WA CCW.

These are brand new sights. Purchased from Optics Planet in April.

These fit almost ANY 9mm or .357 Sig caliber pistols. .40 and .45 caliber Sig Pistols use a #8 rear and #6 front sight.

 They were installed on my Sig 2022 by Ingleside Gun Works in Macon. This is the second set of sights that Ingleside Gun Works broke trying to install for me along with some Tru Glo TFOs.

  So after returning my installation fee they are taking care of the RMA of both sets of sights. In my opinion they should have returned my full retail price but when I got to the shop today they gave me these and told me I was free to take them home. I guess 'you broke it you buy it' does not apply to them.

 I finally sent the pistol to Sig and had them install Sig Lights on it for about the same price as the sights and installation. So I am now stuck with these. All due to the incompetence of Ingleside Gun Works. 2 broken sets of sights in a row on the same gun makes me worry about anyone having real smithing work done at that shop. They are really nice guys but I will never have work done there again.

 So take your gun to Ingleside Gun Works at your own risk! Rant/over. 

 Ok so Now I have these sights. They have just come back from RMA and are in perfect condition. I paid $90 + shipping for them but I will part with them for $75. I would really prefer cash but will consider trade for 9mm, 10mm, 22 Magnum or 223/5.56.

This beautifully machined rifle has a synthetic stock, is very lightweight, has a removable single stack magazine, and a 3x9 Leupold scope. The trigger on this rifle, as with most Tikkas, is excellent, very crisp and accurate at long distances. 

A 7mm-08 is the .308 Winchester case necked down to accept 7 mm (.284) bullets with a small increase in case length. It has a flatter trajectory than the .308 Win. and .30-06 Springfield at similar bullet weights and is less affected by drag and crosswind while in flight. Its trajectory is comparable to the .270 Winchester.

rounds through it. Starting a Custom Mosin Nagant project and need to part with this rifle. The MVP is new 

from Mossberg and has been highly reviewed, has a lot of nice custom features for a mid-range rifle. Comes 

in original box with paperwork and 1 ten round magazine. I also have 2 (30) round MSAR poly mags to go 

with it and 132 loose rounds of ammo which is a mixture of wolf and Lake City 55 GR FMJ. I have a bipod 

attached also What makes this rifle unique is its ability to take any standard AR mag. Mossberg is the 

only one who offers this. Leupold scope and rings is not included with sale.

Low use and kept well.  

The CZ 52 pistol is a roller-locked short recoil-operated, detachable box magazine-fed, single-action, semi-automatic pistol chambered for the 7.62×25mm Tokarev cartridge (the gun was originally designed for 9 mm Luger caliber but due to political pressures had to be redesigned for the Soviet then standard pistol cartridge). It weighs approximately two pounds unloaded. Military models feature either a parkerized finish or a gray oxide coating, while some CZ 52s were arsenal reblued in the 1970s. These re-finished guns are usually marked as such.
The CZ 52 has a deep (front-to-back) but slim (side-to-side) grip, as well as a low ""hump"" which meets the web of the hand at the rear of the grip. These ergonomics cause the barrel and slide to sit rather high above the grip, resulting in very strong felt recoil. The CZ 52 is also well known for its very sharp report and great amount of muzzle flash. Due to its muzzle energy, higher pressure FMJ ammunition fired from the CZ 52 pistol will penetrate even NIJ II rated ballistic vests,[4] or the PASGT helmet.[5]

In the early 1930s, the Italian army was impressed by the Walther PP pistol. Beretta did not want to lose a big Italian military contract and designed the compact M1934 for the Italian army, which accepted it in 1937. The M1935 is simply an M1934, modified to fire .32ACP ammunition.

The M1935 is a single-action semi-automatic blowback pistol that fires the .32 ACP ammunition. It is made out of carbon steel with plastic grips. It is fitted with a manual safety and when the last shot has been fired the slide is retained open by the empty magazine. The magazine capacity is 8 rounds. As this pistol was built for the Italian army, all parts were interchangeable, which simplified maintenance and manufacturing: a first at the time.
