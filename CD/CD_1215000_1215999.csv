Here was a post that some ""friendly"" person within your gun community posted:

""just a friendly fyi, i know a couple cowboys who are a part of the chisolm trail club and they said if they catch anybody at the gunshow trying to double or triple their money on the .22lr 500 packs they are going to hand out some good old fashioned beatdowns! dont hassle me im just passing the wire!""

I can picture the front-page headline: ""Three Hospitalized After Violent Fight at Gun Show.""

Is this the image we want to project for our community? In case you weren't aware, the gun community is under greater fire than ever by the politicians, media, and other branches of the establishment. We need to change the perception of gun owners for the better, and starting fights at gun shows is not the solution, regardless of what you think about the so-called ""scalpers.""

I know this will get flagged as a ""scam"" by overzealous hotheads who have done this to other posts, but if you have had the chance to read this, please give it some thought. Thank you and be careful out there!"

Ok guys, it's been a fun ride, and maybe profitable for a few of you. But let's get back to reality, and sell used guns at used prices. And yes, for those with their head still in the sand, 
""When you walked out the door with your NEW gun, it automatically become USED"".
Works just like a car dealer, although the depreciation on your gun isn't as high as your car.

So I am looking for another gun, no I don't need YOUR choice of holsters and ammo, I will pick my own, so price your choices separately, it's doubtful, but possible, I may be interested in buying them.

I love the ads that say, ""I just want out of it what I paid"" . So that means because you were suckered into paying a high price, you now want me to do the same!"" Probably not going to happen.

So tell me what concealed carry gun you have, and a reasonable price. All reasonable emails will be answered."

Drop-in bolt and carrier group has a hard Nickel Boron self-lubricating surface that eliminates the need to apply oil or grease that can attract dirt, dust, unburned powder, and carbon and lead to cycling failures. Nickel Boron finish produces an exceptionally hard surface (68 Rockwell C) that’s 40% more wear resistant than chrome plating, with an ultra-low friction coefficient. Surface is actually harder than the substrate underneath and will not peel, flake, gall, or rub off.

Nickel Boron finish bolt/carrier groups have been tested to function reliably without additional lubrication up to 50,000 rounds. Reduced friction also means less heat generated by metal-on-metal contact, so the gun runs cooler and parts last longer. Easy to clean, too - fouling brushes right off.

Before treatment, parts are shot peened for surface uniformity and magnetic particle inspected to make sure there are no hidden flaws. Gas key is hardened to USGI specs, NiBore lined to resist erosion, and comes already staked to the carrier. Complete Bolt/Carrier Group comes fully assembled and ready to drop into any DPMS styled upper receiver.

INCLUDES:
Carrier with staked key & MIL-SPEC screws

Assembled Bolt (ejector, extractor, cam bolt, firing pin etc.)

Completely assembled and ready to put in your gun!

It’s in great working, mechanical and operating condition, with only minor wear/handling marks. I’ve only taken out of the safe to be shot 5-6 times, with no more than 200-300 rounds through it, it’s near mint condition.
I’ve only used new production/high quality non corrosive non lacquer coated/steel cased ammo. It’s super accurate, very gentle recoil and an absolute blast to shoot. I’ll include (2) 30 round PMags by MagPul.
The XCR isn’t well known, so I’ll give you a short list of improvements/benefits over that of an AK or AR platform.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Armament_XCR
Robust long stroke piston driven gas system like that of an AK. Shoot hundreds of rounds, clean the barrel and you are done. No more cleaning a filthy dirty receiver like on an AR.
5 position gas selector. No matter what kind of ammo, how hard you run the gun, with 5 settings you can be sure the gun will always cycle.
One piece aluminum extruded upper. It’s strong, light weight, full length quad rails, and very well built.
Ambidextrous bolt release. Release the bolt (last shot hold open) with your trigger finger with ease.
Non reciprocating left side charging handle. Manipulate the rifle without ever losing your sight picture.
Multi cal. With a simple allen wrench, you can change the gun to shoot a wide range of ammo in under a minute! You can currently shoot .223/5.56X45 NATO, 6.5 Grendel, 6.8 Rem, 300 Blackout and the ever popular and cost effective 7.62X39 rounds!
Folding stock. Because the recoil spring is inside the piston (like an AK) the stock is foldable, that’s impossible for an AR to accomplish.
Free floated barrel. Because of the one piece extruded aluminum upper, the barrel is 100% free floated for superb accuracy.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:En-XCR_stripped.PNG
This is a very simple, robust, and well designed 12st century battle rifle, capable of adapting to various calibers as needed. 
I also have a 7.62X39 caliber conversion kit available for sale for an additional $600.00, and that come with (2) 30 round magazines as well.
Before all the craziness these were selling for $2200.00 all day long. So I’m going to ask for $2500.00 OBO.
You can email, call or text. sixonesixeighteight6one52three.

Buy 3000 rounds (under $600 total!) and the rifle pays for itself and is basically free, it would cost you $1500-$1600 more to buy the same amount of 5.56 ammo and 5.45 is arguably a better round. It has even lighter recoil with same or better ballistics and velocity as 5.56 but tumbles on impact to produce some very devastating wounds. Wideners has 1080 round cans in stock right now for $180 but it can still be had for as little as $160 per 1080 rounds. Shoot 4 times as many rounds as your buddies for the same cost. For those of you that are not familiar with the AK74 or 5.45x39 caliber ammunition, see below for an interesting read. 

For sale is one brand new Spikes Tactical limited production run complete 5.45x39 caliber 16"" upper receiver group with the latest in corrosion resistant finishes, mated to a brand new Palmetto Sate Armory complete forged alloy lower receiver with 6 position collapsable buttstock. It has never been fired, and has a nice trigger pull. This Corrosion Resistant Upper features a Melonite finish inside and out, a top quality Lothar Walther Barrel ($375) with Nickel Boron (NiB) treated M4 Extension, Nickel Boron treated 5.45x39 caliber bolt, Melonite coated F-marked FSB, Melonite coated Gas Tube, Stainless Roll Pin, and Melonite coated A2 Flash Hider. Built to handle the dirtiest surplus ammo with no ill effects and still be a breeze to clean. I saw one review of this rifle saying the guy fired 7500 rounds of corrosive surplus ammo over the course of 1 year without ever cleaning the rifle, and had no corrosion at all.

During the 1960's the Soviet military made the decision to convert their assault weapons from 7.62mm to a reduced caliber of higher velocity. This was based in part on studies of the American made M-16 during the Vietnam conflict. They felt that the United States may know something they didn't and decided to follow their example. This did not sit well with Mikhail Kalashnikov who felt that the M-43 7.62x39 cartridge was sufficient for all modern battlefield needs. Even so he began work on a new weapon to chamber the smaller cartridge.
The task of designing the cartridge fell to a group led by Viktor Sabelnikov. Other prominent designers on the team were Lidiya Bulavskaya, Boris Semin, Mikhail Fedorov, Petr Sazonov, and Petr Korolev. Their task was to develop a 5.45mm low impulse cartridge that would be more accurate than the cartridge currently used in the AKM assault rifles.
The result was a small caliber bullet of very high velocity. The bullet also has good sectional density and a fairly flat trajectory. Despite being lighter in weight than its predecessor, the 5.45mm cartridge retained the same lethality as the older round. It can penetrate a 5mm steel sheet at 350 meters, not bad for a 53 grain bullet.
Another feature that contributes to the lethality of the cartridge is that it becomes unstable when it strikes an object. This means that although it flies perfectly well through the air, it tumbles violently after striking a target - creating a larger wound channel when compared to a normal bullet. This was accomplished by leaving a hollow space at the front of the bullet which makes the round imbalanced on impact with flesh or wood.

REVIEW (of current batch of this surplus ammo, from Wideners website): This caliber is just great fun to shoot. We tested it in a Romanian rifle with eight 30 round magazines. Recoil is SO LIGHT and it functioned 100% of the time. No malfuntions at all. Overall, this is SUPER GOOD SURPLUS."

If your smart... and want one of these usless caliber AR's....., go to Acadamy on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. That is when they get their truck and put them out. Thats where these on armslist come from! Then they charge you twice or three times the actual price. Hint Hint.

I just don't shoot it very much and am looking to sell it. It has been put together with only the best parts from the best companies and has never failed anytime I have fired it.  I have shot it just enough to break everything in and get it sighted in. (About 500 rounds) I used and LRB Arms stripped lower as a base. (LRB makes lowers for Doublestar too)  Following are the parts I used to build it after that:  Daniel Defense Lower Parts Kit, Palmetto State Armory Complete Carbine length gas system upper with 1:7 twist, chrome lined barrel.  The Bolt Carrier Group is HPI tested and magnetic particle inspected and the gas key is staked properly.  All parts used for the build are mil-spec.  The rifle features a Magpul forend, Magpul Vertical Foregrip, Magpul Moe Grip, Magpul Moe Stock, and Magpul Mbus rear folding sight.  The VFG and Mbus are OD green.  The rifle also has a Troy VTAC padded sling in foliage green.  The rifle is always kept clean and cleaned once a month when not being used and lubed with CLP to keep all parts like new.  You not only get the rifle, but 3 Pmags (2 in OD and 1 in black), 300 rounds of assorted ammo which is mostly M855, but also XM193, Silver Bear, Federal V-shock, and Remington UMC.  Also included is a Primary Arms Black Rifle case that has external storage for 6 magazines.  This is a nice rifle and a great package for anyone looking for a AR-15.  I am asking $2100 OBO for everything.  If you are interested, make an offer.  I am not going to get mad at someone making an offer.  Just serious offers only.  I wouldn't waste your time and I would hope you wouldn't waste mine.  I live on Fort Carson and am willing to meet in the surrounding area.  You can text me at REDACTED or email me at REDACTED for interest.  Thank you for taking time to read my listing.
