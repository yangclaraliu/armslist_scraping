38,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8244038,For Sale:  NOVAK TRITIUM BAR ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS FOR 1911 LOWMOUNT,"northport, Florida, United States",$ 75,"Listed On: Tuesday, April 17, 2018",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"new unusedThe new uniquely designed and patented (US patent #9,714,811) adjustable sight for use in the Novak LoMount® 1911 .495” x 65° rear dovetail cut. This sight is modeled after its original fixed Novak LoMount counterpart to emulate all of its industry leading and benchmark benefits, but now adding the capability of screw adjustment for elevation and drift adjustment for windage. This design was purposefully engineered to greatly enhance the strength, durability, and reliability of the adjustable type sights. The probability of failures due to component fragility and fatigue is virtually eliminated by this state of the art design.  This new LMA series adjustable sight is a direct replacement for the current Novak LoMount 1911 fixed sight and it uses the same front sight height as its fixed counterpart. This simplifies changing to an adjustable sight by removing the need for a different height front sight to match up unlike all of today’s current adjustable rear sights.  One of the major additional benefits of the new adjustable is the ability to correct point of aim/point of impact issues due to changes in various ammunition types or factory pistols that have a minor lockup issues. This added benefit reduces the costs and stress of changing both front and rear sights just by replacing the rear sight only. The return of the tritium bar rear in the LMA04 variant is one of the fastest, less confusing sight pictures available. The opposing shapes of the front dot with the horizontal bar rear is a preconditioned response for anyone that has signed their name on a line. The method in which the tritium bar is installed is also a part of the new patented design. All of the same exceptional traits and extreme durability of the fixed Novak LoMount rear sight is now available in the ultimate adjustable format.MSRP FOR 119.29"

However, I like to cycle through firearms but cannot afford to keep buying and not selling, so I'm letting this one go. Has roughly 250-300 rounds down the barrel, and cleaned after each range session. I shot Malaysian surplus 7.62 NATO through it which burns clean and is non-corrosive. I had a scope on it, but found it to be more fun without the scope and just blasting rounds out with the iron sights. I will sell with or without the scope, which is a Nikon P-308 with Vortex medium-height rings. Add $200 for the scope, or $225 for scope + rings. I do have another .308 rifle, but I only shoot match ammo through it, so I can sell you the remainder of my Malaysian surplus for a good price - I think I have roughly 250 or so rounds left (I'll update the listing once I do a count). The rifle will come with the original box and all accessories.Will sell to VA resident only and MUST have ID + CCW license. Can meet anywhere in Winchester or Manassas areas.

More photos soon. Watch for more high-end firearms I'll be listing for auction in coming weeks - Colts, Winchesters and more! Here's one for the Winchester collectors - very popular these days, very collectible and who knows what the future holds. Got money in the stock market? Time to bail and invest in something that you can hold in your hand. Here's a Winchester 1890 Deluxe, in a beautiful case-colored finish! I have obtained some very interesting info on this one. Restored 27 years ago by Guns Unlimited - ""World's Finest Custom Gun Work"" - which was owned by none other than Thomas Haas of the Ponderosa Ranch in Spencer Indiana! The name may ring a bell as his work is pictured in The Book of Colt Engraving. Haas and Horacio Acevedo are famous for the exact copy of the ""Sultan of Turkey"" Colt Dragoon. The original Sultan was given to ""His Highness the Sultan of Turkey"" by none other than Sam Colt! The Dragoons are pictured in the colt book side by side and they are a beautiful pair. The original resides in the Metropolitan Museum the copy was featured in the collection of Buddy Hackett. Hass was famous for the custom Patersons he built, along with 25 or so Colt Walkers and the many Colt Single Actions he converted to 22lr. When Colt was unable to finish 1,000 Texas Ranger Commemoratives for the 150th celebration of the Texas Rangers, Haas completed them, and probably saved Colt from an expensive lawsuit. As an advisor on many western movie sets, he became friends with several Hollywood types, including Elvis, Lash LaRue, Dale Robertson, and Mel Torme. He was also a technical advisor to Gary Cooper, Burt Lancaster, Vera Cruz, Victor Mature, and many others. This particular rifle was at his shop for over four years and an apologetic letter from the shop verifies this. Sadly, he passed away 13 years ago. Truly a rare piece with a colorful story behind it and worthy of any collection! Features a gorgeous high grade walnut pistol grip stock with fantastic figure and excellent checkering. Beautifully colored crescent butt plate, along with the lower tang and hammer. The pistol grip cap is mounted with an engraved screw. The case-colored receiver is excellent, tastefully done, not the bold phony colors sometimes seen. The 24"" barrel appears to be lined and has the Winchester patent dates and address as shown. The front sight is an ivory bead when down and a globe sight when raised. The barrel has a two leaf sight and the rear tang sports a Lyman marked sight. The sights alone were very pricey. I'm sure you know that original deluxe 1890 rifles can run upwards of five figures and are very seldom seen for sale. This is a fantastic quality Winchester that isn't often found in a deluxe version and you'll have the best looking one in town, restored by a master! The documentation will be included. Add it to your collection or take it out and shoot it! See my feedback - my descriptions are honest. If you don't like it, you're welcome to send it back for a refund - but you'll be pleased. Feel free to ask questions and I'll respond as soon as I can. Add $99 for careful packaging and shipping. Payment by postal money order is preferred and ships the quickest, but I will accept a wire transfer or major bank cashiers check - allow a couple of days for it to clear my bank. Cash price listed - credit cards accepted by PHONE ONLY but you will lose the 3% discount shown here. SORRY - NO LAYAWAY AND NO PAYPAL. NO PERSONAL CHECKS - if you send one, it will be returned and your rights to the auction forfeited. Please pay within 5 days. FFL is required. It's your responsibility to have your transfer dealer arranged and to make sure the FFL gets to me. I can accept a faxed or emailed FFL copy or one included with the payment. If I have to make repeated phone calls to obtain the FFL copy, it will delay shipment of your gun. The Gunbroker auction number and your name must accompany the FFL copy. All of my contact info is available on the Gunbroker auction page at the end of the auction. Three day non-firing non-disassembly inspection from the time it's delivered to your FFL to insure my honest description - you won't be disappointed! ANY DISASSEMBLY OF THE CYLINDER/SLIDE, GRIPS, ETC. AND THE GUN IS YOURS - WITH NO RETURN. In the unlikely event of a return, you'll pay all shipping. Must be returned in the same original condition. Check my feedback - I only sell quality guns. Listed as used per Gunbroker rules as it was previously sold. This is for sale locally so I reserve the right to end the auction early if there are no bids - so bid early. CHECK MY OTHER AUCTIONS FOR MORE NICE FIREARMS!"
