This ammunition is top quality M80 ammo. Please note that it has the NATO headstamp which means something. That is a exclusive club that means that the arsenal has passed some tough tests and the ammo is good to go. This ammo has ""staked"" primers that have the advantage of a crimped primer, but are much easier to reload. This ammo is boxer non-corrosive primed and EXTREMEMLY clean when fired. Tests show this ammo to be extremely accurate and function perfectly in semi and full auto military rifles. AND IT HAS A COPPER JACKETED BULLET. NO STEEL ANYWHERE IN THIS AMMO."

The 500AB is the 500A Mossberg shotgun with some upgrades...specifically a Walnut stock VS the various hardwood stocks found on the regular 500A model. This 500AB also has some metal etchings ,as seen in 1 photo, that the 500A doesnt have ...and it has a 30"" barrel. (Every part on this 500AB is interchangeable with the regular 500A)
This is a fixed full choke 30"" barreled shotgun. 30 inches is a long range shotgun. Perfect for Deer and Water Fowl...and predators of any nature. You get the 75-100 yard reach of a rifle, with the spread pattern of a shotgun. Full choke means it keeps it's shot pattern tight over a long distance, so you get killing/stopping power at rifle like distances. It shoots bird and buck shot...and rifled slugs. It is chambered for 2 and 3/4"" and 3.00"" shells. It functions flawlessly and it looks good. The bore is beautiful inside...slick as a whistle. It also has a metal safety switch, not a plastic one like the newer Mossbergs. It has a Tasco Red Dot scope, a good one, that enables quick sholdering and accurate firing of shotgun. For those folks who don't know what a Red Dot scope is: You turn the switch on and the red dot is displayed in the scope lens...when you look thru the scope, wherever the dot is - is where the bullet goes. If you move your head, the red dot stays on the target your pointing at and you can still see the dot as you move your head around. It makes for very quick and accurate shooting). I love this shotgun, and the new owner will too. I will trade this gun for a firearm other than a 12 gauge shotgun....of equal value."

If you can't find a Bolt Carrier Group since they are nearly $400 everywhere, this is a much smarter idea to get practice in, get quality trigger time, and get used to your AR15. Order a BCG, and wait for it to come in, all the while shooting .22LR through your AR15 and getting quality training in while you wait.

Everyone knows by now that no one is selling lowers for $50.00. 
 Please send offers and I will respond if I am interested. If I do not respond, that means I am probably not interested in your offer. I will remove the listing as soon as they are sold so if it's still up I still have at least one left.
I will also be listing a couple upper receivers in the same way if interested."

620,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1025620,"For Sale:  Omega Speedmaster MK40 3520.53 all boxes, papers complete","mentor/lake county area, Cleveland, Ohio","$ 1,800","Listed On: Thursday, May 16, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is my Omega Speedmaster MK40. The reference number from Omega is 3520.53

It was well known as being one of the first watches to be featured as part of ""Michael Schumacher's Choice"" series of watches.

It has been discontinued for a few years and is rapidly becoming more and more rare every day. Watches in good condition with all boxes and paperwork are almost non-existent.

It has many complications (complications, meaning functions like calendar, chrono, etc), all working without issues.

To read a bit more about the watch itself, here is the link for Omega's website: http://www.omegawatches.com/gents/speedmaster/day-date/35205300

My specific watch does have some pretty minor swirls and tiny scratches but is otherwise in excellent condition. I believe it was made around 2001, I purchased it just a couple years ago... and it was serviced by the jeweler who works with my broker. I unfortunately was not given any documentation as he did it as a favor to me, but the work was done and the watch has always run flawlessly.

I have all boxes and paperwork that I know of (what you see in the pictures is what you get: outer white box, red box, red docs holder for warranty and manuals, manuals, warranty card) as well as a spare link and pin (there might be more than that, I'll have to double check).
The red box and red paperwork holder is a bit worn, which seems to happen to all older omega red boxes. You should be able to see it in the pictures. I have much larger pictures I can email you.

If you have any questions, please email me, and we can arrange to talk on the phone or meet in person.

The price is $1800 with just a bit of room to negotiate (cash talks, as they say). The price is lower than what the watches are going for on ebay that are complete with boxes and paperwork and is in good cosmetic and excellent mechanical condition (feel free to check ebay's completed or current listings for similar watches). Complete sets like these go for 2200-2400 on ebay, but I don't want to deal with the crazy number of scammers and fees. NO TRADES at this time.

Thanks for looking!"

http://www.bravocompanyusa.com/LMT-10-5-M4-Carbine-Upper-Receiver-Group-p/lmt%2010.5%20urg.htm

Made by Lewis Machine and Tool (LMT). These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups come in the PreBan (No Ban) configuration only, including bayonet lug, threaded barrel and A2 flash hider. These uppers are assembled, headspaced, and test fired. These do not include bolt carrier groups. These do not include charging handles. 

Please Note: 
LMT's branded product line was developed primarily for the US Government / Professional Market. The civilian market is a secondary benefactor to this program. As such the QC standards and priorities (and features) are very different than that of a commercial market AR15 manufacturer. To the very overwhelming majority of shooters, this is a huge plus in the LMT column. It makes their product and extremely attractive option for a civilian shooter looking for a higher standard of product.

With the primary focus being a quality standard for GI sales, there are some noteworthy differences in the product as you receive it. Specific to the LMT Upper Groups, they ALL come extensively test fired from the factory. As such, every single real LMT Upper Group on the market will have significant brass, significant carbon, and handling marks on the group. Regarding the utility of the Upper Group (everything LMT builds is focused on utility); this is a very very good thing.

HOUSE BILL 1588
_____________________________________________
State of Washington 63rd Legislature 2013 Regular Session
By Representatives Pedersen, Hope, Jinkins, Hansen, Freeman, Kagi,
Walsh, Carlyle, Hunter, Clibborn, Ormsby, Cody, Green, Stanford,
Orwall, Maxwell, Liias, Pettigrew, Tharinger, Springer, Hudgins,
Wylie, Moeller, Fitzgibbon, Ryu, Roberts, Goodman, Riccelli, Farrell,
Fey, Appleton, Pollet, Habib, Bergquist, Moscoso, Santos, Reykdal, and
Hunt
Read first time 01/31/13. Referred to Committee on Judiciary.
1 AN ACT Relating to requiring universal background checks for
2 firearms transfers; amending RCW 9.41.080; creating a new section; and
3 prescribing penalties.
4 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:
5 NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. The legislature finds that there is broad
6 consensus that certain people, such as felons, minors, and
7 involuntarily committed persons, should not be eligible to possess
8 firearms for public safety reasons. Background checks are an effective
9 and easy mechanism to ensure that firearms are not sold to those who
10 are prohibited from possessing them. However, because background check
11 requirements apply only to transfers by licensed firearms dealers, many
12 firearms are currently sold without a background check, allowing felons
13 and other ineligible persons to gain access to them. The legislature
14 intends by this act to strengthen our background check system by
15 broadening the requirement for a background check to apply to all
16 firearms sales in the state.
17 Sec. 2. RCW 9.41.080 and 1994 sp.s. c 7 s 409 are each amended to
18 read as follows:
p. 1 HB 1588
1 (1) No person may deliver a firearm to any person whom he or she
2 has reasonable cause to believe is ineligible under ((RCW 9.41.040))
3 state or federal law to possess a firearm. Any person violating this
4 ((section)) subsection is guilty of a class C felony, punishable under
5 chapter 9A.20 RCW.
6 (2)(a) No unlicensed person may sell a firearm to another
7 unlicensed person unless the purchaser has undergone a background check
8 in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (2) and the
9 purchaser is not ineligible to possess a firearm under state or federal
10 law.
11 (b) A seller of a firearm to an unlicensed person shall request a
12 background check of the purchaser or transferee from a dealer or from
13 the chief of police or the sheriff of the jurisdiction in which the
14 seller or the purchaser resides. The background check shall include a
15 check of the national criminal instant background check system.
16 (c) The purchaser must complete an application to transfer a
17 firearm. The application shall be provided to the dealer or the chief
18 of police or sheriff conducting the background check.
19 (d) The department of licensing shall create and make available an
20 application to transfer a firearm for use by unlicensed persons engaged
21 in the sale or purchase of a firearm. The application shall include
22 the information required under RCW 9.41.090 for an application to
23 purchase a pistol from a dealer, and any other information the
24 department of licensing determines is appropriate.
25 (e) A dealer or a chief of police or sheriff who conducts a
26 background check for an unlicensed person under this subsection (2)
27 must indicate on the application whether the purchaser is eligible or
28 ineligible to possess a firearm under state and federal law based on
29 the results of the background check. A dealer or a chief of police or
30 sheriff may charge a fee for conducting the background check in an
31 amount not to exceed twenty dollars, plus any charges imposed by the
32 federal bureau of investigation.
33 (f) A person who sells a firearm to an unlicensed person in
34 violation of this subsection (2) is guilty of a gross misdemeanor
35 punishable under chapter 9A.20 RCW.
36 (g) For the purposes of this subsection (2), ""unlicensed person""
37 means any person who is not licensed as a dealer under this chapter.
HB 1588 p. 2
1 (h) This subsection (2) does not apply to the sale of an antique
2 firearm.
3 (i) This subsection (2) does not apply to, and is not intended to
4 alter the requirements of this chapter that apply to, the sale of a
5 firearm by a dealer licensed under this chapter.

Since this one is evidently harder to find, I'm offering it. Under 100 rounds through it with 90% being 38+P's. Very clean, includes PC box and key.

**I got a couple of stupid offers or comments regarding my price but when I see $50+ bricks of 22 ammo and MAK90's for $8-1200, I just have to laugh. This stainless S&W snubby is worth more to me than any AR15 for REAL LIFE USE.**"

Green just got good™. Crimson Trace presents the MVF-515 Green; a revolutionary, patent-pending concept that combines three tactical tools for your AR style rifle into a single modular package. With a rock-solid 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum hard-anodized tang as the foundation of the foregrip, the unit also features a green laser sight and a 150/200-Lumen LED light module. The MVF-515 Green leverages advanced technology to ensure long battery life and rugged durability through a wider range of conditions than consumer grade green lasers. Hot or cold, light or dark, the MVF-515 Green readily provides the most complete sighting and target identification system available anywhere. The laser and light are instinctively activated as you hold the weapon, and activation switches are ambidextrous. This allows operators to select the light or the laser individually or simultaneously. Both laser and light functions are programmable with three illumination modes to select from including: independent momentary, strobe or constant beam. A master on/off switch permits complete shutdown of either laser or light. Being a modular unit, users may separately purchase a red laser module for direct replacement.
