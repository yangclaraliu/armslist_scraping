This particular pistol has matching numbers and in excellent mechanical condition and decent cosmetic condition. The frame and slide has some holster wear and some small cosmetic wear as this was issued for duty in Italian police and military forces throughout the 70s and 80s. The original magazine works perfectly and has no issues locking the slide open (some older 92s mags have an issue with weak springs). This pistol has some expensive new imported wooden grips installed. Its very difficult to find fitting grips for this pistol. There are a few differences from its younger sibling the 92fs. Notice the European heel mag release instead of the standard mag release. Also the magazines have a small cutout near the bottom to properly lock in this pistol. The good news is that most official Beretta 92fs magazines still come with this notch.This pistol comes with a soft pistol case, the original 15 round Italian Magazine, a new 17 round promag brand magazine, the original plastic grips with the original screws.I recently found the period correct military holster with the belt. I added a picture for reference.If ad is still up I still have the pistol."

The South Korean license for Daewoo to produce the Colt M16 expired in 1984. Also, the Koreans were expressly prohibited from exporting/selling license built Colts. To alleviate that, the South Koreans initiated the XB rifle program in 1972 to develop a Korean designed and built successor. The result in 1983 was the adoption of the Daewoo K2 5.56mm assault rifle. It is still their standard military issued rifle today. Daewoo exported a few semi-auto versions of the rifle both before the 1989 Bush import ban and after. This Max II is one of the preban import guns featuring their unique long stroke gas piston/recoil spring setup (similar to an AK) and FAL style gas plug and hinged upper. It features a side folding stock. It is chambered in 5.56mm with a 1/7 twist barrel and uses M16/AR15 magazines. This rifle is one of those preban guns imported by Stoeger (post-ban guns were imported by Kimber and cannot take the side folding stock). My price is $1500. I'm looking to sell because I keep buying too many Colt and S&W pre-1982 revolvers. If you have some of those that I don't have (or a 1970's Colt Combat Commander) we might talk trades. This rifle will come with the sling and a USGI Adventure Line Vietnam era 20 round mag.I need to do a FTF in the North Dallas area (I am in Plano).

Ive only fired 30-40 rounds from it. Its an amazing rifle. The only reason im selling it is because I just decided to liquidate my armory. Im moving to California and its going to be a pain going through their processes.The gun configured for left handed shooters. However as a lefthanded shooter, I noticed how great a right handed rifle worked for me. So although its confirgured for leftys, its still a user friendly rifle. Im asking $750 for the rifle. It will come with some ammo, scope, and high scope mounts (clearing the way for iron sights). This is really nice because you have the option of using the scope or the iron sights at any moment. The gun is very accurate and holds close groups. I am very happy with it. Im selling a custom AR-15 as well.I intend to sell this to someone who is of good character. Will not entertain suspiscious buyers.Feel free to call or text (preferred) (2...........0..........2).......8.....2.......1.............55...67"

The A-Post gasblock was then PROFESSIONALLY replaced with an Odin works low-profile gasblock and a 15” MLOK Troy Alpha Battle Rail system was put on as well as a Primary Arms FSC Compensator/Flash Suppressor Combo. I kept the original Ruger Flip-up rear sight and added an MBUS flip-up front sight for back ups. Also on the rifle is a Vortex Strikefire II red/green dot sight which I have the original box for and it has an Unlimited Lifetime warranty from the company. There is also a Daniel defense fore-grip on the rail. I replaced the original BCG with a heavy M16 full auto rated BCG for reliability as well as an H2 BUFFER. ALL ORIGINAL PARTS INCLUDED WITH FIREARM. I have all the original parts an extra bolt carrier and even a carbine length magpul hand guard that I am throwing in with the rifle. I also am including 2-30rd pmags (3 if I can find the other), a hard case that locks with two sets of keys, the original box (if desired), a magpul D-60 60rd drum magazine and a full cleaning kit with a .223 bore snake (used of course).

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The Walther P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from their centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns ...and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art. Comes with threaded barrel and forward compensator for a full 5"" target model barrel, as well as the Walther carrying case.          SPECIFICATIONS   Finish Black   Type Semi-Automatic   Action Double/Single   Caliber 22 Long Rifle   Barrel Length 5""   Capacity 10 + 1   Safety Ambidextrous   Sights 3-Dot   Weight 1.3 lbs"
