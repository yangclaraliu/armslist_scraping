All current models of the SPR come in one of a variety of McMillan synthetic stocks. The earliest rifles were shipped in the H-S Precision aluminum chassis fiberglass version of the Winchester Marksman stock. While these ""First Generation"" rifles were simply dropped into the aluminum bedding blocks of the H-S Precision stock, the later guns are all glass bedded by hand. FN Special Police Rifles of all iterations are noted for being both very accurate (.5 MOA or somewhat less is not uncommon) and very low maintenance, featuring Parkerized metal finish, synthetic stocks, and a chrome lined bore in the barrel. A chrome lined bore offers a more durable, more corrosion resistant, and easier to clean barrel for the end user to maintain and is rarely found on precision bolt action sniper rifles. The barrels of the ""First Generation"" rifles were said to be made from the hammer-forged blanks used for M240 General Purpose Machine Gun production at the FN Manufacturing Inc. plant in Columbia, South Carolina. Later barrels are said to be from hammer-forged blanks intended exclusively for FN Special Police Rifle production"

Much of what they do is called journalism and reporting by making a sensation of an
activity.  Let us conduct our gun transactions honestly with nothing to hide.  Let us do
this and conduct our demeanor in such a way that any normal business transaction would
take place.  Pretty boring stuff to most people.  Let's not give them fuel for the fire by
becoming angry or beligerant.  

Gun Owners:  We don't need to pick a fight with the media.  Let's treat them with respect
even if they don't treat us with the same.  In other words if we conduct ourselves in a
proper manner the truth will be known that we all aren't a bunch of radicals, but are in
fact law-abiding, and peace-loving individuals that are not fearful of free speech."

A Matt who is a salesman at Indy Trading Post here in Indy, replies to my ad & says they have 1 in stock.

So I go to their website to see a price & it's listed @ $1,044.00  (go to shop online, it's the last link on their page)
So I call, excited to finally find this gun at the price I wanted to pay, Matt then tells me the gun is $1,299.00!!  I asked Matt why the website says $1,044.00 & he suggested I call back & talk to the owner after 6pm tonight....so I did.  Matt states the gun costs was $1,000.00 & they like to make at least $150.00 on a gun of this quality & shoots me a price of $1150.00.  So again I question the advertised price VS what I am being quoted & he said he would talk to the owner & I should call tonight.

so I call at 6:30, guy that answered the phone, puts me on hold after I explain the story to him & he tells me he spoke to the owner & the price of the gun is $1299.00, I then question him & ask him why they have it advertised at $1044 & the guy tells me they dont list prices on the website (which I have it printed out)  he then proceeds to tell me it's an error.
I then ask him if they'd be willing to work with me on a price between what was advertised online VS what the tell me on the phone of $1299.00 & I was told NOPE.  IT's $1299.00 & that's that.
The guy then proceeds to tell me it must be another gun...I mean comon a BNIB COlt Defender is exactly the same as another BNIB Colt Defender.

Absolutely BAD business.....  horrible that they wouldnt even try to negotiate a price...nothing but a ""sorry""...

Not sure how long this post will stay active before it get's marked as spam...but jsut thought I'd do my part in spreading the word on HOW some local dealers operate.
Not to mention the fact that a BNIB Defender can be found on Gunbroker, gunsamerica...etc for less than $1100.00   just pisses me off!!!

I have made a list of fair prices, even considering the current market climate, so that people can be educated on what things retail for if you have a small amount of patience. 

If you see something grossly overpriced, please flag it as overpriced. There is a flag option of every post, just mark overpriced items and move on so we can get some sense of normalcy back 5 months after the run up on guns and ammo started. 
I understand some things command a SMALL premium since they are hard to find, but double and triple price is not reasonable, and we need to work together to flag these people away.

The list:	
POPULAR AMMO:
5.56/.223 Ammo: 
30-35 cents per round for steel case
40 cents per round for bulk brass FMJ
50-60 cents per round for hunting stuff	

9mm Ammo:
30-40 cents per round for steel case and bulk brass FMJ
40-60 cents per round for normal hollow points

.22LR rimfire ammo
.04 to .06 a round for bulk lead and lead hollow points
.08 cents per round for CCI and quality stuff

The reality is if you are patient and put a little time into it, you can get most ammo types for .30-.50 cents a round. Some Hollow points and carry ammo do go for more. 

POPULAR GUNS:
AR-15’s and M-4’s: 800-1200 dollars is MSRP on most models.

AR-10’s. You can find these for 1200-1400 dollars retail easily.

Mini 14- 800-1100 depending on the model

Glocks: 500-625 depending on the model. Do not pay more than this for any glock. 

Mossberg 500: Most models sell for right at $350-400. I wouldn’t pay more than this.

10/22: These sell for anywhere from $220-270 depending on the stock and barrel, new in box. Be patient and flag 400 dollar ones on here. They are grossly overpriced. 

1911: These can go from as low as 400 to as high as 2000, so BE SURE and RESEARCH the model before you buy. 

Please feel free to repost this in other towns/areas if you want, and spread the word. If you are sick of seeing 800 dollar Assault Rifles selling for 2000, and 1200 dollar AR-10’s for 2500, please TAKE ACTION!!!! FLAG PEOPLE AS OVERPRICED! Feel free to send them a message letting them know how overpriced they are as well. They are ruining local gun communities."

I am selling my long distance/hunting rifle with scope and bipod along with the gun case and 23 rounds of ammunition. 

For sale:
One Savage Model 16 chambered in .300 Winchester Short Magnum. 

Attached are the following two accessories:

1) Black Caldwell XLA Fixed Bipod. See the picture bellow, it is attached to the rifle, but can be folded back when not in use and extends in reasonable increments for when you need more or less elevation. Can be removed if you want to take it off. (http://www.battenfeldtechnologies.com/caldwell/catalog.asp?family=xla-bipods) 

2) Tasco world Class 4-16X50 scope. (http://www.tactical-store.com/ts-to-rs-dwc416x50.html)

Also Provided:
1) One box of 20 Winchester Supreme .300 WSM rounds (see box in picture)
2) Three rounds of .300 WSM. I used them about 6 months ago and had 3 left over, but do not remember the brand. 
3) One nylon black carrying case.
4) One cleaning kit for a .300 WSM (punch rod, ect).

The only issue with the weapon is minor cosmetic damage to the outside of the barrel (some of the silver was darkened). I purchased it that way and had it checked by an armorer. He said that it would not affect the weapons functionality.

I am not a FFL, but I will insist on seeing a Virginia drivers license with your name and face on it as well as a verbal acknowledgement that you are legally allowed to purchase and own a firearm. We will fill out a copy of a ""Record of Firearms Transfer Between Unlicensed Persons"" agreement for our records to cover both of us. http://www.beararms.com/PDF/FTUP.pdf

And to all you people who think people like me are somehow buying this ammo for 2010 prices and getting 2-3x what we paid for it...you are dead wrong. None of us like high ammo prices and my prices are very fair. I put in a lot of effort to find ammo at a decent price and bring it into Indy and you demonize me for making a few cents per round. I put my thousands of dollars of my money at risk by taking an inventory position that could instantly lose value...what...do you expect me to take a loss selling you ammo that you can't find on the shelves ANYWHERE? Haters get a grip!

Businesses isn't built on haters, it's built on people who risk their own resources and reputation to bring a service to others.

I have made a list of fair prices, even considering the current market climate, so that people can be educated on what things retail for if you have a small amount of patience. 
If you see something grossly overpriced, please flag it as overpriced. There is a flag option of every post, just mark overpriced items and move on so we can get some sense of normalcy back 5 months after the run up on guns and ammo started. 
I understand some things command a SMALL premium since they are hard to find, but double and triple price is not reasonable, and we need to work together to flag these people away.
The list:	
POPULAR AMMO:
5.56/.223 Ammo: 
30-35 cents per round for steel case
40 cents per round for bulk brass FMJ
50-60 cents per round for hunting stuff	

9mm Ammo:
30-40 cents per round for steel case and bulk brass FMJ
40-60 cents per round for normal hollow points

.22LR rimfire ammo
.04 to .06 a round for bulk lead and lead hollow points
.08 cents per round for CCI and quality stuff
The reality is if you are patient and put a little time into it, you can get most ammo types for .30-.50 cents a round. Some Hollow points and carry ammo do go for more. 

POPULAR GUNS:
AR-15’s and M-4’s: 800-1200 dollars is MSRP on most models. DPMS, Bushmaster, Doublestar, colt etc rarely break the 1200 mark retail. 
AR-10’s. You can find these for 1200-1400 dollars retail easily from BUDS, they come in stock once a week or two. 
Mini 14- 800-1100 depending on the model
Glocks: 500-625 depending on the model. Do not pay more than this for any glock. 
Mossberg 500: Most models sell for right at $350-400. I wouldn’t pay more than this. 
10/22: These sell for anywhere from $220-270 depending on the stock and barrel, new in box. Be patient and flag 400 dollar ones on here. They are grossly overpriced. 
1911: These can go from as low as 400 to as high as 2000, so BE SURE and RESEARCH the model before you buy.

Please feel free to repost this in other towns/areas if you want, and spread the word. If you are sick of seeing 800 dollar Assault Rifles selling for 2000 and 1200 dollar AR-10’s for 2500, please TAKE ACTION!!!! FLAG PEOPLE AS OVERPRICED! Feel free to send them a message letting them know how overpriced they are as well. They are ruining local gun communities."

Troy Battle Mags are very similiar to P-Mags, with a few exceptions. A lot of people think they are superior to P-Mags for some or all of these reasons. 
1. Much better tactile surface (aka they are much easier to handle, especially in wet or cold conditions).
2. Feel and sound much more solid, the spring doesn't rattle like most P-Mag's.
3. Made from military grade impact-resistant polymer (which is chemical and biological resistant as well).

These mags are brand new in factory sealed packaging, and will stay that way until sold. I will not open or spilt them. Not to be a fear monger, but there is a chance you won't be able to purchase 30 round magizines in the near future, at least if Washington has their way. Get them while you can, and for a reasonable price. Even is this never happens, these mags are rock solid and will last you a very long time.

Price per 3-pack is $90. FTF cash sales only. No Shipping. Must be willing to meet in the Akron area. CCW owners (like myself) preferred."

WG Sig P226, all 3 rollmarks matching (1990 production)

I am the second owner, it was re certified before my purchase early last year.  Since purchase, I have completely replaced all springs and the roll pin just in case.  I have put in a short reset trigger (can include original if you like) and put custom (real) Rosewood Stippled grips by hogue on (can include the original black ones as well).

Including the red case it came in with all the paperwork/warranty card that came with it.  One 15 rd factory mag and two NIB mechgar 18 round mags.  Also included is a Comptac IWB holster. 

It has surprisingly little wear for a 23 year old pistol, but it is used.  Minor cosmetic holster type wear on the outside, normal wear from firing on the external of barrel and inside the frame/rails.  Excuse the pics, I store mine wet and with lithium grease to keep them happy.

 It is a Sig however, and can be counted on to be a freaking awesome pistol for many more decades.  There is a reason there aren't many 226's to be found for sale.  They are great guns, and the West German ones are sought after for their quality.  This one was built in 1990, which is right when the wall was coming down (89) and before official re-unification (95).

 Unfortunately my car is half as old as this gun and needs some work.

Face to face only, must present CO driver's license, and be over 21.  No felons, badguys or future fellons/badguys.  Show me your ccw for my peace of mine and you get a box of 50 rounds for target practice for free.

The Aimpoint Micro T-1 is ideal as a standalone sight, and can also be piggybacked on top of larger magnifying scopes, night vision, or thermal imaging optics.

The performance of the Micro T-1 is optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices (NVDs), but is ideal for 3rd generation night vision technology. The clearest, brightest image possible Aimpoint's unique coating on the front lens reflects the dot's selected frequency of red light at near 100% efficiency to give the highest possible dot brightness with the least amount of energy while other wavelengths in the visible and near-infrared part of the spectrum pass with a minimum of reduction. This provides the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation Night Vision Device (NVD). With 4 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 8 daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the Micro T-1 is ready for round the clock use.

Surefire P2X Fury Dual-Ouput Led Flashlight 
P/N: P2X-B-BK 
The P2X Fury uses a high-efficiency, virtually failure-proof LED to deliver your choice of either 15 or 500 lumens of perfectly focused light, the latter qualifying the Fury as a pocket-sized searchlight. The 15-lumen level is excellent for general work at close-to-medium distances, and also lets you greatly extend the runtime per set of batteries, a valuable option when you're miles from civilization. At either setting the high-strength polymer micro-textured reflector delivers a smooth, comparatively wide beam with a brighter central area and generous peripheral light. The Fury is activated with a click-type tailcap switch: press for momentary-on low, press further to click constant-on low; return to off and press or click on again within two seconds for high. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is smoothly sculpted for a comfortable, secure grip and is hard anodized to military specifications for extreme resistance to scratches, abrasion, and corrosion. 
Features
•Virtually indestructible LED emitter regulated to maximize light output and runtime 
•Two output levels—high for maximum light, low for extended runtime 
•Precision micro-textured reflector creates smooth, optimized beam 
•Coated, tempered window resists impact and thermal shock, maximizes light transmission 
•High-strength aerospace aluminum body, Mil-Spec hard-anodized for extreme durability 
•Dual-output tailcap click switch—press for momentary-on low, click for constant-on low, return to off then press or click again for high 
•Tailcap switch locks out to prevent activation during transport or storage 
•Weatherproof—O-ring and gasket sealed 
•Includes high-energy 123A batteries with 10-year shelf life 
Specifications:
Output / Runtime -- White Light 
•	High 500 .0 lumens / 1.5 hours* 
•	Low 15 .0 lumens / 46.0 hours

These weapone were manufactured from recycled locomotive rails and are among the best of the imported 1911's. Custom builders always liked the Norinco frames as a base for project guns because of the strength. Norinco 1911s are one of the few pistols Bill Wilson will accept to work on as a project gun. That says something about the quality of the steel in the pistol.
