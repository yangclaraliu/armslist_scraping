It was on April 18, 2011, when Ruger, after years of consideration, finally launched its own version of the 1911 pistol. The SR1911, a full-size, stainless-steel combat pistol, launched the series. Now, just over a year and a half later, Ruger is ready to expand the SR1911 line to include the new SR1911 CMD. 

The primary difference between the 1911 CMD and the original is the barrel length. CMD is short for ""Commander,"" which denotes the pistol as having a 4.25-inch barrel instead of the standard 5 inch. Beyond this one change, the pistol remains the same. The pistol is of an all-steel construction, free of any polymer components. The slide and frame are stainless steel. Some folks lose sleep over the use of a cast frame, but Ruger is one of the finest casting companies in the world, and its frames hold up.

The machined bar stock slide is topped with a matte black dovetailed Novak three-dot sight system. The rear sight is windage adjustable via a tension screw. These low-profile sights are ideal for concealed carry due to their snag-free shape and excellent sight picture. The slide serrations are simple, straight, and located at the rear. The frame appointments, including the slide catch, thumb safety, magazine release, checkered mainspring housing, as well as the various pins and screws, have a matte-black finish to match the sights. The contrast of the black parts to the natural satin finish of the slide and frame is aesthetically appealing. The checkered Rosewood grip panels complete the handsome package. 

The magazine release is extended to about double the height of a standard button and has a checkered face. This extra height comes in handy for shorter fingers. The thumb safety is extended for easier operation, but it’s also narrow enough for practical carry. The reduced-weight hammer is kept from nibbling at folks’ hands by a cupped, beavertail grip safety. This safety also features a grooved ""speed bump"" that does a good job of ensuring the safety is disengaged when the pistol is fired. The trigger is of the skeletonized aluminum variety and features an over-travel adjustment screw. 

The interior of the SR1911 reflects the Series 70 design, providing a trigger feel that remains universally appreciated. Other features are ""GI Standard"" as well to help reduce the price and allow for easier mixing and matching of aftermarket components. These include a Browning-style barrel bushing, plunger, short guide rod and internal extractor. The linked stainless-steel barrel and its bushing are milled from the same bar stock on the same machine to improve accuracy. 

Field stripping the SR1911 CMD prior to shooting revealed an interior free of the metal shavings, dirt or detritus that sometimes follows new guns home from the factory. The fitting of the metallic components was tight and precise. The slide cycled smoothly right out of the box (and only got better with shooting). The grip panels were properly fit and snuggly cinched into place. The two magazines were stiff and rugged, without the flimsiness that lesser magazines display. Overall, it looked like a fine pistol inside and out.

THIS IS A CASH PRICE, SLIGHT ADDITIONAL COST FOR CREDIT CARD PURHCASES TO OFFSET BANK FEES.  SELLER IS A FFL HOLDER SO BUYER WILL NEED TO PASS A NICS BACKGROUND CHECK.  TEXAS SALES TAX MAY APPLY.

The stock has an antique oil finish that looks amazing. All the numbers match - even on the bayonet, and it comes with the original cleaning tools. There isn't a speck of cosmoline on the rifle and it shoots great. It is an Izhevsk rifle with a wartime stock that has the brass bands on the hand guard. There are several stamps on the stock, but no refurb mark. The barrel has the point of aim proof and several other markings. The rifle cycles perfectly and I've attached a picture of a 4"" target at 50 yards that I shot last week - the gun is probably better than this, but my eyes aren't that good.

This isn't your typical refurb Mosin Nagant that's covered in cosmoline and has scratches and a flaking shellack finish - this is an amazing rifle that shots very good and looks perfect.

If you know anything about Glocks then you know that this is one of the most accurate pistols made by Glock despite being a compact pistol. Bought it in April of 2012. It is in excellent condition and have taken really good care of it. Has been cleaned after every outing and have only put 607 rounds thru it (600fmj & 7 PDX1 HP) and have had zero malfunctions. Runs like a champ and has barely been broken in as you can see from the round count. The frame has been very nicely stippled for enhanced grip and I must say it is a vast improvement! No need for grip tape anymore. It is not too rough either it is just right in my opinion. Stippling jobs normally cost between $100-200 FYI. Also has a little trigger guard reduction which elininates the uncomfortable rubbing of the middle finger when shooting at extended periods of time. I am including THREE different sights with this deal! The factory Glock sights, TruGlo TFO night sights, and the XS Big Dot Tritium night sights which are currently installed on the weapon and highly recommend for self defense. Both night sights are only a year old and have at least 90% life left on them which is about 9 more years. You can try them all out and choose the one you want and even sell the other two if you want and make some of your money back. The TruGlo are $99 sights and XS Big Dot are $120 sights new, just for reference. The gun has the extended slide stop installed but I will also include the factory slide stop. Comes with two 10rd and three 13rd mags (two of which are brand new never used). One of the 13rd mags has the mag grip extension to give the gun a full size grip. The two 10rd mags have Pearce/Scherer finger extensions installed but will include the two factory floor plates as well. I am including THREE holsters in this sale! The first is the Versa Carry Zero Bulk concealed carry holster which is perfect for this weapon and really adds no bulk whatsoever while carrying concealed…this is an ambidextrious holster. The second is a Lynch Combat Systems RH black kydex holster that comes with a velcro soft belt and two kydex magazine holders. Can be worn IWB or OWB. The third is a G-Code OH OWB holster with shirt guard and the belt slide attachment which can adjust to belt sizes up to 2"". Holster is right handed & color is OD Green. It is a straight drop holster (no cant). This is a premium kydex holster, the best I have used and you can purchase other attachments for the holster thru the G-Code website. This package has pretty much everything you will need for this weapon as a responsible gun owner. Here is a list of everything included in this purchase. 

- Glock 30sf with stippled grip, extended slide stop, and XS Big Dot sights installed
- Two 10rd mags with finger ext. installed + original floorplates 
- Three 13rd mags (two of them brand new), one mag grip extension

Solid cross bolt mounting to the rear sight base with a locking nut insures solid and rigid installation and is a major improvement over the mounting systems of earlier generation scout mounts which use two mounting screws that can strip out the mount and work loose - and which are still being sold by many vendors at gun shows and on the internet.

RING SPECIFICATIONS:
+ Strong Lightweight Aluminum
+ Non-Slip Mounting
+ Matte Black Finish
+ Medium Height Profile
+ One Inch Diameter
+ New in Box
+ Fits Weaver Style Bases or Picatinny Rail

You come to me.  Here is a rare and hard-to-find MAC-10 style semi-auto in 22lr MPA22 made by Masterpiece Arms. I believe they do not make these anymore. I have only put less than 50 rounds through this, but I did purchase it used, so I am unsure of the total round count. It appears to be in very good condition. It does have one small scratch as shown in the pictures that was there when I purchased it, and does not affect the operation in any way. The fake silencer on it was intended for a 9mm, but it fits just fine and makes it look more ""real"". Comes with original hard case and 1 30 round magazine. It is a blast to shoot with the 30 rounder. Do not buy if this would be illegal for you to own. Please read the manufacturers note below regarding ammunition:

I have a BNIB, NEVER FIRED, TAGS STILL ON, Springfield Armory M1A Super Match, Model SA9102, with Oversized Walnut Stock. In addition to this beautiful rifle, I also have 5 BRAND NEW ""still in the wrapper"" 20 ROUND MAGAZINES - FROM SPRINGFIELD ARMORY (not aftermarket), a COMPLETE CLEANING KIT INCLUDING COMBO TOOL, and a GAS CYLINDER LOCK WRENCH. After I received this rifle, I decided it was a ""little big for me"" and probably not the right rifle for me. So, I have decided to sell it along with the other items described. This is a ""COMPLETE PACKAGE"" and I have NO DESIRE to sell just the rifle, or just the magazines, etc. - it is a ""ALL OR NOTHING"" deal.  Sorry my pictures aren't any better, but I'm not that good with cameras. One of the pictures is one I downloaded from Springfield.

The description of the rifle below is taken from Springfield Armory:

The Super Match M1ATM rifle embodies the most sophisticated development in Gas GunTM technology. Capable of sub-MOA accuracy with the proper ammunition, the Super Match is built for the individual who demands the very best. A truly custom gun. Springfield’s latest proprietary development for the Super Match is the rear lugged receiver. Additional extraordinary features include an ultra heavy air gauged national match barrel, custom oversized op-rod guide and maximum dimension match grade stocks available in American walnut and McMillan fiberglass.￼￼

Caliber: 7.62 X 51mm (.308WIN)

Barrel: 22"", 6 Groove, 1:10 Right Hand Twist, Parkerized, Douglas Premium Air Gauged Custom Heavy Match.

Trigger: 2 Stage Military Trigger, Match Tuned, 4.5 - 5 lbs.

Front Sight: National Match .062"" Military Post.

Rear Sight:  National Match Hooded Aperture, Adjustable, One-half Minute Windage and Elevation.

I am not looking to trade for anything except the ""green stuff"" - cash only. If you reside outside the state of Colorado and/or require any shipping, then I will ship to an FFL Dealer ONLY and YOU WILL PAY ALL SHIPPING COSTS. I will require a completed Bill Of Sale, a copy of your Drivers License, and preferably a copy of a CWP if you have one. Finally, I'm not desperate to sell so please don't make me any ridiculous offers. I  think I'm pricing all of this very fair when looking at some online dealers (who say ""currently out of stock"")  as well as looking at the prices for the magazines and other accessories direct from Springfield. 

Thanks for looking."

Nothing special about it. Polymer framed gun. 2 mags. Box and paperwork. I'm 99% sure the scope mount is in there too, but I'll have to check to be 100%. Maybe 500 rounds through it. Spent more time in a holster than anything else! 

I can text/email pics later. Cash price FTF is $300. If you have a trade that fits the bill let me know and we can figure out cash on my end (I expect this for what I'm wanting).

You can tell it's a 3rd Generation because of the barrel NOT having a flash hider.

It is in great shape with NONE of the problems you hear about in earlier Cetme's.  The cocking tube is 100% straight with good cocking handle gap, creating a very smooth cocking motion.

It also does NOT have a ground bolt.  The third picture is the back of the bolt, and it clearly shows that this has a good bolt.

It has recently refinished wood parts that look and feel very nice.  It has a Port Buffer on it, meaning not only does your brass not go flying 30+ Feet (Common with all HK Clones), but will also keep it from getting mangled upon ejection, so you can reload the brass.

You would be hard pressed to find a better shooting Cetme. Put 2 in center bullseye at 100 yards using the iron sights when I was at the range 2 weeks ago.

I have alot of extra parts including stocks, hand gaurds, pistol grips, and a Carry Handle that I am including in the deal.
Comes with 3 20-Round HK Aluminum Mags, 1 20-Round Steel Cetme mag, and 1 5-Round Steel mag.

I have 175 rounds if brass cased 7.62x51 ammo that goes with it.
For the right offer I have a never used Primary Arms 30mm Red Dot sight with a cantilever high mount.

My disclaimer: I stand by my word. I describe item condition honestly, I properly own all items I sell, I only make legal deals with qualified individuals, and I keep appointments. If you are a flake, don’t waste my time. If you don’t keep your word, the deal is null and void. Unless I specifically say I will reserve an item, it is open to the first paying individual. If you say you will buy it and then don’t get around to sending payment quickly, don’t be surprised if someone buys the item out from under you. When you pay, I ship ASAP. If you are unhappy with an item bought from me, I will probably refund your money, less my shipping costs, when you return the item to me promptly and in same condition.
