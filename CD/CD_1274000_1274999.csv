I'm looking for $3,000 cash o.b.o. as long as it's a fair price.  I see stock guns still running for $2,000 at the local shops! I am interested in a specific trade and I'll mention that below.

This pre-ban SKS was purchased new by me in 1993, upgraded with the composite folding stock, then relegated to the gun safe for the past 2 decades. It shows practically no evidence of use and maybe 100 rounds through it's chrome lined barrel.
Shortly after this was purchased the weapons ban went into effect and any new SKS had the bayonet lug cut off. This one not only has the stock bayonet lug, but also has the original spike bayonet.
Since this SKS comes with both the original wood stock and the installed composite stock, you can make it look however you prefer.
This is a very nice example of a numbers matching classic that has had a very easy life.
If you are looking for a tactical rifle that is more cost effective than an AR-15 or AK-47, but is dead solid reliable, then look no further. This SKS is for you.

Background on the SKS:
The stock SKS has a conventional carbine layout, with a wooden stock and no pistol grip. The SKS is a gas-operated weapon that has a spring-loaded operating rod and a gas piston rod that work the action via gas pressure pushing against them. Also, it has a ""tilting bolt"" action locking system. The SKS has a 4-inch longer barrel than AK-series rifles; as a result, it has a slightly higher muzzle velocity."

Made in Germany by the legendary Weihrauch company, the Beeman P1 is considered by many to be the Holy Grail of air pistols. This is an heirloom airgun that you'll pass along to your grandchildren and beyond. The gun's heft and balance convey quality and substance. It fills your hand without feeling bulky or oversized. The unusual overlever cocking mechanism compresses the powerful mainspring, and the hammer is actually the catch for it. The fully adjustable rear sight and adjustable two-stage trigger, will help you extract maximum accuracy from the P1. In fact, the adjustable trigger is so crisp, you'll wish it was on your firearms. Unlike many modern air pistols, the P1 isn't made of molded synthetics. It's a solid metal gun with finely checkered walnut grips. And, it's truly ambidextrous. The 11mm dovetails make it easy to mount a pistol scope or a red dot sight. This .177 version of the P1 has two power levels. Low power is approx. 380 fps, and high or full power is 600 fps. The different power levels are created by cocking the gun to different lock points. The distance you shoot, the weight of the pellet and the type of target will determine which power level is best. The P1 is an excellent indoor trainer for those who shoot the M1911A1.... comes with stock and combat grips and cleaning kit

Factory rail and UTG Red Dot sight. It has been upgraded for fast, flawless magazine changes and easier takedown (in other words, it's been “de-Lawyered” and breaks down exactly as if were a Mark II model). The mags fall right into your hand (like they OUGHT to!) when you push the release. 

Appearance and function on this gun are immaculate.  After mods (see below) were made and sight was attached, approximately 150 rounds were fired at the local range to “zero in” the firearm and make everything functioned perfectly. It does. In typical Ruger fashion, it “eats” anything you put in the magazine. CCI, Federal, Winchester, you name it. NEVER Remington. Just don't...

All internal friction points were burnished and polished for a silky trigger pull, including the square block where the barrel/receiver meets the frame. No mallets or tools necessary to break this gun apart.

Sight is UTG “red/green” dot variable intensity.  Keep both eyes open, bring the weapon up, and put the dot where you want it. Exhale. Pull the trigger. Bullseye. Simple as that.

Auction includes firearm, 2 magazines, speed loader, genuine Ruger Mounting rail, scope (as pictured) and hard padded gun case

Background checks on gun purchases amount to de facto gun registration. UNIVERSAL background checks on gun purchases amount to de facto UNIVERSAL gun registration. 

The default ""lawyered-up"" (the ones that won't release your mags and are difficult to break down) versions of the 22/45s are selling in the  $300 – $400 price range. Hard to put a value on my day-and-a-half with 600 grit sandpaper, polishing compound and gunsmithing tools pulling out all the garbage like gutting a fish, but mag changes and the trigger pull are are nicer than other 22/45s by a long shot... 

Cost of the sight was moderate. If you don't want it, I'll take $40 off the price.  Mounting rail stays on the gun.

The fact that this sale will take place between two consenting adults without paperwork is priceless. Make me an offer. I will also consider trades. .22 lr ammo mostly."

This gun is in “as-new” condition both functionally and cosmetically. Bluing pristine, without marks, and grips/handles are in absolutely perfect condition with no wear visible. 

This model has “threaded” barrel-removal system (see picture), which is superior to the “push-button” models because it does NOT have any springs to wear out over time and it functions as well after 1,000 take downs as it does when new. It also has a locking side button on the thumbwheel that keeps the threaded retention wheel absolutely tight while shooting. 

It has the famous High Standard “loaded chamber” indicator on the rear of the slide. The safety on the rear of the frame also functions as the slide lock. Mag release is located left forward, above the trigger guard. Handles both standard and high-velocity .22 lr ammo. Not recommended for hyper-velocity rounds, such as Stingers. People shoot 'em in HS pistols, but I've never fired any in THIS weapon.

This gun is SOLID metal. It is pure joy to hold, shoot, and handle.

Firearm has no visible nicks, scratches, rust or other signs of wear inside or out. 

Two genuine High Standard magazine are included (one blued and one stainless), and both have been “tuned” to accept either CCI or Federal ammo (does not care for Remington cartridges, however).

I will include the carbon-steel magazine adjustment tool along with instructions so that the new owner may custom “fine tune” the mags for any desired ammo.

This firearm has absolutely NO issues. Everything about this gun, inside and out, is 100%. The trigger pull is smooth and crisp, and sights are “on the money” for 25 – 50 yards.

Auction includes firearm, 2 magazines, speed loader, mag adjustment tool and padded gun case.

I also have the Owner's manual in electronic form, which I will email the buyer.

As a High Standard in this condition with 2 factory magazines is almost impossible to find, I'd like to entertain serious cash offers in the $550 range. I would also consider partial trade for .22 lr or other ammo."

We all know what AR's are selling for these days especially with extra 30 round mags and 400 rounds of ammo.  Please feel free to email me any REASONABLE OFFERS.  The worst I can say is thanks but no."

The gun has the Realtree camo synthetic stock with the Hogue Overmold inlays. It also has the XCR specific TriNite coated 26"" stainless barrel, receiver and jeweled bolt with a tactical style knurled handle. It has a 3+1 capacity internal magazine with a hinged floorplate featuring the RMEF logo inlayed with gold. The barrel bore has been lapped for optimum performance, the trigger has been lightened to 2.5lb and it has had a 24lb firing pin spring installed. Mounted on this awesome rifle is a beautiful 3.3-10x44 Nikon TiTanium series scope. Scope is mounted on Leupold stainless bases that match the TriNite coating and the TiTanium scope perfectly. The scope has been charted and the gun will come with 51 custom loaded (chamber specific) rounds of ammo that are loaded with custom Barnes T-TSX 168gr bullets. This gun still shows retail price on Remington.com @ $1249. The scope alone sold for $639 new. Box ammo for this gun runs nearly $3 per round, so these 50 custom loads are valuable.

This is a unique snub nose revolver as it shoots from the bottom chamber instead of the top one like a smith and wesson or ruger revolver would. Because of this design the recoil and muzzle flip is more manageable allowing for quicker follow up shots an a more enjoyable shooting experience. This gun is like new. It hasn't even had a full box shot through it. It comes with a molded leather holster that is made in Italy also and the original carry case with owners manual and cleaning rod. This gun is perfect if you are looking for something lightweight and concealable but also with a lot of power. The only reason I'm selling it is because I am short on money.
