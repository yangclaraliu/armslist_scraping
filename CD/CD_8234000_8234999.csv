I live near Howard City but work in GR so I can meet in a lot of places.

I would like to buy a West German SIG Sauer. P220, P226, or P228. Triple serial number and proof marks. ""New/unfired outside of the factory"" condition or close to that is desired. The gun itself must obviously consist of only its original factory components/internals, with zero mods done. guns lacking extra mags, lacking the factory box, and lacking the manual are absolutely considered, in any combination of the 3. if it comes with everything, terrific. if not, thats not a deal breaker. Pictures are best descriptors.A little background here. I am a big fan of these particular guns. I currently own a W. German, 1990-produced (KA date code) SIG2 Sauer P228. It is my favorite gun and I would like to buy a couple more of these W. German guns, so obviously a P220 or P226 would be my first choice. P228 I already have, but if you have one in superb condition as stated above, I am definitely intrigued. I am a shooter more than a collector, but I can be both. So know that your classic P series pistol is going to a good home. Every gun that I own is meticulously cleaned, lubed, and maintained.I am new to armslist. Out of state lookers, if you are willing to ship to an FFL, I will consider your guns as well so long as the shipping price isn't too high. Also I am not even sure you can see my listing if you are out of state, but this part of my listing is here in case you can.I am willing to pay up to 900$ but I will be flexible with sweet deals. For the condition I described, lowest I will offer is 700$. Let me know your thoughts. Also, I have two rare cold steel knives in new condition that I can offer for price reduction/negotiation, if you are into them. for more details for those interested, contact meTo whoever reads this, I appreciate your time and consideration."
