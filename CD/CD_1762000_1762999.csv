* This is a German police surplus gun which was issued NEW in Germany, and has the police officer's name still in the box: Heinzan, Wolfgang.

 The SIG P6 is a more compact version of the SIG P220. The Swiss Army wanted semi-automatic handgun, that would provide excellent functionality with a double-action trigger. The 9mm SIG-Sauer P6, debuted with various new and inventive features. It utilized a single column magazine holding eight 9 mm rounds and has a 3.9 in. barrel.

 A new German police standard, in the mid-1970s, prompted SIG-Sauer to develop a new pistol that met the standard: The SIG-Sauer P225 (known as the P6) and the Heckler & Koch P7. The SIG-Sauer P225 was the least expensive (due mainly to the inventive design) and received the majority of the orders. To be able to manufacture that many handguns, SIG acquired a controlling interest in J. P. Sauer & Sohn in Eckenförde, Germany to manufacture parts. This is also where all P225s were manufactured. The only difference between the P6 and P225 — the P225 (which was adopted by US civilian law enforcement) has a lighter trigger pull, whereas the P6's trigger pull is heavier. The P225 has tritium fixed sights; P6's have fixed sights only. Because of its compact size, the P225/P6 is quite readily usable for concealed carry. In U.S. states where high-capacity magazines were prohibited, the P6/P225 is in high demand."

I bought this less than a month and a half ago. Very clear glass and is a very well built scope. I went with a higher power scope, that's the only reason I'm selling it. This scope has some very nice features and routinely gets very high reviews online. 

One of the best things about this scope is the 1x is almost a true 1x. It's like 1.1x so you can use this as a red dot scope on the lowest power and shoot with both eyes open and the image will not be distorted. Even the Leupold scopes that are a 1x are more like a 1.4 or 1.5x making them useless as a red dot on low power. 

Scope has ""zero stop"" target turrets, ballistic retical which illuminates green and has 11 brightness settings as well as a night vision setting. Has a 30mm main tube and a 24mm objective lens. Eyepiece has a fast focus adjustment. Also comes with front and rear flip up covers, 2 batteries, cleaning cloth, Allen wrench and original box. 

Also included is a Burris P.E.P.R 30mm 1 piece scope mount. Will mount to any picatinny rail. Includes 2 sets of ring tops ( picatinny and smooth), Allen wrench and original packaging. 

Both scope and mount are in excellent condition and basically look new. I paid around $330 for the scope and around $80 for the mount. Selling for $320 firm.

Since the end of the American Civil War, personal and official use of Confederate flags and of flags derived from these has continued under some controversy. But what isn't a controversy these days?

The display of the Confederate flag is a highly controversial topic generally because of disagreement over its symbolism. Supporters of the flag view it as a symbol of southern heritage and the independence of the distinct cultural tradition of the South from the North. I was hesitant to put these up but got so many responses on the Colorado Gadsden that I figured this may have a niche as well. And at the same time trying to stay neutral as far as it's negative connotations go. Good or bad, it is a part of our Nations' history.

The STG-44 (Sturmgewehr 44) was developed in Nazi Germany during WWII and was the first ‘Storm’ (or assault) rifle to see major deployment.

Retaining as many of the original specs as possible, the GSG 22.LR version of this piece of history flawlessly sends 25 rounds of ammo accurately and quickly downrange, and is perfect for casual plinking, target shooting, and hunting. Stunning wood finishing, easy-to-adjust iron sights, and simple safety features add to the STG-44’s superb level of quality. Packed in an old-world style pine crate made by Amish craftsman, the STG-44 offers everything to make any shooting experience a memorable one. 


I shot one 325 round brick through it. I am a big guy (6'7'') and this gun is a little small for me to be comfortable.
 All the original bits come with the rifle in the wooden crate. In addition it also comes with 2 extra 25 round mags and a 325 round brick of 22 lr ammo."

I am interesting in trading for a home defense/tactical shotgun preferably with folding stock. I can add cash or ammo for the right trade. May also buy the parts to turn this into a home defense gun, but I always thought the wood was too nice to do that to this gun.

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain.

Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano.  The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment.  To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed.

The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.
The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith.  Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry.

I purchased it new so I am the original owner and it has been well taken care of (only used it to mow my yard). I have followed the scheduled maintenance since I bought it new. I have only used Cub Cadet filters and FULL Synthetic Quaker State since the first oil change. Everything works very well and the engine still runs strong (it has never used any oil which is rare on a small engine). It has been a good solid mower for me I just decided to step up to a newer mower with a larger 60"" deck. It is a used mower so it has the normal wear and tear. However it is good condition and I have taken care of it. The hydrostats work well but I guess it is a tad slower than it was when new (to be expected). Still a speedy mower for sure. Here is the basic specs for the mower:

Cub Cadet Zero Turn (RZT) Mower 
22 HP Briggs & Stratton V-Twin Intek
50 inch mowing deck
331 hours (it has the digital read hour display)
Blades are 1 year old (Cub Cadet Blades)
Good Tires

You are obviously more than welcome to test drive it first, you can mow my entire yard if you want . Will take cash or trade for firearms. I'm pretty open for now on gun trades as long as they are quality firearms. I may consider a bow but would prefer guns or cash. 
$1000 value cash/trade.  I have my CCH for any trades etc."

Apparently I was unclear before.

YES, IT IS STILL FOR SALE. If it is still posted, I still have it.
YES, I would appreciate a cash offer, along with your contact info, and a timeframe on when you're available to meet.
YES, I understand it's used/worn/unlucky/non-kosher/upside down/(insert random misc excuse). As you can see the prices are lower than you'll find at a shop/Bud's/Gunbroker/etc.  I do this for a reason.  I understand what things cost.
YES, I am open to reasonable offers if buying multiple items.  
YES, I probably do have extras to go with it.  Check out my other Listings.
NO, I don't have any more to say about the item.  I bought it at some point because it was a fair value, in good enough condition, and goes bang every time.  I wouldn't have bet my life or my families' lives on it if I had the slightest doubt.
NO, I'm not going to spend all day answering 'what's the lowest/least/etc amount you'd take for this today/tomorrow/after the apocalypse/etc' emails.  Don't waste your time or mine.
NO, I am not interested in trades at this time.
NO, I will not consider your lowball offers. I'm not a fix-needing junkie, this is not stolen, I don't need the money, and I'm not mentally challenged.
NO, I cannot deliver them across the state at these prices.  
NO, I do not sell across state lines.  I'm not a fan of federal prison.
NO, I do not sell to felons.  Again, not a fan of prison.  
NO, I don't take payments, food stamps, fake jewelry, broken cars, or used electronics.

Now that that's out of the way, I'm a straightforward guy.  I would much rather sell to an individual for a good price than watch people constantly lose $200 every time they go to a shop and try to trade something in.  I'm off work this week and will be heading down I-75 to Lexington at least once.

Low-profile gas block combined with an amazing modified free floating quad rail makes this rifle stand out from the others. The rail is the best part, with enough quad rail for a flashlight and bi-pod, a full rail on top that meets all the way to the A3 flattop receiver, a quick detach swivel stud slot on either side, all while saving weight and not scratching up your hands. Combine it with a Sig Sauer CP1 3x BDC reticle and you have a 6 1/2 lb rifle (unloaded with no mag) that shoots amazingly with very quick target acquisition which is great for hunting fast targets. I added an accuwedge to take out what little slop it had. What was professionally done was a polished trigger group, installed extended latch, installed Magpul enhanced trigger guard, and the buttstock shaved and repainted to prevent the charging handle from jamming into it. It has an adjustable cheek rest but because the one-piece gunsight sits so low you can't use it. It's still there and available if you want to put a traditional hunting optic on the rifle.
