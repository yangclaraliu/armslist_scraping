Patriot Training and Consulting, LLC, provides its clients with much more than just the minimum requirements of concealed carry certification training. We do not waste time teaching subject matter you already know, and we do not accept just anyone willing to pay the fee on the firing line either. 

If someone accused us of placing high standards on our clients, we would have to enter a plea of guilt. We require every student to pass a handgun safety and proficiency test before the class starts to ensure the safety of all of our clients. 

Because all of our Concealed Carry-Handgun (CCH) instructors are Marine Veterans who possess Criminal Justice expertise, we know first-hand how best to prepare you for two of the worst fights you could be in; a gun fight in the Civ.Div. and the legal fight that will surely follow. 

If all you want is the certificate, this is NOT the course for you. There are 'anyone will pass' classes for that and they are cheaper, too. If what you are looking for is both a challenge of your handgun skills and an educational course that will teach you much more than the N.C. CCH curriculum requires, this is your course.

Save money and stop shooting that overpriced .22lr ammo. This is a precission air rifle with match grade accuracy. Velocities match .22lr! Plus you can shoot anywhere...EVEN INDOORS!

INCLUDES
 Mounted Beeman Blue Ribbon 3x9 variable match grade scope

When RWS first introduced the Model 48, we expected it to become a classic. What was unexpected was its rapid rise to classic status among knowledgeable air gunners. At 1110fps in .177 (750 mps), this rifle propels pellets at .22 rim-fire velocities! This tremendous power is generated by the use of a very robust spring piston power plant cocked by a side lever action. The action is mounted into an extended beech stock to reduce felt recoil and to aid in achieving accuracy potential. Not designed for the faint hearted, this is one impressive air arm, both in performance and presence. It fulfills its purpose as a potent, full-size sporting airgun suitable for either pest control or field target shooting, yet it does so with both balance and grace. The substantial one-piece stock allows for comfortable offhand shooting and adds to the overall sensation that the Model 48 is a force to be reckoned with. The rifle is fitted with a finely rifled, fixed barrel system loaded via sliding breech opening. Its full accuracy potential can be realized by the use of a quality RWS airgun scope mounted to the scope rail. Other standard features include an adjustable trigger, an adjustable rear sight, and an automatic safety."

When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

Up for sale is an FN TPS (Tactical Police Shotgun). This is a pump action 12 gauge, 7+1 capacity, ported barrel, AR style sights, Hogue pistol grip, top rail, and AR buffer tube with Magpul MOE collapsible stock.

I ordered this shotgun new several years ago, and it has only had around 200-300 rounds thru it.

A piece on the right side of the trigger guard (plastic) was broken during installation of the rounded winter trigger guard. The part was repaired using epoxy and is also held in place by the trigger guard retaining pin. There are also some wear marks/scratches on the receiver which are shown in the pics.

This scope was bought six months ago for $400 bucks.
Asking $280 firm. It is brand new in box.

Scope is of the highest quality rifle scope line made by Barska USA. I would never buy any Barska that is not part of the SWAT line because any others are lower quality.
For the same reason I would never buy any Bushnell that is not in the ELITE line because all of Bushnells other scopes are if low quality.

This is a great precision Varmint/Hunting/Range(long distance) rifle scope perfect for someone who wants a great piece of glass for their Semi-Auto or Bolt-Action rifle but doesn't want to pay absurd prices and its ready to go to a new home

Very light use, looks almost new. Includes all original FA parts except for the disconnector. All NFA rules apply.

Comes with $41 worth of new AK Builder parts including a proper Romanian 80% receiver flat, rivet kit and center spacer/rivet.

Note: Be careful with kits which have new barrels unless they are properly head spaced already. Unless you know what you’re doing and know how to use a mill you will end up ruining your barrel, trunion or both. There is only a 0.003 difference between a good build and a pile of junk. Alternatively, sending a barrel out to a smith will cost you $100 or more.

If the bans some of our government representatives want to get passed happen these spare parts kits will become “priceless”. If your state and local laws prohibit these parts do not bid on this auction, I will not ship to locations which prohibit such parts.

$600 for the kit and the AK-builder parts mentioned above.

Ground shipping is a flat $20 to the lower 48 for 1 kit. Contact me for qoutes on other shipping methods and\or multiple kits."

I just thoroughly inspected the gun... trigger mechanism has no excessive wear or thin spots. Firing pin is in good shape and so is the hole it sticks out of. The bolt and carrier have minor pitting, but not on the mechanical parts. Purely cosmetic. Gas chamber and piston are in good shape. Springs are tight, barrel is clean, stock is not broken or cracked. Bayonet is there and works fine. Field sights are free. Mag release is free. If this was a car, I'd put an inspection sticker on it... drive it to California."
