Still in their original package. They have the heavy spring and anti-tilt follower like pmags so the follower doesn't tilt like the old military green followers. Come with a lifetime guarantee. They  are one of the best alternatives to pmags that you can find.  Keeping 3 for myself and have 3 left to sell. Asking $40/each.  Thanks for looking.

From Tapco: The next generation of AR magazines has arrived and INTRAFUSE® is at the forefront with our 30rd Gen II AR Magazine. It still retains the rugged mag body that the original had, but we’ve made vast changes to the interior components to improve the overall functionality of the magazine. First, we’re making the spring out of premium 17-7 Stainless Steel. Second, we’ve redesigned the shape to make it smoother, quieter, and easier to load all 30 rounds. Plus, we've made changes in spring tension to cut back on the stress put on the mag body when fully loaded, making spine cracks something you'll never have to worry about. But we didn’t just stop on improving the spring, we also totally revamped the follower. We’ve kept the anti-tilt design but the new follower allows more dirt and grime to pass through the magazine so there won’t be any feeding errors no matter what kind of debris has entered the magazine. Along with these interior design changes, the Gen II magazine does away with the rare drop-free issue that some users were experiencing with the first generation mag. When you purchase the INTRAFUSE® 30rd Gen II AR Magazine you can be sure that you are the owner of the best AR magazine on the market."

The P229® DAK™ is the standard pistol of the Dept. of Homeland Security and the U.S. Coast Guard who selected the P229 after a 3 million round grueling torture test. A favorite among law enforcement professionals, the P229 offers compact size, choice in firepower of 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, tactical versatility of an accessory rail, double-action only and the unbeatable performance that only comes from SIG SAUER® all in one package. Developed by the renowned engineers at Sauer for the SIG SAUER pistols, the new DAK trigger system delivers a safe, reliable and consistent 6.5 pound double-action only trigger pull. The DAK also features double-strike capability. SIG SAUER DAK pistols also disassemble without the need to pull the trigger - simply lock the slide back and remove the magazine to disassemble like other SIG pistols. The DAK is also available in the P220®, P226® and P239® models.

If you are shopping for your first AR, be sure that you know what you are buying. This gun is an M4-A3, which is the most desirable civilian model for a few reasons. The base model which is the A1, comes with a fixed carry handle and open site that can be adjusted for wind. The A2 has a fixed handle as well, but the sites can be adjusted for wind and elevation. The A3 has both wind and elevation adjustments, but it also incorporates a removable handle so that you can mount optics to the top picatinny rail, use the open site on the handle, or mount optics using the handle as a riser. This gun is an A3. Additionally, the barrel is rifled at 1/9"" twist which makes it fine for both 5.56 NATO and .223 REM Ammunition. The gun is chambered for 5.56, but you can shoot either safely.

Double/Single action provides a very safe and timeproven design. High-capacity steel magazines are durable and drop-free when the magazine button is depressed, even when empty. Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease of cleaning. Barrels also feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling.
. Open Slide Design: Open top slide virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping. Allows the user to load and chamber one cartridge at a time should the  magazine be lost or damaged.
. Disassembly Latch: Simplifies field stripping for maintenance by allowing quick and easy disassembly. Stays on the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. 
. Visible Automatic Firing Pin Block: The front par t of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascer tain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer.
. Rear Sight Profile: The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
. External Hammer Design: A traditional feature of Beretta pistols, this design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
. No Glare Finish: Beretta’s exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish.
. Light Aluminum Frame: Each pistol features a lightweight, forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
. Reversible Magazine Release: Positioned next to the trigger guard for either right or left-handed shooters, allowing rapid reloading. Magazine drops clear when released.
. Unique Ultra Safe Design: The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb of a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it’s either positively “on” or “off ”. The safety lever also functions as the pistol’s decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin. Additional hammer drop catch (half-cock notch prevents striking of the firing pin unit) in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop.
. High-Capacity Magazines: The 92 family magazines are interchangeable within caliber, and range in capacity from 10 to 20 rounds in 9mm.

Yes, these lowers we're professionally assembled by gun-shop personnel; however, the variance in parts ought to tell you how hard finding AR-15 components is getting - even for those connected to the industry. The PMAGs hold (30) rounds and are still in the packaging. If you live relatively close by and would like to avoid paperwork, we do not have to meet at an FFL facility. I can meet you after work.

This rifle has never been fired, is in almost brand new condition. Made in 1943 at the Izhevsk arsenal. It is literally a virgin. So how is a rifle made in 1943 still brand new?

As any Mosin Nagant enthusiast knows, these M38's were made in the Soviet Union for war time use by the Red Army, so this really is a piece of World War 2 militaria. For some reason unknown to me at least, many of these rifles were immediately put into storage straight off the assembly line and were forgotten about for decades as they were eclipsed by the more modern Simonov SKS and Kalashnikov AK weapons. A few years ago these rifles were uncovered and exported to the United States for civilian sporting use. 7 years ago gun stores were awash with these but by now the source has dried up. Adding to the current lack of supply is an import ban ensuring foreign surplus guns stay foreign.

This rifle fires the 7.62x54 Rimmed cartridge, which is ballistically similar to a .30-06. This cartridge was designed in 1891 and is still in use today in Dragunov Sniper Rifles and PKM Medium Machine guns making this the oldest cartridge that is still in military use. Ammo for this rifle is relatively cheap, widely available and very reliable. I have never had any issues with 7.62x54R military ammo.

I saw one of these in similar condition sell at the Spokane Gun Show in November for $300 so I know that is what they are worth. And this was before the election and before the great gun rush.

Local private sales only. Please do not message me and ask me to ship it to your FFL. I want to keep it simple and local."

Bike is factory stock except for custom tuned carb and pipe, added just so bike would run very well. This is a very common practice preferred on these bikes and makes for a terrific running bike. Do a search or call the Suzuki dealer if you have any questions concerning this. 

I bought it last year and it has been covered ever since except for a weekly start just to keep it lubricated.

It is electric start.

I have a VERY clean tank I am letting go with this bike...worth around $500 or more. I bought it to have repainted in a ""custom color some day"". It is a super nice, clean tank worth at least $500.

My price is firm on this bike, it is worth every penny. Probably one of the nicest around with low miles and runs perfect. You simply won't find a better, cleaner, nicer looking bike for this price.

This bike has the 650, four stroke engine labeled as ""Bullet Proof"".
