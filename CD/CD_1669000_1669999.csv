The Sako Quad is made with the best materials, using cold-hammered forged precision barrels and Sako workmanship to produce flawless accuracy and operation. Sako Quad has been a runaway success with shooters, offering both practical versatility and serious performance. With the Sako Quad, you can mix and match parts to create the firearm you need to suit the activity you‘re engaged in. 

BARREL
The interchangeable Sako Quad barrels are precision-machined, cold-hammer forged, famous Sako quality barrels. The barrels are color coded to indicate each Quad caliber. All Quad barrels are free-floating for flawless accuracy and operation, available also with muzzle thread to accept a variety of different accessories. Barrels are changed easily in few seconds by using the Sako Quad barrel tool.

STOCK
The Sako Quad rifle concept offers several different stock options. In general the stock design is modern and streamlined, and it features ambidextrous palm swell. The stock material is either selected walnut or glass-fibre reinforced copolymer. 

ACTION
Sako Quad rimfire rifle is based on the Sako P04R bolt action design. The action features two locking lugs and the bolt lift angle is 50º.

TRIGGER & SAFETY 
Sako Quad comes with the same single-stage trigger unit as the famous Sako hunting rifles. The trigger is adjustable from 1 to 2 kg (2 - 4 lbs), and there is also an optional single set trigger mechanism available. Sliding safety catch is located rear from the bolt handle and it locks both the trigger and the bolt.

MAGAZINE
Sako Quad magazines are correspondingly colour-coded and can house two different calibers. The magazine construction prevents the use of wrong combinations of barrels and magazines. The 5 round Sako Quad magazines are available in two lengths to match the calibres: short magazine for 17 Mach 2 and 22 LR, long magazine for 17 HMR and 22 WMR.

CALIBERS AND COLOR CODING 
In addition to individual caliber marking and serial numbering of each Sako Quad barrel, they are also color coded for ease of caliber differentiation. The Sako Quad magazines are also color coded corresponding to the colors on the barrels. The Sako Quad construction prevents the use of wrong combination of barrel and magazine. The Sako Quad riflescope by Burris has color coded adjustment dials to match the color coding on the Quad barrels.

Each of the four Sako Quad caliber has its own characteristics and is designed for specific shooting needs. Calibers from left to right: 
17 Mach 2 – a hot necked-down version of the popular 22LR 
22 LR – The universal caliber for target shooting and close range small game hunting 
17 HMR – A high velocity varmint cartridge with excellent ballistics up to 150 yards 
22 WMR – The most powerful of the Sako Quad calibres. A good small game and varmint cartridge.

It was made in the famous Soviet factory of Izhevsk. The very early HEX receiver rifles are getting quite hard to find and are stronger and more reliable than the round receiver rifles. This is a fabulous rifle with a barrel that has strong rifling and grooves. The rifle has all matching serial numbers with the mag plate an electro-pencil match and is in excellent shape! This rifle will make a great shooter. I will ship the rifle anywhere in the country (to an FFL or C&R) but I prefer a face to face sale in Arkansas. I will do a bill of sale requiring DLN and date of birth of Arkansas residents. I will also accept a Concealed Weapons License number on the bill of sale which would eliminate a DLN and Date of Birth. Thank you!

I have two black powder guns I don't shoot much that I'm looking to sell to fund other purchases. The $300 price is for both guns. I am willing to sell them separately.

Gun #1 - Pietta 1851 nickel-plated black powder revolver. It is .44 caliber. It takes #10 caps (or you can crimp #11 caps with your fingers to make them oval and they'll work). It has a steel frame. I think it's very attractive, though you can definitely tell it's not new. There is some black powder fouling that I haven't been able to scrub out, and a few minor scratches. You could see it as ""antiquing"" if you want, it's a matter of perspective ... I think 1851 revolvers are some of the most attractive and best-balanced guns I've ever held, and I think the nickel finish looks extra nice. Again, please don't expect this to look like new - some wear is accounted for in the price.

Gun #2 - CVA Frontier Carbine. 24"" barrel, .50 cal. Very handy percussion cap rifle (#11 caps). Shoots patched .490 ball or maxi-balls (I'll include some with the sale). 50 grains of FFX or equivalent for a light target load, 80 or so grains for more range and power. I've been told it can handle 100 grains, but I haven't tried. Blued barrel and handsome wooden stock with brass hardware. This is a good-looking carbine in excellent condition.

There are no legal requirements for black powder sales, just be a decent person. Email if interested and I'll take some pictures.

Ive got a really nice I.O. Inc Polish Ak 47 rifle that has the following:

-PWS JTAC 47 Muzzle Brake
-Magpul MS2 FDE Sling
-Arsenal Polymer Warsaw Pact AK Stock Set (same as Arsenal SGL series ak rifles)
-Russian Cleaning kit in buttstock
-Six 30 Round Serbian steel ak mags (has last round bolt hold open followers in them, as is standard for factory serb mags)
-One 40 round steel ak mag (guess is romanian, def combloc manufacture though)
-249 total rounds of 7.62x39mm (only 24 rounds are traditional steel case, 45 rounds are remingtion/winchester brass reloadable, and the rest are zinc plated silver bear ammo)
- Custom krylon camo finish on rifle and mags lol (can be easily removed with goo gone if you desire, personally it looks pretty good)

This entire package is the same price as what the base rifle costs with 2 crapco ak mags current price. This is all HIGH quality stuff, not fun show junk that was haphazardly put on a bottom bin ak. This is a earlier polish ak (barrel is factory chrome line and hammer forged as is standard for russian, polish, and bulgarian factory ak rifles; Receiver is Polish; All the rivets, weldings, etc are properly done per polish factory standards) that came in to the country as a barreled receiver and was ""assembled"" by I.O. (as in all they did was put a tapco g2 trigger in it, and put their stock set on it). This is a very well made rifle that will service you in any fashion you desire and you have everything ready to go to start shooting and have a nice battle set up. The price is at a VERY fair $850, as im not looking to sit on my throne and demand panic era prices and let it sit covered in dust. This is priced to sell, and you need to act fast to get it as there are NO other deals like this in the springfield area. You can email me or text/call at 417-413-8five0seven (texting is better during the day), and again send me a email asap as this wont be here for long!!"

$17 each, 20 available.

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches."

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.




Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.




Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.




Made in U.S.A.

•Next-generation impact and crush resistant polymer construction

My M&P has only had 560 rounds through it and has had no problems to speak of, but I would prefer something different for my carry gun.
It comes with the factory case, lock, backstraps, paperwork, and THREE mags (these are pretty hard to find right now and pricey when you can find them), one with the pinky extension and two with the flat base.  Also comes with a leather OWB holster.

I am primarily interested in trades.  I am particularly interested in an XD40 in any size, though I would prefer the service model or sub compact.  Would also be interested in a Glock 22, 23, or 27, or a 1911 with a 4 or 5 inch barrel.  May add some cash for the right trade.  I am very open to trades though, I would consider just about any quality firearm in .40 or .45, not really wanting anything in 9mm though.  Feel free to let me know what you have, the worst I can say is no.
No Hi points or revolvers (already have some of each).

Otherwise I will sell for $450.  Thats $100 under retail with an extra magazine ($40 value) and a leather OWB holster if you want it ($35 value).
I am a motivated seller/trader, I would love to make a deal this weekend.

I am selling my .308 Remington R25 rifle with some accessories. The gun works and looks great. It does have a little rubbed off paint on the forearm of the gun, but other than that, it is in great condition. It has a threaded, bull barrel(not standard for this model) and a scope. I have it sighted it in at 200 yards, and it is very accurate for a semi-automatic rifle.

I am including the gun, the P.E.P.R. rings, scope with a sun shield, a 2-point sling, recoil pad, a 5-round clip, four 20-round magazines, and a box of ammo.

I'm asking $2,650.

For fastest response, call or text me at REDACTED 

I can meet in Cookeville, Nashville, or anywhere in between relatively easy. If you're farther away, we can talk about possibly meeting somewhere in between.

Possibly the coolest you will ever see.  I also bought a picatinny scope mount for it.  This is not your standard laser.  Most that you will find are around 5 to 50 mW's.  This laser is 3 watts and will burn wood and pop balloons on contact at close range (see my youtube video at http://youtu.be/CYE2HKnViiw).  It has a light range of over 8 miles and can be seen from space.  I will be traveling to Birmingham this weekend and will be back in Mobile next week and would be possibly interested in a trade for guns or ammo of equal value.  
Disclaimer: this is NOT a toy and is never to be pointed at aircraft and moving vehicles.  This laser can cause severe burned or blindness if used improperly.    This laser should be used with safety like you would with a firearm.  The laser comes with a pair of safety glasses."

Rifle has warranty and any work or tuning or accessories you want added, just bring the rifle to them and they will take good care of you.
Frog Lube used for wear protection.
Less than 200 rounds range fired just to break in and zero the sight.
It is a multi receiver so shoots 2.23 and 5.56.
Has a YHM (Yankee Hill Machine) low profile micro gas block added to accommodate the quad rail. Quad Rail is nice durable but lightweight aircraft aluminum. Gas block and quad were installed on site at HDP.
I have between 600-800 rounds of AMMO that will go with the sale from HORNADAY, Remmington to PMC.
Rifle is flawless and shoots wonderfully.
For absolutely everything mentioned above I will take the first $1250 cash in my hand.

Possible trades considered would only be for Motorcycle parts or work. For parts I would be looking for a set of ape hangers for my 1997 HD Road King and maybe some other items for my bike. I would actually like to have my bike painted so that is an option as well.
I prefer cash and have upwards of $2100 in this set up.

Can send more pics or even meet you at a range to test fire. you wil know when you see this rifle how clean and nice it really is.
Call me, bring $1250 and you have a great ""assault rifle"" or ""sporting carbine"" with plenty of ammo to hit the range or prepare for the zombie takeover.

The M952V Millennium Universal WeaponLight attaches by means of an integral Swing-Lever rail clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail.

Changing back and forth from white output to infrared output is accomplished by a push/twist action on the M952V head, which self-locks into the selected output mode.

Surefire HL1ATN HL1 Tactical Helmet Light 123A Tan 19

SureFire LED Helmet Light HL1 provides a compact, hands-free, low-output illumination source. The SureFire Helmet Light is ideal for navigation and close-quarter work like reading maps and documents, loading gear, or repairing equipment in the field. Surefire makes this LED flashlight from tough, weatherproof Nitrolon polymer and equips it with virtually indestructible light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The lightweight SureFire HL1 Headlamp attaches directly to the side of any TC 2000 MICH (Modular Integrated Communications Helmet). SureFire HL1 Watertight Helmet Flashlight uses a single 123A lithium battery and six LEDs to produce three different types of light at multiple power levels. This compact, multiple-output LED Helmet Light by Sure-Fire features three white or yellow-green LEDs, two blue / red / IR LEDs, and one blinking red infrared LED that serves as a personal Identify Friend or Foe beacon. The white LEDs are perfect for general-purpose, close-work illumination; the blue lights of the Surefire light serve the same purpose in a low-signature, night-vision-friendly color. Sure Fire HL1 Tactical Head Flashlight attaches via a special mount that clamps semi-permanently to the rim of the helmet by means of two socket-head machine screws. Once attached, the flashlight can be easily slid onto the mount, where locks into place; depressing a small lever slides the Surefire headlamp right off. While designed primarily for military and SWAT applications, the SureFire Helmetlight is also an option for caving, climbing, construction, or search-and-rescue operations - pretty much any activity involving wearing a helmet and requiring low-output, hands-free illumination. Available in tan or black models.

I got The Gun a while back After An officer friend of mine to Sold it to an FFL so i Could Buy itWhen FN Herstal Makes A Law Enforcement Firearm they change out a lot of the guns parts to make it not only shoot better but also shoot cleaner last longer, & Reduce Trigger Pull also giving it a tougher specialty Barrel, A Speciality Hammer Release that works Differently then the normal one, & A lot more to make it a super fast and Reliable firearm Plus a lot more. 
These are Super rare not just because it's a LEO but also they are no longer made. I love the gun but I don't use it much and there are lot of gun i've been interested in getting so i figured i would barter for one. The  FNP9-M LEO actually has a really low round count  around 100 Rounds, So it looks and Shoot like new even though i have had it for a while its mostly sat in a Humidity Controlled safe.

The Bushmaster C15 is a unique modernization of the traditional AR-15 utilizing space age composite materials. Composites have been the primary focus of advancements in firearms innovation for several decades now because they are lighter and stronger than heavier aluminum or steel. Composites are also far more resistant to weather and moisture as well making them more rugged and durable too. The barrel and other critical steel parts are manganese-phosphate-finished for corrosion and rust protection. The Carbon 15's lightweight 14.5"" M4 profile barrel is made of chrome-lined chromemoly steel and includes an Izzy flash suppressor pinned and welded in place to achieve the 16"" overall barrel length.

I took this gun in on a trade, but already have a carry pistol. If you know guns, you know this pistol and it's quality. The trigger is one of the best you'll find on a pistol this size, the slide locks back on empty and there is no manual safety so the profile is very  slim. The CM40 is one of the best carry and conceal guns on the market. This is not a gun for beginners.

I'm asking $425 or best offer for the gun. MSRP is $517 and Cheaper Than Dirt lists them at $529 (before shipping and FFL fees). I also have a box of Remmington Golden Saber hollow points that I'll sell you at half price ($13.50) if you need some ammo to go with the gun. I won't sell them ammo separate though, sorry. I'll listen to trade offers, but I'm only interested in complete guns, no parts. Pretty much anything else, I'm open to. Exact specs are listed below. Feel free to ask me any questions you've got.

So you can see this is very versatile gun and there no others as versatile. This gun is new and comes in a case. REDACTED please don't call after 9pm

I also have a .22 long rifle conversion for $200.00 they cost $265.00. So you can switch this gun out to shoot ,22 long rifle. It as simple as changing the slide and magazine and now your ready to shoot .22 long rifle. I also have home defense ammo in .45acp. Plus i have ammo that used for snakes which is like a shot gun shell round but in .45acp and other .45acp ammo.

This handgun is based on a beefed up CZ-75 platform and is one of the best designs in the world.Unlike most other semi-automatic pistols, the Witness slide rides inside the frame rails rather than outside, similar to the SIG P210.This provides a very tight slide-to-frame fit, very good barrel lock-up and contributes to better accuracy.

There also other slide, top end kits you can buy to change this gun to shot. The 9 mm , .38 super auto. .40 S&W, .10 mm auto, and yes this gun can handle 10 mm because it is beefed up to also handle 10 mm.Another capability that the interchangeable top end groups provide is the different slide/barrel lengths. The shorter ""Compact"" top end can be mounted on the Standard frame, and vice versa. So if you want to make it more compact you can in any caliber. There is also other calibers conversions being offered for this gun in .357 SIG, 9x21, 9x23, .400 Corbon. There is also large frame .40 S&W barrels offered which are used to convert a 10 mm slide to .40S&W. With no other parts needed for this caliber conversion. You can use a 10 mm slide and magazines with this large frame  .40S&W barrel to run .40 S&W ammo. Do some research and you to will see this gun was given high marks by some of the top gun experts."
