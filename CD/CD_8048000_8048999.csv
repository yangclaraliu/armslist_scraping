I swapped the rear sight over, so there is no rear sight. The only issue is the front sight screw is stripped. I tried to remove it to swap it over as well, but it ended up stripping on me. Just swap the rear sight over from your existing mark iv and you are good to go. 
Again, Please note that this is for the receiever/barrel only. Not the entire gun. This is a Mark IV, it will only fit other Mark IV lowers or Mark IV 22/45 lowers.

The holster is nothing special but it has a -super- strong clip. Strong enough that I can clip it to my sweats when I'm bummin' it at the grocery store. So I'm tossing it in.This is my EDC so it's showing a lot of wear on the slide finish. I recently went to the leather holster because my old Alien Gear kydex was rubbing the polymer around the pic rail. This gun runs FLAWLESS with every kind of ammo from cheap white box to Rip rounds and SpX hollows. Features an external hammer and safety decocker. This gun is DA/SA with second strike capability(but I've never used it because I've never had a light primer strike on this firearm!)Racking the slide is smooth as silk! And the trigger pull is not bad for a double action banger.Price is firm. I'll entertain trade offers but my wife might give me the evil eye.Must have current/valid CWP or be willing to sign a bill of sale with your address and license #."

This beauty has tons of mods, and could def be a competition gun. I started with the BCG and installed the Voltquarten ""Talon"" ejector wich has a stronger spring, I changed out the ejector pin to Voltquartsen as well as spring, then installed the Tandemcross titanium firing pin and upgraded heavier striker spring, which removes the worry of misfires due to a light strikes or offset contact... I also installed the Voltquartsen accurizing kit which comes complete with their CNC Machined Disconnector, Target Hammer, Hammer Bushing, Target Sear, Target Trigger with steel plunger and properly adjusted spring weight. It also comes with pretravel and overtravel adjustments. Then instead of using to curved Volts trigger I installed the flat Tamdemcross skeletonized trigger to allow for a better trigger feel. Honestly, you have to feel this trigger to believe it, it is a joy to shoot. But I've only put 50-100 rounds down range with it and I believe this would be the perfect .22 for the rivht person. I'm so busy that when I do go to the range im practicing with conealed carry. Oh yeah it has the wooden grips for target shooting (i have originals) and an extended slide release on it to make it easy to reach with fat grips. It feels great in the hand. Comes with 2 mags and I'd give you some ammo but I'm all out of .22 rounds. Lastly i got rid of the pesky mag ""safety"" outfit, so no fussing with that. I'm asking $600. I figured that was fair for a Nearnly brand new Mark 4 Target with all the upgrades and time I put into it. Please don't come to me saying I'll pay 300 today, I will happily entertain reasonable offers but crazy lowballers will be ignored. Hit me up on here also my number is REDACTED text plzl. Thank you for taking the time to look at my offerings!Oh yeah and it comes with the optic in the pics, it's actually very accurate for a sightmark. It can run a bunch of different reticles and has 5 brightness settings in red and 5 in green. If you decide to go open sights or put some real cash in to an optic this thing is lethally accurate with it's big bull Barrell. Finally this gun is not a good gun for self defense, the trigger is way to light! Be warned..Just dropped price to 500 firm.

From Arsenals Web Site:  Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.  Arsenal's Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal's hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.  Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal's meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.  Summary: SAM7R-51 | 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, Arsenal, Inc.'s US made hammer forged and machined trigger that features a wider trigger grip for more comfort on the shooter's finger and a Bulgarian Warsaw Pact length buttstock, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, scope rail, one 10-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

The improvement reduces projectile deformation as it passes through the bore during the firing sequence and the projectile stays uniform instead of squeezing material on opposite side grooves. Hence, the more uniform projectile, the better the accuracy.   All Finished Barrels go through a 100% Inspection Process.   Inspections Equipment includes CMMs and Air Gauges for the Bores.   Our expectations is that our Barrels, 16 inch or longer, will hold a 1.000"" MOA at 100 yards with appropriate ammo and shooting techniques.
