99,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1857099,For Sale/Trade:  Springfield P9 competition gun package deal,"Mineral Springs/Monroe, Charlotte, North Carolina","$ 1,100","Listed On: Thursday, July 25, 2013",Handguns,Springfield                                                                                ,no type,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Price Drop: I've got a WICKED bad Springfield P9 in 9x21 I'd be willing to sell or trade.  VERY accurate gun, it has a WCPI (World Class Pistols Inc.) 6 inch barrel, long slide with no porting, compensator (with 3 ports), short single action trigger, skeleton hammer, ambi safety, extended mag release, scope mount with carbon fiber side panel, Tasco PRO point red dot scope, wood checkered grips (very slim and comfortable), and this one has the rounded style trigger guard as opposed to the more squared off version sometimes seen on the custom P9's.  Pistol comes with 4 weighted factory type 17 round mags and I'll toss in someone's ""bubbafied"" high capacity mag that still needs some TLC to sort it out (fits, but jams about half through a full load).  For the re loader/competitive shooter I've got (if the math is right) 1,915 brass 9x21 casings... 1,637 of those are brand new unprimed brass Starfire, 84 once fired brass casings, 197 new primed casings.  I also have 4 or 5 boxes of Winchester and Fiocchi 9x21 factory loaded rounds, and I probably have a bag of 50-100 or more of my own once fired factory brass that I managed to pick up at the range out back.  I'm just thinning the pistol herd a bit, not hard up to sell this baby.  Cash value on this one I'll say $1,250 or I would work some trades for rifle or rifle/pistol combo.  All laws must be followed, CCW or pistol purchase permit required.  This would either be an excellent gun for competitive shooting or a great piece for someone's collection.  WCPI pistols are fairly rare and were built by the well respected George Huening.  Many of his parts are still used by competitors today, he was very cutting edge at the time and his guns, scope mounts, etc. were in many magazines back when he was first building (he's back into shooting I see with his son).  Also this gun will fire 9x19 rounds, but acted up on me last time I tried it with a Jericho/Mossad type mag... it ran fine with 9x19 in the Springfield P9 mags the other times I've fired 9mm, so I think it was just that mag.  I generally run 9x21 though the gun but have tested on occasion with 9mm on several occasions... only had feeding issues with the one mag and only had the one spare Jericho mag on me that day to test with."

It will come with original case, paperwork, lock, the two extra back straps and three 15rd glock factory mags. Also trigger guard has been professionally undercut to allow you to get a higher grip purchase. I am only looking to trade for a few things that I will list below all other offers will be ignored and I'm not interested in cash. The only reason I want to trade is that I carry this regularly and now that it is summer the gen4 grip is rubbing me the wrong way literally. The gen 4 is about $100 to $150 more that the gen 3 and its worth it for the reduced recoil due to the double recoil spring so I think anyone who trades with me will be getting a good deal.

Used only once or twice.  No need to wait months for one.  Price is $100.

The paragraph below is from the Milt Sparks website. 

""The Nexus has several new features as well as some old tried and true. The most unique feature being our new self closing, neodymium magnetic loop (Patent Pending) that has the same holding attributes as the traditional one-way snap, but is much easier to align and fasten to the belt. The steel cup portion of the closure shields the belt from putting direct pressure on the loop closure that might cause accidental separation as sometimes happens with regular snaps. And because you don’t need to allow for additional room in the loop like you would need to work the one-way snap, a smaller, closer fitting loop can be had with less slop.""

The Wilson Combat is an OWB Lo-Profile shark skin holster for 1911 models 4"" to 4.25"" with a 1.5"" belt.  Typically out of stock on Wilson's site.  Used very little.  Very comfortable and looks great.  Price is $140.  

Both holsters look like new and have been used very little.  Only selling because I just sold my Kimber Pro Carry, so I have no use for them.  If someone is interested in both, I'd take $220 for them."

 ANTI-GUN SENATOR SHOOTS INTRUDER - YA GOTTA LOVE IT!

One more reason to vote all of them out of office.

http://tpo.net/anti_gun_senator/Senator.jpg

State Senator R.C. Soles (D - NC)

Long time Anti-Gun Advocate State Senator R.C. Soles, 74, shot one

of two intruders at his home just outside Tabor City, N.C. about 5 pm

Sunday, the prosecutor for the politician's home county said. The

intruder, Kyle Blackburn, was taken to a South Carolina hospital, but the

injuries were not reported to be life-threatening, according to Rex Gore,

district attorney for Columbus, Bladen and Brunswick counties.

The State Bureau of Investigation and Columbus County Sheriff's

Department are investigating the shooting, Gore said.  Soles, who was

not arrested, declined to discuss the incident Sunday evening.""I am not

in a position to talk to you,"" Soles said by telephone. ""I'm right in the middle

of an investigation.

""The Senator, who has made a career of being against gun ownership

for the general public, didn't hesitate to defend himself with his own gun

when he believed he was in immediate danger and he was the victim.  In

typical hypocritical liberal fashion, the ""Do as I say and not as I do"" Anti-Gun

Activist Lawmaker picked up his gun and took action in what apparently was

a self-defense shooting. Why hypocritical you may ask? It is because his

long legislative record shows that the actions that he took to protect his

family, his own response to a dangerous life threatening situation, are actions

that he feels ordinary citizens should not have if they were faced with an

identical situation. It has prompted some to ask if the Senator believes

his life and personal safety is more valuable than yours or mine. But this

is to be expected from those who believe they can run our lives, raise our

kids and protect our families better than we can.

Description

P2XD-A-BK
The P2X Fury Defender is a single-output version of our dual-output, pocket-sized Fury searchlight, and it also features a crenellated Strike Bezel® that can be used as a last line of defense in an emergency. Its precision micro-textured reflector shapes the light from its high-performance LED into a smooth, far-reaching 500-lumen beam with a bright central area that can temporarily blind an aggressor.

Ok guys this is a true rarity for this forum and most others too.  What I have is a GA Precision HRT RIFLE. this company makes some of the most sought after precision weapons out there. They aren't easy to get, they have extremely long waiting periods and they are expensive. But it's all for good reason. This is a world class weapon guaranteed to shoot sub 3/8 inch groups and it will do much better than that.    This is the exact gun used by the FBI HRT Team.  It's all hand fitted, tuned and Ceracoated.   It has their legendary Templar action and One piece Billet bolt that has been custom fluted.  It has a Bartlein 22"" barrel with An MTU contour.  This is a freakin Hammer.  It's set up in a McMillan A3-5 stock. It has a custom tuned Jewell trigger and man is it tuned!   This weapon isn't even fully broken in and its already becoming silly smooth.   It comes with a Durefire Muzzle brake/ suppressor adaptor installed.    It has a Nightforce NXS F1 3.5-15 power scope.  This is a front focal plane scope. Illuminated reticle. ZeroStop and Hi Speed turrets.  It was professionally installed in lapped TPS tactical scope rings.  It has a scope level installed as well.    AI 5 round magazine and Atlas bipod attached to an Atlas rail with QD flush cup.  The stock has 5 flush cups. 

I will also include a T.A.B. gear sniper sling with QD attachments

I am looking for $6,250 OBO for the setup. I will take trades on high end weapons. 

The round count is under 400. All match ammo.

Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space

I prefer semi-autos, so I don't find myself using this much. I have only shot about 20rds through it, and it functions without issue. Finish was rated at 70-79% by Bud's -- these are Police trade-ins from years back. I'll try to get pictures up tonight.

Going with the revolver will be a black Desantis leather holster (pancake w/ thumb break) and about 130rds of Geco .38SPL (hard cast lead bullets), since I will no longer need those without the revolver.

I've got just about $470 into the package after shipping on everything and transfer fees, so I'd like to see $400 for all of it. I'm firm on that price for now, and not interested in any trades. I'd rather just free up the cash for other projects. I'm OK with a FTF for NH residents w/ a pistol permit and bill of sale. If you prefer doing an FFL transfer, you'll have to pay the fee."

I also have 820 rounds of military 556 red tracer rounds and 200 hornady red tip rounds that can be included

For the gun and mags I am asking $1600

With over 1000 rounds I ask $2000.

It is a Stevens SXS 12 gauge. Due to the way it was marked I believe it is 1930's production, but I could be wrong, however, Stevens dropped the ""Springfield"" name in 1948, so it is no newer than that. My father purchased it in the 60's and even then it was clearly very old. The Trigger guard is a Replacement and the rear screw probably needs a better match (just a cosmetic flaw), however the rest is all original and in extremely nice condition for something of this age. This version has the Tennite stock which is rare to find uncracked, however ours is in top shape. Photo's are at the link below

*Note: Not sure how this will affect shipping, but being this old, this gun has NO Serial number of any kind on it.

For sale is a gently used Savage Model 10FP with an Osprey 10-40x50 scope and a Harris style bipod. The rifle has seen about 100 rounds and is in excellent condition--it still even has the factory sticker on the stock! The only blemish is a very small cut on the bottom corner of the rubber recoil pad. Savage does not make these anymore--they were the predecessors to the current Models FP-SR and FCP. The scope is an Osprey 10-40x50 with red/green illumination, externally adjustable turrets at 1/8 MOA increments, and a one piece mount. The original box, lock, and literature will be included.

More pictures can be seen here:

http://www.ar15.com/forums/t_7_93/1194250_.html&page=1

The rifle has a 24"" free floated bull barrel with a 1:10 twist that will effortlessly deliver sub-MOA groups all day long. It also has an enlarged bolt handle and a 4+1 capacity. It is equipped with Savage's adjustable AccuTrigger, which is currently set at around 1.5-2 lbs with no pretravel, a very crisp break, and minimal overtravel.

I am looking to trade for any of the following: 

AKM/47/74
HK USP in .45 or 9mm
Kimber 1911
Sig 220
FN in .45
NO AR-15's

Great condition. Clean.. the finish is still in great shape. The shotgun is well cared for. I flitz polish the action parts and also the chamber to ensure smooth extraction. If this is something you do for your guns you can appreciate the hours and hours of care taken. A really well maintained shotgun. Very dependable. Comes already full camo finish. This is not a home defense shotgun. This is a turkey/trap shooting shotgun. I would reach for this in a heart beat if my life was on the line. My Mossberg 9200 goes for around $500 +/- on gunbroker with asking prices into the 600's. I am putting a $450 value on it but I would bet those on gun broker are not cared for or tuned anywhere near what this is. Also no ffl and no shipping fees with mine. Will also send a couple boxes of brass end shells. Not the cheap aluminum stuff.

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights.

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."

BE CAREFULL!

A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any why! 

A little bit about Damascus steel

Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded together. Then folded and the same process is done until the maker is satisfied with the amount of layers usually between 352 & 512  layers depending on the maker. The Damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.
Mine are made with an average of 512 LAYERS

The following steel will provide bright lines:
1.)	15N20 -- nickel content  

The following steel will provide dark lines:
      2.) 1084

There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.


•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.

A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any why! 

A little bit about Damascus steel

Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded together. Then folded and the same process is done until the maker is satisfied with the amount of layers usually between 352 & 512  layers depending on the maker. The Damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.


•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.

A Lot of the knives you see on the net are “Wall hanger s” or “Decoration pieces!” That’s why they are so cheap, they just try to make them look “COOL” or “Deadly” But they are more deadly to the owner because they will not hold up. I believe, that if I own any knife or machete it has to be a fully functioning workhorse or why would want it. It would be like having a gun with no bullets -WHAT GOOD IS IT! I should just put a poster on the wall! My items are for everyday use if needed “BUT” nice enough to put on the wall and show them off if you want to! But when and if you need it, you can trust that it will do the unexpected if need be! You can Stake your life on it and know it won’t let you down in any why! 

A little bit about Damascus steel

Damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels). The billets are heated and welded together. Then folded and the same process is done until the maker is satisfied with the amount of layers usually between 352 & 512  layers depending on the maker. The Damascus is then acid-etched. The different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. 

•	Johnson’s paste wax can be used on the blade handle and sheath to protect it.  Birchwood Casey gunstock wax is another alternative for the sheath.


•	If your sheath gets wet, don’t store the knife in it.


•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.

D2 STEEL

D2 is sometimes called a ""semi-stainless"". It has fairly high chrome content (12%), but not high enough to classify it as stainless. It is more stain resistant than the carbon steels however, it has excellent wear resistance. D2 is much tougher than the premium stainless steels like ATS-34, but not as tough as many of the other non-stainless steels. The combination of great wear resistance, almost-stainlessness, and good toughness make it a great choice for a number of machete & knife styles. 


There are some tips for you to look after your knives
•	Never store your knives for long periods in the leather sheath. Leather can absorb water, which will rust the knife.

•	After use, wash the blade, dry it, and use Flitz, WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust.

•	These Sheaths are made of fresh Cowhide Leather. So always coat your knife with WD-40, vegetable oil, or Vaseline, Gun oil on the blade to prevent rust. For the first couple months. To give the leather time to age and release any moisture from the tanning process.
