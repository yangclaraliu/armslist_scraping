I have spent the last year and a half building this light machine gun for my “end of days gun” and I despise the idea of parting with it but something has come up that I can not ignore so I must part with it.  For those of you who don’t know the galil arm is a .223 caliber light machine gun model of the galil family, and is fitted with an integrated bi pod/barbwire cutter and a longer barrel than any other model. It is also fitted with a ventilated wood handgaurd to keep it cool during sustained fire.  The arm model was normally used with the 50 round magazines of winch I have 3 it will come with a standerd 35 round magazine,  but the interesting thing is that there is an adapter to make it accept any M16 or AR15 type magazine winch is one of the many reasons I chose this particular gun to defend myself and everything I care about.  Weather its the rock solid AK action or the flip up tritium night sights or even the built in bottle opener (yea it relay has one) the galil arm is the gun that I wanted by my side but I have more pressing matters.  The gun itself is nearly complete only a few minor finishing details, the biggest of winch is that the receiver still needs to be Parkerizing.  Other than that its minor thing that only the most detail oriented of us need worry about.  If you are willing to wait I will Parkerizing the receiver for you but I must receive payment as soon as possible but I only need half now and the other half later.

Let me help you. 

You're probably asking yourself ""Why do I want a Nagant? Why wouldn't I just buy myself a .308?"" Well let me answer that for you... ammo prices. Yep shop around on the ammo. You can shoot this gun for right about what it cost to shoot your grandpa's 22. Sure that's a slight exaggeration but seriously, you can shoot these things all day long for little of nothing. Plus you probably like the nostalgia of a gun that helped decide WW2.

Why this one? Well look at it. The standard Mosin Nagants are UGLY... this one isn't. Plus it's a 1942, which is a fine vintage. And it's one of the better built Tula guns. And there's the chance it might have the faint sniper markings over the star, which means it would be one of the more accurate M91/30s. And the bore is great. And it already has a scope, bayonet, ammo pouches, and just enough ammo with it to put a smile on your face. Oh and all the numbers match.

Also comes with the original wooden stock which I didn't take a pic of because they're hideous. Feel free to email me questions, concerns, recipes, pics of your beautiful wife, or information on the gun you want to trade me."

For sale only is one used Argentinian Ballester Molina 45 ACP 1911 style handgun. This resembles a regular 1911 although only the barrels and grips are interchangeable as far as I know. It has the same weight and feel as a 1911 but has no grip safety. This weapon has been refinished in a nice overall parkerizing. It has basic military style small sights. It functions flawlessly. Comes with two magazines and a second pair of unfinished wood grips. This would be perfect for anyone looking for a basic 45 ACP pistol. It is not designed for pin point accuracy but would definitely do the job for personal protection and plinking.

The Arcus 98DA is a double action semi-automatic pistol manufactured by Arcus. It draws heavily from the Browning Hi-Power, via Arcus' previous Arcus 94 clone. There is a compact version, the Arcus 98DAC. The 98DAC uses standard 13-round Hi-Power magazines, but the 98DA uses slightly longer 15-round magazines.

Local purchase information:
All federal and state laws apply. Buyer must complete ATF form 4473 and pass a standard background check in person. Ohio sales tax will be collected from Ohio buyer. Please be sure the information on your driver's license is correct so that we can accept that for required identification purposes. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply; cash and check price is what is listed. 

Out of State purchase information:
We will complete out of state sales by transferring the gun to your local FFL holder who will then complete the paperwork and background check. Shipping is normally $30, which covers packaging, shipping costs, tracking numbers, and insurance to the lower 48 states. Know your state gun laws before buying as there are no returns on this item. 3.5% credit card processing fees apply, money order/certified check price is what is listed.

Warranty and Return information:
 If there is a manufacturing defect, the repair will be handled by the manufacturer's warranty or through our distributor's warranty. This firearm has a lifetime warranty through our distributor, and we will provide the warranty paperwork with your gun.

Contact us:
Please contact David Greer with Free Republic Firearms at REDACTED or by phone at REDACTED with any questions. To get updates of our new arrivals, ""like"" our Facebook page, and visit www.freerepublicfirearms.com for more information. If you contact us via email, please include your name and phone number to eliminate spammers and to ensure we can contact you. Lately we have been having problems with messages from hidden email addresses that are sent through gun listing/auction sites. The emails are being returned as undeliverable, so if we don't respond to your email, please make sure we have another way to contact you.  We do not hold firearms, because people do not always follow through with purchases, and we can lose guaranteed sales if a firearm is not available because we’re holding it for someone.

Trades:
We will consider firearms trades, but we cannot give a value on a gun unless we see it in person. Please realize will cannot pay full retail for your firearm. We are a business, and there has to be room for us to make a small amount when we resell the firearm.

Extra information:
To all the spammers and criminals that can't legally buy guns, don't contact us asking to meet in a parking lot to complete a cash sale, or to trade a stolen laptop or other electronics for our guns. You shouldn't have guns, and we're definitely not going to help you get one.  To those who are under the legal age to buy firearms or handguns, we understand your desire to have a gun, but we will not break the law to sell you one, so please don't ask. We believe that if an 18 year old is old enough to fight for our country in the armed forces, they should be able to buy a gun. But until a little common sense is used in Washington DC, we cannot sell handguns to anyone under 21, and long guns to anyone under 18."

Winchester Model 1894 (also known as Winchester .30-30 rifle, Winchester 94, Win 94,, .30-30 Winchester, or simply .30-30) is a lever-action rifle which became one of the most famous and popular hunting rifles. It was designed by John Browning in 1894 to chamber .30 caliber rounds loaded with smokeless powder, and was produced by Winchester Repeating Arms Company through 1980 and then by U.S. Repeating Arms under the Winchester brand until they ceased to manufacture rifles in 2006. The rifles are back in production today, being made by the Miroku company of Japan and imported into the United States by the Browning Arms company of Morgan, Utah.

The Model 1894 has been referred to as the ""ultimate lever-action design"" by firearms historians such as RL Wilson and Hal Herring. The Model 1894 is the rifle credited with the name ""Winchester"" being used to refer to all rifles of this type and was the first commercial sporting rifle to sell over 7,000,000 units.[1]"

About 10% were selected and verified with a Wilson case gauge. 5 pieces were measured with caliper and separately bagged. Pic shows cases you will actually receive, not a file photo. As you can see, these take a bit of work to get just right and I pride myself on the finished product.

Title says it all. Excellent condition. Pistol: Taurus 'Raging Bull' nickel plated .444, 8 3/8"" barrel 5 Shot Revolver. Less than 15 rds fired. Great shooting gun with TONS of penetration and KNOCK-DOWN power! I bought this just a few months ago as my hunting gun. I can’t hit squat with it. At 70 I find I need a riffle with a POWERFUL scope to even get close. This pistol can be fitted with a scope or reflex sight for hunting or simply use the fixed sights for home defense. 8 3/8” barrel with muzzle porting. 5 shot 44 mag. comes with nylon shoulder holster. Factory box and security keys also included.

The Original Raging Bulls are still among America's favorite hunting handguns. Chambering the popular and powerful .44 Magnum rounds, the mighty 444 revolvers are built for a lifetime of tough use. Offering award-winning designs in four distinct barrel lengths, these monsters feature a crisp trigger break and smooth pull for accuracy, cushioned grips and factory porting to reduce felt recoil.

Dual lockup cylinder
Provides stability under extreme chamber pressures.
Cushioned insert grip
Exclusive on the RAGING ™ Series large frame revolvers, Cushioned insert grip pillows recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
Porting
Referred to as factory tuned porting and gas expansion chamber for recoil and makes shooting comfort a reality.
Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear."

Six different ergonomic combinations can be created by changing the grip circumference and trigger style. All-black (not shown) or bi-tone finish. Siglite® contrast sights provide target acquisition in any lighting situation. All models feature quick takedown with no tools required.

Richards Double 12 gauge,"Nw Suburbs, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota",$ 1,"Listed On: Tuesday, March 26, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Let me start by saying I have not fired either guns. And you should have a qualified gunsmith examine if you are going to fire. 

After saying that I believe the .22 J Stevens to be a ""gallery gun"" from 1910 to 1920. And being a gallery gun it was never meant for hi-power/velocity modern rounds. I believe it to take CB rounds. CB's are a bullet in the case and no powder, just the primer. So I repeat you cannot shoot modern ammo through this gun. Ok as for the gun itself. Action works, trigger works has the sights and it looks like everything is original. The furniture: The forearm/slide is really nice for its age. The wrist has a chunk missing and is wired and taped up. The rest of the stock is ok. It has dents a crack and a few gouges. 

The 12 Gauge: I think it's a twelve. Has everything, except a screw to hold on one of the hammers. Side by side barrels actually look silver. But only because, in my opinion looks like someone took some steel wool to them. Maybe going to blue it? Double triggers work, exposed hammers work, pins are there and work but are a bit sticky. Made by W. Richards. Not to be confused with Westley Richards. I think about 1890??? Must be black Powder and not meant for modern high pressure ammo. 

I personally will not shoot these guns and consider them wallhangers.

The rifle fires the potent 5.7X28mm round, which depending on bullet choice, is a perfect varmint round but can also penetrate Level IIIA body armor. The magazine capacity is 50 rounds and this auction comes with a total of three original manufacturer (AR-Five-Seven) Magazines. That is 150 rounds in three magazines! This is previously owned, but has fired only a couple of boxes of ammo. The AR Five-Seven upper has picatinny rails on the top, bottom, and sides. These are currently equipped with mostly Knights Armaments Inserts. The Lower receiver is a Tactical Innovations T15-BDX milled receiver with integral trigger-guard. This is one of the best and strongest receivers available, and is marked “multi-caliber” so that you are not constrained to any particular caliber. If you want 22 LONG RIFLE, 9mm LUGER, 5.56 NATO/.223 REM, 50 Beowulf or any caliber upper in-between which can fit a standard AR/15 receiver, you can fit it to the T15-BDX. The trigger is an upgrade over the standard AR trigger. It also has an ERGO grip pistol-grip and a BUSHMASTER collapsible butt-stock. Although it has all this versatility, you probably will want to leave it just like it is, because this is a great performer, and the higher magazine capacity definitely outweighs the slightly greater power of the 5.56 NATO round. Also, because the magazine is on the top, you can slightly modify a standard AR-15 magazine (without follower or spring) to act as a brass catcher, since the expended casings fall down through the magazine well. There are a number of situations where leaving spent casings scattered around is a distinct disadvantage. Other than statements made herein, there are no representations except that you will get the firearm in the pictures if you make the winning bid and comply with the requirements of the auction. All firearms, or firearm-accessories, should be inspected by a qualified professional (gunsmith) after change of ownership, and before new owner use, including this one. Any safety related repairs or adjustments recommended by the gun professional should be implemented before loading with live ammunition. Read and follow manufacturers’ directions before use. FIREARMS SAFETY DEPENDS ON YOU."

 3 boxes of Remington UMC (brass) 95 grain (one box is missing one round so 149 rounds)


I have around $250 tied up in this ammunition, not even including the rounds I've already fired. You and I both know that the price has increased dramatically since then.  I'm not looking to extort you, but I am looking to get as much as possible for this high quality, new ammunition as it is worth a great deal.  I would be surprised if you could find this (if at all) in any store for twice that much money.  I'm looking for around $300.  Please call me at REDACTED (or text) to discuss the price and where you would like to meet.

Thank you!
