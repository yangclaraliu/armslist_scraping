These were built by the legendary Zavasta Arms factory. This particular example is an M92 pistol (M92pv) chambered in 7.62x39. fratures that make this a winner over standard AK rifles/pistols are hinged bolt cover, rear flip sight for long range or short range, flip up front night sight, and the superior Cold Hammer Fordged barrels. I picked this pistol up at an estate sale of a gun dealer. This a new gun and the only rounds down the barrel are the 4 I shot to ensure proper function of the firearm before I put it for sale. For full price offers I will include a nice range bag as well. The pistol only comes with one steel magazine but AK mags are cheap and I test fit a poly PMag from my other AK and it fit nicely. I might entertain offers for quality firearms firearms only but really just needing to cash out some of my collection. Low ballers don't waste my time and I won't waste yours. While price is not 100% firm be respectful as this is already the cheapest one on here and the only NEW one. Also shown in photo is a new never fired Beretta CX4 Storm in the rare 45acp 2 mags, factory hard case, manual, factory cleaning kit, factory barrel shroud never installed, left and right side charging handle. $1100 or REASONABLE offer (look it up on gun broker used they are $900+ and no rare accessories like dual charging and barrel shroud)."

Both were confirmed as Italian military issue by contacting Beretta and it's also confirm by lack of proof markings (they were not required on Italian military contracts - per Beretta) Both are in excellent shape with excellent bores - the white splashed you're seeing in some of the pics are reflections as the finish is very a very glossy bluing. These are not your typical 92s though: Both have their slides upgraded with the additional ""safety slot"" which the ""large"" head hammer pin rides in (they both also obviously have the upgraded enlarged hammer pin). Both have had upgraded triggers, new trigger springs, and upgraded ""D"" hammer springs installed. Additionally the also have brand new upgraded recoil springs and locking blocks. (Yeah I know I practically rebuilt the guns using the original frames and slides!). Both work 100%.Additionally the package will include 5 magazines which are either Beretta manufacturers or military contract numbered.Now the real pot of gold...a baggie of original 92 spare parts that I collected slowly over the years (if you didn't know - a lot of spare parts on these that are 92s specific are IMPOSSIBLE to come by - that's something that everyone purchasing these doesn't realize yet!!). I'm not going to list everything out but you can see from the pics what its all contains.

All books, stickers, etc. As you know, Vortex offers a lifetime no fault warranty on this unit, so if anything ever happens to it, they give you a new one. Even if you run it over with your car. But this one is in new, mint, fully functional condition.Also included is a set of 35mm Seekins Precision billet rings (very high end) that are professionally torqued to the scope, a Vortex Optics bubble level, and the optional Vortex flip up caps as seen in pictures. The rings are picatinny, so they will mount on anything with a picatinny rail.I paid about $2700 plus tax for this setup and everything is still in new condition.

In very good shape especially for its age. It's the heavy frame model which means it uses the standard 12 gauge receiver and magazine tube and is a bit heavier than the 20 gauge 1100's that came out later. This makes it very easy to swing and made it very desirable by skeet and trap shooters. Looking for around $600 or maybe a trade on a Smith and Wesson shield or CZ75 of some sort. Either would have to be in 9mm. Otherwise cash will take it. Thanks for looking. Text is best way to get ahold of me and I can answer any questions or send more pictures. My number is REDACTED."

The Bersa Pro 9 (sometimes referred to as the Mini Firestorm or Thunder 9 in the past renditions) is an excellent design that builds upon proven mechanical features. The slide is similar to the SIG type, with a barrel hood that butts into the ejection port for lock up. The ejection port is large enough to eject both spent cases and to clear a full length cartridge or dud round. The frame is conventional aluminum construction. The trigger action is similar to the Beretta with an exposed drawbar on the right side of the frame.
The action is smooth enough for fast hits at conversational range. The trigger features a modest over-travel stop. A long double-action press fires the pistol. After the first shot, the slide cocks the hammer for subsequent single action shots. The single-action trigger breaks about just over five pounds. The safety is an excellent design. The safety lever is fully ambidextrous. Shooters may press the safety upward to decock (lower) a cocked hammer. The safety is on when up, and fire is down. A frame-mounted safety is much faster and more ergonomic than a slide mounted safety."

The slide will not lock open reliably. This could be cured with some relatively minor work.The bore is pitted but quite shootable.The recoil spring is a bit kinked, but not enough to seriously affect function.The serial numbers all match, but were force-matched at an arsenal.The date is 1944- during World War III don't know which arsenal the markings indicate- they are a circle with an arrow within.Thanks,Darron R.

The slide will not lock open reliably. This could be cured with some relatively minor work.The bore is pitted but quite shootable.The recoil spring is a bit kinked, but not enough to seriously affect function.The serial numbers all match, but were force-matched at an arsenal.The date is 1944- during World War III don't know which arsenal the markings indicate- they are a circle with an arrow within.Thanks,Darron R.

The slide will not lock open reliably.
