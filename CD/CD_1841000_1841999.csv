Two are Samsung Galaxy Tablets 10.1"" 32GB.  One has 4G LTE through Verizon but can be used with wi-fi.  The other 2 are  wi-fi only but one comes with a $45 Gumdrop rugged case and there are 2 new custom neoprene cases that fit these perectly.  One of the wi-fi model has been my primary tablet for the last year and has been in the case with screen protector ever since.  I'm only trading it off b/c I got a 32GB Galaxy Note.   Might be like an odd trade but I got the idea b/c two nice gentlemen just traded me a 45 for one tablet (we met at a local FFL) and another traded me a 12ga. 
The other item is a brand new Furman home theater 7 outlet line conditioner.  It is still in original box and has never been used.  Furman line conditioners are high end home theater power management/protection systems, not your cheap surge suppressor.  The Furman 7-line conditioner is $380 on Amazon.com right now.  
The 4th item is a Klipsch 5.1 Promedia speaker system.  The subwoofer is HUGE and the Klipsch speakers are renowned for their sound.
So...if there's someone else looking for a trade, let me know what you have. My Tablets are in 9 of 10 condition with 10 being brand new. We never activated the 4G LTE on Verizon, deciding just to use it  on Wi-Fi which is present everywhere we go.
I'm located in Kansas. Picture is of the 4G LTE item I have. Please provide me details of your item (make, model, what's included, age, condition, number of rounds through it).
Also looking for a safe big enough for shotgun.
I'm not interested in outlaying any cash...looking for outright trades only.  Would be willing to trade two or all items if necessary to come up with a fair trade."

- Modified stock with 14.75"" length of pull (1.25"" spacers), Hogue recoil pad and counter-weighted to balance the rifle at approximately 1"" forward of the action.  The stock has an aluminum bedding block for superior accuracy.  The last one of these I built fired sub 3.8 groups.

- Nightforce 20MOA pic-rail base
- Tactical bolt knob threaded and epoxied to factory bolt bolt by professional gunsmith.
- Harris S-L 9-13"" bipod mounts via the front stud on the stock
- VTAC Padded two-point sling

The first breakup would separate the scope from the rifle.  Then, if the scope goes, but not the rifle, I'll separate out the rifle components and bipod.  It'll be a shame to disassemble the rifle and sell it for parts, but if that's what it takes, that's what it takes.

Here are the details:

A few months ago I bought this rifle on AR15.com to use in an Advanced Precision Scoped Rifle Course, and it did not disappoint!

Having never shot beyond 200 yards, this rifle made easy work of 550, 750, and 1,000 yards.

I'm selling it because it served its initial purpose, and another similar custom rifle arrived after I had purchased this one.

I am the second owner. The previous owner stated that he fired approximately 180 rounds through it. I've fired 198. Total round count just under 400.

The price is $3150. It comes with the scope (the Nikon in the first picture with the sun shade), two scope mounts, and one magazine.
The scope was recently cleaned, adjusted, and calibrated by Nikon (I have the paperwork attesting to this). It has not been re-mounted yet.

Condition: Excellent. There is a small bit of safe rash on the left hand side of the receiver that was present when I bought it. 

Details:
Quentin Defense billet lower

Cmmg parts kit

Rock River two stage trigger

CAA grip with Palm rest (snap in kind)

Mega billet side charging upper (cant recall BCG manf)

Magpul PRS stock

Alexander arms 26 round mag

24"" Lilja match grade fluted bull barrel finished by Precision Firearms

15"" JP free float handguard

Harris bench rest bipod

Nikon Monarch 6-24x scope with BDC reticle

Burris scope rings

Extra scope base with 20moa incline for long shots

It has an incandescent bulb that advertises 120 lumens of white light output.  Don’t tell Obama about these bulbs.  My version has a quick release lever mount to attach to the bottom of a quad rail, making it very easy to take off and put back on.  I’m normally not much for quick release anything, but I like it in this case.  Tape switches are built into the sides of the vertical grip area, there is a permanent on/off switch on the bottom, and a little bitty tape switch at the top back of the unit for ‘navigation lights’.  I went a step further and added a blue light filter onto the head.  At first I just wanted it to protect the primary lense, then I found that blood will stand out in a dark area under blue light.  It hasn’t come in handy yet, but it could some day.

JP Custom Buffer Springs and Silent Captured Springs
The “spoon over a cheese grater” sound emitted by modern sporting rifles whenever they’re charged or fired has always been one of the AR platform’s ugly blemishes and one we’ve worked ardently to eliminate.  After years of specially selecting buffer tube manufacturers based on the quality of their tubes’ interior finish, we opted to design and produce our own action springs with a perfect centerless-ground and precision-polished outside diameter.  These JP Custom Buffer Springs are an inexpensive way to see exactly why we have a reputation for having the quietest, smoothest rifles on the market.

Our pursuit of perfection didn’t stop with springs though and led ultimately to the creation of the JPSCS™ Silent Captured Spring (patent pending), new for 2012. Maintaining all the benefits of our polished buffer springs and proprietary LMOS™ buffer, this combination buffer-spring assembly eliminates the friction of standard buffer components resulting in outstanding smoothness and sound abatement. What’s more, the spring is removable from the assembly for custom tuning, and both the AR-15 and AR-10 versions of the JP Silent Captured Springs are functional in rifle- and carbine-length operating systems. The AR-15 version fits and functions in any gas-operated AR-15 variant, regardless of caliber and the AR-10 version should fit and function in any large-frame AR-10-type platform. The JPSCS is not compatible with any 9mm AR variant or any blowback system using a solid (weighted) carrier.





Silent Captured Spring for AR-10-type rifles

Includes spacer to allow for installation in both carbine-length and rifle-length buffer tubes.

Compatibility
The JPSCS-AR10 is designed to work in standard 7-inch M16/M4-length buffer extension tubes on .308 AR-type rifles like the DPMS LR-308. Armalite .308 rifles likewise use these standard M16 extension tubes with rifle-length stocks, so the JPSCS-AR10 will function normally when installed with the supplied spacer. However, Armalite’s .308 carbines use a slightly longer, nonstandard carbine extension tube. The JPSCS-AR10 can still be used with these extension tubes by installing the spacer, which must be modified to fit. Alternately, the system will function readily if the longer Armalite carbine tube is replaced with a standard 7-inch .223 carbine extension tube.

The JPSCS-AR10 is not compatible with the Rock River Arms LAR-8 because of its longer bolt stroke and subsequently longer extension tube."

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

""The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.""

If you notice a price change, it's because the lower is currently at my local gun shop. If you want it shipped to your local FFL, we will split the shipping (I think it's about $10-20). Price to do a FTF will be $270. I will pay the transfer fee up front ($25) plus total i've payed for lower ($245) which is where the total of $270 comes in.

X-TAC COMPACT - Unparalleled Performance in any Shooting Condition
Enhanced Grip Texture
Enhanced Sight Picture
Wilson Combat’s Legendary Attention to Detail

Enhanced grip texture, Enhanced sight picture and Wilson Combat’s legendary attention to detail add up to a unique new offering destined to be a top choice of working operators everywhere.
The new bi-directional, X-TAC COMPACT frontstrap and slide treatment offer enhanced grip and improved durability over traditional checkering in severe and hard-use environments. Scientifically designed to work with dry or wet hands, with or without tactical gloves, the X-TAC COMPACT pattern redefines secure shooting comfort and gunhandling without the coarse, often painful nature of other grip treatments. In tandem with our G-10 Starburst grips, the X-TAC COMPACT tread pattern locks securely into the firing hand and will reduce muzzle flip without snagging on clothes or cover garments.
The X-TAC COMPACT proudly wears our newest rear sight, the Wilson Combat 1911 Battlesight. This high profile rear sight has a .145” wide U-Notch for optimum sighting in low-light, dynamic range conditions. The rear blade of the sight is serrated, while the notch area is recessed into a semi-circular pocket for a crisp, protected sight picture. Accompanied by the new heavy-duty Wilson Combat fiber optic front sight, this resulting sight picture is clearly amazing.
Wearing a time-tested Mil-Spec Parkerized phosphate finish for further enhanced grip, the X-TAC is everything needed in a professional’s working gun without any of the frills except superior performance."

Unfired Springfield M1A Socom II 7.62x51mm/.308win. Springfield Armory SOCOM rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.

Yep, you can almost never get anything from me without a story so excuse me if you are a Type A and hate this stuff. My point was (which makes the pistol worth zero dollars more, but hell I like a good story ha ha)  one day after telling us about watching over World War 1 German prisoners when he was a young man (he said many were just farm boys just like him just doing what they were told to do and he said they were good ole boys). Anyhow after he had us all wide eyed with story after story he told us to wait a minute and one day came out of his house with an original black powder .44. I can't remember what style because I was too amazed at the ""chain fire"" stories he told us if you were under attack or careless and didn't prep the weapon correctly.

So today Charlie is long gone, his stories live on with me and the guys I grew up with that moved on to places unknown and over 35 years later I’ve got a wicked old .44 black powder.
I saved this one from a slob who had it I don't think ever cleaned or polished it. Fortunately it is an older reproduction and is well built and tight so it cleaned up pretty nice as I hope the pictures show.Even has a Naval Battle scene engraved in the cylinder (hard to see in pics but it is there for anyone drooling over it to see)

I know these aren't some super high dollar pistols but like the story I related, just having one displayed somewhere draws everyone's attention. The brass and wood is so ""pretty"" my wife was even giving it a ""Wow, that came out niiiiice!"" my son's were impressed with that but even more by the attention demanding .44 business end of the barrel and the dogs running and hiding when I slowly would click the hammer back into firing position (only time my dogs are smart ha ha). 

While it is older technology it is still an awesome .44 and will blow a home invader right back out the way they came in if they were stupid enough to ""visit"". Get an extra cylinder like Clint Eastwood did so famously in his movie and pull the cylinder release and slid in a preloaded cylinder and now you have a ""speed loader"" (well maybe ""quicker"" loader ha ha).
So as good of a story as it can be, and a chance to share our countries history with sons or Grand kids as they look at it in awe it still can serve as a very effective weapon if you need to call it back into service. SHOW AN GO!

I don't want to sell it straight out (unless you have to much money ha ha) but I would like to trade it for a more modern pistol or nice rifle. You know I like a good story and of course like cool or even wicked weapons. I reached my goal getting this one and got all of the oohs and ahhh's out of it since then so time for another new ""toy""

If you respond please send pictures,model numbers and anything that goes with your trade (NOT the one's like ""Hey I got me a camo sofa an uh .22"" with zero details ha ha).

I am happy to keep it if needed but here she is if you want her worse than me. Is a damn nice and very cool piece. Thanks for enduring my stories if you made it here to the end."
