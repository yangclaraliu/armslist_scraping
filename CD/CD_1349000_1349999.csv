Ultra sharp pocket knife. Never been carried, mint in box. Hurry before it hits eBay.

Specs from the makers:

Our Para-Military2 has several changesover the classic version. The G-10 handle is narrowed at the end improving theergonomics. The handle and blade have been profiled thinner; removinguncomfortable angles when in the closed position. It features a CompressionLock and an ambidextrous-friendly four way clip which carries tip-up/tip-down,left/right-hand and rests deeper in a pocket. This Exclusive run comes with high-performance M390 full flat-ground bladebut we've also lengthened the blade's tip and added additional surface jimpingto both the spine and finger choil. Implementation of a new stepped pivot systemhelps generate fluid action and more consistent manufacturing tolerances.Larger lanyard gives more options for carry.

Refinements to overall construction maynot be drastic or even visible to the eye but from the Blue G-10 texturedhandle to the M390 steel full flat blade, everything is sharper, smoother andguaranteed to provide performance and user comfort.

Bolt action, shoots, 762x54r, like the majority of M38 these things are counterbored.

comes with sling and cleaning rod. when i picked it up no cleaning kit or one of those funky metal bottles seemed to come with it. Top hand guard is lighter than the rest, i dont know why but I like the looks of it. You know what they say about opinions tho.

The gun still looks like new, with only slight scratching on the weaver rails from removing the sight hoods which I don't like when shooting indoors. The only adaptation from stock is a set of ambidextrous grips as opposed to the right hand only stock grips, which I prefer because they more closely replicate my 1911.

I bought 1 of these HC3R mag's, came home, opened it, knew I loved it, best quality mag built, BETTER than Ruger. It can even be taken apart for very easy cleaning.
So....QUIT  paying these stupid, outrageous prices for Ruger mags that aren't even as good. Don't believe me????Go buy a HC3R and if you don't like it, come on here, write to me and I'll buy it from you. And NO, I'm in NO WAY connected to Fuquay Gun, I don't know one man there by name.

Comes with 3 22 round mags & 1 10 round. Comes with 110 round drum but there is something wrong with it and I have never taken time to fix or send to ATI. Comes with a fake suppressor and a flash suppressor. Also comes with a single point sling. This pistol has had the push pin upgrade so it takes seconds to remove butt and forend. I had a gunsmith put the rrages.com screw kit upgrade in this pistol as well for more reliability and durability. It comes with all original paperwork and tools to work on it. Also included are a front foregrip and retractable stock which can only be legally installed on the pistol with a federal stamp but I will include in the sell.  I have shot 100 rounds through this firearm flawlessly. Very fun gun to shoot. I have invested $800 in this gun but you get the chance to get it for less. Price will be $600 unless someone offers more. Thanks for looking.

Oh, your brother's cousins nephew's sisters garbage mans dentist has 9 of them in stock for $50? That's a deal, your should buy them all. You bought these back in 1974 for $32.00 each? You should have bought them all. I've been called a ""price gouging n!@@er"" for a $300.00 Remington .308. I've been called a tool by a guy asking me for mags I didn't have listed that I offered to sell out of my personal collection when he asked for them. I'm tired of getting dragged into meaningless arguments by douchebag people who are sitting at home with nothing better to do. 
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY WHATEVER I HAVE LISTED THEN JUST MOVE ON AND LEAVE ME ALONE. If you tell me you can get one cheaper, I will check and usually match the price. Now, I won't even check I'll just tell you to buy it from them. Quit bothering people trying to sell their items especially when you have no clue what they paid for it, how or when they got it, or what it's worth. 

Anyone genuinely interested please feel free to contact me. To all my regular customers thank you for constantly promoting and referring me and keeping my small shop in business. 
I'm sorry to have to add this to all my ads but those certain people on this sight are just getting too old and wasting too much time. If you have ever listed anything on here you probably know what I mean."

The gun still looks like new, with only slight scratching on the Weaver rails from removing the sight hoods which I don't like when shooting indoors.  The only adaptation from stock is a set of ambidextrous grips as opposed to the right hand only  stock grips, which I prefer because they more closely replicate my 1911.  I am attempting to purchase another 1911, so I am grudgingly parting with the Buck Mark.

If you do not intend on buying this gun please do not contact me and waste our time. If you can find one cheaper that's excellent, please keep your great deals to yourself. Oh, your brother's cousins nephew's sisters garbage mans dentist has 9 of them in stock for $50? That's a deal, your should buy them all. You bought these back in 1974 for $32.00 each? You should have bought them all. I've been called a ""price gouging n!@@er"" for a $300.00 Remington .308. I've been called a tool by a guy asking me for mags I didn't have listed that I offered to sell out of my personal collection when he asked for them. I'm tired of getting dragged into meaningless arguments by douchebag people who are sitting at home with nothing better to do. 
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY WHATEVER I HAVE LISTED THEN JUST MOVE ON AND LEAVE ME ALONE. If you tell me you can get one cheaper, I will check and usually match the price. Now, I won't even check I'll just tell you to buy it from them. Quit bothering people trying to sell their items especially when you have no clue what they paid for it, how or when they got it, or what it's worth. 

Anyone genuinely interested please feel free to contact me. To all my regular customers thank you for constantly promoting and referring me and keeping my small shop in business. 
I'm sorry to have to add this to all my ads but those certain people on this sight are just getting too old and wasting too much time. If you have ever listed anything on here you probably know what I mean."

This is a Jennings .22LR semi-auto pistol package.
These can be very finicky on ammo and this one is no exception to that rule.
This 'package' comes with the gun, 4 magazines, a soft case, 3 practice rounds and 7-50 round boxes of Federal .22LR ammo.
We have found this ammo works best in most picky .22 semi-autos.
Although this J22 will work it is being sold as a PROJECT for an aspiring or accomplished gunsmith. 
It may function perfectly fine for you or not.
There are videos on YouTube on mods to this and many other guns.
That being said we will consider offers on the above listed package.
The magazines have been selling for $25.00 alone on GunBroker so please at least be fair on your offers, be it CASH or items of some value.
Normally trade offers do not work very well but we will give it one more try here.
PLEASE describe your offer or include a photo. You know our app. location so please also let us know approximately where you are.

Defense revolver, offers great concealability thanks to a very unusual profile. The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

If you do not intend on buying this gun please do not contact me and waste our time. If you can find one cheaper that's excellent, please keep your great deals to yourself. Oh, your brother's cousins nephew's sisters garbage mans dentist has 9 of them in stock for $50? That's a deal, your should buy them all. You bought these back in 1974 for $32.00 each? You should have bought them all. I've been called a ""price gouging n!@@er"" for a $300.00 Remington .308. I've been called a tool by a guy asking me for mags I didn't have listed that I offered to sell out of my personal collection when he asked for them. I'm tired of getting dragged into meaningless arguments by douchebag people who are sitting at home with nothing better to do. 
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY WHATEVER I HAVE LISTED THEN JUST MOVE ON AND LEAVE ME ALONE. If you tell me you can get one cheaper, I will check and usually match the price. Now, I won't even check I'll just tell you to buy it from them. Quit bothering people trying to sell their items especially when you have no clue what they paid for it, how or when they got it, or what it's worth. 

Anyone genuinely interested please feel free to contact me. To all my regular customers thank you for constantly promoting and referring me and keeping my small shop in business. 
I'm sorry to have to add this to all my ads but those certain people on this sight are just getting too old and wasting too much time. If you have ever listed anything on here you probably know what I mean."

Also a very reliable scope and the scope itself is the reason for the higher asking price. I know $300 is a lot for a Mosin but the scope itself is a $300 scope. It's zeroed for 100 yards and can put 3 shots within 1 1/2 inches and anyone who knows Mosin's will know that is good for one. I shot my first deer with this rifle and it dropped the deer cold. Hunting ammo is pretty cheap for it. The stuff I shoot is only $14 for 20 rounds. Comes with the synthetic stock that is currently on it along with the original number matching stock and the assorted accessories that come with a Mosin.

To me looks like it went through some damage in battle and the jap soldier cut off bad part. But one never knows who did it or when. 

Made at the Nagoya arsenal. Not a training marked rifle or school use marked rifle.  Single Nagoya mark as well, not double marked like some you see with assisting arsenal. 

Bore has very nice rifling and is clean, no pitting. Fires great and very accurate. The only thing missing on the rifle is the magazine follower spring which can be bought on ebay or gunbroker for anywhere between 10 to 20 dollars. If I buy it and put it in the price goes up 20 more dollars.

The M6A2 rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2 rifle also features a longer mid-length free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2 rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2 rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2 rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."

It's been a great little rifle and still works great. The tip has been broken from the tube magazine, but it did create a little more room for a couple of rounds of ammo. It is accurate and has a Tasco scope with raised mounts to allow you to use the iron sights. Gun was reblued and looks pretty descent. This will make a good truck gun for someone or even one to take into the woods. The last couple of rounds in the chamber will misfeed from time to time because of the tip in the magazine, but the first 13 rounds will fire and feed without fail. I'm sure with a little thought, this could easily be fixed. Now low balls, not interested in trades. Must be a KY resident and I will require a KY ID."

The M6A2 rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2 rifle also features a longer mid-length free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2 rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2 rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2 rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2 rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design."

The gun still looks like new, with only slight scratching on the Weaver rails from removing the sight hoods which I don't like when shooting indoors. The only adaptation from stock is a set of ambidextrous grips as opposed to the right hand only stock grips, which I prefer because they more closely replicate my 1911. I am attempting to purchase another 1911, so I am grudgingly parting with the Buck Mark.  I offer the gun for $450.

Springfield Armory Sub Compact 40S&W w/3"" Barrel/Black Finish

The XD Sub-Compact has the natural pointability of the XD. Combined with
the compact size and shape of its polymer grip, makes it feel more like a
natural extension of your body rather than an object in you hand. That's
why most people find they shoot better with an XD. The Sub-Compact is
available in 9mm and .40 S&W,  standard and high capacity magazines (you
will receive two standard or 10 round magazines where high capacity is not
available), weights 26-27 oz.,  and offers dovetail front and rear steel
3-Dot sights (standard) and Tritium sights (optional).
