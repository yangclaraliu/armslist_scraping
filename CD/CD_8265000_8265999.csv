This is a complete drop in upper in order to shoot 7.62x39 in your mil spec ar15. I went to sight in my scope and it came loose during a mag dump test to make sure it would cycle properly on my lower and my lower magazine. Your lower may need a stronger spring to helps with ignition problems caused by ammo with hard / difficult primers (Common issues with old/cheap 7.62x39 ammo is light primer strikes.  A heavier spring will give your hammer some extra ""umph"" to set off those primers.). You will need magazines like the ACS or C-Products. If you must have one, you can buy my ASC 20 round for an extra $20 for a total of $400.

Never fired.
Impulse buy.  If I am going to buy a suppressor, I really just need to build an SBR while I am doing my paperwork.
I hand cycled some 300 blackout through it to make sure it cycles by hand.
I don't have to sell it, you don't have to buy it. Price is firm.
In person cash transfers.
Thanks for not asking me about shipping, best prices and trades.
If you send me a message ""Is this available"", I will assume you didn't read the listing. If it is listed, it is available, so if you ask me, I assume you're just another scammer.

From their website:
 
Our ALL NEW OMNI HYBRID MAXX features a fully-patented metal reinforced polymer upper receiver along with a fully-patented metal reinforced polymer lower receiver.  The Omni Hybrid lower features a patented hammer and trigger pin retainment system, preventing movement from the hammer and trigger pin during firing.  The Omni Hybrid also featured our patented over-molded metal insert, which reinforces the buffer tube housing and rear takedown pin.  This allows for metal-on-metal contact with both the buffer tube as well as the rear takedown pin thus increasing strength and durability from recoil and consistent firing.  In addition a magazine is now included with all Omni Hybrid MAXX rifles.

Everything is correct including the metal buttplate, beautiful bore and rifling, slight thinning of the blue along the lower receiver from being handled. Do not confuse the 32 W.S. (Winchester Special) with the 32 W.C.F. (Winchester Center Fire). The 32 W.C.F. later became the 32-20 and was a black powder cartridge. The 32 W.S. comes in with a velocity of just over 2400 feet per second and it's energy at just over 2100 foot pounds of force. Ot has a bullet diameter of .321 on a 30-30 case. The 32 W.C.F. velocity is 900 feet per second and energy is 207 foot pounds of force it was primarily for target and small game. It has a bullet diameter of .312. The 32 W.S. works great on large game and the ammo is readily available through Remington, Hornady, Federal and Winchester."

This is a Savage Model 1899/99 rifle with a 26” barrel chambered for the .303 Savage cartridge. In 1920 Savage shortened the model number to “99”.  It has a very good bore, a cartridge counter and cocking indicator.  The Schnabel forend is very good.  The buttstock has been cut down and repaired – and a pretty decent job was done (see photos).  I found vintage replacement stocks at Numrich Gun Parts and on eBay for $60 - $86.  When dating the rifle using Savage’s serial number look-up without inputting the decimal (21510), the date of manufactures comes up as 1901 or 1902.  Leaving the decimal in (21.510), the date comes up as 1895.  $299.  You may contact me with your private email for more pictures.  Reply to this ad or contact John at 2 5 3 five four nine 6 6 one six."

I bought the Ballester 20 yrs. ago from a gun collector and it has spent most of the last 20 years in my gun safe.  I've fired 2 clips thru it in all this time, so might as well trade for something else I might use. The gun is in good condition.  Has a parkerized finish on it.  Was manufactured between 1942 and 1944 based on the serial no. of 17211.  The gun's numbers match except for the ammo clips (2 ammo clips included). I believe the wood handgrips were changed at some point also as the Ballester Molina always came with a wood grip with serrated lines in it, to the best of my knowledge and these grips are still available from multiple sources online (the current handles are also wood but lack the serrations).  The gun has some nicks and scratches but nothing severe.  Thanks."

The brown holster is properly marked in for the P38. The black holster is actually a Luger holster and is also properly marked. The Luger holster works perfect for the Walther due to them being the same size roughly.  I would sell the numbers matching pistol for $1,200 with the holster and the non numbers matching for $750 with a holster.  First buyer gets to pick which holster they want"

Converted in the 1870's by surplus gun dealers into single shot breech loading shotguns for their rising African trade businesses with the tribes of the african american continent, hence given the nickname ZULU guns. Featuring a swing out breech block of simple design, they worked well enough for hunting, but not worth much in war. Very popular anyways, thousands were manufactured. This example has survived very well compared to most for the age. If you’re a collector in the market for one of these, this is a fine example to own! Metal Condition: Finish has worn to a silvery patina throughout, looks nice and consistent. Stock/Grips Condition: One piece stock is very well intact with a lovely surface.

I have added the Lapco str8shot barrel and mock silencer as well as 2 first strike mags. There is 2 regular paint mags that have to be used with the factory barrel and one air thru mag that allows you to use a remote line and hpa/co2 tank instead of the small CO2 canisters.
There’s an absolute ton of extras included. The gun can be used as anything from a pistol to a sniper rifle which is amazingly accurate with the first strike rounds to a cqb gun or a mini uzi.
You can quickly switch back and forth from first strike rounds to regular paint via the hopper attachment just by flipping the gun and twisting the barrel.
The lasers included are pressure sensitive and the scope has an include sight raiser so you can actually use it with your mask on. There are 2 different types of handles included. One type is a fixed handle. The other is a 5 position handle. I have a spare air thru adapter included that is not installed in a mag yet (only works for the regular paint mags) and a extra parts kit with spare bolts, sprigs, screws and o-rings to do a complete rebuild.
The marker was just recently serviced and used last week. Everything works great. I’ve owned this gun for the last 5 years. Only thing at all wrong with it is a screw broke off 2 years ago on the hopper adapter/plate cover. I’ve included a picture. It does not affect the marker what so ever. The other 3 screws hold everting perfect and works with no issues. I always play with the hopper on because I like to switch paints but the cover is included if you do not want to use the hopper.
This gun is the ultimate scenario style gun. Will trade for firearms. Well over $1200 invested."

Condition: Excellent! I have kept this gun in a drawer in the house.
 
Includes RUGER branded plastic factory case.
A durable, reliable, and affordable semi-auto: for most people -- beginners especially -- an excellent choice. Produced using advanced precision cast techniques that was perfected by Ruger company. As a result, the P95 earned a reputation of great value for the money yet extremely strong and durable.
The P95 offers excellent ergonomics and accuracy…. And most of all: RELIABILITY – built like a tank! And well known for firing under adverse conditions and firing multitudes of ammo. Reputation for being indestructible. It eats whatever you feed it, from sooty Russian steel-case to +p defensive loads.
This pistol incorporates the Sig P220 locking system with a 1911-style tilting barrel in order to offer exceptional reliability and good accuracy. Originally designed for the military, the P89 is ultra-reliable and feeds all ammo under all situations. The gun is made of 100% metal (other than the removable grips). 
Stainless steel construction is the ultimate in corrosion protection. It also never shows wear since it is impervious to being polished and re-polished. 
ERGONOMICS:   Slide-mounted decocker – Mounted on BOTH sides for ambidextrous control. Ruger did not stop there -- Ambidextrous controls extend beyond. Magazine releases are also ambidextrous. The mag release position is just right, easy enough for even smaller handed shooters to reach.
Proven and reliable three white dot system.
High capacity double-stack magazine.
The P95 takes down easily and without tools. You just line up the marks on the slide and frame, pop out the slide release, and then pull the slide off.
