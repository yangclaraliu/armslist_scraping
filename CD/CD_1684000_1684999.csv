Product Description
 Bushmaster's Optics Ready Carbine is designed to provide a platform for your imagination: any optics, any purpose, anywhere. The ORC comes with a receiver-length Picatinny optics rail and two 1-1/4"" riser optics blocks (perfect for holographic sites, scopes, or red dots) without a lot of extra factory accessories that you're going to replace anyway. But the ORC isn't a bare-bones rifle by any means. Its 16"" M4 profile barrel is chrome-lined in both the bore and the chamber with an A2, birdcage-type flash hider to control muzzle flash. A heavy oval M4-type handguard provides a fore-grip while maintaining the ORC's immaculate balance and control. The ORC's six-position telescoping stock reduces overall length by 4"" when collapsed for convenient carry. This ORC includes an operator's safety manual, a magazine, a gun lock, and a black sling. A one year Bushmaster warranty comes standard

...M16 bolt carriers are not designed and inteded solely and exclusively for use in converting a weapon into a machinegun and are not any combination of parts from which a machinegun can be assembled.  Further, an M16 bolt carrier is not a firearm as defined in the GCA or a machinegun as defined in the NFA.  An M16 bolt carrier is simply a machinegun part and as such its domestic sale and possession is unregulated under the Federal firearms laws.  It is not unlawful to utilize a M16 machinegun bolt carrier in a semiautomatic AR15 type rifle."

The brass i got from someone, most is new.  he primed a few but i never loaded them so i do not know what primers are in the brass.  the brass is from starline so it is small rifle primers.  Magnum primers need to be used with all casull brass.  the leather holster comes with the cartridge belt and then i also have a Bianchi holster for it.  the scope mount is a weigand combat scope mount that is matched stainlss like the revolver.  in total i think there are 100 pieces of brass.  i haven't counted them but there was 100 when i started and they should all still be there.  You have everything needed to get out and hunt hogs with this and everything to get started reloading for the casull.

Well, I have come to the conclusion that guitar playing requires some sort of black art that is outside of my conjuring ability and I, therefore, must let it go. Friends have commented on how well it plays and the Gibson 180 Sonex Deluxe got very good reviews when it came out. This one was built in the Nashville, TN plant on June 8th, 1982 and was production number 49 and retailed for $499. It is still in very good condition with very minor scratches and bumps (picture shows worst damage is chipped paint below and around tuners) and has a very good shine. I've seen the Sonex 180 line selling lately for between $450 and $700 (one identical to mine was just posted on EBay for over $1000!) and the condition and rarity of the silverburst color pushes this one toward the higher end of the price spectrum. I am including the Gibson strap, a set of Ernie Ball strings (minus the #s 46 and 13 which are presently on the guitar), a dozen assorted picks, a string speed winder, and the guitar stand. Technical specs:

Gibson exclusive Multi-phonic body construction - Single cutaway design - Adjustable chrome plated Tune-0-Matic bridge with chrome plated stop-bar tailpiece - Uniquely shaped double sided fingerrest with white revealed edge - Two high output Humbucking 3-point adjustable exposed pickups that feature one black and one cream coil - 3-position toggle switch for pickup selection (individual or both pickups simultaneously) - Attractive, efficient black speed knobs - Body size: Length 17 1/4' width 13' depth 1 3/4'

NECK SPECIFICATIONS One piece select hardwood construction - Width at fingerboard nut 1 11/16' - Rosewood fingerboard with dot inlays and corresponding side dots - Individually enclosed chrome plated machine heads - Gibson truss rod with distinctive truss rod cover - 22 frets - 24 3/4' scale length

This firearm has come a long way from the ""sporting"" version that they come as when they are imported into America. The Saiga 12 is constructed entirely of steel and is an incredibly robust, reliable and powerful machine. Chambered for 3"" shells, it is capable of firing the hottest 3"" shells or low-brass 2 3/4"" with just a turn of the gas tube valve. Barrel is fully chrome-lined, which not only significantly increases barrel life but requires less maintenance than a barrel of plain steel construction. List of modifications and aftermarket parts equipped are as follows.

Tapco USA Made T6 Telescopic stock with recoil pad, single-point, two-point sling mounts and a pistol grip storage compartment.

Tapco USA Made forearm with 3 removable picatinny rails mountable on the left, right & bottom of the forearm.

Carolina Shooters Supply USA Made gas tube shroud

Correctly polished action for increased reliability which also provides significantly smoother functioning and feeding of the weapon.


Original stock, forearm and factory Izhmash matching serial number 5 round magazine are also included with this package.

Weapon has cycled hundreds of rounds flawlessly from cheap Federal Multi-Purpose 8 shot to 3"" 1.25 ounce foster slugs. I have cleaned every inch of the internals of this firearm after each time it was fired, action was also kept properly lubricated at all times. I am extremely familiar with this firearm's design so feel free to contact me with any questions you may have regarding anything about them.

WILL NOW INCLUDE 50 rounds of buckshot and 50 rounds of slugs. Federal, Remington, and other high quality ammo.

My intention is to trade this for an AK-74, an Izhmash manufactured Saiga like any of the SGL31 variants (61, 62, 68, 94). Cash difference will be needed or given depending on what you have to offer.

 This certificate which has been signed by the original purchaser, will entitle you to 1, 4-day class in; Defensive Handgun, Tactical Shotgun or Practical Rifle. If you prefer, you can take a friend and split the training with them by using the certificate for 2, 2-day classes as long as you both take the same class. 

 There is a $50 background investigation fee payable at the time of registration which is not included in this certificate. That is the only money you will be asked for at Front Sight unless you rent equipment from them which I would recommend. They will rent you the necessary equipment for the classes for $100 for the 4-day class. Ammunition is of course extra.

 Check out the Front Sight website and think about making a trip with some friends. Splitting expenses like fuel and rooms will make the trip very affordable. 

 Just remember, you can only use one of these certificates once. After that you either pay the full $2000 or join the resort. The 2-day classes are great but the 4-day class is much more than twice as much. The days are around 12 hours long, but they fly by. The instructors are the most informed, practical and intelligent trainers I have ever encountered. The facilities are first rate and everyone involved is professional in every way.

 Front Sight offers different certificates and promotions from time to time for other classes and things. Sometimes I have those available. If there is something Front Sight related that you desire or need, just ask. I might have something available that will fill your need.

 I have several different types of firearms training opportunities available in my other auctions. Please take a look at my other auctions."

Like new! This holster fits Smith & Wesson Model 10 or 19 or similar 4"" K-Frame. It is a duty appropriate holster with Level III retention designed for very secure carry. It may fit a Model 686, but not sure, given the tightly constructed fit. This holster retails at $199.95. There is one minor scratch in the finish. See photos.

From Safariland:
""Now the industry uses several locking mechanisms that re-engage if the user releases them. In some cases an additional movement is required by the user to release a mechanism. For example, in the case of Safariland’s SLS (Self Locking System), the user must overcome the pressure of two springs to push the hood down in order to unlock the mechanism. Then, while holding the unit in the down unlocked position, the user must rotate the hood completely forward to allow the weapon an opening to exit from the holster. If the user simply pushes the hood down to the unlocked position and then releases it, allowing the hood to re-lock, the holster is as secure as it was initially. However, since there are two separate and distinct motions (much like releasing a snap and then rotating the weapon forward slightly with the older 295 holster before drawing), the SLS provides two levels of security by itself. By adding a Sentry device to the SLS, which requires a separate and distinct motion by the user, a third level of security is achieved."""
