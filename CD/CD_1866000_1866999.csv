79,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1866079,"For Sale:  Noveske Recon AR-15 Stainless 16"" 1:7"" 5.56 223","Arizona, Arizona, United States","$ 2,500","Listed On: Wednesday, July 10, 2013",Rifles,Noveske                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,no type,Rifle,"oveske Recon AR-15 semi automatic rifle chambered for 5.56mm NATO. Noveske is one of the premier manufacturers of AR-15 pattern rifles and this is a perfect example. This rifle features a 16"" Stainless Steel barrel with a 1:7"" twist rate and Polygonal rifling. Polygonal rifling is an innovative alternative to conventional rifling, boasting increased velocity and accuracy, and significantly easier cleaning. The smooth bore profile provides an improved gas seal, decreases deformation of bullet jackets, and has no sharply angled grooves to hold deposits of fouling. Noveske's Stainless Steel barrels are made to fill a precision role while retaining flawless function. Retaining accuracy and reliability is a complicated balance in that the chamber needs to be slightly modified from the NATO to improve bullet hook-up in the throat, while keeping to functional properties of the NATO body dimensions. The result is a proprietary Noveske chambering. The steel used is a type of 416r and hardened to about 30 HRC prior to any machining. These barrels are button rifled with Noveske's proprietary 7 PT button. This design and the type of stainless used helps the lead edge of the rifling from eroding as fast as it might with conventional rifling, and the barrels tend to outlast others. The barrel has a bead blasted finish for a matte appearance. A mid-length gas system is used, decreasing heat related wear to critical internal componentry, and reducing felt recoil to the operator. For use in any precision application, Noveske recommends a Stainless Steel barrel for its edge in accuracy and excellent reliability.

The upper receiver is a forged Vltor MUR modular design, including an anti-rotation interface with the handguard. The MUR is a rigid Mil Spec design with a flat top Picatinny rail for easy and secure mounting of optics. The walls of the receiver are thicker, making it a stronger, more accurate, and more reliable platform. The MUR is precision milled from forged 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum which has been stress relieved, heat treated, and cryogenically treated. It features extended feed ramps for flawless cycling. The Vltor MUR is likely the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today. The 11"" Noveske SWS quad rail handguard is free floated from the barrel to maintain maximum potential accuracy. It is a lightweight design with plenty of space for tactical lights, laser, target designators, bipods, and any other accessories an operator could require. The bolt is is shot peened and Magnetic Particle Inspected to ensure flawlessness, and the bolt carrier has a properly staked gas key. The installed AAC Blackout 51T muzzle device is a clever design that functions as a flash hider and muzzle brake, but also allows rapid installation of compatible sound suppressors. Front and rear BUIS are installed, making this rifle ready to operate.

The lower receiver is a mil spec Noveske Gen II expertly milled from 7075-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum. It has a mil spec black hard coat anodized finish for excellent wear and corrosion resistance. The magazine well is aggressively flared for quick, easy reloads. An ALG Combat Trigger is installed, boasting a smoother, sharper trigger pull by extensive polishing and a Nickel Boron HardLube coating. The geometry of the sear and trigger assembly has not been altered, and thus reliability is not affected. The trigger and hammer are 8620 alloy steel that has been quenched, tempered, and carbuerized, offering very high surface hardness, and the pins are upgraded tempered 4140 Chrome Moly steel with a Nickel-Teflon coating. Pull weight is typically about 6 pounds, making it compliant with U.S. military specifications. A Mil Spec receiver extensions is installed with a Noveske QD plate and Vltor iMod Carbine stock mounted. A popular Magpul MOE pistol grip is equipped and one 30 round PMAG magazine is included.

Description from the site:
MTR Custom Leather offers you the best of both worlds by coming up with a great (IWB) inside the waist band holster that converts to (OWB) out side the waistband by easily taking off our USA powder coated holster clips that will reveal our molded belts slots for our famous close riding pancake.  This holster is becoming one of our best holsters because of the fact you can have a choice of how to wear this holster.  We only use the finest bull hide and hardware on this holster to ensure the longevity and durable wear for years to come.  We reinforce the mouth for easy one handed re-holstering and to prevent collapsing while (IWB). This holster by far is a great wearing holster (OWB) and (IWB). This holster is also tuckable, so you can tuck your shirt behind the metal clips."

I bought this Diamondback DB380MS from Bud's Gun Shop in June 2012.  I installed a Crimson Trace Laser (LG-491) on the pistol in August 2012.  A magazine with a finger extension (DB380 0009-G02) is also included with the pistol, along with the standard magazine the pistol came with.

This model of the DB380 has low profile machined sights and is no longer being sold by Diamondback.  I guess the idea behind the low profile sights is to minimize snags when drawing the weapon.  I find the sights useable, but they are pretty minimal.  I added the laser to compensate for the sights.

It was serviced by the factory because of feeding issues in October 2012. The firearm has all factory updates as of 10/24/12. They replaced the slide, barrel, and trigger mechanism as part of the updates. The Diamondback representative said that they replaced basically everything but the frame.  The Crimson Trace laser was sighted in by Diamondback on 10/24/12.

I have put about 100 rounds through the pistol since the factory updates.  I carry this pistol occasionally, but this pistol shows almost no holster wear.  If you look closely, there is some slight holster wear on the corner of the slide above and to the right side of the muzzle.  Also, I am pretty fanatical about cleaning and lubing my pistols.

The buyer pays for the firearm transfer fee."

I Will be in Denver this weekend and would like to either sell or trade my parts kit. 

About it:

Purchased off of a friend who needed cash in 2005, he paid $800 for it, I bought it from him for $700. 
It is not a numbers matching kit, it was at one point assembled for use and then decommissioned, meaning the original 8"" barrel was cut along with receiver. The guy i boght it from pressed the barrel out and removed the receiver remnants. It does not come with a barrel or receiver. EVERYTHING ELSE IS THERE! 

It is an under folder kit, the front trunnion block has Russian markings on it, but again it is not a numbers/manufacturer matching kit. It is chambered in 7.62x39. Fully built these guns go from $1700 to $2300 from what I have seen, and similar parts kits go for $700-$800. All parts other than the trunnion appear to be new and if not new they are in pristine condition. 

Receivers go for 100-200 from nodak spud, which is what I would recommend, but you can find them cheaper, and barrels are available contrary to belief. I can let you know how to start on finding one, they are quality and run about $130. 

Please let me know if you are interested. Like I said I will be in Denver this Fri and Sat, I will not ship and it will b a face to face cash transaction or trade for items listed below. Cash price is negotiable, but starting price is $700 which is what I have in it."

It is not a 30-30, or a 44mag. they only made the 375 for 3 years and are very difficult to find. thats is why it is not priced as a 400 dollar 30-30. To tell the truth that's the only reason I am selling the old gal. the ammo is rather hard to find, but if you invest the time on the internet it is out there. I do not reload but the brass is available. it is in great shape, well kept, and the blue is in great shape as well. it shoots smooth and is a great hog or hedge trimming rifle. if interested im looking for 850 obo cash. I would consider trades on high end single actions, 1911s, ar15s, and semi auto shotguns. im open to offers worst I can do is say no. thank you for your interest and your time"

This is an awesome concealed carry pistol and is super light and small.  You won’t find a 9mm easier to carry.  The only reason I’m selling it is b/c I really don’t like the DAO trigger and so I instead purchased a Walther PPS to replace it.

The Barrel features a proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. 16"" length, 300 AAC chamber with a 1:8 twist, MPI & HPT, chrome-lined, carbine-length gas port, and M4 feed-ramps. The barrel is finished off with a taper pinned, f-marked, front sight post, standard handguards, and an A2 flash hider. Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. The lower receiver of this carbine is made using the most advanced aerospace manufacturing technology to produce the industries finest, forged Mil-Spec lower. This PSA receiver is machined on a multimillion dollar, automated, manufacturing system which produces a product of unequaled quality and value. The forged lower is quality made material machined from Aluminum Forgings 7075-T6 with Hardcoat Anodizing: (MIL-A-8625F, Type III, Class 2). In addition this carbine comes equipped with the Magpul MOE+ Grip, which combines reinforced polymer body construction with comfortable, wrap-around rubber over-molding for maximum weapon control in adverse environments. This design features a hard-polymer bottom edge to reduce the possibility of equipment snags or grip damage. The MOE+ Grip accepts optional storage cores for gear stowage and includes a basic grip cap. Another Magpul upgrade is the Magpul MOE polymer trigger guard. The Magpul trigger guard features a shallow ""V"" shape for better use of gloves in tactical shooting or winter operations. It has rounded edges, and fills the annoying ""gap"" at the rear of the standard trigger guard. A 30 round IMI polymer magazine is also included. I think that you will find this PSA 300 BLACKOUT CARBINE to be a fine all-around weapon to add to your collection for hunting, target, or self-defense.

Lee Deluxe 3-Die Set 223 Remington. 

Lee Precision has been producing some of the highest quality reloading equipment for over 50 years. Their Deluxe 3-Die Sets for rifle cartridges are no different. They are made to tight tolerances to help reloaders make consistent and accurate ammunition. These die sets are perfect for both beginning and seasoned reloaders. Each die is made of steel and the set comes with a full length sizing die, collet neck sizing die and bullet seating die. Reloaders use the full length sizing die to produce ammunition to factory-new specifications using new brass or brass cases that were fired in other guns. Full length sizing dies are also great for the reloader who wants to ensure each round loaded will chamber in their rifle with ease. The collet neck sizing die allows reloaders to produce ammunition that has been fire-formed to the chamber of that rifle. Since only the neck is sized more force may be required to get each round to chamber but brass life is extended and a lot of reloaders see an increase in accuracy. This set also includes a bullet seating die, shellholder, powder dipper, storage box and load data.

Lee Factory Crimp Die 223 Remington

The Lee Precision Factory Crimp Die is designed to give reloaders the perfect crimp on each round of reloaded ammunition. The Factory Crimp Die crimps the bullet more firmly in place than any other die with more uniform pressure. The Factory Crimp Die features a collet that squeezes the case mouth into the crimping groove for a firm hold. It is nearly impossible to buckle the case when crimping when compared to a regular roll crimp die. Lee's testing has shown that using a Factory Crimp Die provides a more uniform pressure curve, increasing the accuracy of any bullet. Shellholder sold separately.

Fits: Reloading presses that accept standard 7/8""-14 Threads

Lee Universal Depriming and Decapping Die

While this is listed as a Universal die, it is not recommended for use with 17 or 20 caliber cases.
