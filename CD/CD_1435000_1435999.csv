THE LEGEND CONTINUES, The legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic is a semi-automatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate. Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic features the original Swiss folding stock, as well as a polymer ergonomic forend.

The Classic’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ button rifled barrel.
SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor. The SIG 556 Classic brings back the look and feel of one of the world’s most sought after military rifles but on a platform available for law enforcement and responsible citizens

     So to save some of the confussion that happens please research this item before responding. This is not a s&w sig mossberg or other knock off its a colt the best enough said about that lol .First this rifle is not the $450 m4 that people keep googling and even those are not availible at online retailers sold out everywere so dont tell me you found one for $450 because you didnt. Second this is a very rare 20"" barrel version for long range accuracy based on the m16 a2 exact same specs. Only .22 lr which is super cheap to shoot and train with there is only 2 i know of on arms list in the whole country. 3rd the ones most people are selling have 10 round mags not 30 round mags and the 30 rounders are not avail anywere for less than 75-100 dollars."

Prefer larger quantities for trade, like 250 for 500, but I will do as little as (50) 17HMR for (100) 22LR. I don't care what brand or grain .17 you have.

The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 Window is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons that features transparent windows to allow rapid visual identification of approximate number of rounds remaining. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 Window incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.

Modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a wide range of non Colt®-spec platforms such as the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons.

Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 Window features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine. Utilizing a high visibility indicator coil on the spring and numerical markers on the magazine body, the MagLevel™ system provides positive verification without affecting the durability or reliability of the magazine."

Up for sale is my safe-queen AK-47 chambered in 7.62 x 39. It is a Russian made Vepr K that was imported by Robinson Arms around 1999-2002. These were built using a RPK squad machine gun receiver that is nearly twice as thick as a traditional stamped AK-47. With the extra thick receiver and a heavy barrel these are extremely accurate and durable weapons. 

Note: Unlike the recent imports that came with 10 rounds magazines and thumbhole stocks, this VEPR-K accepts all high cap AK magazines without any modifcations. 

Included are:

>One Eastern European ribbed-back 30 round magazine
>Cleaning kit, oil bottle and cleaning rod that came with the it."

This is a really great handgun, it has a sleek rounded no snag design that is good for CC and the SA/DA with the safety allows for cocked and locked carry. The ergonomics on the grips are outstanding, comes with small medium and large side plates and back straps that can be used in any combination without creating gaps or ridges on the grip.  This makes the .40SW round MUCH more controllable than in a USP or a Glock.

I will also throw in a box of 50/50 165 and 180 grain HP home defense ammo plus a full magazine of the 165 grain stuff so no waiting until ammo restocks to try it out!

I am selling this handgun to raise funds for an AR build that I need to finish soon so don't hesitate to make an offer. Will meet halfway to just about anywhere in Oregon for sale, must have valid Oregon ID.

Also, I never filled out the warranty information to register the handgun with HK, and get the warranty card. So if your into that sort of thing, the info is in the box."

It is chambered for .380 ACP and has a 7-round magazine.  

This particular pistol is marked “Gardone VT 4937-XV,” indicating that it was manufactured in the 15th year of Mussolini’s fascist dictatorship, which was 1937.  The serial number is 557xxx.  As indicated by the photos, it has some pitting on the rear and right front of the slide, and some lighter pitting on the right frame and trigger guard.  The original grips have some dings and scratches but are in good used condition and all markings are clearly legible, which is why I rated it NRA “Good” condition despite the pitting.  I have fired this pistol and it shoots very well, as shown by the photo of a target using Fiocchi 95-grain factory loads in a 10-round group at 30 feet.  It also comes with what I was told was an authentic “new old stock” tropical canvas holster in excellent condition.

This was purchased with a C&R license, so a photo ID will be needed because I have to keep a record of that stuff, and you’ll need to sign a bill of sale stating that you’re not under a restriction to purchase or possess a firearm.  Would consider partial trade for reloading components or ???."

Carbine gas system. 1x7(1x8 and 1x9 available also) Twist rate. LW19 Steel. Manufatured by Lothar Walther. Black Nitride finish for durability and corrosion resistance. These barrels are truly a cut above the rest. They start life at world class maker Lothar Walther. Made from LW19 bar stock, then drilled, contoured, chamber reamed and rifled at 1x7, 1x8, 1x9 twist and CNC lapped to provide fantastic out of the box accuracy. On top of the quality that comes from a Lothar Walther barrel, these have undergone ferritic nitrocarborizing. You now get the accuracy of a precision crafted barrel and the benefits of a black nitride finish. Black Nitride has a lot of benefits. The surface of the steel normally has a rockwell hardness, hRc, of 42-46. After nitriding, the surface hardness goes up to 69-72. This gives greater durability to chrome lining, but unlike chrome lining you are not covering the lands and grooves with an uneven layer that can degrade accuracy. 

Many of the top companies use Lothar's barrels, including Spikes Tactical in their higher end uppers. 

What is Black Nitride? 

BLACKNITRIDE™, or Ferritic Nitrocarburizing, is the thermochemical that simultaneously diffuses nitrogen and carbon into the surface of ferrous metals. During the process, a two-part surface layer is formed, an outer iron nitride layer with a nitrogen diffusion layer below it. During this treatment, nitrogen and carbon are absorbed by and diffused into the surface of the metal. Reproducible and uniform layers with a predetermined thickness will be formed on all areas of the metal. The result of this process is markedly improved surface properties on ferrous metal parts while maintaining dimensional and shape stability. Metal components treated with BLACKNITRIDE™ have increased wear-resistance, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, lubricity and cosmetic appeal. Often replacing the more expensive processes of hard chrome or nickel plating, BLACKNITRIDE™ gives better corrosion protection. Additionally, BLACKNITRIDE™ is commonly used as an alternative to high temperature conventional heat treatments such as carburizing and carbonitriding.

 ""Ken,
  Anytime there is a new model or series developed there is a prototype, whether it be a car, an airplane or a gun. The prototype is the first of that series. Usually there are two of them, one for all the testing and the second for display or to send to gun magazines. Prototype guns are always collectors items and usually will sell for almost double what the standard production model will sell for. Yours was one of the 2 prototype guns made. That series was probably 20 to 25 years ago when our shop was in Florida. I don’t have any paperwork on it as when we moved here from Florida we were required to apply for a new license and all old paperwork had to be boxed up and sent to a warehouse in West Virginia where it sits and rots. Back then we built several series of guns on Freedom Arms base guns. We were the first ones to build the 50 AE in revolvers. We started with Freedom Arms 454 revolvers and put new barrels and cylinders on them. They were the Lucifer’s Hammer series. After we moved out here in early 1994, we became a licensed manufacturer and began to build our own guns from scratch. Your gun had a full action job on it, some engraving as I remember, new grips and refinish. maybe a few other items but that long ago I don’t remember exactly what. Quite often the production guns will be quite a bit different from the prototype as some features may work on it while others may not go well with the series and be dropped after production starts. The original series sold for $1295 and I have seen 2 or 3 of them on Gunbroker for $4000.  Hope this helps.

Carbine gas system. 1x7(1x8 and 1x9 available also) Twist rate. LW19 Steel. Manufatured by Lothar Walther. Black Nitride finish for durability and corrosion resistance. These barrels are truly a cut above the rest. They start life at world class maker Lothar Walther. Made from LW19 bar stock, then drilled, contoured, chamber reamed and rifled at 1x7, 1x8, 1x9 twist and CNC lapped to provide fantastic out of the box accuracy. On top of the quality that comes from a Lothar Walther barrel, these have undergone ferritic nitrocarborizing. You now get the accuracy of a precision crafted barrel and the benefits of a black nitride finish. Black Nitride has a lot of benefits. The surface of the steel normally has a rockwell hardness, hRc, of 42-46. After nitriding, the surface hardness goes up to 69-72. This gives greater durability to chrome lining, but unlike chrome lining you are not covering the lands and grooves with an uneven layer that can degrade accuracy. 

Many of the top companies use Lothar's barrels, including Spikes Tactical in their higher end uppers. 

What is Black Nitride? 

BLACKNITRIDE™, or Ferritic Nitrocarburizing, is the thermochemical that simultaneously diffuses nitrogen and carbon into the surface of ferrous metals. During the process, a two-part surface layer is formed, an outer iron nitride layer with a nitrogen diffusion layer below it. During this treatment, nitrogen and carbon are absorbed by and diffused into the surface of the metal. Reproducible and uniform layers with a predetermined thickness will be formed on all areas of the metal. The result of this process is markedly improved surface properties on ferrous metal parts while maintaining dimensional and shape stability. Metal components treated with BLACKNITRIDE™ have increased wear-resistance, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, lubricity and cosmetic appeal. Often replacing the more expensive processes of hard chrome or nickel plating, BLACKNITRIDE™ gives better corrosion protection. Additionally, BLACKNITRIDE™ is commonly used as an alternative to high temperature conventional heat treatments such as carburizing and carbonitriding.

733,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1435733,For Sale:  Romanian AK-47 75-Round Drum ***Updated with New Picture***,"Northfield, Bloomington, Minnesota",$ 175,"Listed On: Thursday, April 11, 2013",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a NIB 75-round drum designed for use with an AK-47.  This drum loads from the back, comes with the original directions, and accommodates 7.62x39mm ammo.  

The box has a sticker which reads “MAAK78”.  This designates the drum as being Romanian.  The instructions list Century International Arms as the distributor of origin.  The second picture also shows the country of origin as Romania.  

Additional information on the MAAK78 can be found at these three sites:

http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/MAG-042

http://www.sportsmans-depot.com/products/CENT-MAG-AK47-75RD-DRUM-ROMANIAN-CENT-MAAK78.html

http://www.wholesalehunter.com/brand.asp?brand=7573

The way this works: load it with ammo from the back (read the directions), insert the drum in the mag well, let the bolt go forward, pull the trigger and it’ll go “Bang” seventy-five times followed by an audible, “Click”.  At that point wipe the grin off your face and do it all over again.  

This was purchased in 2012 and never used.  It sat forgotten about until last week when I wondered what was in the brown box on a shelf and I opened it.  I’m a bit of a traditionalist and prefer to fire from standard 30-round magazines and I don’t anticipate using this anytime soon.  So, it’s up for sale.  

I’m selling this for $175 which seems fair.  You can get them for as cheap as $160 or for significantly more on this site.  Mine is unfired / NIB and comes with the original directions.  I’m thinking that’s worth the extra $15.  Heck, if you want to go up to $200 I’ll throw in the first 75-rounds of steel AK ammo to fill the drum.  The extra $25 actually makes the ammo a few cents less than I paid for it.  

I don’t need to see a permit or require a DNA sample to purchase this.  It hasn’t come to that for magazines and drums."

The Variation 2, Eagle “C” Military finish was made in the serial block 343087P to 345126P, with an estimated procurement of 2,000.  The guns were chambered in caliber 7.65 (.32 ACP), were commercial proofed on the right side of the chamber, barrel and on the slide below the ejection port, and had the Eagle “C” stamp placed on the left side of the frame, above the magazine release button.  This Walther PP pistol is as described above, with the serial number falling in the middle of the serial block range.  The gun is in excellent condition, retaining 99% of its original military finish, with only some minor thinning on the sharp edges. It has strong stampings, a bright bore, and the action is tight and functions perfectly.  A fantastic piece, and very rare, the only one we have every seen in 36 years of business."

All top notch products went into this rifle. I have only bore sighted it and test fired it with about 10 rounds to be sure it cycles correctly. The lower receiver is Franklin Armory with a receiver tensioning screw that takes all the wobble out of the upper and lower. This makes for a very tight accurate gun with no need for accu-wedges. This is a 50 state gun and is California compliant for buyers in California and I can send it without the bullet button for the rest of you lucky people in the more rifle friendly states. Inside the receiver is an Armalite National match 2 stage trigger with a 2.5 pound take up and just under 2 pound let of. All internal springs are chrome silicon for reliability. The fire controls have been nickel plated for durability aesthetics. It has a full length quad rail for mounting anything you want such as night vision, lights, lasers....just about anything. Don’t think this rifle is all show. It will certainly hold a 1 inch or better group with factory loads. The barrel and upper receiver are DPMS. The receiver is a super heavy duty slick side and the BCG and has been Molly coated for smooth operation. The gas system is rifle length and has a weaver gas block for back up sights. The barrel is a heavy contour 18"" match grade 1 in 8 twist Panther Arms Mark 12 in stainless steel. It has been factory coated with black Teflon to keep the recce/mark 12 look correct. The optic is a brand new Nikon 3x9 P223 scope with BDC bullet drop compensating reticle and it has a brand new Burris 20MOA cantilever scope base. Rifle comes completes as shown with bi pod and ...sorry 10 round magazine. y'all can change that! The stock is Magpul STR with H-buffer and the pistol grip is MOE. This is a well rounded rifle that I set up for predator shooting. It put 77 grain black hills down range at .75 MOA/inch and it was worn out. This rifle is 100% new parts and I'm selling it for special reasons unfortunately. I have lots of cash invested in this rig and I hope its new owner can appreciate the time that went into putting this rifle together. It looks much nicer in person. It measures between 39"" and 35"" depending on how you have the stock positioned. It is as agile as a carbine but as accurate as a designated marksmen rifle. I copied this off of what the navy seals would use for medium range work. People talk a lot about that type of performance but seldom can they do it. This rifle has what it takes to get out there. So it makes for a great all around shooter. With ammo prices and availability so slim its nice to know that you will not waste any ammo with this rifle because it is very likely to hit what you are aiming at. Cashiers Checks preferred. This rifle is on consignment at local gun store so the auction can end at anytime. Thank you for looking and bidding on this rifle. Buy it Know get free shipping. BPM


To understand this rifle better than I can describe it please take a look at this guns and ammo review. Mine is a very little bit different. I chose some different things for a more ridgid platform but they should shoot similar. In theory mine should punch holes tighter. That is in theory. http://www.gunsandammo.com/reviews/dpms-panther-mark-12-review/"

914,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1435914,For Sale:  FRONT SIGHT FOUR-DAY DEFENSIVE HANDGUN COURSE CERTIFICATE,"Miami, Florida, United States",$ 110,"Listed On: Thursday, April 11, 2013",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Four-Day Defensive Handgun course at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute in Pahrump, outside Las Vegas, NV. Retail price: $2,000, but I'm giving it away for just $110.
This course is fast paced and exciting. The four day curriculum includes almost forty hours of training crammed into four intense days - there's very little down time! You spend many hours on the range performing live-fire exercises in addition to learning dry practice drills. You also attend several dynamic and thought-provoking classroom lectures. You will have an introduction to tactical training, and then you will have an opportunity to ""clear"" a live-fire shooting house simulator. Front Sight's unique teaching methods will bring you to the highest level of training offered by any training school in the industry. Even if you've never shot a gun before, or if you've been shooting for years, you're skills will improve dramatically. After completing the course you will have a complete understanding of the defensive handgun and a skill level that surpasses many of those who carry a gun for a living. Your gun handling, marksmanship, and tactical skills will be better than they've ever been and you will be able to safely and easily draw your weapon from a CONCEALED holster and fire two,sighted shots to the center of a target 5 yards away - all under 1.5 seconds!
For complete information on this course go to the following link: http://www.frontsight.com/courses/defensive-handgun-training-course.asp
I've taken several courses at Front Sight. Every time I've been on the range there's been law enforcement, military, and corrections personnel as well as private citizens on the range with me. My experiences at Front Sight have always been positive, so I purchased lifetime memberships for myself, my wife and my six children because I trust and believe in Front Sight! When we arrive at Front Sight we are treated with the utmost respect - in a friendly, supportive, and caring manner - by the absolute best trained, most consistent, and most effective instructional staff in the industry. Simply put - Front Sight provides the finest firearms training in North America!
You don't need to be an experienced shooter to take the course. I brought my 19 year old daughter who had never handled a BB gun, let alone a firearm. Upon completion of the course she understood basic tactical principles and had multiple opportunities to use her newly acquired skills under the stress of simulated, lethal encounters.
Friday-to-Monday...or Tuesday-to-Friday: You choose which portion of the week that's best for you to train.
Lecture Topics Include: Use of Deadly Force and the Law; Color Code of Mental Awareness; Stopping Power; Civil Liability, Concealed Carry; Course also includes Supplemental Lectures on Shotgun and Rifle topics
Firing Range Drills Include: Loading and Unloading; Grip, Stance, Sight Picture, Sight Alignment, and Trigger Control; Presentation from Ready and Holster; and Target Engagement from Arms Length to 15 yards under Time Pressure. Malfunction Clearing; Speed and Tactical Reloading; Tactical Training Simulation using Realistic Targets in Shoot/No Shoot Scenarios; Single Elimination Shoot-off, and Distinguished Graduate Skills Evaluation..Training starts at 8:00am each day and ends after 6:00pm each day.
Paperless Electronic Certificate: Your training certificate cannot get lost because it is provided in the form of an ""Digital Certificate"". I will send via email a Front Sight issued paperless, electronic certificate number directly to you upon receipt of payment. It will allow you to log into Front Sight's registration page at https://www.myfrontsight.com/secure/login.php and register for your course (or you can phone Front Sight to register). As long as you register for your course at least two weeks before the course date, you will be guaranteed a spot in the course you select. There is no expiration date on the course certificate once you purchase it. 
Prerequisite: None - no experience necessary.
Ammunition: You must purchase ammunition for your course. Approximately 600 rounds of ammunition are required for this course. You can purchase ammunition at Front Sight, or you can bring factory new ammunition (reloads are not allowed).
Handgun Rentals: You can rent a handgun, holster, belt, magazines, and magazine pouches from Front Sights Pro Shop. Front Sight provides a Glock 17 in 9mm as the standard rental gun (others may be available upon request). Contact the Front Sight Pro Shop at http://www.frontsightproshop.com/ You can also bring your own firearm and equipment. You must bring electronic hearing protection.

This is basically brand new. There is one minor dent on the top of the safe, but does not affect functionality in any way. I came home and unwrapped the box and was too lazy to return it because its 260+ lbs. 

This safe is sold out everywhere and is the absolute best safe you can buy for under $400. I paid $397 plus tax which came out to $432. So you can buy from me and save $42.

Bushnell Elite 3200 Tactical Rifle Scope 10x 40mm 1/10 Mil Adjustments Mil-Dot Reticle Matte

Product Information
Bushnell #: 321040T UPC #: REDACTED45
Bushnell Elite 3200 Rifle Scopes feature resettable fingertip adjustments for windage and elevation with repeatable audible clicks. They also feature 1-piece hammer forged aluminum titanium alloy tubes and multi-coated lenses that have been treated with Bushnell's Rainguard coating. This scope features 1/10 milliradian (MIL) windage and elevation turrets and a Mil-dot reticle; this is also known as MIL/MIL. The combination of these two features enables the shooter to make quick and precise corrections. By using the Mil-dot reticle to measure how far off the shot is in MILs, each dot is 1 MIL apart, the shooter does not need to convert milliradians to minutes of angle in order to correct the point of aim. With traditional 1/4 MOA turrets, if the point of impact is measured to be 1.5 MILs low the shooter needs to convert the MILs to MOA and then adjust the turrets which can be confusing. With a MIL/MIL rifle scope if the shot is 1.5 mils low then the shooter simply turns the turret 1.5 mils or 15 clicks. The mil-dot reticle can also be used to determine how far away an object of known size is.  Bushnell Elite 3200 Rifle Scopes are waterproof, fogproof and shockproof and covered by the Bushnell limited lifetime warranty.
