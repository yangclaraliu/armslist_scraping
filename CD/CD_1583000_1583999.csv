This is a early Du-Lite blue Remington Rand with type 2 slide, early ring less grips, checkered small parts, and Colt barrel. This pistol is an all original example, and even includes the original holster and issued ammunition! This pistol has all of it's original parts and is the correct configuration, with original finish. This is a rare early Remington Rand in the 930000 serial number range. Notice the raised grips screws, this was common on early examples. The identifying characteristic of a Type II is the Remington Rand, Inc. spans the length of the slide stop, while on the Type III slides it only runs 70% of the length and on Type I Remington Rand legend New York is not abbreviated.

This is the Buckmaster LT (Buck 185). This is a skeleton handle version of the famous Buckmaster knife. There were only 6038 of these knives made between 1984 and 1989. To put this in perspective, if this knife were a car, it would be something like a Plymouth Superbird as the numbers that were produced are not that far apart. This knife is in very good condition with some minor wear from use, and it has a small nick in the rubber handle (see photo), otherwise it is in fine shape. Look this up online if you like and you will find that in almost any condition they are fetching a high price (around three hundred). You can have mine for 150.00. If your a collector of knives, this is one you don't want to miss out on, as there will never be any more made, and the stock of what is out there will only get slimmer as time goes on. Many of these knives have already been lost due to hard use, as few understood how rare they are. This is a survival knife after all, that is what it was designed for, and what I used it for when I went camping, until it got stored away years ago, and getting stored away is why it's still in nice shape. If your interested let me know, until then the Buckmaster will be going back into storage. Thanks.

NOTE: This is for local pick up only, I will not ship this knife. Thanks."

I found a website that actually sells this magical stuff and at real prices (I have 2, 555 box bricks on back order that will be to me finally in the next 3 weeks - been waiting 2 already) and at only $24.99 per brick plus shipping - about $30.00 each total. 

I am looking for the honest folks out there that, like myself, that like to target practice without spending way more than needed on ammo to buy just 1 brick of 525, 535 or 555 rounds of .22lr. (preferably Federal or Winchestor) Not for hoarding or reselling, but for actually going out to the range and having a day of fun this weekend. 

I will pay $35.00 a brick, maybe $40. Sad thing is just months ago it was $19.99 a brick at Fleet, and then the hoarders came and cleared all the shelves everywhere. 

Nice thing is, I know someone in the business and they say they are working all types of O.T. and big shipments will be going out soon, so all you not so wonderful people on here just trying to make money, good luck, soon you will be stuck with all that ammo and will only break even. : )

Designed by the famous gun designer John Browning.  John Browning and Ithaca both have a very interesting historical background.  

This shotgun shoots 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells. Ventilated rib barrel 28"" with chokes - including a modified and an extra full (turkey) choke.  

For an extra $200 I can include a matching Deerslayer 20"" rifled barrel with iron sights that is in 99% condition. You won't find many Ithaca 87's in this kind of condition and you will be surprised how accurate slugs are with the 20"" rifled Deerslayer barrel!  You may even decide to sell all your rifles!  This shotgun has been carefully maintained and stored.  It has the corncob forend.

I will sell this gun for $650 with either barrel. Your choice.  

 It only takes a minute or two to change the barrel with no tools--wonderful for cleaning, storage, and transporting.  The lockup on the barrel to the receiver is much tighter on Ithacas since it's a threaded fit, not merely a slip fit.

I prefer not to ship this shotgun and would like a face-to-face transfer with proper Florida ID exchange and Bill of Sale signed by both parties.  If you see this ad then the gun is still available.   Please don't ask if it is still available.  

The Ithaca 87 is just like the Ithaca 37 except it has no slam fire trigger.  The barrels will even fit most Ithaca 37's with serial numbers of 855,000 or greater.  Thank for looking!"

Pistol comes stock with skeleton trigger, commander hammer, beavertail, Heine Straight Eight sights, lowered ejection port, checkered front strap, and ambi safety. Only blemish on the pistol is scratch on left side below the slide release lock, where prior owner scratched the surface when attempting to reassemble the gun. I have buffed most of these out using Mother's Mag Cleaner. Otherwise, this gun is in good shape and a great shooter. For the same price as the GI entry level pistol for one of the guns made in the Philippines, you can have a gun with a lot more options. Pistol comes with three 8 round magazines. I'm only selling because I have put another 1911 in layaway and would like to sell this one to help fund the newest purchase. Read the reviews on this gun and see what a true bargain it is. Thanks for looking! Sorry, no trades!"

The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments. Trigger pull weight is a comfortable 5.5 pounds and trigger travel is a crisp .5"".

The GLOCK, non-fiberglass, reinforced polymer frame helped revolutionize the handgun industry by delivering a new standard in high-impact resistance, durability, and extended life all while significantly reducing weight. All GLOCK metal parts are treated with a Nitration finishing process that optimizes the molecular structure of those surfaces. This progressive technology delivers a high degree of surface hardness, maximum durability, and exceptional corrosion resistance, that provides many years of trouble-free service under the harshest environmental conditions.

GLOCK barrels are manufactured using a cold-hammer forging method, with surface treatment and rounded interior profiles allowing for uniform precision and consistency—even after a high number of rounds have been fired. Plus, polygonal rifling leads to a better gas seal that translates to higher velocities, increased accuracy, and a substantial reduction in maintenance.

This pistol includes a speed loader and ships in a Glock branded padded hard case

Caliber: .40 S&W

Capacity: Three 13 round magazines included

Barrel: 4"" Cold Hammer Forged, 1:10"" twist, polygonal rifled

Dimensions: 7.3"" long, 5"" high, 1.2"" wide

Weight: 21.3 ounces unloaded, 31.1 ounces loaded

The engineers have welded together the lead core and copper jacket to obtain controlled expansion and a higher weight retention. The bonding can also take on the toughest barriers at varied ranges and velocities to simulate real world threat. 

Upon impact, the jacketed hollow point initiates expansion up to 1-1/2 times the size of the original bullet diameter. The unique notching in the bullet creates six equal segments creating maximum expansion on impact. Finally, Winchester has chosen nickel plated brass to maximize reliability through smooth chambering and case ejection.

Brand New in the box Glock 30S -- the latest 45 ACP pistol from Glock.  It mates the double stack (10+1) SF frame with the slim and light barrel & slide similar to what is used on the Glock 36.  The result is a lighter, more comfortable pistol to carry -- but with the greater magazine capacity of the larger & heavier pistol.

I thought I might carry this as a CCW -- but I decided to stick with another firearm.  Absolutely nothing wrong with the pistol and these are in high demand and difficult to obtain.  Buyer will also have the option of purchasing an additional after-market Lone Wolf barrel that is extended and ported.  This barrel will allow the ability to shoot lead bullets as well as tame the recoil significantly.
