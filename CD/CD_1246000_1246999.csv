Also, beware of those cheaper Carbon Model ARs out there.  You have to ask yourself, do you want to bet your life on one ?  Talk to an Armorer.  Have you seen what happens to your carbon arrows when disintegrate?

I am selling my Brand New AR15 Windham Weaponry R16M4A4T, because I need the money for another project.  This was purchased brand new in January.  The heavy oil job is still on the rifle.  Everything that came with the rifle comes with it here.  All paperwork (lable that was on the rifle too), box, rifle case, etc... comes with the gun.  This has a lifetime transferrable warranty too.  You can not go wrong with this Quality Gun.  Windham Weaponry is basically the owner of the original Bushmaster.  He had to sell the machinery and sign a non-compete agreement for 10 years.   Time was up, and he wanted to put his people back to work, and thus the dawning of the Windham.

The last lot is 700 rounds of Blazer Brass and PMC Bronze, and 40 rounds (2 20 round boxes) of Hydro-Shok. Yes I know this is 740 rounds, but the price of the Hydro-shoks more than makes up for that.

127,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1246127,For Sale/Trade:  2006 Kawasaki Ninja 650r,"Bothell, Seattle, Washington","$ 1,800","Listed On: Tuesday, March 12, 2013",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Looking to either sell or trade this great little bike. In perfect mechanical condition with a bit over 4k miles on it. I bought it from the first owner, who low sided at 35 on a country road and ripped the fairings off. I got it at a good price with the intention of making it a street fighter. I got new turn signals and a headlight for it thinking I could easily throw them on and wire them in. And then I realized all of my mechanicing experience was on 80's American cars with simple mechanical systems and no electronic tom-foolery. I could probably figure out the wiring harness and all that eventually, but I'd rather spend that time riding. I was given a quote of $400 to give it a tuneup, mount a new rear tire (I have the new rubber just no way to mount it), and wire in the new headlight and turn signals. Honestly though, I feel kind of stupid every time I look at the damn thing and would really prefer to just get rid of it and start over.

Ideally I'd like to trade this. If you have a bike in good running condition that you're looking to upgrade and either have the know how to wire in the electric bits or just want to have someone else do it for you it seems like a win win. You get a great bike at a low cost, and I don't have to feel like a dumbass every time I walk out into the garage. I'm especially interested in older Honda Magna's and Yamaha Seca II's but I'm very open to anything in good running shape. I'd like $1800 for the bike, new parts, and new tire in a straight sale. I have a clean title, although I can't find the actual paper so I'll give you the registration and a Release of Interest. Here are a couple crappy cell phone pics, I'm happy to get more or add additional detail if you're interested."

This gun was my fathers and it has been in storage for the last 15+ years. I am not a gun collector and I have not tried to clean the gun or do anything with it. The serial # is 710452 - which from what I understand means made in 1936. There are other dates on one side of the barrel the last date being - July 22, 1913 ( not sure if that means anything or not ). I am only looking to sell no trades. I have many pictures that I will be happy to send you if you are interested. I live in indianapolis and will meet on the northwest side of town. I am selling for $500. Thank You !"

Para TTR uses a trademarked Delayed Impingement Gas System (DIGS) designed by Allan Zitta to get the shooter back on target faster than any other rifle in its class. The system utilizes a unique modified gas key sporting a nickeled operating rod that runs through the upper receiver and over the barrel to the gas block where it sleeves the chrome-plated gas tube, with the recoil spring over the gas tube on top of the barrel.  No buffer tube or spring in the stock (which reduces overall length by almost 10” when folded)!  Stock and tube are by Yankee Hill machine as are the sights.
The charging handle is beefier and features a channel that redirects any gas heading towards the shooter’s face out to the side. Drawing the charging handle on the TTR is more like drawing a bow’s string than charging a typical AR. That’s because you’re stretching the op rod’s spring system rather than compressing it. Locking the bolt to the rear always means that the charging handle is always pulled back into the receiver.
Releasing the action allows the op rod spring to drive the bolt carrier assembly with such force that it’s hard to imagine a situation where it would be necessary to use the forward assist to lock the bolt into the chamber. Combine the fact that a scarce amount of carbon fouling ever enters the chamber with the benefit of the op rod spring translates into enhanced reliability.
Field stripping the upper receiver on the TTR starts with the top rail and is different than a typical AR. Depress a spring-loaded plunger and slide the top rail on the handguard forward to remove it. Draw the action spring back and remove the retaining clip, easing the spring forward. With the upper broken down, shotgun style or completely removed from the lower receiver, remove the charging handle by pulling it rearward from the receiver. The charging handle also brings the bolt carrier assembly and operating rod with it. From this point, disassembly, care and maintenance are identical to a typical AR rifle.
I paid $2400.00 plus tax.  About 200 rounds (+/-) put through this rifle.  Condition is excellent.  Asking $1800 or make an offer!  (Come with a case)"

I have a 3 year old Taurus PT1911 that I am looking to part with. The 1911 is a great piece and comes with a lot of bells and whistles most models do not.

It has been a great shooter with about 800 rounds down range and no malfunctions. The only downside is that it does has a scratch on the slide (see pictures), from holstering. It is simply cosmetic though. 

The firearm will come with a hard case, a kydex paddle holster for OWB, 3 eight round magazines and a couple different grips I have accumulated over the years. 

I am willing to sell, but am really looking to trade for something more concealable. Think along the lines of a Glock 26 size pistol. Please send me any offers that you may have. Thanks for taking a look!"

596,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1246596,For Sale:  FS: New Stag Model 2 w/Plus Package and a WHOLE LOT MORE!!!,"Columbus and surrounding area, Columbus, Ohio","$ 2,000","Listed On: Tuesday, March 12, 2013",Rifles,Stag Arms                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is not just another inflated AR deal.  This is going for well below what I have in it at non-inflated pricing.  

This is a Stag Model 2 with Stag's plus package.  The plus package puts the Model 2 at a full Mil-spec tier from tube to tube.  Along with A LOT of brand new upgraded parts.  

A little about Stag (it's been done to death, but for those who don't know).  Stag Arms is sister company, or retail face, of Continental Machine and Tool (CMT).  If you own an AR from Colt, Bravo Company, or damn near any other company that makes or assembles AR's then you probably own a part from CMT.  CMT has made bolts for Colt, they make upper assembly's for Bravo Company (as well as lowers and barrels), and have been supplying just about everyone out there with AR parts for years.  The owner of CMT is the father or the owner of Stag.  CMT makes everything in a Stag rifle.

All that being said, a base model Stag is not a Colt, and is not a Bravo rifle.  However, a Stag rifle with their optional ""Plus Package"" is absolutely comparable.  Their Plus Package is comprised of the same mil-spec components, and held to the same MPI/HPI inspections as the parts CMT delivers to the top tier guys.  

Why the price difference...$1100 for a Stag with the ""Plus Package"" and $1900 for a BCM if they're the same rifle you ask?  Stag/CMT makes everything on their rifles, whereas BCM and others have to contract and assemble the contracted parts bought elsewhere.  Quite a bit more expensive.  

Ok, enough of the sales pitch.  This rifle sells itself.  It is absolutely on par with any top tier direct gas M4/AR I've ever owned.  Beats the crap out of any Colt I had in the service, that's a fact!  There is ZERO play between the upper and lower.  No need for any added wedge crap that will wear other parts faster...just tight tolerance.  All parts are the ever UN-importantly important mil-spec (barrel is 4150 CMV chrome lined, chrome lined BCG and chrome lined properly staked gas key, shot peened Carpenter-158 MPI/HPI bolt w/tool steel extractor and black (not blue) extractor spring, mil-spec buffer tube, and mil-spec single stage trigger group, and M4 feed ramps, 556).  Also, this riffle is right around 30 days old.  I put 60 rounds out of 100 through it to make sure it was good to go and dial in an EOTech 552 (already sold, don't ask :)), you get the remaining 40 so you can play with it without burning you own.  All the upgraded parts were bought specifically for this rifle brand new and I'm selling everything with it.  There are ZERO issues with this rifle, trigger is crisp and creep free...it is perfect.  I'm selling it to fund other interests at the moment.  All prices are what I paid (minus tax and shipping when applicable), they are just for reference.  As I said, I don't expect to sell it for what I have in it.

I have pt1911 and love it, first thing I done was get rid of the crappy cheap ambi safety that falls off after a range trip. Only issues Ive had is ftf while experimenting with other mags. After wasting money on quite a few high end mags, I've had 100% reliability so far (4 years and going) with the factory taurus mags as well as chip mccormick mags. My pt1911 feeds both fmj's and jhp's. I use mine in rotation with other .45's as a defensive carry. I also have a kimber raptor that has been 100% reliable after break in and eats both fmj's and jhp's without any problems using the kimber mags, but doesn't like the chip mccormick mags... I can't speak for any of the cast Filipino 1911's other than a relative had a brand new ria and even after break in wouldn't feed jhp's.. Then again the original colt 1911 was designed to shoot fmj's right? Also with Taurus they have a slack quality control, sometimes you get a good one and sometimes you don't. I would never sell my pt1911, but probably won't ever buy another one of their products."

Gun was cut down to just over 16 1/2"" and Duracoated.  Did not have barrel recrowned so it is flat and left enough that if someone wants recrowned they can.  We used for our kids to shoot squirrels with and it is very accurate.  There was too much weight to the front of the gun for them to shoot.  This lightened it up and is still compliant both in barrel length and overall length.  They all have their own 22's now and it just sits."

The stock is about 3/4″ longer than a standard M4 carbine stock, and 1/4″ longer than a crane stock with padded butt.  The length of the EMOD stock also results in a longer LOP when fully extended, and provides slightly more cheek weld surface area for use with a scoped rifle.

There are two longitudinal, waterproof, battery storage compartments. Unlike other types of storage stocks, these compartments can be accessed while the stock is installed on the rifle. There is an additional storage compartment on the toe of the stock. The long tubes will hold 4 CR123 batteries each. The small compartment is too narrow for CR123 batteries, but will fit N type batteries, or parts or small tools.

Vltor has equipped the Emod with QD sling mount points near the rear of the stock, which can be used from either side.

Length: 7.75 Inches
 LOP Collapsed: 11.5 Inches
 LOP Extended: 14.75 Inches
 Weight: 14 oz
