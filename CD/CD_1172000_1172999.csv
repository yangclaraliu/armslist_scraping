It has Magpul adjustable 6 position sliding stock, pistol grip, trigger guard, sling mount, and hand guard all in OD Green. There is a 20 round Pmag and a single point tactical sling in the same OD green to match the furniture. Also has Magpul rails, a vertical grip, NcStar rear adjustable peep sight, new front sight (with a crosshair built into the winged sight) with bayonet lug and front sling, muzzle brake, UTG CQB red/green dot sight with two quick-release mounts, integrated sunshade, flip-up covers, and extra battery, UTG flashlight with pressure switch that mounts on the side rail. The pressure switch for the light needs to be remounted on the vertical grip (there's a little bit of damage/residue from where the glue had pulled off from the previous owner). 

I'm also including 2 brand new 30 round Gen2 Magpul Pmags in the plastic, the factory hard case and, since it's impossible to find ammo these days, 100 rounds of PMC Bronze .223 ammunition in the box (not pictured) to get you started.  A seven pocket US military AR 15/M16 bandoleer with pin and strap (not pictured) and two magazine couplers/clamps round out this package.

This is a lightly used gun. It shows some sign of wear but is in great shape with no abuse. A few marks on the rear sling post, the aforementioned residue from the pressure switch mounting, etc. It works great in the daylight or at night, however, and is very accurate as well as lighter than your standard AR, even with all the extras attached.  This is everything you need all in one package, whether you're an AR veteran or looking to enter into the black rifle world.

I'm hoping to get cash for this to pay some unexpected bills, so I'm not really looking for trades at this time. However, if you have a gun you need/want to get rid of and are willing to add cash to it I may consider a trade. Lowballers will be ignored. I'm willing to drive a little ways to meet if you're coming from a long distance away. Prefer face to face meeting with cash only, although I am willing to ship to your FFL dealer at your cost. Wisconsin ID required, and CCW preferred so I know you have a clear background. If you have any questions (other than ""do you still have this?"") please feel free to contact me."

The R55 is solid, reliable, and above all, accurate-- hitting those bolts on the 100-yard line at the silhouette side with a decent scope is very possible, not something a lot of stock rimfires can claim. Super flat trajectory, sight in at 50 and shoot at 100 without adjusting. You will notice the rounds flying out there much faster than a .22.

This rifle is very clean, less than a few hundred rounds of ammo through her and always cleaned after every shoot. No jams/FTF/FTE whatsoever. I am also including a brand new magazine (never used, usually close to $30 if you can even find it) and a hundred rounds of Hornady 17M2 to get you started-- Security, Young Guns, and WGS carry this ammo, just to name a few. There's also a scope rail included with the rifle, allows you to see the sights without obstruction. This would be great as a little survivor gun, you can cary hundreds of rounds on you in a compact package and not worry about range-finding your target. Very good quality, very well-built, has to be seen to be appreciated. Will consider reasonable offers."

Honestly never really has much playing time on it even though there are so many games.  43 games with the PS3 are all top tier games I can list if anyone is interested and has something I may be interested in. The accessories are Chargers, remotes, rockband guitar and drums, guitar hero guitars, move, move rifle gun, etc. When I say easily well over $2500 to $3000 spent on my part here it is no exaggeration. I understand there is plenty of depreciation. My kids said I can part with it because they play the xbox more. As for the Wii there are 10 games. Again so much money invested. There are at least two sets of nun chucks and three sets of wii motes.  Have accessories thrown in a box. Think there is a rifle and guns for games and other various little accessories So the Wii, 10 or so games and nunchucks, wii motes, and accessories, a charger base, a fan, and various other accessories are what is included with the Wii.

It's chambered in NATO spec 5.56MM, not civilian .223.  Fewer than 500 rounds on it, but I lost track of the exact count.  Unlike most flattop AR-15s I see listed on Armslist, this rifle is complete with both an optical  reflex sight with coaxially mounted red laser, and Yankee Hill BUIS.

The price is $1300 for the rifle, two Troy Battlemags, and 100 rounds of PMC Bronze ammunition.  I'm pretty firm on that.  The cost of the parts to build it was more than that at pre-panic prices.  Add in the cost of the mags and ammo, and I'm already selling at a loss.  

The trades I'm interested in right now are a  USP .45(allow up to $800 depending on condition), .45acp ammunition(at .45/round), .22LR STANDARD VELOCITY ammo, or American gold or silver coins.

• 870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.

• All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.

• All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.

• Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.

• A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.

• A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.

• Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.

• The fore-end on the Express model is longer and not compatible with many police shotgun vehicle racks.

• The Police shotguns utilize the heavy duty SPEEDFEED Stocks and Fore-ends.

• The Express model will not allow for the addition of an extension tube without physical modification to the tube and barrel, which can nullify the warranty.

• The Express model has a BEAD BLAST BLUE finish while the Police models utilize either High Luster bluing or Parkerization.

• The Express model utilizes a synthetic trigger housing while the Police models use a compressed metal housing.

• The Police shotgun barrel is locked down with a “ball detent” system in conjunction with the magazine cap vs. a lesser grade “synthetic magazine spring retainer” lock down as used on the Express system.

• The receivers used in Police guns are “vibra honed” to smooth out rough finishes and remove burrs before parkerization or bluing.

• Police shotguns use machined ejectors and extractors, as opposed to powdered metal cast which are utilized on the Express."

J.A. PETRAY A LIEGE CIVIL WAR MUSKET-My research tells me that this gun was made by J Auguste Petray from Belgium  1842-1867.  It was one of many companies in the Liege Belgium area that were manufacturing guns for the Unitied States Civil War effort.  To the best of my knowledge it appears to be a close copy of a French 1842 musket.  The gun is in fair condition.  It has some rust, pitting, and fore stock is cracked.

I am constantly looking for good deals on large quantities of new .45 ammo to resell at a reasonable fixed price, regardless of the brand of ammo. My intent is to hold the line at or below $30 per 50 round box during this weird shortage for as long as possible. Yes, I make a couple of dollars per box, I make no apologies for that, but a small profit enables me to locate other supplies and quickly purchase good ammo for resale.

I have no purchase limits, if it's in stock and you have the cash, I will sell as much ammo as you want. It might be a good idea to email or text message me first if more than 20 boxes at a time is wanted.

At this time I do not stock any other calibers other than .45 (sorry, no 9mm or .22), I have enough problems finding .45 to keep supplied. Thanks to all of you who have bought my ammunition recently."

Among the few that have been enamored of the cartridge are Alaskan hunters and serious rifle enthusiasts that have found it to be powerful enough to take down virtually any type of game that is encountered in North America in a rifle that is about the length of the average 94 Winchester carbine. This performance does come with a price, however and that is recoil that can be stout, to say the least. This version of the Model Seven is the MS from Remington’s Custom Shop and with its full-length stock, it resembles the Mannlicher-Schoenauer rifles used by the likes of W.D.M. “Karamojo” Bell and Roy Chapman Andrews.

One advantage of this rifle over a genuine HK91 / G3 is the price tag. Another is not having to take a collectible rifle out to the range. The advantages of this rifle over the CETME is the charging handle doesn't fly back and forth while firing, so you don't have to worry about your thumb getting hit by the charging handle, it takes CETME mags as well as HK91 mags, and it has a smoother action. A gunsmith who is both H&K and Glock certified recently said the headspace is good, and the gun has not been fired since.

There isnt a scratch on this gun (no idiot mark either). 
From the Sig website: The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

This isnt a cheap set up for a .22 and its a very very hard to find one since the mags will be banned within months and probably so will the rifle unless you already own it. Makes shooting fun again when you can leave the range with 500 rounds of ammo shot for 50 bucks ?

If the mags are banned they arent going PERIOD I can try and find a 10 round to add in those are cheap online but I will not ship to states with size limiations PERIOD and I have google so dont lie to me I will check

Your funds have to clear my bank account first so if you paypal (which I prefer the funds have to hit my account ususally within 3 days and I will ship within 24 hours of the funds in my account. 
Legally speaking the gun has to ship to your FFL  but the mags and other toys ill box and ship to you directly  You will pay shipping costs (around $30 -40 not super bad and get it within a few days.

Fellow firearm enthusiast, please help clean up this site from price gougers. Start flagging the overpriced items. We should be sticking together and fighting the folks attacking our second amendment rights here in Colorado, not taking advantage of each other.

When you see these gougers, and they are apparent flag them. They are not trying to make a fair profit but are doubling or tripling the price, simply click on the flag option, click overprice, and hit ok.

This message will likely be flagged by them within minutes and will disappear, so please help out. Copy this message and repost yourself later today and various times during the week. It was flagged and removed at least 8 times yesterday.  Please help me keep the message out there.

If we show a uniform voice, they will eventually keep their hoarded stashes or come down in price.

St. Louis Ordnance Plant in 1953, in lot numbers one through four (an unfinished case exists with ""5"" also, but no loaded ammunition has been observed with that lot number). It was a contract for the U.S. Government, for ammunition for use in whatever convert operations they chose to use it in. It was not made specifically for the ""Bay of Pigs"" fiasco.
Similar rounds were made by Twin Cities (AN) and Lake City (CN).

These rounds are, like all ammunition, collectible, but are not rare.  It is packed in a standard olive-drab 6six-pocket U.S. bandoleer, each pocket holding two, five-shot Springfield-type steel clips, with end tabs, nestled in a carboard pocket within the pocket of the bandoleer intself. Standard U.S. packaging, although the use of Springfield clips in a 1953 contract is interesting of itself, and I have no information as to why that particular arrangement was done.

The bandoleer has no markings other than a stampled representation of the cartridge's headstamp on it.

The ammunition is Ball M2 Alternate, which differs from Ball M2 in having a GMCS bullet jacket, rather than a GM jacket. Bullet weight is 150 grains.
The primer is non-corrosive.

Less than two boxes of shells fired.  The gun is a dream to carry and with a 26 inch barrel it points like a dream.  The Benelli inertia driven semi auto feeding mechanism is regarded as the best in the world.  Comes with 3 chokes, C, IC, and M, plus choke wrench.  I am selling it only because my boat needs some serious repairs to get it in the water this spring.  I bought the gun for $1,500 but am willing to let it go for only $1,100.

Description:
Weighing only 6 pounds, the Benelli Ultra Light is one of the lightest semi-automatic 12-gauge shotgun in production. Sporting a featherweight alloy receiver and shortened magazine tube, Ultra Light shotguns take lightweight construction a step further with their unique raised target rib made from the same super-light, super-strong carbon fiber employed in Formula I race cars. An uplander’s dream, Ultra Light shotguns give you proven Benelli performance at an easy to carry weight you will appreciate while walking back to the truck at the end of a long hunt! 

Inertia Driven System:

Reliable—The Inertia Driven® system never needs adjusting and will cycle anything from light field loads to 3-1/2"" magnums with consistent reliability, year, after year, after year. In fact, there are Inertia Driven® Benelli shotguns that have fired over 500,000 rounds, still in the field and functioning perfectly.

Simple—Inertia Driven® is simple with only three primary parts: the bolt body, the inertia spring and the rotating bolt head. Simple is better.

Cleaner—Gas, smoke and burnt powder stay in the barrel where they belong, rather than being channeled into the gun’s mechanism, as they are in gas systems.

Strong—The strong steel locking lugs on the Inertia Driven® system’s rotating bolt head not only lock steel-to-steel into the gun’s barrel; the lugs lock in even tighter during firing.


Faster—With a greatly reduced mass of parts, Inertia Driven® is faster.

Low Maintenance—The Inertia Driven® system is much cleaner so gun cleaning takes a fraction of the time that it takes to clean a gas-system gun.

Lightweight—The Inertia Driven® system is not only incredibly simple, it is also lightweight, allowing Benelli shotguns to be some of the lightest semi-automatic shotguns ever produced.

Perfect Balance—With no springs, action bar linkage or heavy gas cylinder under the forend, Benelli’s Inertia Driven® shotguns balance like a fine game gun should


Crio® Barrels

Cryogenic physics has revealed that strange things happen when matter is taken to temperatures of -300° F; gases become liquids and solids, ceramics become conductors of electricity and steel is changed at the molecular level.

When a Benelli barrel is cryogenically treated, all of the stresses caused by hammer forging are relieved and the surface of the bore takes on a more even-grained, slicker surface that offers less resistance to wads and shot charges.

With a smoother and more uniform surface, Benelli Crio® Barrels not only pattern better, they stay cleaner longer

Crio® Chokes

Crio® Chokes are the second part of the Benelli Crio® System. Extra-long choke tubes, with a more gradual constriction, coupled with the slick surface created by the cryogenic treatment, puts more pellets on target. The Benelli Crio® System improves patterns by as much as 13.2% and yields denser, more uniform shot patterns.

The specially-designed, longer choke tubes of the Crio® System allows for more gradual constriction of the shot charge, which reduces pellet deformation. Frozen to -300° F, Crio® Chokes have a more evenly grained and slicker surface that provides less resistance to the shot charge as it passes down the bore. When coupled with a Crio® Barrel, the result is as much as 13.2% more pellets on target."

this gun is for you 
got a Steyr m9 in 9mm up for trade
yes Steyr, the same company that brought you the scout sniper rifles and the Steyr AUG bullpup assult rifle used in multipul militaries world wide...

its in great shape personaly have fired about 60 rounds through it, feels good no issues no FTE/FTE. not sure what finish it has on it, but its like a dark olivedrab in color(ive heard parkerized/ tenifer treated)  the trigger is a very crisp pull, said to be superior to even glock(had a g19 and m9 side by side, imo true...) tbh it feels like they took a glock, and made it better (glock fans, dont beat me down)

some of the other neat things about this gun are the sights... they use trapazoid(triangles) you have to get used to them but they are suppolsed to be good for aquiring a target quickly
and followup shots...

gun comes with 
-case
-slide lock keys(great for when childeren at home
-2 15rd mags
-blackhawk open carry holster with magazine pouch

- not included but can be sold/traded with, 1000rd case of 9mm remington umc, but mostly looking to trade ammo for ammo, smaller amounts of 9mm avaliable as well

this is a good gun and its my carry weapon. Not itching to let go, but like id see what else is out there...

The advantages of this rifle over the CETME is the charging handle doesn't fly back and forth while firing, so you don't have to worry about your thumb getting hit by the charging handle, it takes CETME mags as well as HK91 mags, and it has a smoother action. A gunsmith who is both H&K and Glock certified recently said the headspace is good, and the gun has not been fired since.

Bravo Company factory complete MID-LENGTH upper includes:
Cold Hammer Forged 1/7 twist, chrome-lined, MP, HP Barrel
Daniel Defense quad rail with sliing quick-detach points
Wilson combat front sight block with flip-up sight.  This thing is as solid as a fixed front sight, and folds down below the picatinny line-of-sight to give you a complete top rail.
Sig Sauer rear flip-up sight
lo-profile rubber rail covers

Research mid-length (middy) rifles if you haven't yet.  They have slightly less recoil and better reliability because of the increased gas-tube length.

Leupold VX-R 3-9 Illuminated scope + Leupold mount are an extra $399 if you want them with the rifle.  Or $475 if you want to buy separately.

Trade offers considered, but I need to end up with mostly cash in the end.  I'm interested in a Glock 30SF or maybe a 1911
