Different versions of the SUB-2000™ rifle will accept most double column handgun magazines (see list below). By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000™ rifle can instantly be reduced to a size of 16.25 x 7 inches for ease of storage.
The polymer of the weapon is made of an impact modified glass reinforced Zytel. Two integrated Picatinny rails come standard on the SUB-2000™ forend for mounting compatible accessories. The forend also includes five mounting slots per side, configured for various M-LOK™ accessories.
The stock can be adjusted to three different positions for shooter's comfort. Each position adds approximately 5/8 of an inch to the overall length of the weapon, with a total extension of 1.25 inches in the further rearward position. The stock includes a single point sling loop attachment, a slot for adding a nylon sling loop (1.25"" wide is ideal), and a Picatinny rail on the bottom for adding small accessories.
The SUB-2000™ features a push-bolt safety located behind the trigger on the grip assembly. The bolt can be locked in the rear position by cycling the bolt to the rear and rotating the operating handle up into the cutout on the receiver. The rear sight is of aperture type and the AR style front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation.
The thread protector on the SUB-2000™ is removable, if the shooter desires to replace the thread protector with a compatible accessory for the 1/2""-28 threads (9mm model) or 9/16""-24 threads (.40 cal S&W). The SUB-2000™ can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools."

Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.Specifications:- Family: Rough Rider Series - Model: Rough Rider Small Bore - Type: Revolver- Action: Single - Caliber: .22 Long Rifle (LR)- Barrel Length: 6 1/2""- Capacity: 6 Shot- Sights: Fixed - Stock/Frame: Alloy Frame - Stock/Grips: Black Pearl - Finish: Blue - Weight: 33.40 oz"

Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs feature a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Variant 7 is a double action without control lever (no manual safety/decocking lever)."

I assume one of its owners from back in the day must have accurized it for competition or something?I have gone completely through it and repolished everything, including all internals. Replaced the springs, firing pin and a couple of other items but I have all of the original parts too. Took it out 2 weeks ago and shot approximately 100 or so rounds through it and it is a great shooter with very nice recoil and accurate as well. The mags (2 of them) should probably be replaced as they are not the best. I would stick with ball ammo as I tried a few brands of JHPs, etc. and it did not like them.It has the pearl-like grips that are in nice condition and fit well in my hand. If I keep it, I will probably mount it in a display box and hang it on the wall as it is a beautiful piece of history but will function if the need arises.Asking $900.00 oboFeel free to text me at 281.seven 36-nine 678Please do not ask if it is available.
