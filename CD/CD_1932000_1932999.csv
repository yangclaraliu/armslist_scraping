Sig Sauer P250 Compact 9mm Pistol w/ SIGLITE Night Sights - 15rd: S250C-9-BSS
The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". 

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. 



The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. 



The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward. I accept USPS money order or bank certified check.

Both pistols have a snag-proof design that permits quick presentation to the target, a slide blade front sight for fast target acquisition, and a smooth, crisp trigger pull in double/single action.

QUALITY POCKET PISTOLS. 
The same dedication to advanced design, uncompromising quality and strict quality control that make the 92FS, Cougar and Cheetah such international standouts is found in all Beretta small caliber, pocket-size pistols. Simplicity, safety and practical use are their best qualities. 
PRACTICAL AND SIMPLE.
The exclusive tip-up barrel allows the user to easily load a round directly into the chamber. It also assists in the safe clearing of the pistol by allowing a live round to be easily removed from the chamber and the bore quickly checked. Jamming and stovepiping problems are virtually eliminated by the open slide design shared by all small frame Berettas. 

1) Barrel. Forged out of special high-strength steel; precisely rifled for accuracy. The Inox models feature stainless steel barrels.
2) Slide. Machined out of high-strength carbon steel and specially heat treated.
 3) Sights. Notched rear sight and blade front sight for fast target acquisition.
4) Frame-mounted. Manual, conveniently thumb operated.
5) Contoured Tang. Top of the grip area is precisely curved and relieved to snugly accommodate the shooter’s hand, thus protecting the thumb web from being pinched by the slide and increasing the pistol control upon firing.
 6) Frame. Made of a special alloy, noticeably stronger, lighter and more corrosion resistant than stainless steel. In all other models the frame is made of special aluminum alloy forgings and anodized black or gray.
7) Tip-up Barrel Latch.
 8) Trigger Pull. Smooth, crisp pull in double/single action. 
9) Snag Proof Design. Smooth contours permit quick, smooth draw.
3032 TOMCAT. EXCELLENT POWER VS WEIGHT.
Stopping power, concealability and lightweight – that’s what the double-action Tomcat is all about. Using 60-grain .32 ACP (7.65 mm) hollow-point ammunition, this latest addition to Beretta’s small frame collection provides firepower equalling the punch of a .380 (9mm Short). Yet, all this serious capability is packed into a compact, lightweight 4.9” (125 mm), 14.5 ounce (400 gr.) package. A drift-adjustable rear sight provides for superior accuracy. Available in the Tritium version featuring the tritium luminous front sight in some countries. 

3032 TOMCAT INOX.
This new model has a stainless steel slide and barrel. The alloy frame is gray anodized to match the color and finish of the stainless components. The trigger, hammer, safety, magazine and other parts are blued. All other features are the same as the Tomcat."

2008 Tomberlin Emerge E-4 LSV (Low Speed Vehicle)/ Electric Car. It is black in color and only has 1085 miles. It was just serviced at Palmetto Custom Carts in Mt. Pleasant, an authorized Tomberlin Dealer.  All batteries tested at 100% with regards to state of health and charge, with the exception of one, which tested at 97% (I have printout of test results).  They are all re-conditioned Trojan batteries, with 4 being 2011, and 4 being 2009. The vehicle has a custom full enclosure with matching seat covers (cost approx. 1k).

This vehicle can be tagged and registered through DMV as a LSV, having met all of the guidelines of the DOT. This would allow you to operate the vehicle anywhere there is a 35mph speed limit or under. It can also be registered as a golf cart, which would allow operation on streets 25mph or less within a certain distance of your registered home. This vehicle will literally pay for itself over time, as it will save you in gas expenses ( See SC Laws pertaining to LSV's/ Electric Cars/ Golf Carts). Below documentation was taken from Tomberlin's Website. For inquiries or to set up an appointment, please call 8four3-44two-20one9. Thank you.


The E-Merge E-4 is an aggressively styled, four passenger, street-legal, electric car that can charge overnight on a standard 110 volt outlet and have a range in excess of 30 miles. It is targeted to individuals in local neighborhoods and communities for running errands, commuting and general recreation. Its powerplant will generate almost 11 kilowatts making it capable of a top speed of 25 mph and giving it the ability to aggressively climb hills. The Tomberlin E-Merge™ has 4 wheel braking, seat belts, tip-over-bar, lights, and is street legal.

I shot it months ago with plans to go shoot it some more but I just don't make it out enough to have this sitting in the safe so it deserves a better home.

 The gun is all Palmetto State Armory and was purchased as a complete rifle with the following upgrades:

 Chrome Bolt Carrier, Troy Defense Battle Quad Rail (very nice and lightweight), Magpul flip up rear sight, C Products 30 round magazine and a Bulldog Case.

 It has a 1/7 twist 16"" chrome lined barrel with flash hider and it is chambered in 5.56x45mm, it is a carbine with a mid length quad rail on it with plenty of room for anything you would want to mount on it. It Has a 6 position adjustable stock.

 The shine you see is a coat of oil I wiped it down with after I cleaned it the last time I shot it, I always put a light coat on my guns before I put them in the safe, the camera flash makes it look a lot shinier than it really is.

 This is a great rifle and I am going to regret selling it one day. I am not looking for any trades but if you have to have the rifle and are offering something nice and attractive I will at least hear your pitch."

Again, as a result of popular demand, Buffalo Bore has added a new cartridge to its line—the 460 Rowland.

The 460 Rowland, as we load it, is squarely at mid 44 magnum power levels.  This means that a person can now carry a 1911 style combat pistol that has the power of a 44 mag. revolver, but is slimmer, faster to reload, faster to shoot and holds nine rounds instead of a revolver’s six.  The 460 Rowland casing is simply a 45 ACP case that has been slightly lengthened so it won’t chamber in a 45 ACP chamber.  It also has a stronger web area in the casing, so as to avoid ""blow outs"".

To acquire 460 Rowland test guns, I sent two of my 1911 45 acp pistols to Clark Custom Guns and had them install their 460 Rowland conversion kits. To date the converted 1911’s work great. I can fire a 255gr. hard cast bullet @ 1300 fps or a 230gr. FMJ-FN bullet @ 1350 fps. What a great ""woods"" pistol that still maintains combat pistol qualities.

We are using flash suppressed powders in each 460 Rowland load, so that if you have to shoot a bear or “bad guy” in the dark, the muzzle flash will not blind the shooter and we feel this feature is a big tactical advantage as most civilian shootings in America, occur in low light and we are willing to bet that most emergency wildlife shootings in the wilderness will be in low light too."

It has 152,000 original miles. Within the past 5k it has had the clutch replaced, cv's replaced, water pump replaced, cooling system flushed, and belts replaced. I have the NC title in my hand. It is the LS trim line sporting 142 hp out of a 1.9 liter engine. I have been getting around 33 mpg on average. Its actually fast, fast, reaching 0-60 in just 7.4 seconds. It has power windows, cool ac(needs recharge?), factory am/fm cassette, and power windows. The car runs and drives great; and I wouldn't hesitate to jump in it and drive to Alaska and back. I purchased the car from elderly neighbors who were entering a nursing home, accordingly this car was never beat on or raced. The elderly owners loved this car and spared no expense maintaining it as they wanted it to be the last car they ever owned (and it was). They actually changed the oil every 1,500 miles and the pcv valve every year at Jiffy Lube.

I'm sure many of you can relate to the fact that I am hesitant to sell outright as the better half will take the cash and buy curtains. I'm looking for partial or complete trades for used hunting rifles, old double barrel shotguns, old revolvers. I am an expert in firearms appraisal as I do it professionally, accordingly I am not interested in junk (AR-15's in .410, Mavericks, S&W Millenniums, etc). I think the fairest way to negotiate a trade is to determine fmv by average sale price on gun broker vs average sale price of the acura on ebay (completed auctions). Model 70's, 36's, 37's, 700, 77, etc are all of interest."

Like New. Price includes shipping. No trades, thank you. 

Dillon Precision Product Description: Dillon Three-Die Rifle Die Sets include a sizing/ depriming die, a bullet seating die and a taper crimp die. Sizing/Depriming Die The sizing/depriming die is full-length, to minimum tolerances, sizing cases down to function in semi- and full-automatic firearms. We strongly suggest that a headspace case gage be used to correctly adjust the size die. For high volume users, such as commercial reloaders, law enforcement agencies, and high power or service rifle competitors, we also offer .223 and .308 die sets with a full-length carbide sizing die. Lubrication is still required, but the increased scratch resistance and die longevity of carbide are of great benefit to these groups of users. The depriming assembly includes a carbide expander ball for ""squeak-free,"" effortless neck expansion. This expander ball is located in the middle of the depriming stem to take advantage of superior initial leverage for easier extraction. In the event of a stuck case, the design of the depriming assembly allows it to function as a stuck case remover. Bullet Seating Die Our bullet seating die is internally designed to keep the bullet straight throughout the seating process. Once properly adjusted, the only measurable runout will be that which is inherent in the bullet. Taper Crimp Die The taper crimp die is also specially configured to center both the case neck and the case body, thereby aligning the entire cartridge for a more uniform crimp. Dillon Rifle Dies are designed to meet the more rigid requirements for both accuracy and precision demanded by today's marksman. A taper crimp die is preferred for loading ammunition intended to be used in semiautomatic firearms with detachable box magazines, and in lever-action firearms with tubular magazines."

After years of recommending various brands and types of ammunition, we decided to do things right and create our own optimized round for suppressor useage. Putting together a heavier bullet, a cleaner powder, a premium lube on the lead round nose projectile gave us consistent velocities and harder hitting performance at subsonic, suppressor friendly speed. The 42 grain lead round nose bullet is heavier than traditionally available rounds, but isn't so heavy as to cause instability. While ""harder hitting"" and .""22lr"" aren't usually associated together, steel silhouette shooters will appreciate the difference between a knockdown and a wobbling target that stays up! A designed velocity of 1020 feet per second ensures the heavier projectile remains subsonic speed in most all firearms without resorting to anemic velocities.

Product Description

GunVault pistol safes are truly premium products that set the standard for the rest of the industry.  We know that security and reliability are prevailing priorities when you need our products, and that's why GunVault pistol safes have the features you want.  Our Biometric scanner provides lightning-quick access, even in the dark. Improved high strength lock mechanism and precise fittings make it virtually impossible to pry open with hand tools. Battery powered for maximum security and easy portability. The MVB 1000 (MicroVault XL Biometric) uses fingerprint recognition, to access the safe contents. A high-performance algorithm is used to achieve speedy identification of enrolled fingerprints; and at the same time has a very low False Reject rate (FRR) for a given False Accept Rate (FAR). This self-learning algorithm of the MicroVault XL Biometric adds new minutiae to the fingerprint templates each time a user touches the finger print scanner, which decreases the likelihood of FRR, updates slight changes that might occur over time to an enrolled fingerprint, as well as to help distinguish variations. The MVB 1000 can handle a maximum of 120 fingerprint templates and comes standard with a 4 foot security cable that allows you to secure it to a fixed object, making it perfect for home and travel.

The SIG SAUER P232 is a small and lightweight pistol. Chambered in .380ACP and featuring a fixed barrel blowback action, the P232 is one of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands.

It is import marked.  Stock has a unit disk embedded in it...disk has been polished so writing is barely visible.  Magazine holds 10 rounds and is removeable but is designed to stay in place and loaded with stripper clips.  There is some Farsi/Egyptian writing on the stock and reciever along with electro pencil translation of the serial number.  Stock is solid with a ding here and there...no cracks.  It functions well...I have fired at least 50 rounds thru it.  Bore is a little dark...strong rifling.  It is a heavy rifle and recoil is not bad for an 8MM.  These were designed on the lines of the Swedish Ljungman...I believe the Egyptians bought the design and tooling from the Swedes when they produced them, or so the story goes.   Will consider a reasonable cash offer...not looking for a trade at this time.  I have a lot of 8MM surplus ammo if u need some as well.  Email for a few more pics.

The forend iron has almost no bluing left. The checkering has been recut and is as sharp as it was when it was new. No cracks in the wood and only one small dent on the forend between the checkering and the barrel on the left side. It has a rare safety option in which the gun fires with the safety forward or backwards where the safety is in the middle. The bores have mirror shine with very little pitting in the chamber area.

I AM NOT A DEALER.  FOR SOME REASON I LISTED IT THIS WAY AND CANT FIGURE OUT HOW TO CHANGE IT.  PRIVATE SELLER

Rugged and rowdy, right down to its very core, the BLR Lightweight ’81 Stainless is ready to take on the toughest hunting conditions you (and Mother Nature) can dish out. The satin finish on the laminated gray hardwood stock, the satin-nickel finish on the receiver and the matte finish on the stainless barrel mean no reflections will spook your trophy buck. The TRUGLO/Marbles fiber-optic front sight lets you draw a fine bead in low light conditions. This is what a serious lever-action hunting rifle should be, and what every other lever-action wishes it was.

The button-rifled barrel is triple-checked for straightness and interior finish and then air-gauged to ensure a consistent diameter throughout the bore’s length.
Every BLR barrel is individually finished with a hand-reamed chamber for tighter tolerances and more precise headspace.
The barrel’s target-type Crown enables a more uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in bullet trajectory. The barrel Crown is recessed to help protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy.
The barrel’s standard sights include a Low-Profile adjustable square notch rear sight and a high-visibility fiber-optic front blade on a raised ramp-style base.?
The satin nickel finish on the receiver beautifully matches the satin stainless barrel finish.
The aircraft grade alloy receiver is precision machined to provide outstanding reliability and years of dependable service.
The slick-sided receiver houses the BLR’s lightning fast, glass-smooth rack and pinion lever action.
The BLR has a rotating multi-lug bolt head that locks into the barrel extension to produce bolt-action accuracy and magnum-level strength.
The BLR is one of the few lever-action rifle designs that is strong enough to use today’s most popular magnum cartridges, giving you the extended reach and flat bullet trajectory other lever-action owners can only dream of.
The BLR has a recessed bolt face that surrounds the cartridge head for added strength and lasting dependability.
The BLR’s generously-sized side ejection port allows fired cases to instantly clear the action without hitting you or your scope and bouncing back onto the receiver, potentially creating a jam.
The folding hammer on the BLR provides an added measure of safety when the hammer is at half-cock, having two positions in that mode so the status of the rifle can be instantly seen and felt.
The folding hammer on the BLR has four basic positions; Full-cock, half-cock, folded hammer position and the dropped or fired position.
The BLR’s trigger is unique in that it travels along with the lever as it’s cycled, meaning that pinching your fingers between the lever and trigger on closing the action is a thing of the past.
The fingerpiece on the BLR’s trigger is nice and wide with vertical friction ribs to prevent your finger from slipping, giving you more precise trigger control for those demanding long-range shots.
The detachable steel box magazine makes for quick reloading, both in the field and on the range.
Unlike lever actions with tubular magazines, the BLR’s detachable steel box magazine lets you use aerodynamically-superior pointed bullets, which opens up a whole new world of ballistic performance that is usually found in bolt-action and autoloading rifles.
Magazine capacity is 3 rounds in the magnum calibers and 4 rounds in standard calibers.
The BLR’s laminated stock is sculpted from a satin gray finished hardwood for no-nonsense durability and the cut checkering in the grip and fore-end is crisply executed for lasting good looks and a more solid grip."

The wife recently decided that she was ready to step up to 9mm, so we no longer need this. 
Here are the package details: 
- Walther P22 Platinum Pink edition
- Kydex adjustable under-the-steering column holster
- 2 extra magazines
- 100 rounds of CII Stinger 22 LR ammo

The gun does have minor wear marks (on the slide - visible in picture) from the kydex holster, but nothing major. It functions great and fires smooth; it is a tad picky in particular with Federal bulk ammo that I've noticed, so it might require more breaking in before it will eat that particular ammo. Other than that, it's a great little shooter; I have no complaints.

I would really like to sell this for $375.00 cash, but would settle for a partial trade of cash and ammo. The ammo I'd accept: 22LR and 9mm priced fair. I will respond to all offers, and if I feel your asking value for the ammo is too high, I will let you know.

Complete with factory stamps, model numbers, and serial numbers. Identical models sell for $2164 today and are not nearly as strong and durable as this one, which was crafted by hand.

This canoe was built with the same thickness of aluminum and number of rivets as were used in building the jet aircraft made by the same company in the United States at their factory in Marathon, New York. Things are not so today with our disposable made in china society.

It even has a connector for a mast and sail so you can save the effort of rowing and cruise, beating the gas prices! Still in pristine condition and has been well kept. I have a 5 h.p. outboard engine with adjustable steering i would be willing to throw in for the right deal. More pictures, details, and specifications are available upon request.

Keep in mind this is not the average canoe, and can comfortably fit FOUR adults. It would be at home on any lake or river. It is perfect for duck and any other waterfowl hunting. It will certainly turn heads on any float with the whole party on the Cadillac of canoes.

With a large weight limit you can bring all your camping and hunting gear, or pack the whole family, kids and all, even bringing the kitchen sink with you! Seeing as it is far from ordinary, I'm expecting extraordinary offers. I know what this is worth, and I expect you to know what your offer is worth too. We all know no ban is coming, so I would rather you don't value your trade like it. We all know a used WASR-10 isn't worth $1000, but I'll entertain any offer, and simply ignore lowballs.
