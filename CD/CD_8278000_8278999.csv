I have owned this gun since new for about 6-7 years. It has seen a very low round count (around 250 at most). I had the barrel shipped to Nefarious Arms, Marvin Pitts and shortened with an AAC brake pinned and welded on. With the brake pinned and welded it is shorter but still meets all ATF requirements. This gun is in excellent shape. If you are not aware, they have stopped importing these guns a while back and they are very hard to come by. Due to how hard these are to find, I will be very picky on trades. Silencer is not included.The only trades I will consider are a SCAR in FDE, a Daniel Defense with the 14.5"" barrel pinned/welded brake, and LWRC with the 14.7"" barrel pinned welded brake.If the ad is still up, it is still available."

If you give out your number and this happens, just tell the people who contact you to flag the ad and it will quickly go away.HOW TO AVOID THIS-- Do not post your number in your ad- Troll will respond ""What's your number"" or, ""call me at #), or ""text me"". Do not. Respond that email works best and that you can answer any questions and arrange to meet right through Armslist email. If they insist on speaking, ask for their number and explain that you will *67 (blocks your number) first, so your number will not show. If they are legitimately wanting to buy/sell/trade then they will be ok once you explain why. If they balk, you just avoided a/the troll! Congrats!- Agree to meet very close. Do not drive far. If a scammer/troll/gun hater stands you up, you have only a couple of minutes invested.Operate this way and you will save yourself a lot of time. (The troll hates that I am posting this solution. He will definitely respond to this one. Lol!)So again...save yourself the niusance of the scammers scum/troll scum and do not give out your number. Email is a perfectly acceptable form of communication these days. AND...If a a gun ad has the location listed as ""Florida, Florida"" that is a scam. Also, anyone advertising local, who offers to ship, that is a scam.Happy shooting folks!NOTE: Due to the nature of this post, I will not be responding to any inquiries. The troll shown is not for sale or trade and the ""item"" or ""firearm"" is not available, at least not in Nigeria. The name of the soda (Pity) and the chips (notice me) sums up the life of the troll!"

Rifle has a 22 inch barrel with smooth wood stock. The hammerless design was a useful improvement as it reduces the lock time. This allows the rifle to be fired more accurately, because the rifleman's muscular tremors have less time to move the rifle off-aim. A hammerless design is also less likely to jam in brush or clothing. During the waning years of the Victorian era, America, the red-headed stepchild of the British Empire was maturing into a world force. The Industrial Revolution was in full bloom, and inventors, engineers and industrialists seemed to pop up in every town. Meanwhile in Utica, N.Y., Arthur Savage, a traveler of the world, businessman and adventurer, settled with his family and began to design guns. Lever-action rifles had taken over much of the hunting public and law enforcement community, but they had one major shortcoming. Their under-barrel tubular magazines could not be safely loaded with spire-point bullets, thus they were limited in terms of trajectory and energy. Savage and his son, Arthur John, designed a lever-action rifle that had its magazine contained within the stock in the Model 1895, and later, the magazine was incorporated into the receiver. Savage patented his rifle and dreamed of lucrative contracts with the U.S. War Department; however, by the mid-1890s the government was committed to the bolt-action rifle. Savage continued to refine his rifle and by 1899 had developed a truly elegant firearm. The Model 99 Savage and its .303 Savage round brought high velocity and flat trajectory to the lever-action rifle. The most notable feature on the Model 99 is its rotary magazine. First introduced on the Savage Model 1895, the magazine consists of a machined brass spool capable of holding five cartridges. A novel idea at the time, and Savage also provided a small hole in the side of the receiver that allowed the magazine to show how many cartridges were in it. The Model 99 was the first hammerless lever gun, and its spring-loaded firing pin had a much faster lock time than one fired by a hammer. The rifle also featured a tactile cocking indicator on top of the receiver toward its rear where it could be easily checked with the thumb. All of these innovations were ahead of their time. Along with the cutting-edge improvements to the lever-action rifle, Savage, ever the astute businessman and inventor, offered his rifle in both cutting-edge chamberings as well as the standbys. The .303 Savage was initially intended to be Savage’s contribution to military rifles, but it turned out to be the first chambering for the Model 99. With its 190-grain bullet, it earned a reputation as a great bear and moose slayer, despite the fact that ballistically the .303 is virtually identical to the .30-30 Win. However, it was dropped from production at the end of World War II, and ammunition for the .303 can be difficult to find today. Along about 1912 Savage chambered the ’99 for Charles Newton’s .22 High-Power, basically a .25-35 Win. necked down to take a .228-inch bullet. This chambering enjoyed a pretty fair amount of popularity during the early 1900s, but its non-standard bullet and a lack of accuracy in the Model 99 eventually doomed it in the 1930s. Savage tapped Newton’s genius again in 1915 when the Model 99 began chambering the .250 Savage, which was then known as the .250-3000 for being the first commercial cartridge to break the 3,000 fps muzzle velocity threshold with an 87-grain bullet. The .250 Savage is my personal favorite chambering for this rifle. It holds a slight ballistic edge over the popular .243 Winchester, yet is as equally pleasant to shoot. With a 100-grain bullet it falls short of three grand, but it makes a nice 250-yard deer or pronghorn gun nonetheless. Once smokeless powder replaced black powder, American shooters became enamored with the .30 caliber. The .30-06 had just won World War I, and returning doughboys wanted a .30 to take afield. The Model 99 receiver was too short to accommodate the government round, so Savage developed a shorter cartridge that came close to replicating the ballistics of the .30-06. On the cusp of the Roaring 20s, the .300 Savage debuted and proved to be one of the most popular chamberings for the Model 99. Some three decades later it was the basis for developing the 7.62 NATO or .308 Win. cartridge. During its production the Model 99 has also been produced in many chamberings: .25-35 Win., .30-30 Win., .32 Win. Spl., .22-230, .243 Win., .308 Win., 7 mm-08 Rem., .284 Win. and .38-55 Win. The Savage Model 99 had a 98-year run—1899 to 1997, less a few years for the war—with numerous variations, each designated by a letter or two after the model number. It remains a popular deer rifle in the east, and I still see a few of them out in the west. Several others and I have badgered Ron Coburn, CEO and owner of Savage Arms, to reintroduce this great rifle, even in limited edition form. About three years ago an effort was made at Savage to do just that. Sadly, there simply was not a way to produce the rifle and make a profit today.   704-788-9002"
