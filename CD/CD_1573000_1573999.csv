Gorosabel is a respected maker. This one has been professionally cut down. The barrel has been cut to a length of 18.5 inches, and the pistol grip nicely cut and rounded to a nice pistol grip. Gives it that classic double barreled sawed off look, but still perfectly legal. OAL and BBL length are both still legal. I have not shot it since I bought it. Would make a perfect gun for home defense.

I want to move on to bigger and better things and I must sell some things to fund other projects. I have 3 shotguns and 2 of them must go along with other guns I will make listings for once I have the time. I will be out of the state until May 17th. I will update with more photos and create subsequent listings for each gun respectively but I am just seeing what's out there. I do not price gouge, so please do not low ball me. Serious offers only!

Other guns for sale include:
Remington 12ga. Marine Magnum Super Tactical Custom
Calico M950 9mm Pistol w/ 3 100 Round Drums
Century Arms AK47 with Flat Dark Earth Furniture
POFUSA AR15 Custom AR15 Pistol (7.5"" BBL)

I also have a plethora of magazines for AR15s, and AK47 type firearms.

Please if you're interested let me know, I will be happy to negotiate prices and talk things out but again no lowball offers. I know the value of what I have and I will not give these away nor will I price gouge like I see everyone else doing. 

I would be interested in trades but I am really only looking for certain guns. But I'll entertain anything high end. I am specifically looking for an Arsenal SLR107 series rifle (either the CR, or the FR), an FNH FS2000 or an ACR. I'm also looking for a .50 Beowulf upper. 

Again, shoot me an offer the worst I can say is no.

Product Information
This Adams Arms AR-15 A3 Base Mid Gas Piston Upper Assembly is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO and comes ready to fire right out of the box after installation onto any standard AR-15 lower receiver. This Base Mid upper comes equipped with a 16"" melonite-finished barrel, A2 flash hider, bolt carrier group, charging handle, picatinny rail gas block, delta ring assembly and a set of polymer 2-piece handguards. Additional features include a forged A3 flat-top configuration that's ready to accept the shooter's choice of optic and/or rear iron sight, M4 feed ramps to help ensure reliable feeding and functioning during rapid strings of fire, and a mid length gas system for a smoother recoil impulse and longer sight radius.

The upper's barrel has been finished inside and out with Adams Arms' proprietary QPQ Melonite treatment that bonds with the metal on a molecular level. Also referred to as salt bath nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, extending a barrel's service life by reducing the friction produced inside the bore upon firing for a net decrease in bore surface wear over time. Nitriding converts the barrel steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered with it due to the uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. The end result is a barrel that's capable of producing accuracy on par with a match stainless steel tube, while also exhibiting the longevity and resilience of a chrome lined, mil-spec barrel.

All Adams Arms uppers feature a short stroke gas piston operating system, which prevents hot gas and debris from being directed back into the action upon firing. The result is a rifle that runs cooler, cleaner and more reliably than those utilizing a standard direct gas impingement system of operation. To ensure that damage doesn't occur to the buffer tube from carrier tilt, the bolt carrier is equipped with enlarged ""skis"" to help guide it into the receiver extension. The bolt carrier's solid steel, 1-piece construction incorporates an integral piston strike face to guarantee integrity over time, while the bolt assembly is spring loaded for proper lock-up and to help reduce bolt bounce and cam pin wear. All piston components are finished in QPQ Melonite for corrosion resistance and easy cleaning/maintenance.

All the ammo is brand new and purchased from places like Walmart, Farm & Fleet, Gander Mountain, The Ammobox, or from Armslist deals. The prices are not inflated and reflect what I paid for them, give or take a very small amount. I am not looking to make money on these and instead want to get them into the hands of someone that can use them. Since the prices are what I have them, the prices are firm so dont bother sending counter offers. 

Terms:  By buying the ammo, you agree that you are legal to purchase it without restrictions in the state of Wisconsin and that ammo is being bought as is. No shipping of the ammo, only face to face on the west side of Madison as a cash deal. I will not break up the individual lots except for the 40S&W (so all 9mm goes together, same with 7.62x39 and 223). For the 40S&W ammo, you can mix and match at 40 cents per round but to make it worthwhile I'd like to sell at least 100 rounds in one transaction. 

I'll respond to all inquiries as long as they are not counter offers. Thanks for looking."

""Robust, Versatile, Affordable Rings For Tactical & Sporting Rifles

These rings are precision machined to true MIL-STD 1913 specs to fit Picatinny-type bases such as Brownells Modular Flattop Riser Mount and Picatinny Scope Bases. No special wrenches needed for installation. Underside of ring is undercut with a rounded radius that offers extra clearance for finger tightening the nut and for final tightening with a standard socket or flat-blade screwdriver. Extra-strong U.S.-size hex nuts have a deep slot that provides maximum engagement of screwdriver blade to help prevent slippage and slot damage—you can even use a U.S. quarter in a pinch. Crossbolt has a square shank that serves as a recoil lug to solidly engage scope base when properly installed to ensure rings won’t shift forward under recoil. Four, strong 6-40 x ¼"" T-15 Torx® head screws securely anchor the ring halves, and large contact area with scope helps prevent slippage even on heavy-recoiling, magnum rifles. Available in 4140 billet steel for superb strength and stability, or aluminum models machined from 6061 T6 billet for reduced weight. Matte black finish blends with most factory rifle and scope finishes.""

This pistol is manufactured in Germany by Walther under Colt license, and imported by Umarex (Walther's parent company).  I bought this pistol about six months ago and I've fired a couple thousand rounds through it, which is like nothing for a .22 pistol.  This pistol is smooth-shooting, accurate, and reliable.  I've done some light modification to it, but I still have all the original parts to include with it, so that you can change it back to its original state if you wanted to.  I've fitted a Greider Precision short aluminum match trigger, installed a Chip McCormick polymer checkered mainspring housing, installed a factory Umarex/Walther extended thumb safety, and installed a set of factory Colt cocobolo checkered wood grips.  I also have an extra factory Umarex/Walther recoil spring for it.  The pistol comes with one 12rd magazine, the same as if purchased new at a retail store.

I prefer the Colt/Walther/Umarex series of 1911 .22LR pistols because they disassemble just like a standard Colt 1911 .45ACP with no tools needed.  The other brands of 1911 .22LR pistols require tools for field stripping.

If the buyer of my pistol is interested, I also have four additional factory 12rd magazines available for sale, otherwise I'll sell them separately after my pistol is sold.  The mags are about impossible to find right now (high demand), and market price is up to $50 each.  I'll sell them to my pistol buyer for $35 each.  I also have over 2000 rounds of .22LR ammo that I'll offer first to the buyer of my pistol.

At first blush you might think you have to shell out big bucks for a long-range rifle, but the Remington Model 700 SPS Tactical AAC-SD with a suggested retail of only $833 will hold its own against rifles costing much more. This particular rifle is brand new it has had 40 rounds fired through it to sight it in and that is it. I bought the rifle to build a nice, multi-purpose hunting/tactical long range platform. However, after purchasing it, putting all the bells and whistles on it, having it bench mounted, then twice sighted, I realized I don't have access to a range that allows me to push the gun to its limits, nor do I have the time or ammo. So as it sits the gun is a fully constructed, brand-new, .308 sniper kit, ready to go push 800+ yards.

 ----Caldwell XLA Pivot Bipod - black:

     The Caldwell XLA Bipods provide a stable shooting support that conveniently
     attaches to almost any firearm with a sling swivel stud. The lightweight aluminum
     design adds minimal weight and deploys quickly, with legs that instantly spring out
     to the shooting position with the touch of a button. Pivoting Models - In the real
     world of hunting, the chances of the ideal shot opportunity occurring while on
     level ground are slim-to-none. 

     A pivoting bipod will allow the shooter to compensate for ground that is unlevel by
     up to 20°. The lower portion of the bipod pivots independently from the upper  
     stockmount, allowing the firearm to be quickly leveled on uneven ground. The
     tension knob can be adjusted to control the resistance of the pivoting motion.

----DNZ Products Game Reaper 1 Piece Precision Mounting System:

     piece mounts

Just sighted in at Belton Gun Club. Has Barska 10 x 40 Power x 50 Scope with Red Lighted Mil-Dot Reticle. Green Long Range Tac-Llite [300 yards] Scope and Magazine are hand camo'd with 3M Viny to match gun which was factory camo'd. [see photos below]. ls deadly accurate at 300 Yards, probably much farther. An unrivaled combination of precision accuracy, blazing-fast follow-ups and hunt-specific features. The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality for the modern predator aficionado. The results are astounding – with very serious implications for every coyote, fox or bobcat that crosses its path.

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

And our new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. Whether you choose the 223 Remington or 204 Ruger version, the semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.

Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails. This new family of firearms consists of three models. Each was designed with input from leading predator authorities and decked in the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage, open country and a multitude of hunting terrains. All come with five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other accessories.

The R-15 VTR Predator Rifle has a 22"" barrel with a fixed stock and pistol grip. At 7 3/4 lbs, it’s extremely stable – the best choice for long shots. Our R-15 VTR Predator Carbine and R-15 Predator Carbine CS* (Collapsible Stock) handle like lightning with their 18"" barrels and weigh a mere 6 3/4 lbs. – perfect for high-speed hunting scenarios. The Predator Carbine CS features a telescoping stock with a fully adjustable length of pull for a custom fit.

Also upgraded is the weather resistant barrel which has been professionally duracoated.

I find the recoil to be far less than the Mossberg, Winchester & Remington family of shotguns- it functions more like a Benelli with half the cost.

Zero holster wear - no holster. Comes as a package ready to go with original box, papers, org. test-shot cartridge, tools, and six (6) 20-round magazines. One sealed box of 50 cartridges (Ball-SS192) plus 20 rounds and two Kydex holsters included.

The Five-seven is extremely lightweight for a full-size gun, weighing ~ 1.5 lbs with a fully-loaded 20-round magazine and one in the chamber... that's twenty-one rounds; and yet two 20-round mags to go. The Five-seven launches a 40 grain bullet with a screaming super-accurate Muzzle Velocity of 2,350 fps and a Muzzle Energy of 390 ft. lbs. Not bad for a gun that has a kick that feels like a little cricket in your palm, and way, way, fun to shoot.

As stated, in addition to the ammo, two high-quality Kydex holsters are included. Both great for concealed carry: 1) Blade-Tech Inside-the-Waistband (IWB) Holster with pair of IWB snap loops, and two J-hooks (1.25"" & 1.5"") sets; 2) Fobus Evolution Roto-Holster™ Paddle, rotates 360° employing a forward or rearward cant.

The Five-seven is a full-size pistol, having an overall length of 208 mm (8.2 in), a height of 137 mm (5.4 in), and a max width of 36 mm (1.4 in). It has the same grip angle as the distinguished Browning Hi-Power and M1911 pistols. The Five-seven barrel is cold hammer-forged and chrome-lined, with a total length of 122 mm (4.8 in) and a rifled length of 94 mm (3.7 in). The barrel has eight rifling grooves with a right-hand twist rate of 1:231 mm (1:9.1 in), and it weighs 113 g (0.25 lb). It has a stated service life of 20,000 rounds and the Five-seven is noted for being very accurate. 

Current models of the Five-seven are single-action, having a short and light trigger pull of 2 to 3 daN (4.4 to 6.6 lbF). They have a Picatinny rail for mounting accessories, and a magazine safety mechanism that prevents the pistol from firing without a magazine inserted.
