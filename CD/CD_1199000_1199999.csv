It is made by Revolution and has a butt pad and is made for .920 bull barrels only. So if you are building a custom 10/22 or want to take your old one and turn it into a nail driver at 100 yards this is a great start. I paid $189.00 and the first $175.00 face to face takes it home. There are no disappointments with the stock I guarantee text me at REDACTED to get going on your nail driver. I was building 3 myself and the cost of 2 I had started quickly got way more expensive than i first thought with E R Shaw helical fluted .920 bull barrels etc so this one is for sale and the 3rd 10/22 was purchased by someone that had to have it at $475.00 new in the box. Check out the gorgeous patterns of the wood. This stock is of extremely high quality.

A nice Marlin 30-30 Model 336cs. It comes with a decent tasco scope, already mounted and bore sighted just yesterday. It also has a mounted piece attached to the hammer that allows a better grip.
This gun has two different safety's. One is the safety ""button"" that you push for fire or for safety. The other safety is the half cocked position on the hammer. When it is in this position the gun will not fire even if the ""button"" safety is off. 
Just like on every hunting rifle this gun is not in absolute perfect condition. Yes, i does have some scratches on the barrel and on the wood but this does not affect the over all performance of the gun. It just proves that it has seen action and that its reliability has never failed.

When the United States Military issued PD-48, a purchase description of properties for a single, multi-purpose product to maintain their weaponry, it became known as the ""impossible specification"" because of its severe requirements. The first product to meet the challenge - Break-Free CLP. 

Break-Free's flagship product, CLP is a unique formulation of synthetic oils and individual proprietary ingredients which synergize in combination to do three important tasks simultaneously: Effectively Clean, Lubricate and Protect metal. Break-Free CLP is now recognized around the world as the standard by which maximum metal performance and protection is ensured. 


Penetrates and spreads along metal surfaces into every pit and crevice to undercut contamination and lift residue away where it can be removed. 
Long-lasting lubricating film dramatically reduces adhesion of sand, grit or other abrasives which cause wear and failure. 

Corrosion inhibitors prevent the formation of rust while Break-Free's unique boundary film protects metal surfaces from moisture and other contaminants. 

Specially formulated synthetic oils won't lose viscosity, dry out or stiffen up in extreme environments - such as cold, heat, dust, dirt, humidity and even salt air - keeping equipment in ready condition for months at a time."

This is a dream to carry because its light but still big enough to handle a punch. A full-fingered grip is possible with smaller hands (unlike some snubs where pinky hangs off). 

The bore axis is low, lessening felt recoil (more of a 'push', less of a 'snap'). Because of this, +P ammo is comfortable to shoot wheras other snubs can be painfull when shooting +P.

Includes:
70 rounds of Speer Gold Dot Short Barrel +P ammo 135grain. The best 38 special ammo ever made, consistant expansion and high performance from short barrel. It has sealed primers, bonded bullets. The hollow point is very deep and wide (makes water jugs burst).

24 Rounds of Hornady Critical Defence 110grain, lower recoil defensive round

77 rounds of 38 Special FMJ 130 grain (Remington & American Eagle)

4 Bianchi speed strips

-Model: Bodyguard 38 
-Caliber: .38 S&W Special +P 
-Capacity: 5 Rounds 
-Barrel Length: 1.9"" / 4.8 cm 
-Action: Double Action Only 
-Front Sight: Black Ramp 
-Rear Sight: Integral 
-Frame Size: Small - Internal Hammer 
-Grip: Synthetic 
-Overall Length: 6.6"" / 16.8 cm 
-Weight: 14.3 oz / 405.4 g 
-Upper Frame Material: Aluminum Alloy 
-Lower Frame Material: Steel-Reinforced Polymer 
-Cylinder Material: Stainless Steel with PVD Coating 
-Finish: Matte Black

The speer gold dot retails for $1.20 each, the hornady critical defence retails for $1 each and the FMJ retails for $.50 each so this is 
$146.50 worth of ammo included. Ammo is almost impossible to find now, check and you will see 38 special is out of stock nearly everywhere.

Please read this posting before you offer me your rifle or shotgun in trade.  I only want a snub nose revolver for my wife or myself.  My first choice is a revolver for my wife and the ONLY thing that fits her hand that she will shoot is a Ruger LCR (Light Compact Revolver).   I would take a Ruger LCR  .357 Magnum with Crimson Trace Laser Grips in an even trade if the LCR was NEW like my XD-S. 


Again, I really do not want any rifles or shotguns so please stop asking me if I'll trade for one.  


If you have a Ruger  *****  LCR  ***** in a caliber  other than .357 magnum or you have one without the laser grips I will entertain the offer but it must include cash.  I will consider other quality handguns in trade that I can sell if I can't get an LCR.  I would also consider a Colt Detective Special or 2.5"" Python or a S&W ""J"" Frame snub nose revolver for myself if I can't get the LCR for my wife.  If I don't get a trade that works I'll take $775 cash for the XD-S Package that also includes  a convertible IWB/OWB leather holster.  I'll take the cash and buy an LCR on Gun Broker.  

This Springfield is new in the box and never been fired.  Please email me with what you have or offers and I'll get back to you.  If the trade/offer is for other than what I'm asking for there is a very good chance I will not reply.   The XD-S is on National Back-Order so if you want the smallest, slimmest .45acp on the planet now I have what you're looking for.  Thanks for looking."

As a gun community we need to come together to rid ourselves of one of the deadliest sins - greed. We are all tired of seeing $500 AK-47s listed at $2000, and $800 fully upgraded AR-15s posted for $4500. Guess what? As gun buyers and members on this and other forums, we are just as responsible for the state of our society as the price gougers and hoarders. We need to come together and do two thing: (1) STOP BUYING AT THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES and (2) click on the ad, go to ""Flag"" at the top, and press ""overpriced."" This whole process takes 1.3968 seconds.

I have upset a few of the posters here as being a socialist. I am far from that - I believe as a community we can police our own good and bad behavior. Helping each other and fair profits are a good behavior. I consider gouging a bad behavior. If you consider it an acceptable behavior, buy from them at the inflated prices.

These folks only have a business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement. NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing but we have the Boulder Airlift from Magpul to cover our AR15 needs, and we can also find many of these same things now online. Use a search engine to save yourself big bucks.

I personally believe every time I skip over a $1,500 ad for a $450 purchased AK style rifle, I have just became part of the problem. Send them an email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly flag their ad so we can get prices back to where they all belong.

I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy and paste it to another state's listing in the US or repost later today or tomorrow. The average life span of this post is about 20 minutes.

Add your own two cents in if you'd like or if I got anything wrong. The price regularity will only return if we make it. I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns below:

AR-15: $600-$1300 depending on brand and usage (shots fired, wear, etc..)
AK-47: $400-$900 $400 for WASR, $900 for BNIB Arsenal
SKS:$300-$500
SCAR 16/17: $2000/$2800
AR-10: $1000-1500
Glock: $400-600
10/22: $229
ACR: $2000
1911: $600-1100
9mm ammo: $0.30/round is on the higher end
223/5.56: $0.40/round is on the higher end
.308/7.62 NATO: maybe up to $.70/round (but on high side)
.22: $0.05/round is high

These are all prices that the sellers on here bought for. In most cases, they bought these guns for a lot less. I got most of my AR-15s for $600 and fully upgraded them for a total of $900. Anytime someone posts a Olympic Arms AR-15 on here, they directly insult everyone's intelligence. They think we are not wise enough to know they paid a total of $500 for the thing.

Again, feel free to add your $0.02, make changes, repost, and if you believe they are overpriced flag them."

Rifle also comes with 2 PMags and a Tapco Intrafuse mag, all 30 rounders, a vertical grip, the factory Troy Industries polymer rail guards, the factory trigger guard and charging handle catch, and an Uncle Mikes nylon case w/ 3 mag pouches. There is only 1 other SR 556 on here and it is several hundred $$ more and doesn't have any upgrades. These are SUPER hard to find these days and has been a GREAT rifle, but I'm looking to fund a new build. Asking $1,800 and will include 100 XM193 brass cased rounds on stripper clips. Feel free to email any questions or offers!"

          Davidson's, Inc. warrants to you that if any gun sold by Davidson's ever becomes defective, Davidson's will replace the gun at no charge, subject  to the following conditions. This warranty applies only if Davidson's Supply Company sold the gun to the retailer from which you purchased it and extends  only to the original purchaser from the retailer.

If no replacement is available, we will repair the original or offer you a similar model (to be determined at our discretion) free of charge. This warranty extends to any and all parts of the gun as originally sold by us, but does not extend to guns altered or rebuilt after their original purchase, or guns used other than for their legal intended purposes. DAVIDSON'S LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO REPLACING OR REPAIRING THE NONPERFORMING OR DEFECTIVE GOODS (TO BE DETERMINED AT OUR DISCRETION). WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, EITHER DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL.

Limited Warranty       Terms and Conditions

          Davidson's, Inc. warrants to you that if any gun sold by Davidson's ever becomes defective, Davidson's will replace the gun at no charge, subject  to the following conditions. This warranty applies only if Davidson's Supply Company sold the gun to the retailer from which you purchased it and extends  only to the original purchaser from the retailer. In order to be eligible  for warranty coverage, the original purchaser must complete the warranty registration online or return the  warranty registration card to Davidson's, Inc., at the address shown below, within 30 days from date of purchase. If no replacement is available, we will repair the original or offer you a similar model (to be determined at our discretion) free of charge. This warranty extends to any and all parts of the gun as originally sold by us, but does not extend to guns altered or rebuilt after their original purchase, or guns used other than for their legal intended purposes. DAVIDSON'S LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO REPLACING OR REPAIRING THE NONPERFORMING OR DEFECTIVE GOODS (TO BE DETERMINED AT OUR DISCRETION). WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, EITHER DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. To obtain performance  under this warranty, you must return the product to the retailer from which  you purchased the product and pay the cost of shipping the product to Davidson's.  If the retailer is no longer in business, you may contact another Retailer Near You or us directly at Davidson's, Inc., 6100 Wilkinson Drive, Prescott, Arizona 86301, REDACTED. This warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.

*BRAND NEW GUN:
    Davidson's will ship your replacement firearm the very next business day for all in stock items. You are only responsible for return shipping       costs to us (ie: getting the firearm to Davidson's through your retailer  we do not accept shipments directly from end consumers.) Handguns are   shipped out for next day delivery while long guns are typically received by your dealer within 3-4 days of shipping. If we do not have a       replacement or you elect to get the same repaired firearm back, your firearm will be sent to the factory or an authorized warranty station for repair. If your firearm is repaired, the time frame until we return your firearm will be longer. Your dealer must have a valid FFL with original  signature on file for us to ship and a current account with Davidson's."
