PSA MULTI-CALIBER FORGED LOWER WITH PSA LOWER PARTS KITS EXCEPT FOR THE GEISSELE SSA TRIGGER, MAGPUL TRIGGER GUARD, AND FAB DEFENSE RUBBERIZED PISTOL GRIP WITH HIDDEN STORAGE.

THE GEISSELE SSA SUPER SEMI-AUTOMATIC TRIGGER:
The Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA®) trigger is a semi-automatic-only version of Geissele Automatics’s Super Select-Fire trigger. The SSA is a non-adjustable combat trigger that performs like a match-grade two-stage trigger and allows precise and accurate trigger control. It is recommended for demanding applications such as Squad Designated Marksman (SDM) rifles, Law Enforcement use, and Close Quarters Battle (CQB) and mid-range carbine work. Breaks like a carrot, lighter pull, more accurate rapid fire.

The AGR-43 is the latest addition to our line of Pistol Grips featuring State-of-the Art Multi-Textured Rubber, enhancing your grip experience. Incorporated into its design, is the superior contour of its predecessor, adding even more comfort and proper ventilation needed in extreme heat and moist environments, giving you the edge you need in the field or at the range.

Advantages:
MIL-SPEC Reinforced Polymer Composite with Muti-Textured Rubber Overmold Superior Coating
Three Different Rubber Overmolded Style Textures; Rib Studded at Palm, Alligator Pattern for front Fingers and Moon Surface Textured Sides
Multi Rubber Texture Provides Superior Comfort; Adds Appropriate Ventilation, Prevents Slip and Reduces Sweaty Palms
Finger Swelts and a Backstrap Shape Design Provides Enhanced Grip, Even when Wet
Extended Beavertail for Better Control, Allowing a Higher Firmer Hold
Readily Accessible Storage Area with Securely Sealed Hinged Door

MAGPUL TRIGGER GUARD:
The MOE Trigger Guard is an enhanced polymer drop in replacement for the AR15/M16 weapons platform. It features a shallow ""V"" shape for better use of gloves in tactical shooting or cold weather operations. The MOE Trigger Guard is non-folding, has rounded edges, and fills the annoying ""gap"" at the rear of the standard trigger guard. Also works well with most 7.62x51 AR platforms but some custom fitting may be required. All mounting hardware included.

The gas block is the railed type which allows for mounting of flip up sights or going without any for a better view with a scope. The upper is a T marked flat top. The lower comes in ambidextrous form. Meaning the safety is on both sides of the firearm, as well is the bolt release, and magazine release. That makes this firearm left or right hand compatible. It includes a 6 position buttstock. This rifle uses Magpul mags which are some of the best in the business and are not only easier to find but are cheaper also.

The gas block is the railed type which allows for mounting of flip up sights or going without any for a better view with a scope. The upper is a T marked flat top. The lower comes in ambidextrous form. Meaning the safety is on both sides of the firearm, as well is the bolt release, and magazine release. That makes this firearm left or right hand compatible. It includes a 6 position buttstock. This rifle uses Magpul mags which are some of the best in the business and are not only easier to find but are cheaper also. This a super nice firearm from one of the top tier gun manufacturers in the country. Also included is a gun case to protect the rifle, manual, warranty, and 1 20rd magpul magazine.

A single instrument combines the capability of razor-sharp, top-quality optics with precise measuring.

A steady hand is required for measuring distant targets. The legendary EL wrap-around grip, the low, perfectly balanced weight, and the unique shape ensure the EL Range's good handling characteristics and the display of the exact distance to the desired target.

Many hunting challenges are caused by geographic circumstances. Firing an accurate shot uphill or downhill requires precise timing and ballistic experience. Or a precise measuring instrument. The EL Range with SWARO-AIM is equipped with a completely new angled-shot program developed by SWAROVSKI OPTIK, which determines the precise, correct distance and an exact aim - even in the most demanding terrain.

I have several Kahr pistols and, in today's economic times, I can use the same one in my nightstand as in my car. This pistol actually isn't officially broken in yet. Kahr says it takes 200 rounds to break on in. I've fired 100 rounds through this pistol. Just look down the barrel with the borescope pic. There is zero wear or deposits in the rifling.

Face to face locally. I'd prefer you have a LTCH, but insist you have proper ID. This is a CHEAP price for a high end Kahr. Again, it's not a economy ""W"" series Kahr.

The thumb rests on the underside and the depressions on the top side of the easy to handle rubber armoring ensure secure and comfortable handling. The diversity of models among the SLC binoculars offers the right solution for every purpose.

In the SLC series, Swarovski Optik uses high-quality technologies such as the SWAROBRIGHT coating for maximum color fidelity across the whole light spectrum or the SWAROTOP and SWARODUR coatings for bright, high-contrast images.

The non-stick effect of the SWAROCLEAN coating on the outer surface of the lens makes cleaning objective and eyepiece lenses considerably easier, above all when removing dried-on mineral residues (e.g. water marks due to condensation), insect repellents and tree resin.  The lenses require less intensive cleaning which significantly increases the longevity of optical products.

The large 56 models show off their strengths particularly when used in adverse light conditions and are thus excellent for observation in the transition period between dusk and night.

As with all SLC models, they are characterized by their high-quality optical system with optimized coatings and their sturdy design. The sturdy metal housing and non-slip rubber armoring ensure outstanding functionality.

If you must rapidly evacuate or infiltrate an area and don't wan to be point-targeted, this grenade will hide you. This is also not a weapon. Neither NJ nor the federal government defines a smoke grenade as a weapon. HOWEVER, yes you can hurt yourself with this. This is also NOT a firework.

MADE IN AMERICA!!! There is no other way to ensure such a high level of quality. Kimber is the most popular 1911 pistol in the world, a family with twenty one models in four calibers, whose quality is unequaled with accuracy and dependability right out of the box. The STANDARD is now the Custom II. It incorporates the Kimber Firing Pin Safety that makes each pistol more secure without impeding performance or altering trigger pull. As with all Kimber pistols, standard features set Customs apart from other brands: Match grade dimensions for barrels, bushings, chambers and triggers, ejection ports that are lowered and flared, dovetails mounted sights, extended thumb safeties, and the list goes on. The LAPD SWAT Team carries the KIMBER 1911, as do United States Marines, thousands of law enforcement officers, and hundreds of thousands of American shooters who refuse to compromise on quality.

I have a very fast go kart for sale. Its built on an old school frame, and has a big snow mobile engine on it with large pipes off the back. Looks badass flying down the street... Its been clocked right at 60, and we ran out of road.

The motor alone is worth more than im asking. So please keep that in mind, before you lowball me hahah

The battery is dead and the frame is a little short for me. Im 6'5 and 220 lbs... and the shifter knob broke end of last october. Not the linkage, just the bar/knob. You can see in the last pic. If you weld or know someone, its very simple fix. I just have zero ability to fix it. Once fixed, its easily a $700+ go kart, and you wont find ANY go kart under $1000 that can out run it

Im open to trades and/or cash offers....

trades might include: nice laptops, TV's, high end paintball markers and gear, other off road toys, kayaks, bang bangs, ect ect... Anything of value might spark my interest...

Cash is King, as always

The Rossi revolution started with the founding of the company in 1889 by Amadeo Rossi and over the last 115 years that tradition has grown. The Rossi name represents a piece of firearm history and a tradition of excellence. Over the years Rossi has led the way in design and engineering, while at the same time, stressing the importance of producing an affordable product without sacrificing quality or accuracy. In December of 1997 BrazTech International was created as the exclusive importer of Rossi firearms in North America. Rossi manufactures its classic rifles in a plant in Sa Leopoldo, Brazil selling many firearms outside the United States and North America. Rossi manufactures three models of Taurus handguns including the .38 Special as well as four models of .357 Magnum revolvers under contract. Today's Rossi is still family run and they put the same dedication and innovation into every firearm. At Rossi, it is more than just building guns...it is a family's history and tradition. As a perfect example, this 45 Long Colt R92 Carbine is the ideal rifle for hunting in heavy bush and is a tried and true “Piece of the Old West” with all the beauty and functionality of the original at a fraction of the cost.

W.A.S.P. Treated Barrel
(Weapon Armament Surface Protection) is a salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing surface conversion process or more commonly referred to as nitriding. The nitriding conversion is applied to the barrel inside and out, along with the front sight base on our LE rifles and uppers. Nitriding offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance when compared to hard chrome lining or phosphating. 

Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without the risk of dimensional build up. CMMG Pioneered the use of this nitriding process on AR barrels and has been using it for many years.

Many young men and women, on the occasion of becoming an adult, receive a .22 rifle, as a symbol of trust, maturity and their American heritage – and many other shooters, young or old, buy a Ruger 10/22 as their first rifle. Many elect to enhance the utility of this lightweight 22 rifle by adding a quality scope. 

Compact and mini-scopes being manufactured today rival the performance of full size scopes while offering lighter weight and smaller profiles. These features make them ideal for rim fire and other small caliber sporting rifles. The eye relief on these mini-scopes equals that of many full size scopes, but because of their short length they have to be mounted further back on the receiver to maintain proper eye relief. 

We have a Picatinny rail top mount for the Ruger 10/22 rifle that mounts further back on the receiver to accommodate mini-scopes in obtaining a full field of view. This four power scope, with it’s Range Finder reticle, can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your Ruger 10/22 in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

This mini-scope kit is an economical and functional accessory for Ruger 10/22 rifles and especially for the Ruger Take-Apart rifle as the scope does not need to be removed when the rifle is disassembled and stored.

This pistol started out as a standard ITM MK99 Krink Pistol in 7.62x39. Since new, this was run over to Fred Hastings at CAR Firearms in Tukwila who completely tore it down, modified it to a left hand charge, put on an integrated front sight and gas block, left thumb safety lever to operate the safety and bolt hold back, polished the bolt, worked the insides, coated the gun in Gray/Black Moly Resin... did an awesome job. Plans were to make it an SBR when and if they become legal here or if I moved to Oregon..... I will throw in a 30rd steel mag (not shown) full of ammo and the single point sling (shown) with purchase. I have some other ammo available to purchase with gun if buyer would like.

This scope kit is specifically designed to fit the following Henry rimfire lever and pump action rifles models:  H001, H001L, H001Y, H001M, H001V, H001T, H001TM, H001TV, H003T and H003TM. 

This scope kit DOES NOT FIT the Henry Golden Boy series which require a special barrel mount available from Henry Repeating Arms Company.

The RANGE FINDER reticle can be used to estimate the range to your target and the smaller scope profile makes it easier to carry your rifle in the field or fit it into a scabbard or gun case.

We test a variety of scope and mount combinations on RIFLES until we find a scope package that works best for a particular rifle and application - and this is an excellent mini-scope and mounting system for your Henry rimfire rifle.

Comes with 100rds of .22LR  This rifle retails for $349 plus the ammo. This is a fantastic deal and is pried to move quickly


The Model 597 is easily the most technologically advanced autoloading rimfire rifle on the market today. The difference starts with our proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-grade steel guide rails for silky-smooth functioning, fast feeding reliability, and perfect bolt alignment on lock-up for excellent out-of-the-box accuracy.

To assure reliable, long-life accuracy, we’ve also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597 all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon® plating for a smooth, dependable operation and ultra-crisp trigger pull (that stays that way). Completing the breakthrough design is an innovative last-shot bolt “hold open” feature and our patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack detachable 10-round box magazine.

The Model 597 OD Green Synthetic Scope Combo has a 20"" carbon-steel barrel furnished clean with no sights set in a rugged olive drab green synthetic stock with a beaver tail fore-end. The matching alloy receiver is grooved for standard rimfire mounts and drilled and tapped for the Model 597 Weaver-style one-piece base. A 3-9x32mm scope with rings is included."

From AWC:
The T.H.O.R. Raider represents a state-of-the-art design in a durable, compact, ultra quiet silencer for 5.56mm caliber series. The AWC T.H.O.R. Raider is so effective that it can be used safely and comfortably without hearing protection in confined areas such as underground structures, aircraft hangers and small seagoing vessels.

The T.H.O.R. Raider is designed to be utilized on bolt rifles and semi auto AR platforms. The T.H.O.R. Raider should not be used for full auto fire or on barrels shorter than 14.5 inches. The T.H.O.R. Raider is an extremely strong and lightweight unit, constructed of 100% titanium with each component solidly 360 degree welded.

The Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 tactical scope gives the shooter a broad magnification range, four inches of eye relief and 100 MOA of elevation travel. This NXS retains a slim profile and is easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems.

Nightforce uses outstanding glass and coatings in all their scopes, and the 5.5-22x50 tactical gives you superb resolution at high magnifications. It is the ultimate long range scope. The 50mm objective lens gives you maximum clarity and resolution across the entire magnification range. This Nightforce scope gives the shooter precision accuracy at the longest ranges, yet at 5.5 power remains highly effective for shots at close ranges.

The MOAR reticle is an improved, more versatile version of the NP-R1 reticle. The MOAR has subtensions that are thicker than those of NF’s traditional reticles, which makes the reticle easier to see against dark backgrounds. The MOAR has 1 MOA spacing on the horizontal and vertical axis’, and this is a great tool for precise range-finding and hold offs. The first hash marks on the reticle are 2 MOA from center, and the crosshair is 1 MOA in length."

Mossberg 715T A3 Style Mossberg International brings an AR-style platform to you for under $300. Shooting has never been more fun and affordable. Mossberg International’s new lightweight Tactical .22 combines the look and feel of today’s AR-style platforms with Mossberg International’s reliable and affordable .22 autoloader. Taking cues from the proven 702 autoloader, the Tactical .22 matches an 16.25” barrel to a quad-rail forend, giving any shooter the opportunity to easily customize the Tactical .22 with lights, lasers or any number of AR accessories currently in the marketplace. The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13” length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4” – 14.5” LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights. Other features included with the Tactical .22 are sling mounts and a ten round magazine.
