Don't be fooled about this being a polymer receiver. They have done ""torture tests"" and verified in some instances this lower receiver will OUTPERFORM aluminum receivers.

One of the most sought after lever action rifles on the planet! This .22 magnum rifle entered life in 1973. Just the second year of production. It has bee very well taken care of, and only has very minor handling marks and scratches on the stocks. The blue is in very good condition with no rust or pitting. An excellent example of American craftsmanship!

These, when you can find one, are the most rare, being a pre-XTR, with smooth stocks. The low serial number confirms that this is the one you have been looking for!

Typically selling for hundreds more, you can own this one for just $850.00 O.B.O. Cash, Trade or Both!

Looking for multiple handgun trades, or a pistol and cash, at the moment. Sub-compacts in big calibers, are a plus, but I like some of the smaller rounds as well.

I've had this canoe for a little over a year, and don't use it anymore. I got into kayaking instead and don't use the canoe anymore.

Specs for this canoe are as follows:
Length = 15'8""
Width = 35.5"" or 2' 11.5""
Weight = 80lbs
Max Load = 1,150lbs

Typical wear and tear for any canoe that's ever been used.
Washed with fresh water after every outing.
Very stable in the water (you'll never flip this, even if you try your hardest), and also fairly quick for being a flat bottom fairly wide canoe.

It's pretty big, so I may be willing to deliver after you buy depending on where you live. I might charge a little extra for gas if you need me to do this.
Cash in my hand before I take it anywhere.
If you plan to take it with you, bring your own straps because you're not getting mine!

Comes with 2 life jackets and 3 paddles

The canoe isn't dirty as it appears to be in the pictures.
The filter I used on Instagram when taking these pictures made it appear that way.

LE6920 M4 AR15 Carbine 5.56/223. The Gold Standard of AR15's
This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in (76.2 cm) in length and weighs only 5.65 lb (2.56 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol.

Colt's M4 Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual insulated aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. 
- Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components 
- Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"" (178mm) 
- Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire 
- 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations 
- Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications 
- Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures 
- Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud 
- Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance 
- Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories 
- M203 40mm Grenade Launcher (optional, subject to NFA restrictions) mounts directly to the Carbine without modification 
- Cleaning kit, sling, and 1 magazine are standard.
- Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation 
- High strength materials add durability to the forearm, buttstock and pistol grip for greater comfort and effectiveness.

With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30 in in length and weighs only 6.95 lb - ideal for tactical use.

This is an almost new Ruger 582-series Mini 14 Ranch model chambered in 5.56/.223. Only 18 rounds down the tube. 

Rifle is in a Troy MCS chassis with Magpul STR stock, MOE-K grip, MBUS sights, and MS3 sling. All parts are authentic and none of that PTS air soft garbage. All are flat dark earth color. I do not have the factory stock any longer but I do still the factory rear sight. 

Other additions are new Accuracy Systems Inc (ASI) gas port bushings which keep it from slinging brass a 1/4 mile. I have two other bushings also so you try different ones and get it just right. 

Also has ASI recoil buffers and Wolff increased power recoil spring. These two items will help prevent damage to optics from the hard cycling of the action. 

Comes with 2 factory 10 round mags, 1 factory 5 round, 2 Promag 20 rounders, and 4 Promag 30 rounders. All are new with zero use except the 5 round mag which has 18 rounds through it. 

Lots of money invested and this is a great rifle.  It was between getting rid of this or my AR, and I have way more invested in my AR. 

Asking $1600 firm. Do the math and you will see that i am not gouging like most are now in our current state of economics/fear/panic. This is a fair price and less than I have invested in its all. 

Will consider a partial trade for a XDm in 9mm or .40, must be in good condition and come with all the stock parts. Will also consider some other for partial trade like molle gear in good condition. Just let me know what you have.

All laws apply. F2F local near Raleigh/Knightdale/Wendell/Zebulon. CCW or valid pistol permit must be shown in addition to valid NC ID so I know you're not a criminal. If you can't provide this, we can go through a local FFL and we will split the cost of transfer. 

Text or email through armslist is better during the day. Cell is 9one9 32seven 00eight3.

I also have a new Burris Fastfire 3 that I will sell with the rifle for $200, or $220 by itself. It is a micro red dot sight. Very small. Very cool."

It's one of the few that can be switched between semi automatic and pump action. I may be interested in a trade let me know what you have. Mostly interested in remington 700's.

The Franchi SPAS-12 was a semi-automatic, 12-gauge shotgun noted for its variable-mode firing method in which the weapon could be fired via a gas-operated, semi-automatic mode (featuring self-loading) or a manually-actuated, pump-action / slide-action system. The SPAS-12 could, therefore, fire up to four rounds per second in the former mode, its dual-mode system managed by way of a two-position selector switch near the foregrip. The SPAS-12 was specifically designed as a combat shotgun and anti-riot measure but eventually marketed as a sporting system to civilians. Production of the series - handled by Luigi Franchi Development of Brescia, Italy (Franchi S.p.A), known for good quality shotguns - ran from 1979 to 2000 to which global operators became Austria, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Malaysia and the United States. The Franchi firm was eventually sold to SOCIMI of Milan, which filed for bankruptcy in 1993, leaving Franchi to come under the experienced leadership of the famed Beretta concern. its imposing external characteristics made it a popular featured firearm in Hollywood films such as ""Terminator"", ""3,000 Miles to Graceland"", ""Underworld"" and ""Jurassic Park""."

For trade is a Romanian AK.  I bought this gun about a year ago at Fleet Farm.  I’ve put about 300-500 rounds thru it.  It has been cleaned after every range trip.  The gun has been trouble free to operate.  I haven’t had a failure to feed or fire with any type of ammo (I’ve used Tula, Wolf, and Herters in hollow point, FMJ, and soft point.  It eats them all). This WASR does not appear to have the canted sight issue that some are notorious for having.  The following are included with this rifle:

•	Tapco folding stock
•	LULA Mag Loader
•	Cleaning Kit
•	Tapco standard handguard (rail on top has been removed to see sights better).  Bottom rail is still intact under the protective cover.  
•	Original furniture
•	Tapco RAZR muzzle device
•	Cleaning rod
•	Sight adjustment tool
•	Krebs Peep type rear sight
•	Original rear sight
•	5- 30 round steel magazines
•	Quick release scope mount
•	1200 rounds of ammo (a mix of Wolf, Herters, and Tula) (not pictured)

•	The case shown in the pictures is not included, so you would have to bring your own case when making a trade.  

It’s been a really fun gun to shoot.  I don’t have any trouble hitting a paper plate at 100 yards, but it’s definitely not a sniper rifle.  It’s possible that the gun is more accurate, but my problem is that my eyes aren’t very good; I have problems with viewing the sights; and I’m not all that interested in putting a scope on it because it seems too bulky for me.  That’s my main reason for wanting to trade this for something else.  

I’d like to trade this for a large bore AR upper and hopefully some ammo to get me started.  I’m looking for an upper in either 450 bushmaster or 300 blackout.  I’d also consider a 1911 pistol.  A straight up trade would be preferred, but if you have a really good upper, I may consider adding cash.  I will want to see a valid permit to purchase or permit to carry as a precaution to myself.  I will not ask to make a copy of anything though unless it’s something you want to do.  

I live in Clear Lake, MN.  I’m willing to meet someone as long as the distance is within reason.
