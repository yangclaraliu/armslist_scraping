I am selling a lightly used Smith and Wesson M&P 5.56 Rifle.  I picked this up a while ago, and ran a few rounds through it to confirm function.  The previous owner stated it had a  very low round count but was unsure of the total.  He had put a number of upgrades on it as well.  I am thinning out the safe, and have been focusing on perfecting my 300 BLK and this one needs to go.  I am not interested in parting this out.  A list of extras can be found below.

$10 for all four things. Must pay through one of the following: PayPal, personal check, money order, or $10 cash.

Free Shipping. I'll use USPS. No face-to-face.

Note 1: This information regarding the spring is from the Glockmeister web page: GLOCK 10 Coil Magazine Spring. This is the standard spring for all 17 rd, 9mm magazines and all 15 round, 10mm mags. This includes pre-ban, LE marked, and unmarked mags. It is also the standard spring for pre-ban and older LE magazines with a 3955 marked follower. G22 and G35 pre-ban and older LE marked mags use this spring but not if the gun has a tac-light on it. We recommend this spring as an extra power mag spring for 15 round, 9mm mags and 13 round .40 and .357 magazines that are using the GLOCK +2.

Note 2: Although #9 followers are the latest followers for 40 magazines, #5 are the only followers that should be used for magazines that originally had a #1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 follower. So if your magazine originally had a #5 follower or earlier, then #5 is the latest version for your magazine.

Pistol has maybe 150 rounds through it, is in excellant condition and shoots like a dream.  You know what this pistol is or you don't. This is the very hard to get Springfield Armory Professional model 1911 pistol. Caliber is .45 Auto. This is the same pistol used by the FBI. WHen these are built, the gunsmiths at Springfield do not know which guns are going to the FBI or for commercial sale - therefore this pistol you get is truly built for the FBI, there is no part or quality skimping. While some would argue the point, I believe this to be the finest custom 1911 available, especially with the Nowlin barrel. Current wait time for a new pistol is 2+ years.

It is basically an upgrade from a Glock. The Steyr M is a series of semi-automatic pistols developed by Steyr Mannlicher GmbH & Co KG of Austria for police services. The pistol has a multi-stage safety system consisting of two automatic internal safeties, two external trigger safeties and a manual lock safety. The pistol’s design takes advantage of modern manufacturing techniques: the slide is precision-milled from steel;[2] the frame is an injection-molded synthetic polymer[2] and parts of the trigger and striker mechanisms are pressed from sheet metal.[4] For the purpose of regular maintenance, the pistol is stripped down into the following components: the barrel, slide, recoil spring, frame and magazine.

While the Steyr M is frequently compared to Glock-series pistols (both are polymer-framed striker-fired pistols, with Tenifer finishes), there are several differences in the details of the design. For example, the M-series had a fully supported chamber in all chamberings from the start (Some Glock models also had this feature from the start, other Glock models evolved to having more supported chambers when compared to their original internal layout), unique triangular/trapezoid sights, a loaded chamber indicator below the rear sights (on third and later generation Glock pistols this feature is present on the extractor on the right slide side) and a different grip angle (111°).

The story I got was that he won a match and was given to him by DPMS but since he already had his LR-308 that he uses in competition he didn't need/want this one. I would say it's most similar to the 3G1. It has a 20"" barrel with muzzle brake and includes two 20 round PMags. It has a front flip up sight gas block and a JP Enterprises VTAC modular free float handguard. The handguard has a sling stud near the front for sling attachment. It has a Magpul ACS stock which can be locked down to prevent any stock wobble while shooting. The trigger was done right by DPMS and is phenomenal. I would have no reservations comparing to my GA Precision bolt action rifle trigger. Recoil is very light and is a blast to shoot. There have been 95 documented rounds through the barrel. No stoppages or failures of any kind."

I purchased this rifle 3 months ago for $375(including tax) and now need to sell as I've starded a business and am still lacking a few key tools.  As most the Chinese sks in the stores, this rifle had obviously been in service and had dings and pits in the stock and was in need of refinishing.  I stripped old finish off stock and used a mahogany stain and coated with sealer and 2 coats of true oil.  Looks much nicer now.   If you're a collector, this may be a problem otherwise was necessary in my opinion. Bluing is approximately 70%. Will take a hit and am asking $350 and will show receipt.  Buyer will need to fill out my bill of sale sheet so I have documentation that this rifle is now transferred to a new owner and that you're not a felon.  I live in Lakeville and can meet within a reasonable distance.  Will considder cash off or trade for a set a ladders 20ft extension, 10ft, 6ft for example.  Also considder cash off or trade for something along the lines of used makita or dewalt hammer drill/impact driver combo in decent shape for another example.  Hit me up with any offers! -Erik"

Vepr 12 is produced by ""Molot"" factory, which also makes RPK-74 machine guns and Vepr brand semi-automatic hunting rifles. All ""Vepr"" brand rifles and shotguns are broadly based on the RPK-74 light machinegun designs, adapted for civilian purpose and appropriate ammunition.

TheVepr 12 shotgun is gas-operated, semi-automatic shotgun which uses long-stroke gas piston located above the barrel, and a rotary locking bolt. Gas system is self-regulating and does not need manual adjustments. Gun is fitted with modified AK-style safety that has additional lever that permits faster ""safety on"" operation (mostly useful for IPSC shooters). Safety lever is also duplicated on the left side of the receiver. Other useful addition that is not found in AKor Saiga 12 is bolt hold-open devicewhich holds the bolt open when magazine is exhausted. Magazine housing is provided with extended magazine tunnel, which permits for faster magazine insertion (without typical AK-style rocking movement,necessary to lock the standard AK-type magazine). Furniture includes a detachable or fixed flash hider on the barrel, a side-folding skeletonized butt  with polymer coating, and plastic pistol grip and forend.

It came out of Colt's Custom Shop in 1978 and was in JPL's glass case marked ""Personally Owned Firearm - Not For Sale."" That sticker is still affixed to the well-worn original Colt Box. Of course, since it was marked not for sale I had to try to buy it. It took the trade of two other fine handguns and a cash hand of poker to walk out the door with it. I will be glad to provide a sworn letter to the buyer with the complete story if desired. It has sat in my safe now for 28 years. In that span of time I've owned a total of four different Pythons, a couple of Trooper Mk IIIs and a couple of Detective Specials, and as fine a revolvers as they all are, none come close to the action on this one. And no matter what angle or lighting is used, the camera simply cannot capture the incredible deep beauty that was Colt's Royal Blue at that time. There are many more pictures available; just email for them.

I'm old now, and I am simply not ever going to take this gun out and shoot it. I suppose there are still some fine unfired Pythons out there, but probably few like this one. How to say this in the most polite possible way: I'll be using the funds to enhance my granddaughter's college account, so please don't waste my time and yours with low ball offers or trades, I am not interested and they will be ignored. I figure I will probably need to list this revolver on Gunbroker to get its value but I decided to try Armslist locally first. If you're looking at Armslist from outside Colorado, yes, I will ship this gun from my dealer to yours at extra cost. Thanks for taking the time to read this listing."

It is in excellent condition, with no visible wear other than what is typical on top of the barrel hood.  This particular pistol has the difficult to find Hard Chrome finish, which is the most durable and expensive finish that KelTec offers. It is very resistent to rust, damage, and wear, compared to blueing or parkerizing.  I'm also including the following items:

ArmaLaser Instant-On Tactical laser, which senses when your trigger finger is placed inside the trigger guard and switches itself on automatically.  ArmaLaser offers a unique trade-in option, allowing owners to trade in their current ArmaLaser for credit towards their other models.  Box & papers included.

Three factory magazines: one standard flush-fit seven rd. capacity, a second seven rd. magazine with metal factory optional +1 rd. extension to fit 8 rds. (allows a two finger hold on grip), with original spring & floor plate included to convert back to original 7 rd. capacity, and one ten rd. capacity (three finger grip) for when maximum fire-power is more important than concealability.

Factory belt clip which allows for a very unobtrusive carry without using a holster.

Original box, papers, and new spare recoil spring & guide rod.  Some loose ammunition is included to get you started, and more ammo may be available at extra cost.

My price is $425, face to face in N. Austin. Trades for one or more firearms, +/- cash  may be possible, but I'm not very interested in hunting rifles or hunting shotguns, antiques, etc.  No archery equipment, computers, jet skis, car parts, etc.  Serious buyers will provide me with a (local) phone number if they want to talk in person.  I won't give out my number or e-mail address unless I can contact you at yours (too many spammers & scammers).

Why consider a P-32 .32 Auto, instead of a .380?  The P-32 is smaller, lighter, thinner, and therefore more concealable and comfortable to carry.  It has more ammunition capacity, and is easier to control when firing, due to less recoil, muzzle blast & flip, and noise.  The P-32 is a mature and tested design, and has a reputation for being very reliable, unlike the .380 P3AT.

Thank you."

This machined aluminum trigger is a direct replacement for the factory M&P centerfire pistol trigger. It can be used in conjunction with any combination of M&P internals presently available from Apex Tactical* as well as any configuration from the S&W factory.Reduces Trigger Pre-Travel and Over Travel by approximately 20%. The Center Mounted Pivoting Safety bar prevents unintended operation by creating a trigger block that will not disengage unless the shooter places their finger directly on the trigger face. The flat target style trigger causes the shooter to place their finger on the center line of the trigger and encourages trigger manipulation directly to the rear (in line with the bore axis).
The Apex Fully Machined Sear (Hard Sear)* was designed to enhance the performance of what we consider an outstanding pistol. Our modified geometry will not only improve the over-travel and sear reset characteristics, but dramatically reduce the trigger pull weight in most pistols. This sear is made from heat treated A-2 tool steel for durability and long service life."

Noreen has created the ONLY SEMI-AUTOMATIC .300 WIN MAG and .338 Lapua on the market. The BAD NEWS is a custom-made AR-style rifle that is chambered in the increasingly popular 338 Lapua as well as the powerful 300 WIN MAG. These cartridges give you much greater velocity and power than the typical .308, and as far as ballistics are concerned, the BAD NEWS rifle is going to be the flatter shooting gun for long range shots.

The BAD NEWS rifle is a piston-driven semi-auto; this means you can expect greater range and a higher level of reliability by running a cleaner and cooler rifle. The muzzle break on these Noreen’s significantly suppresses recoil. Additionally, the semi-auto nature of the rifle will naturally recoil less than a bolt action because part of the felt recoil is going to chamber the next round. Lighter recoil is a huge advantage when you’re looking for a rifle with a faster and more accurate follow-up shot.

This piston-driven system is unlike any other AR-10 on the market. The piston movement is strictly in the action, after the bullet has already left the barrel. This is a huge advantage on a precision rifle compared to conventional piston driven setups found in standard AR's. In those rifles, an LWRC REPR, POF P308, etc. the piston runs parallel to the barrel and moves while the bullet is still in the barrel creating unwanted barrel harmonics which adversely affect accuracy. This rifle's piston is located in the receiver and not along the barrel so the bullet is out of the barrel by the time the piston is working to chamber another round and keep your action cool and clean with no gas ever entering the action.

The semi-automatic will not only give you a much faster follow-up shot, it also allows you to stay focused on your target, optic and the trigger, instead of having to manually operate a bolt-action rifle; all subsequent rounds are chambered by the rifle itself during the gas or blowback operation of the action.

The weapon easily disassembles like the standard AR for quick and easy cleaning and reassembly. The piston system drastically reduces fouling, and no venting means no holes for dirt and other contaminants to enter the system.

The full-length Picatinny rail on the receiver will allow you to mount scopes, lights, lasers, bipods, bayonets, etc. The adjustable cheek rest stock option is an added upgrade free bonus.

The innovative Noreen Bad News .338 Lapua provides tactical marksmen with the performance of a powerful and proven long range cartridge with the numerous advantages of the venerable AR platform. The Noreen 338 Lapua weighs only 13 pounds, and it vastly outperforms comparable bolt-action sniper rifles. This rifle comes with a custom muzzle-break and semi-auto action that significantly suppresses recoil. In the AR tradition, the Bad News 338 Lapua disassembles quickly for easy cleaning, then reasembles with no loss of zero. The familiar fit and feel of a conventional AR rifle makes the transition to the more powerful sniper rifle seamless. This Noreen includes an ultra-heavy duty Plano case, which is far superior to a pelican style case. 100% Made in the USA.

You guys paying ridiculous prices for ammo are just making it possible for these guys to go to Wal-Mart everyday and buy ammo just to resale at triple prices so that the average guy that just wants to shoot guns can’t get any.

It was manufactured in October, 1877 and according to the Colt Factory Letter, it was shipped to Schuyler, Hartley, and Graham - New York City, NY, on October 18, 1877, in a shipment of 50 guns.

Undoubtedly a private purchase, this revolver served in the Indian Wars likely protecting the owner and his family as they traveled West in the 1880'.  It served this purpose well for over 75 years, but daily use left it showing much wear and tear until in April of 1954, it was sent back to the Colt Factory for reconditioning.  Now over 130 years later, it remains in 99% condition as received back from Colt in July of 1954.

The ""RARE"" Original Colt Work Order (below) tells the complete history of the Revolver's reconditioning.  Received at the Colt factory on April, 19, 1954, the revolver was inspected and found to have many worn parts.  Although the original barrel length was 7-1/2"", during the time from 1940 through 1956, Colt was no longer manufacturing the Colt Single Action Army model, and the only replacement barrel they offered was the 5-1/2"" length.  The work order shows all the parts that were replaced, as well as the inspection, labor, and dual-tone refinishing costs.  You will note that the original walnut grips were not replaced in 1954, and these original one-piece ""numbered"" stocks remain in place today.  

Interesting, this revolver with its original work order, provides many details about the mystery of the 16 years of Colt's suspended production of the Single Action Army model.  For example, in the late 1940's, the company changed its name to Colt's Manufacturing Company.  The unique barrel address of this revolver shows this change, as well as its placement on the right side instead of the usual top of barrel location.  In 1955, the name was changed back to Colt's Patented Firearms Manufacturing Co.  Barrel address markings after 1955 were again located on top of the barrel.  The newly installed replacement cylinder, displays a ""Colt Pony"" stamp between the chambers, a feature which was to be adopted on future second generation Colts when production continued in 1956.  You will note that the replaced hammer has the high-nose, fixed concave firing pin, features only found of the very first 2nd generation Single Action Revolvers.

All serial numbers of this revolver are matching. The Frame, Trigger Guard, Grip Strap, Loading Gate, etc. are all correct as they were in 1877.  Also, the ""174"" bin number (drawer number shown on the work order) is also stamped on all the original parts.

Finally, the case colors of those revolvers that were sent back to Colt's for refinishing during the ""between production"" years, is the most vivid and colorful of any of the Colt Single Action Revolvers."
