The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. And, it's water resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.

It is an early ArmaLite made during the 1994/2004 AWB. I believe the ""C"" in the M4C model designation stands for compliant. As you can see there is no bayonet lug, an A2 full length stock and a compensator instead of a flash suppressor at the muzzle. The barrel is a medium weight 16"" with I believe a 1 in 9 twist so it will accomodate 55 to 63 grn ammunition. The carbine has a really nice feel to it, swings easily and mounts to your shoulder very comfortably due to the A2 buttstock. The carbine is lightly used and in truly great condition even though it is probably at least 10 years old. I've shot approx 100 rounds through it and it is very accurate. The carbine will be shipped in a hard case with one 30 round magazine."

SureFire FM63 Infrared Filter for flashlights with 1.47"" diameter bezel cancels out the non-infrared portion of the light spectrum to produce a smooth beam of infrared light for use with night vision devices and infrared-capable video cameras. Applying thumb pressure to the locking tab releases the cover; a spring mechanism keeps the open cover out of the way by holding it flat against the flashlight. A cam-locking lever of Sure Fire IR Filter FM-63 for M2, 8AX, 8NX Flashlights keeps the entire unit securely attached to the Sure-Fire flashlight.

Turnaround time is typically as follows:

Service 1: When the frame arrives, I will have it done that day, and shipped the following day back to you.

If you haven't noticed I'll let you in on a little secret. Women are shaped differently than men. Men have wide shoulders and narrow hips. Women are the exact opposite which makes anything strapped to their waistline very obvious. Our ""Lucky Gun"" bra holster gives women who carry an ultra compact like this Ruger LCP another option. The strap is snapped around the center clasp of the bra which leaves the handgun tucked up to the bottom side of the breast. To draw you simply grab the grip and pull it down and to the side at a 45 degree angle. Concealing your handgun here also allows women to wear more of their normal fitting clothing instead of over shirts or baggy loose fitting shirts.

Please dont waste my time complaining about prices. Price is per box, NOT NEGOTIABLE 22 ammo is the hardest ammo to find and this price is not bad when you figure in the gas to run around and find the shelve bare. You could spend 50 dollars in gas driving all over looking for it and going home empty handed. Spring is around the corner and ammo is back ordered till september.

Will only meet FTF (face to face) in two locations only. Sandy Creek boat launch in Hamlin NY, or Greece ridge mall. (this means I won't ship Please don't ask)

I would like to sell 12 pcs. of one ounce American .999 pure Silver Eagle Coins and 2 boxes of 9mm ammunition (100 rounds), for one short pistol grip 12 gauge shotgun, such as a Mossberg 500 JIC (just in case), Mariner, or ?. these coins are not valued at the spot unrefined silver prices you hear quoted on the news, but for a determination of their true value you can look on www.ebay.com to see what they're actually valued at and selling for. keep in mind that when the crap hits the fan or the US dollar is dropped as the worlds reserve currency, and that's in the works, the dollar will be like toilet paper but gold and silver will go through the roof in value. The value of these coins and this scarce ammo right now is about $460 + but I've no doubt it will be jumping up soon.

NOTE: If the jump comes upon us suddenly, I will amend this offer accordingly, so don't put off this trade if you're thinking of adding silver to your stockpiles or shoring up your economic security."

The Firefield Riflescope with Red Laser is equipped with a Green/Red Illuminated Mil Dot reticle that is used for range estimation to help find the distance between the shooter and the target. Precision multi-coated optics are the distinguishing feature of the Firefield Tactical Riflescope line and offers the clearest view in both bright and low light situations. Featuring a built in 5mW red laser, the Firefield Riflescope, is used for quick target acquisition in rapid changing environments, so it hits the target every time with precision accuracy. The lowest magnification setting at 2.5x can be used for scanning, while offering a much broader field of view, while the highest settings in the magnification range are more than adequate for mid to long-range shots.

If you’re “Praying & Spraying” with a TEC-9, you should probably own one of these.

Absolutely a BLAST to shoot!  Shoots very straight with small groupings.  Essentially stock with the exception of a scout scope and a rubber shock absorber.  No machining done, so with a screw driver and an allen wrench you can convert it back to stock.  I couldn't get a good picture of the serial numbers (because of the scope), but all serial numbers match.

Rifle is in good shape with no rust.  For sale is the rifle, scope, shock absorber, and all the original parts including two ammo pouches, oil can, bayonete, original sights, original butt plate.  Also included are three unopened spam cans of 440 rounds of ammo and one open can.  I haven't counted the packs, but most of the fourth spam can should be there. Oh, and I have a pack of 20 soft points to throw in as well.

I know $470.00 seems high for a Mosin Nagant, but consider that the ammo itself would easily cost you $340.00 + $20.00 (for the soft points) leaving the cost of the gun and scope and accessories at $110.00.  Sounds like a deal to me! 

I love this gun!  The only reason I'm selling it is I have my eye on a 30-06 and I have too many guns to begin with.  I have to sell one to get one at this point.

Please email me, call me, or text REDACTED) me if you are interested.  There is a gun range 5 minutes from my house in Sandy Springs.  If you are willing to pay for range time, I am more than willing to let you shoot it before you buy it.  I am available nights and weekends.

($500) REDACTED



.308 Cetme rifle with 9 soon to be banned 20 round magazines.

This gun is cloned after the old Spanish/German Battle rifle's.

I replaced a couple of worn parts in this gun because it missfired a couple times on me.

The bolt gap appears to be with in spec now after replacing a spring and ejector lever. The gun is put back together. I do not have time to mess with this gun anymore or fire it. The few times I did fire it, it was dead on with just the iron sights at 100 yds. I could hit a golf ball at 100 yds with this thing. The .308 is a bigger and more powerfull round than the standard AR 5.56 or .223 round.

It will be more accurate from further away.

I paid $900 for this gun with the mags. 9 x 20rd mags alone are worth about $130

The gun comes with a red dot that is worth another $100

This gun is used and does not look new and shiney.

The semi auto ban may not be passing but the high cap magazines surley will and very soon. At any given moment Florida could decide to follow NY, Cal, Conn and all the other states and ban any gun they want anyways. Here is the chance to get a very high powered rifle now while you still can for cheap. Only reason I am selling this is due to just being to busy to use it. I was going to dress it up and Duracoat it British Cammo Style. Rails, bipods and stocks are very cheap and easy to find online for these guns and they are bad ass all dressed up.

The first person with $500 cash can have it with all 9 high cap magazines.

Mags and red dot alone are worth $230. Basically your buying a .308 for $270, thats a very good price.  Very easy gun to dis assemble and re assemble. I am open to trades but would rather have the cash. No shipping. Im too busy raising a 2.5 yr old to shoot or mess with guns anymore.
