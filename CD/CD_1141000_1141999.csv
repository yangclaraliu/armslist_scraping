If you are asking $1500+, please dont bother wasting both our time as im not interested. Brand new in box just sold on GB for $1,125. If I wanted to pay that much I would have bid.    If its used, it doesnt make sense to pay $1,200. I think you understand. Realistic price would be appreciated. I did mention cash. Any mini's out there under $1K?

Stevens Browning 620 12 Gauge Pump, I believe it to be from the late 1940's.
It shoots and functions fine. It has a couple of cracks in the stock and the blueing is faded from its age, has nice patina. Stilll a good shooter, I believe it has a full choke. It could easily be converted to a home defense gun. It holds 6 or 7 in the magazine.
Also the 520/620 Models were designed and manufactured without a disconnector, you hold the trigger down and pump it and it will fire nonstop until the gun is empty, just pump and shoot, or you can fire one at a time as normal. This is why the US military used them in world war I and II as trench guns."

Tula SKS in a tactical side folder stock. Blade bayonet. (Gun is stamped 1954R w/ a star and an arrow in the star)
1,480 rounds of ammo. Most are FMJ and steel case, some HP and some is brass case. Most of the ammo is in boxes and is brand new, the rest is on stripper clips. There is also about 80 rounds of steel core. There is prob 1,500 rounds but I stoped counting at 1,480

3 - 30 round mags (one is installed) and the original 10 round mag is included

over 50 strippper clips still in the package

This is a package deal, it all stays together, I will not seperate. NO TRADES! I am firm on my price.

The only trade I will consider is $1,000 cash and a Kel Tec PF9 or another compact 9mm but will still want $1,000 cash if I consider the handgun.

There is well over $500 just in ammo, based on .40 cents per round

I do NOT have to sell this package but I am considering building another project. I can text pics of the SKS if you are interested.

If you haven't heard about this gun, look it up. Originally manufactured by Beretta, then the machinery was transferred to Stoeger. So they sold for a Stoeger price with Beretta quality. This one has the Stoeger markings

This has been my primary defense/carry weapon. I put 100 rounds of various hollowpoint through it to see what it liked and to verify it worked reliably (as a carry weapon it's just stupid not to). No FTFs or FTEs.  

This one is somewhat rare as it is the compact version WITH RAIL. The Cougar has a rotating barrel that cuts down on recoil and increases the reliability of feeding. It is really a sweet piece.

The AR-30A1 is the next generation of ArmaLite's highly acclaimed bolt action rifles - the ULTIMATE long range target and tactical firearm. The new AR-30A1 is available in a target version and a standard version. Both versions are available in .338 Lapua and .300 Win Mag.

On the surface, the AR-30A1 bears a family resemblance to its predecessor, the AR-30. But, every individual component of the AR-30 was scrutinized
in the AR-30A1. As a result, only the pistol grip, buttpad, trigger, and a few small components from the AR-30 passed muster for the AR-30A1. All other components are new and/or improved. The result is a firearm that maintains its predecessor’s outstanding accuracy, light weight, and soft recoil while dramatically improving its ergonomics, adaptability, versatility, reliability and ease of use.

Features of all versions of the new AR-30A1:

Muzzle brake threads on the end of the barrels employ threads that are standard for the sound suppressor industry (5/8 x 24 for the 300 Win Mag and 3/4 x 24 for the 338 Lapua). So, many sound suppressors can be screwed directly onto the barrel without the need for an adaptor.

The long, 26” barrel in the .338 Lapua enhances muzzle velocity, flatness of trajectory, and terminal ballistics. The 24” barrel of the .300 Win Mag balances ballistic performance with portability.
Optional 1913 rails will support a variety of add-on accessories.

A tough, through-hardened receiver means reduced wear and increased smoothness.

The bolt-mounted safety mechanism locks the firing pin to the rear. This design is stronger and more secure than a sear or trigger blocking safety because it directly blocks the firing pin itself.

The metal cheekpiece is very durable and the elastomeric cheekpiece pad provides a comfortable shooter interface in all weather conditions.

The cheekpiece supports contain integral cleaning rod guides that prevent damage to the bore due to inadequate cleaning rod control.

Multiple sling installation locations allow simultaneous use of a sling and a bipod. And the rear sling swivel can be moved to either the left or right side.
To provide very compact transportation, the entire buttstock assembly can be quickly and easily removed with only one
allen wrench.

The standard and target buttstocks are interchangeable on any receiver with use of only one allen wrench.

Military grade anodizing and phosphating finishes enhance durability and corrosion resistance.

Features specific to the AR-30A1 Standard version:

Much evaluation went into the ergonomics of the AR-30A1. The cheekpiece is at the optimum height for viewing through a telescopic sight by most shooters. And the buttstock, although not adjustable, is ergonomically correct for most shooters.

The included 20 minute angled top rail on the receiver allows zeroing at the extended range provided by the .338 Lapua. (A 10 minute rail is also available as an accessory.)

Performance characteristics of all versions of the AR-30A1:

ArmaLite’s testing has proven the muzzle brake to be the best in the industry for both reducing recoil and increasing accuracy. This makes shooting the AR-30A1 comfortable for even the smallest or recoil-sensitive shooter.

The competition grade barrel and our patented V-block receiver bedding system are keys to the AR-30A1’s minute of angle accuracy. ArmaLite’s patented V-Block™ Bedding Wedge and V-Block Stock assure absolute strength and repeatability for superb accuracy. The aluminum stock reinforces the receiver like a bench-rest sleeve.

The magazine of any mag-fed firearm is critical to reliable feeding. The AR-30’s magazine underwent extensive development testing to assure reliability of feeding. It is made of steel, not polymer or aluminum, to provide years of heavy duty service.

The single stack design of the AR-30A1 magazine minimizes the material removed from the receiver for the mag well. This significantly contributes to the strength and stiffness of the AR-30A1 receiver.

The deep magazine well under the receiver makes magazine insertion fast and easy, while holding the magazine in exactly the correct position for reliable feeding.
An ambidextrous magazine catch is centrally located so that the shooter can release the magazine and catch it with the same hand. Reloading is fast, and the expended magazine won’t be dropped to be lost, damaged or muddied.

The rifle balances just in front of the magazine well. So, the rifle can be easily and comfortably carried near the rifle’s 
The powerful ejection system and generous ejection port eject even loaded .338 Lapua cartridges rapidly and reliably. The large ejection port also makes single loading of cartridges through it easy and fast.

The ergonomically improved bolt handle design and “competition grade” dimensions and tolerances in the receiver allow lightning-fast, butter-smooth reloading.

The buttstock can be removed with one allen wrench for compact transportation or storage. In confined areas, military and LE users can employ the AR-30A1 in a “pistol configuration” without its buttstock. ArmaLite’s highly efficient muzzle brake makes firing, even in the pistol configuration, comfortable

Lock and case.  Comes with stags lifetime transferable warranty.  

here is a review

The 3G is an 18″ barreled AR-15 with about all the bells and whistles you could want for 3-Gun and a lot more. It comes standard with a 15″ Sampson free floating handguard, a Magpull ACS stock and MOE handgrip, and a Geissele Super 3-Gun trigger created specifically for 3-Gun competition. The gas system is the full rifle length version, not the shorter M4 version. This makes for a lot less felt recoil and very smooth control-ability shot to shot. STAG also makes one of the few reliable .22 conversion kits for the AR, and it works flawlessly in this new 3G.

I guess the question is, how many people would buy a dedicated gun for 3-Gun? The STAG 3G would answer that question,” it doesn’t matter. ” The 3G is a formidable battle rifle with almost perfect balance. The twist on the gun is 1 in 8,” which is capable of stabilizing a wide range of bullet types, and the 18″ barrel turns a corner as fast as a 16″ M4, but with a better gas system and more velocity. You also couldn’t ask for a better stock and hand filling grip than the Magpull product. STAG really didn’t skimp on this rifle and they made some important add-on choices that you may not have gotten as right forced to make the choices yourself.

I personally find quad rails annoying, even with too-fat rail covers. This smart Samson handguard comes with 3 short rail sections to mount whatever you like on the gun. It makes for a comfortable, hand sized forward grip and the flexibility to add what you want. You can see from the pictures I like the stumpy UTG/Leapers forward vertical grip, and I was able to mount this in less than five minutes. What I like about it most is that you don’t need a special AR wrench to take the handguard off. It utilizes a collar and two Allen screws, and slides off with little or no effort. For ease of use the Samson wins hands down.

I can’t say I understand the difference between a single stage and a two stage AR trigger because I haven’t messed around with them that much. This Geissele trigger is supposed to be a “hybrid” pull, durable enough for heavy use yet light and controllable for long shots. In my test rifle the trigger broke at 3.5 to 4 pounds, and is snappy and sure. There is no play in the front of the pull at all, not even a wiggle, and less than 1/8″ of travel before it breaks. A 4 pound trigger may be considered a little too light in a traditional battle rifle, but battle rifles have historically been made to carry safety-off, and they are made for the lowest common denominator in safety and shooting ability. If you train on this 3G and get to know it, I don’t feel the 4 pound trigger is too light for a self defense/combat situation, yet it is light and sure enough to take a delicate long aimed shot. The safety is also snappy and sure on these STAGs.

The flashhider/muzzle break is an interesting animal. I haven’t seen it on another rifle, even a STAG. It has top ports and front ports, and breaching fins. I haven’t seen a 3-Gun stage with door breaching, so I’ll assume this is part of the multi-purpose aspect of the rifle. I have yet to find a reliable method for measuring the effectiveness of a flash hider or muzzle break, but the 18″ barrel is also going to help with muzzle flash. More powder burning inside the barrel means less powder burning outside the barrel, which is what causes muzzle flash. Shooting the gun in daylight produces no flash at all that would handicap you, and the recoil shot to shot is completely manageable.

For accuracy, we measured a consistent 1″ or less 5 shot group with the 3G at 100 yards. But even more important, it was easy to keep 10 or 15 shots within 2.” You are going to be shooting a hot gun in a 3-Gun competition. A rifle that can make an inch cold-rifle isn’t as important as one that doesn’t fluxuate when the gun has just emptied three mags. We were also able to shoot this gun briefly at 200 yards. You’ll see from the wet targets that we hit a stormy afternoon at Manatee Gun Range, and they called the range cold right after we got the one group off that you see here.

Outside of a flyer that was probably a raindrop shot, the 1 MOA held out to 200. Nice also was that we were using a Nikon 223 scope, and we dialed that in after shooting at 100 just putting the scope on the 200 mark. The 18″ barrel in the 3G is close enough to the 24″ used in ammo testing at the prescribed 3240 fps. that the 223 series relies upon."

It has billet matched upper and lower receiver set. Why is that important you ask? Billet machined vs. forged means that the billet upper and lower are precision CNC machine cut from a single block of aluminum instead of having molten metal poured into a mold, then pried out and polished up. They are free of imperfections, are never out of spec, and are such a perfect fit that you can't even fit a piece of paper between the upper and lower when they are mated. This leads to a much higher degree of accuracy for your weapon, and longer life from the cycling of ammunition.

It has a 1/10 twist stainless barrel, which allows you to fire accurately up to a 180 grain bullet without affecting trajectory. The stainless material outlasts chrome-lined barrels and holds accuracy longer.

It has a 10.1"" free float hand guard with a monolithic rail from upper receiver to the end of the hand guard. Why is that important? It means there is no impingement on your barrel all the way to the base of the receiver, allowing it to flex as the round is fired and have a truer flight path to the target vs. having the hand guards affixed to a ring just behind the gas block leaving only the last few inches of the barrel to flex. It also allows the barrel to stay cooler during extended periods of fire, giving longer life to your barrel. The monolithic rail will allow you to mount any type of optics you chose and at any position that best fits the eye alignment and arm length of the shooter.

It has a Magpul ACS-L lightweight precision adjustable stock, giving an excellent cheek weld to the stock for proper head position and body alignment when acquiring your target - very important for maintaining accuracy and rapid target realignment for a follow up shot.

It has a Magpul Mission Adaptable (MIAD) combat grip, allowing the shooter to customize the back strap and/or front finger groove of the grip to their desire or mission purpose. It also has storage in the bottom for spare batteries for optics or other field necessities.

It also comes directly from the factory with a 20 round Magpul PMag - nothing but the highest quality in the industry.

I own an identical rifle to this. I know first hand that it will out-shoot the shooter. It is ideal for any type of situation - whether in competition shooting, hunting, or personal defense.
