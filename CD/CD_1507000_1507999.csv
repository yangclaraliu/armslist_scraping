   I have a brand new AR 15 223 Black Rain Ordanance in the digital camo for sale. I bought this one week ago thinking that it had a 20 inch barrell on it and instead it had a 16 inch barrell. So thats why im selling it. It comes with 4-30 round mags, a soft case, 200 rounds of full metal jacket plinking rounds, sling and a few extras to dress the gun up a little more.  I also have a couple scopes that I would part with for a cheap price if you need one.  Im asking $2100 for everything. 
   Please contact Jason if interested at REDACTED. Please only serious buyers!!! Im willing to hear reasonable offers other wise dont text, call or e-mail me if your going to try and low ball me. Im already giving this away! 

I paid $2100 for just the gun plus tax and bought a few extra accessories for the gun which are included in the price. Im willing to eat the tax and throw in the ammo, mags and the accessories to give someone a great deal and get them either started or help add another Beautiful AR to there collection, this also will allow me to purchase the gun I origanally was going to buy.  I cant buy my new gun until this one sells and Im running out of time.  Total value of package is ($2700) and some change.  I think I have my reciepts for most of this stuff.  I will have to look if you want to see them.  Please research this gun and everything that comes with it.  You will see how good of a deal this is and that im not making a pennie, im loosing my ass. (-$600)and some change to be exact but it was my fault when I bought it for not checking the barrell lenth out. Its a beautiful gun and will drive tacs but what Im going to use it for requires at least a 20 inch barrell.  I own a Snow Camo Black Rain Ordanance with a 20 inch bull barrell that I use for coyote hunting and its an amazing gun to shoot. 

If you have any questions on what accessories come with the gun and the brand of the accessory please text or call me at REDACTED.  I try not to buy anything cheap when it comes to my ARs and Gun accessories.

Took it to the range and it functioned flawlessly. Once I got zeroed I tore up the center of the target. There's a reason there are still a ton of these out there... they work.

Lightly used (250 rounds it +/-) The firearm comes with the original box, 2 magazines, and all original paperwork. 
Plus 100 rounds of Federal 40gr FMJ and some CCI 40gr HP and 40gr TMJ (neither are quite full). It's a start...it's what I've got on hand.
The gun is in excellent condition, there are two small scratches on the finish on the right side of the firearm (trigger finger right handed) as indicated in the pictures. While Im sure the finish will touch up easily, I have nothing to hide in this sale. 

If you are reading this post. You have no doubt done your research and know what you are looking at, so I'll spare you the details. I will say however the gun is incredibly light, even when fully loaded. There has been absolutely zero Key-holing, the gun is extremely accurate. I am capable of hitting shotgun shells one handed as far as they can be thrown 30 for 30 until the slide locks back, no problem (no doubt many of you can likely best that). The only FTFs experienced were all within the first magazine, and is confidently attributed to  MY OWN improper seating of rounds in the  first magazine fired. If you read the manual (provided) and seat the rounds in the magazine as indicated (tappy tappy) you wont experience any problems.

I like the firearm a lot, it's the ultimate plinker/ trail gun and I have been very happy with it. I am selling only to help facilitate the purchase of a motorcycle. 

Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns . I am only interested in face-face Ga sales with valid photo ID. I will not ship the firearm. Price is firm."

We can coat anything from firearms and knives, to industrial and automotive parts. If you want it coated, we can coat it. Testing Performed by an independent military approved testing facility proved that Cerakote™ is 7.5 times more wear resistant than other coatings including, but not limited to, duracoat, gunkote, parkerizing, powder coating, blueing, ion bond, etc. You can coat your items in virtually any color you want.

We also offer Micro Slick services. Cerakote™ Micro Slick is a dry-film lubricant that is able to withstand high temperatures and extreme pressures. The Micro Slick coating is able to lubricate, resist wear, and also act as an anti-seize agent while preventing galvanic corrosion or bonding of the metals. Micro Slick is virtually unaffected by temperatures ranging between 800 and 12000 degrees fahrenheit. When two adjoining surfaces are coated with Micro Slick it prevents surface-to-surface contact, which reduces friction and wear between the two surfaces. An example of this would be to coat a bolt carrier group on an AR 15 and the inside of the upper receiver. This combination would reduce the amount of friction between the parts and help the firearm to function more smoothly.

Micro Slick is generally applied, but not limited, to internal, moving parts such as bolts, bolt carrier groups, trigger groups, rails, etc. This product comes in a dark grey color only.

MKII pistols are centerfire, double

Action: The action of the Ruger manual safety model pistols is of the U.S.
M1911 type that utilizes a tilting barrel design in which the barrel and slide are
locked together at the moment of firing. After firing, the barrel and slide recoil
to the rear a short distance while still locked together. After this initial movement, the barrel tilts downward from its locked position, permitting full recoil
of the slide and the extraction and ejection of the spent cartridge case.

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.  Pretty neat setup for long distance shooting.  More info on this at: http://www.opticsplanet.com/gearexpert/bullet-drop-compensation-nikon-spot-on-2016

Scope by itself retails for $200, so you're basically getting the binoculars for free (which retail for $115). Willing to ship for $15.00 extra.

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

Public awareness plug : Hagglers need not apply.  Comb the net or better yet visit your lgs if you think there is a better deal out there.  Purchasers of 9mm FMJ range ammo from my other ad will get a discount on these defensive rounds equaling 250 of the Federals going at $180 or 250 of the Rangers going at $215.00. I will also apply that same discount to multiple purchases of the 250 round lots listed in this ad.  That means your initial 250 round lot purchase receives the same discount as well.

Before any one asks again, yes I have more of all the ammunition lines presented in my ads on hand vs what is pictured.  For all those whom naively (and rather loudly and quite immaturely) claim that the ammo shortage is all over now, I would ask that they provide actual proof to validate their completely bogus and tiredly repeated claims.  At the very best we are looking at another 6 months to possibly even more than a year of this.  Blame your government that you voted for (on both sides) not your fellow shooters.

This one has factory Metrolight night sights and a Glock grip plug installed. I had the Glock Armorer install a 3.5 lb trigger kit including the connector and all 3 springs over the weekend. Its actually a little less then 3lbs I think. I have a couple of other Glocks done exactly the same way and this one has the lightest trigger. The factory trigger parts are included. This gun also includes 2 hi-cap mags, the box and all factory accessories. 

These EXO Glocks are extremely hard to find especially brand new. The chance of you walking into a gun dealer and them having one are almost impossible. The last few Glock EXO's that sold on Gunbroker went for around $700. And that's without the extras that are on this one. Im asking $775 or best offer. As we all know Glocks are a little hard to come by right now with most dealers only having a couple if any at all. I personally know several friends of mine that are dealers that have been waiting months on their Glock stock orders. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or offers. Im not interested in any trades at this time and low ballers can go on to the next listing. Thanks for looking & GOD Bless."

Don\'t settle for a Bushmaster, CMMG, or any other sub par manufacturer.  These rifles are all piston driven and are as reliable and accurate as you could ever want one to be.  Here is a unbiased review from Guns&Ammo regarding the LWRC M6 platform.
http://www.gunsandammo.com/reviews/lwrci-m6a2-review/
If you have any questions please email me at REDACTED - below are the specs and other information on the rifle.
This M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in 14.7 inch barrel length and in 5.56mm NATO.  The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

The M6A2™ rifle can be used in various roles. The 14.7 inch barrel M6A2™ rifle is an excellent general purpose carbine capable of effective fire out to 600 meters. 

The M6A2™ rifle’s edge in capability, reliability, accuracy and long service life is the result of advanced technology materials and manufacturing processes, combined with progressive patented designs. All LWRCI™ carbine systems feature our short-stroke gas-piston operating system. The operating system is lightweight, self-regulating, and self-scraping. This system of operation does not foul the moving parts of the weapon with carbon or heat, greatly enhancing service life and reliability while decreasing both user and armorer maintenance. All M6A2™ rifles feature a match grade, cold rotary hammer forged barrel with a target crown. The barrel is treated with NiCorr™ surface conversion technology that extends service life, enhances accuracy, and increases the effective range of the weapon. As in all of our rifles, the bolt carrier group and the barrel extension of the M6A2™ rifle is coated with EXO’s patented nickel-boron surface conversion technology that provides a hard permanent lubrication to the moving parts.

The M6A2™ rifle defines itself as the most modern and incrementally evolved carbine in the world. At the same time it also presents the best value. Service life is extended to four times that of a legacy M4, accuracy is 100 percent better, and our M6 rifles are many times more reliable than the legacy gas-impingement design.

We are forced with financial hardship to let loose of some material possessions. I have an interarms 30-06 with a pretty decent scope, it is a tasco and was 159.99 new. The firearm itself was manufactured in alexandria, va and is modeled after the mauser. The bolt assembly itself is listed online for $250 because it can go right onto a mauser. I value the gun at around $400 without all of the extras for it, such as 20 rounds of ammo, reloading dies with extra depriming pins, 160 rounds of brass (100 of which are polished and deprimed), and case trimming length gauge, along with 2 shell holders. I would let it go for $350 alone and $420 with the extras. The 30-06 is the one on the bottom.

Also for sale is a remington 550-1 semi-auto tube fed 22lr, 22short, 22long. I have one box of 49 rounds of subsonic CCI CB22 short ammo and 25 rounds of remington hyper velocity 22 short golden rounds that I will include.""These older Remingtons are super shooters. They have REAL walnut stocks and all steel parts. Except for the buttplate, you won't see any plastic or potmetal on them."" There is not a semi-auto 22 rifle made these days that can use a 22 short and work the extractor. In 90% condition they are worth $350 all day long. This gun is not in that condition, in fact it is currently disassembled and the barrel is stripped to bare steel because I'm in the process of blueing it. I would sell it right now how it sits for $150 (I would reassemble it of course, so you can see that it operates properly before buying). After I blue it and take the paint rub off of the stock I will be selling it at $300 price tag. This is the second gun from the bottom  in the picture. I just slapped the barrel on the stock, it also has a weaver side mount scope for it so you can have your iron sights and scope both with easy visibilty.

3rd from the bottom is a marlin model 60 22lr semi-auto tube fed 15+1. This gun is $200 new and have a $30 tasco scope that you see in the pictures with the ammo. It also has high visibility fiber optics iron sights which I have used at night and work well. I am also selling this for $150. I am not including the 50 ($5) rounds of CCI minimags, the 525($24.99) rounds of remington golden rounds, or the federal ($20) high velocity 22lr rounds in the deal but would be willing to sell this ammo separate for $30.

Finally at the top of the picture is the H & R Pardner pump 12g shotgun. This is a 5+1 pump action that is modeled after the Remington Express 870, I have a shoulder sling that I paid $30 for that is on it in the picture. We paid just over $200 new for this gun, this gun is just about brand new was bought as a Christmas gift, has only had 30 rounds put through it. All of the shotgun ammo in the picture comes with it. 2 boxes (50 rounds)of winchester target ammo, 1 box of remington #4 shot pheasant load, 4 boxes of federal #7 1/2 shot multi-purpose rounds. 5 rounds of winchester security ammo, has slug with 3 pellets of 00 buckshot. 10 remington rifled slug rounds and 5 rounds 00 buckshot. This is about $80 worth of ammunition. So I value it all about about $310 and will sell it for $230.

I also have a Lyman eazy-loader 3 stage reloading press($199), an electronic micrometer($30), 2 ammo cans ($35), one wooden 100 round casing holder($15). Bottle of birchwood casey Brass cleaning solution($10) and an RCBS gun powder scale($169). The steel box in the background is the case for the press. This is easily $400 worth of stuff, but I will let it go for $150, because of our current need.

By my math you could get everything here at my discounted price for $1130, if you were to come and take all off my hands I would come down to $1000. This is an insane deal and I would also throw in all of my gun cleaning accessories as well, around $75 worth of stuff if one were to take all. 

Within the first 48 hours I will not be responding to any replies to break up the collection as I'm wanting to give a chance for someone to take it all. After that if there is no one who will take it all, than I will start going down the list of the emails I received first.

I've got more pictures and/or can take more if you need, just let me know. Am willing to ship through an FFL if you were to pay all the fees.

Trade: You will notice,I prefer trades.
Trades: Would trade for a NICE Ready to kill/hunt Bow Setup. 2012 lowest year I would look at, 13 is preferred. Bowtech, Matthews, PSE, Hoyt in order of preference, then Maybe diamond, some elites (answer) but not really too interested in other brands but still would consider if its a top model like g5 or other. PSE Vendetta 13 would save money as you could get a RTK package under asking price as will the PSE Dream Season DNA. Can also do something like the PSE Stinger 3g, black, Ready to kill with arrows, or the Diamond Outlaw, Ready to kill  Arrows, either of those two for the PISTOL (NO MARS SIGHT) ONLY. READY TO KILL setup is the bow with the accessories already installed.  All bows, please have limbs @ 60-70, or 50-70. I don't really go over 70, but do like to shoot @ 60. Enjoy dropping it to @ 55 for all day events. prefer new, but if in really good condition, would def. look at used. This is a good chance to get rid of that bow you bought last year that for some reason you just didn't like, or for the PSE and/or outlaw, they have the rtk setups ready to go, under 500.

May consider trade for conceal carry type pistol, or ar15/10 or Browning Bar Safari with the BOSS system (No BOSS system, not interested at all). 30 caliber preferred, but would consider 270, not interested in other guns. I don't really even need an ar, cept maybe the 10 would be nice to go hog hunting. 

Not interested in other trades. You can ask, but I probably will ingnore/or say no. First to show up, or first to guarantee purchase/trade (trade with at a min pic/receipt, I will hold for a minimal time, but am not holding for days and days as I've held onto stuff and lost time in it being sold from holding off on selling it to others. I can drive about an hour or so from San Antonio to help out.

Please text: 910-476-142(Three). Will be working all day wed and thurs, but off for the weekend. Can still have people come over on wed/thurs, but it will be after 1930 or 7:30pm.
