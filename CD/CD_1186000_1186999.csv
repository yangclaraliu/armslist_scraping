Beautiful Rifle and I also have the bayonet for it. The bayonet is a 4 sided Star shape that is now against Geneva convention so play nice and no stabbing, it's too hard to sew you up. The numbers do not match on the baynet and scabbard, though. The bluing is in great shape with no real visible rust, pitting, or wear. The bore is bright with nice rifling. Bolt and bolt face are in very nice condition and the stock has some great markings and character without abuse like gouges, deep scratches, or cracks. This would make a great addition to the collection. You can still buy ammo for this gun and shoot it. What a hoot and a lot of fun. It is the first gun designed for the high pressures of the smokeless powder. Of what I understand it hold 8 rounds, so sorry New York, this assault rifle is not for you. I recommend you move back to the United States. Below is the Wiki about it and it's great history. Priced to move @ $500.00

Sorry, I don't have the original box and papers. Gun is in good fireable shape. It has been in the safe for many years only to be pulled and cleaned and inspected. Look at my other ads also.

The Lebel Model 1886 rifle (French: Fusil Modèle 1886 dit ""Fusil Lebel"") is also known as the ""Fusil Mle 1886 M93"", after a bolt modification was added in 1893. It is an 8mm bolt action infantry rifle which entered service in the French Army in April 1887. It is a repeating rifle that can hold eight rounds in its forestock tube magazine plus one round in the transporter. The Lebel rifle had the distinction of being the first military firearm to use smokeless powder ammunition. The new gunpowder, ""Poudre B"", was nitrocellulose-based and had been invented in 1884 by French chemist Paul Vieille. . Lt. Colonel Nicolas Lebel contributed the flat nosed 8mm full metal jacket bullet (""Balle M"", or ""Balle Lebel""). The first practical full metal jacket rifle bullets had just been invented in 1881 by a Lt. Colonel (then Captain) Eduard Rubin (Swiss Army). Somewhat later, in 1898, a ballistically superior pointed (spitzer) AND boat-tail bullet was adopted for the Lebel rifle. It was made of solid brass and called ""Balle D"". Featuring an oversized bolt with front locking lugs and a massive receiver, the Lebel rifle was a durable design capable of effective long range performance with "" Balle D "" . In spite of outdated features, such as its tube magazine and the sharply tapered case of 8mm Lebel ammunition, the Lebel rifle remained the basic weapon of French infantry during World War I (1914–18)."

I am splitting the cost on what I paid when I finally came across some in stock last week.  9mm is in stock nowhere for more than a few hours.  If you think you're going to be paying 12 cents a round again for 9mm sometime in the future, that is great, but you can just keep on waiting.  I am sorry you picked a bad time to stock your safe with ammo, that is not my problem.  Given the political climate, shortage, and federal government buying up all the 9mm rounds it can (1.6 billion 9mm jhp in last year via department of homeland security), we currently have a situation where 9mm is hard to come by.  If you have a secret place where you go to buy your 9mm at 15 cents a round, that is great, move on or share it with the rest of us.  If you want these 500 rounds, the price is 235 bucks.

AK fans now learn what the SKS-nuts have long known - A little Tapco makes for some good rifles.

Case in point - These Intrafuse magazines.  Not only are they 1/3 lighter than the steel 30 rounders, but they are arguably more durable as well - in that ""six of one half dozen of another"" that exists between a cracking or bending of materials.  Here it's with the feed lips.  You might be able to bend your AK mag back to shape, but a cracked Tapco will keep feeding until you get time to replace it (as seen in professional tests).  Which would you want more in the critical scenario?

Load out with more ammo and less magazine mass, while saving money to boot.  This latest scare has seen steel magazines go up to $40 a piece, while polymers have barely risen at all.  You'll also use three less import parts - for the sake of 922(r) compliance - when attaching a Tapco versus most steel magazines.

Single column magazine holds 6 rounds. 

Firestar pistols are claimed to be ones of the smallest guns in their caliber, but, obviously not the lightest ones.

While retaining most of the  M16 design features, Daewoo designers replaced the direct gas system of the AR-15/M16 rifle with the more common and reliable gas piston system, and made several other improvements, resulting in very good combat weapon.

 The following parts in the DR-200 are common with the AR15 series: hammer, disconnector, trigger, hammer spring, disconnector spring, firing pin retainer (cotter pin), bolt cam pin, magazines, hammer and trigger pins, flash hider on pre-ban [AR100], front sling swivel, rear sight drum and detent same as m16a1, front take down pivot pin and detent. Converting to pre-ban config is easy due to this. Since it uses a gas piston and regulator, not direct impingement, cleaning is easy and operation is nominally flawless."

If we want to save our freedom NOW then we have to spread this message to every corner of America!

So please, watch this video: https://membership.nrahq.org/forms/donate.asp?CampaignID=weareamerica

And after you do, be sure to email it to friends...post it on Facebook...link to it in blogs and forums. Wherever and whenever you can help spread the word, please do it tonight or tomorrow. Please send it to all the Colorado Senate members.  If enough of us forward, maybe they will all watch at least once.

But we need to do more. MUCH MORE.

So in addition to sharing this video with friends, I hope you'll help NRA take their campaign to the next level.

It's absolutely critical that they buy commercial air time RIGHT NOW so we can answer Barack Obama and his elitist allies, word-for-word, every time they try to belittle our freedoms and shame us into silence.

I'm putting this out there to see if there's any interest.  Ideally I'd trade it for the XD sub-compact in .40 or a Glock 27.  I know these normally got for more than my 4"" XD is worth so I could throw in some cash.  Heck, if you've got a nice 9mm sub-compact to trade (XD, Glock 26, ect...) we can talk about the couple hundred rounds in ammo I have too.

My gun is well taken care of and I'd expect the same of any trades.  Also, I'll only sell to another CCW permit holder or someone willing to fill out a bill of sale with driver's license info on it. Thanks for understanding!"

Price will only be this low for a short amount of time till I won't be so in need of the money then it will go back up to $650.

I am looking to sell my beloved Calico Liberty 50 9mm rifle. It uses a helical style drum that sits above the receiver and holds 50 rounds of 9mm ammo. Can also use a 100 round Calico 9mm drum/magazine that can be purchased from Calico Light Weapons Systems. This is from the newer generation of Calico's so it uses the newest generation of their magazines which were more reliable than the originals. 

Comes with a factory scope mount, factory speed loader, and a 2 custom rails (bottom one for forward grip, top rail for flashlight/laser). Also has a Hogue Handall grip added to make the stock pistol grip more comfortable. About $180 worth of accessories! 

Probably 1500 rounds or so put through this, which isn't much considering that you are normally loading up 50 rounds at a time. First and only owner of this nice gun, and has been babied and well kept over the years I have owned it.

Get one of these while you still can! If there is ""any"" sort of ban, this will be on it as the smallest magazine it can accept is 50 rounds! These things were hard enough to find before all this nonsense started, so buy it before they become impossible to get!

Price if FIRM at $600, this is probably the cheapest Calico 9mm you will find on Armslist. CASH ONLY, I'm not a bank so I can't take cards and I don't want to take a check hoping it won't bounce. 

Third pic added to show what the gun looked like when I had a Forward Grip and Flashlight attached to the lower rail, and a 2x Red Dot Scope on the scope rail.  These are NOT Included.

Without them the acp cartridges drop into the cylinder). HiViz sight, notched rear, ""ribber"" grips, etc. It is like new and barely even shot (function tests only). I have the gun, box, manuals, warranty card, tools, etc. I also have some ammo too, but only for the right deal. 

Must be WI resident. If the ad is still up then it is still available. I am not in a rush to get rid of it, since it seems like shotgun ammo is the only thing left along with hunting rifle calibers. Cheap 410 birdshot can be bought about the same as UMC 9mm or less than 40 S&W. Will not sell outright unless it's an offer I cant refuse... trade preferred.

This is a cash only private sale. There is a lot of concern right now about whether or not anyone will be able to buy these guns in the very near future. It was built to take a 50 round high capacity magazine, and even the cheap federal ammo for it goes straight through a level 2 bullet proof vest. The better ammo goes through several of them. It is portable, light weight, and a great investment or SHTF defense weapon.

Location: Portage Indiana. If you see this listing handgun it's available.
For sale Raven Arms MP-25 small handgun in .25 auto. Holds 6+1 rounds. All black.
Weight only 15 oz. overall length 4.5"", 3"" tall, 7/8"" wide. The slimmest gun you can buy.
Double safety, voted as the best compact and inexpensive handgun ever produced.
Made in the USA from quality steel, full metal frame and slider. Not like today's small cheap alloy or plastic guns that can explode in your hand on the first shot. 
Fixed barrel (length 2 3/8""), good for mounting silencer, not that you need one.
This is very good quality personal defense, or backup, easy to carry and conceal handgun. Perfect for ankle holster, any pocket, purse or just any place. It fits in small size hand perfect. Ideal for women, or young people with tight clothing.
Very easy to disassemble and clean, very simple construction with only few moving parts.
Handgun is in good condition with some wear signs, its very accurate and had less than 300 rounds trough it. Its been functioning flawlessly, without any problems. I have several of this guns and I enjoy shooting them because of literally no recoil and excellent accuracy on 25 yards.
Caliber .25 with hallow point personal defense rounds, its the way to go if your are concern about the size, weight and easy concealing. I own several full size handguns and they all weight around or over 2.5 lbs with the full 15 rounds magazine. After a wile becomes big burden and very unpleasant to carry such a bulky, heavy, and very hard to conceal gun. One that I always enjoy to carry is this one, you don't even feel it.

Online research: 
""In CT, there have been six self-defense shootings employing the MP-25 over the last 20 years. All six have been fatal for the attacker. At 100% fatality rate, this weapon exceeds both the .45ACP and .357 magnum for lethality. Obviously the sample is too small to draw any real conclusions, but it is important to note that 6 rounds of .25 at close range means a lot of blood lost for the bad guy.""
With today's technology boom in ammunition evolution, one modern self defense .25 bullet can make a lot of damage.
 Gun Review: Raven MP-25 Semi-automatic pistol
""Raven MP-25 has a tumultuous history and remains a controversial piece of the American firearms scene. It was designed by the famous George Jennings, and is the original, quintessential, “Saturday night special.” Reviled by journalists and anti-crime activists for its extreme popularity with criminals, this weapon suffered a smear campaign unrivaled until the concept of the “scary black rifle” reared its ugly head in the nineties. While it is true that criminals employed this weapon heavily through the seventies (count how many you see in the movies “Dolemite” or “Black Caesar”), it was the same things that attracted the weapon to criminals that attracted it to everyone else. For twenty years, this pocket stinger ruled the streets of Miami, Memphis, and Harlem. It was designed to be small, light and disposable. In the end, like any weapon, it has good points and bad, and the end user must ultimately make the decision for their own reasons...
This weapon only had one competitor in its class when it came out: the Colt .38 Detective special. In the sixties, the snub-nosed .38 ruled the concealed weapon scene. Small, comparatively powerful, and reliable, every cop had one on the ankle and every detective had one on the hip. When the MP-25 hit, you now had access to a weapon that could shoot seven rounds and then reload in the blink of an eye. Like all detachable magazine automatics, reloading is as simple as dropping the mag, and sliding in another. It was way faster than wrestling a speed-loader into a revolver, or worse, feeding individual rounds into the cylinder...""

If you ever have any problems you send it for free repair or service, if is not repairable they will send you new one. Not many factories have the lifetime warranty, this is the good indicator of the excellent quality. 

This is the perfect size light weight handgun, perfect for personal concealed carry, pocket, purse, vehicle, man and woman. 
It is all chrome, black polymer grips, maintenance free-no oiling needed outside, it wont corrode, oil wont stain your clothes, it wont make mess in you purse. 
Perfect concealable firearm for a beginning shooter to an experienced marksman. No recoil, very easy and simple to operate and shoot. Perfect balance and shape - rounded edges, will not catch the clothing while drawing. And reassembles the famous James Bond Walter PPK. 
Caliber .32acp (auto) it's actually 7.65x17mm. It has good stopping power. This is the best caliber for the smaller pistols, because if you go bigger you are losing number of bullets in the mag and shooting becomes unpleasant especially for very young people and females, due to short handle /grip and huge recoil. Light weight of the gun cannot compensate any part of the recoil forces and gun can even jump out of the hands and kick you in the head. That is why .32 is the perfect choice with almost no recoil, even seven years old can shoot it safely.

""SIG SAUER P250 SUBCOMPACT NITRON

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.
SIG SAUER® P250 Wins Two NRA Golden Bullseye Awards SIG SAUER, Inc. proudly announced the P250 pistol as the recipient of the National Rifle Association’s coveted Golden Bullseye Award for Shooting Illustrated Handgun of the Year and American Rifleman Tactical Handgun of the Year. This is the one gun that changes everything, the new P250®...""

If you want ""the best handgun in the world"" then you should chose Sig Sauer.
If you want ""the best Sig Sauer"" then you should chose Sig Sauer P250.
There is only one better then this one for me. But this one is the best for many others.
Start with this subcompact model, and then later add different sizes and calibers. This is the original solution for many people that want more then one caliber, and one gun for more then one application.
If you ever shoot the best of all handguns, this one will surprise and impress even you. It is so smooth, sweet, stylish, comfy, very sturdy, accurate and very light. It works like a dream.

In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun."

This is identical to the M4 used by the US armed forces with just one exception, this rifle only fires semi auto, while the US Army and navy versions fire full auto as well. All the internals and components are the same as the US Government rifles, the only difference being semi auto vs. full auto fire. This is the rifle Colt markets to law enforcement agencies across the world. Again, this is a true Mil Spec rifle, not a civilian knock off AR. The rifle is absolutely brand new and was only taken out of the box to take the pictures. The rifle has been fired 40 times and comes with two colt 20 round magazines, box, papers, cleaning tools, sling, and whatever else came with it from the factory. Only serious buyer should contact me. i only accept cash, Money order, western union and Money Gram  (add 2.5% for local, 3.5% if not local),
I will ship anywhere, if you cover shipping and associated fees."
