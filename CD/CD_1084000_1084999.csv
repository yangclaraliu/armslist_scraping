A lot of people have messaged me wondering how the AK-47 compares to theAR-15 so I'm going to include that here. First, the AK-47 is an unbelievablysimple gun, it's very easy to break down and clean. Second, the AK-47 is remarkably reliable, and it will shoot nearly any ammunition regardless of how horrible it is. Third, the 7.62 x 39mm ammunition that the AK-47 shoots packs significantly more punch than the AR-15's 5.56 x 45mm. Fourth, this gun is very cheap compared to the AR-15 and a lot of the accessories are more readily available even in today’s market. Now for the bad, this gun is not well known for its accuracy. With that being said accuracy for this gun is greatly impacted by the ammo being used, don't expect top accuracy if you're shooting garbage ammo. The upside is that this gun will consistently shoot cheap-o ammo whereas the AR-15 will have problems. Had I decided to not sell the gun, I would have absolutely upgraded to a chrome lined barrel with a nice compensator, and probably upgraded the bolt carrier assembly. The bottom line is, if you want decent accuracy out of an AK, shoot decent ammo."

From Rugers site:

Ruger® SR-556™ Semiautomatic Rifle

-Reliable two-stage piston-driven performance
-Troy Industries folding battle sights are adjustable
-Quad-rail handguard with rail covers
-Six-position, telescoping M4-style buttstock
-Two 30-round magazines and soft-sided carry case
Experience the rugged reliability Ruger is renowned for in a new rifle that redefines the AR platform. Its chrome-plated, two-stage, piston-driven operating system offers improved dependability over gas-driven rifles. A four-position, chrome-plated gas regulator allows the shooter to tune the rifle to specific ammunition or conditions. The bolt, bolt carrier and extractor are also chrome-plated to enhance performance and durability. A cold hammer-forged, chrome- lined, mil-spec 41V45 barrel delivers consistent accuracy. Troy Industries folding battle sights are adjustable and co- witness with mil-spec optics so they can easily be removed to make room for high-powered scopes. The Troy Industries quad-rail handguard provides a rigid mount for the piston-driven transfer rod. Rail covers for unused rails make for a more comfortable hold. A six-position, telescoping M4-style buttstock can be used to adjust length of pull. Includes two 30-round MAGPUL PMAG magazines and a soft-sided carry case.


I have also installed a Magpul B.A.D Lever. Something all AR's should come with!

I can ship the Ruger. I have sold and shipping firearms via Armslist before. I have email chains and references. Before you send any money a bill of sale with my and your information will be exchanged. No games here. I am more than happy to talk you through the process over the phone."

Paul bought a 40 year old Marlin 44Mag and began having buyer's remorse before he even saw the rifle, then wants to extort me (the seller) into having this gun re-blued.

Comes with original blue Sig case, four mags, Sig factory grips (shown), fine wood grips (Rosewood?), and a Blackhawk holster.  

There is a lot about this gun that I don't know.  The sights are definitely Trijicon but they have additional dots on the top (two rear, one front) that really help with lock out.  The trigger has a super smooth action and I was told when I bought it that it had the Sig action enhancement work done on it but I can't verify that. I do know it has new springs and an extra power recoil spring. I think it has the SRT, but this one has lines on the pad area whereas my other 220 triggers have smooth pads.  The throat and ramp have have also been beveled and polished.  You'll have to judge for yourself but the action on this is like butter and definitely not stock Sig  If you'd don't have a 220, I'll bring one of my 220 carry pistols for you to compare it with."

Semi-automatic rifle chambered in 30-06 Springfield.  Has a new Boyd's stock and a new leather sling, comes with the original stock.  I'll also include 3 loaded 8-round clips and a cleaning kit.

I am NOT a Garand expert!  I do not know anything about all the various stampings, manufacturers, etc.  I inherited this M1 from my father along with several other guns.  I did do some quick research and learned about rewelded receivers, this one has no signs of being welded.  I'll do my best to answer any questions you may have, just keep in mind I'm not an expert.

For pricing, I searched Armslist for ""Garand"" and looked at what else was out there.  I think $950 is fair, considering this one has $150 of new wood on it.

I'm a private seller. This means cash only (although I might consider a nice stainless Bearcat as partial trade). It also means no shipping or tax, no background fees, and no waiting!

Please, if you choose to send me an email, write something other than ""still available"" so I know you're a real person. Thanks!"

TECHNICAL DETAILS ON THIS BOLT-ACTION:
1992 to 2006 Winchester Model 70
Starting in 1992, Winchester re-introduced many features of the pre-'64 rifles. The Post-'92 Model 70 is an extensive rifle line that boasts nearly all of the features of the original line, but with some updated equipment, such as the Controlled Round action and synthetic stocks. Popular variants feature black resin stocks, which hold up better than wood stocks over time. 

BALLISTICS DATA:
Many ballistics scholars consider the 7mm Rem-Mag ""the Most Ballistically Efficient Round"" available under .338 Lapua.
This rifle will send a 150-grain Federal Hi-Shok out the barrel at 3,110 feet/per-second with a muzzle energy of 3,220 foot-pounds.

When I brought this mag home I immediately vacuum sealed it and put it away for LONG TERM storage, that is how it has been sitting ever since.

Now just to be clear this mag is brand new and has NEVER even had ANY ammo loaded into it. There are no scratches and it has NEVER BEEN INSERTED INTO A PISTOL or any gun. This is the newest style factory Glock mag with an additional cut out for left handed guns. I need money bad so I am willing to let this gem go. With government cameras and drones everywhere, GPS in all cell phones, the dollar about to possibly collapse and society falling apart do you want to risk facing a TOTAL SHTF/WROL scenario without the tools you need to protect yourself and your family? 33 rounds of 9mm in a reliable weapon system would help. The price for the factory Glock mag is $120, vacuum sealed.

I also have a brand new vacuum sealed 33 rd 9mm Korean made mag for Glock pistols as well. They have a good reputation of working well, they cost less then factory Glock mags. The price for the Korean mag is $80, vacuum sealed.

Not too happy I missed last hunting season, so looking to purchase a used shotgun. Break, pump, bolt or double barrel does not matter much to me as long as the gun is safe to use, reliable and around $150.  I have a lot of property and can even share some deer, turkey or small game with someone that has a hunting shotgun they can't use but still want to reap the benefits.  So if you have a shotgun in your basement and don't use it but still want some venison, I'm your man!  Email me if interested!"

The cylinder in it is the 22 magnum cylinder. This gun is not pretty by no means, been dropped, scratched, and probally a lot more that I don't know of. I'm not the original owner. It still fires in single action by cocking hammer. In double action it catches. Its just a good plinker or use for a beat around revolver. Pictures speak for themselves. Comes with a box of winchester super X 22 win mag 40 grain jacketed hollow points. There are 46 rounds out of 50 left in the box. Also comes with a padded zipper case. 
Will sell outright as is for 135 or trade for a shootable old pump action shotgun. Not looking for anything special as this isn't but it's still a functional revolver that I could piece out for much more than what I am asking for it all. It has the 9.5 inch barrel as well.

Scope mount included. Here is the specs:

The AK-54R rifles are built upon Category 1 (nice, minty, un issued) Romanian PSL rifle parts kits, using a special receiver that allows for the use of regular AKM type butt stocks and pistol grips. They also feature a correct, and fully functional, scope mount, installed on the left side of the receiver . The barrel is shortened to 16.5 inches, and is re-profiled, allowing the gas block and handguard retainer to be moved rearward, so that standard AKM length gas pistons (we use a Tapco stainless unit, which provides an extra 922r compliance part) and standard AKM type handguards can be used! The idea is simply to give the end user an AKM sized package that delivers the powerful punch of the 7.62x54R cartridge. This initial batch of rifles will feature a non-pinned Romanian PSL muzzle device, on 14x1 LH threads, K-VAR synthetic furniture, in plum, beautiful gun kote finish . 

These are very hard to come by. Plus the ammo is still affordable. I can add ammo for the right deal. More pics upon request.  Thanks!"

The Saiga AK-47 7.62x39 is the perfect rifle for those just getting into the world of AK's or for veteran gun owners. This gun is made in Russia by Izhmash, the original manufacture of the famous line of AK rifles. The secret to the AK's ridiculous reliability is the sheer simplicity of the firing mechanism consisting of only eight moving parts. The simplicity of its design means anyone can learn how disassemble and operate it in only minutes. Because this weapon does not come with a pistol grip and has a ten round magazine it is not considered an ""Assault Weapon"" by many politicians. 

Package includes:
-Saiga AK-47 7.62x39
-Factory 10 round magazine 
-Six additional Thermold 30 round magazines 
-Sling 
-Twelve 20 round boxes of Russian made 7.62x39 TULA ammunition (240 rounds total)
