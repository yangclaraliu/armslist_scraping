Perfect for females. To my understanding, this was manufactured by a company in Santa Monica in the 70's under licensing from S&W. It was made as a simple inexpensive fire arm. The targeted buyer was often store clerks who were looking for an inexpensive way to protect the store. The quality control was not as good as if S&W was manufacturing themselves. This is meant to be a simple , easy to use revolver that will get 5 shots off.  Its not meant to take to a range and put 500 rounds through.  Hense the cheap price. Most of these guns are missing the barrel locking pin, or other parts. This hasnt been fired since 1972.  So, its in amazing condition with all parts ."

Though it was produced for only 5 short years in the mid-to-late 1950s, it appeared in a plethora of models, firing different cartridges and with several different weights. The Royal Sporting Rifle had dovetails for a scope mount, a low Monte Carlo comb, and a raised cheekpiece on the stock. There were three models of the Royal. Short-action models (.22 Hornet and .222 Remington) had the basic features of the Royal, including a low Monte Carlo stock with a raised cheekpiece, a checkered pistol grip wrist, and a checkered fore-end. The metalwork is of natural-finish steel with a 24-inch barrel. They were not drilled and tapped for a scope mount, but had a folding-leaf rear sight.Based on the rifles serial number it was manufactured in England in March of 1955.  For a 63 year old rifle this weapon is in amazing condition.  The metal including a 24 inch barrel are in 100% condition and the wood is in approximately 90% condition exhibiting only light handling marks.  The rifle will come with a Simmons Pro Hunter scope in 6X18 by 200.  (Sling is not included)Must be willing to meet at local PD or other public arena, must possess a valid MO drivers license and must be willing to sign a bill of sale.Thank you"

If you offer me something else, you’ll either be ignored or spammed.  DON'T BOTHER WITH YOUR 10MM, YOUR .40, OR YOUR BOAT TRAILERS.  Seriously, people, read what I am writing.  My strong preference is for a DA/SA gun or one of the ones on the list below, but if you have a 9mm full size (barrel 4 inches or longer), you can try me.

Comes with two magazines and a nice Kraft IWB holster, retail value approx $120. I enjoyed shooting this pistol. Purchased for use at home since it has a rail for a light, but prefer full size guns. Has functioned flawlessly for about 500 rounds without cleaning. Those who know, know. Wouldlove to trade for a full size CZ if you have one, can add cash. No other trades considered."

Scope MountThere is nothing wrong with this upper. I’ve fired around 400 rounds through it, mostly Black Hills 77gr, no junk ammo has been through it. It’s very accurate, and very soft shooting. That Wilson Combat barrel was not cheap nor was it easy to find. Zero malfunctions since I had it assembled. The Strike Eagle and mount are included with the upper. The price is so low because I want it gone. I do not need the scope and I do not need another upper laying around. You will love them both, but they’re just taking up space at my house. You will not find a better bargain than this on Armslist. I understand I’m taking a loss, but I need to make space in my gun safe. Contact at (4 zero four)-9 zero nine-7 9 zero 5"

The 16-inch Chrome Moly Vanadium barrel features a 1:8 twist rate to handle a wide range of bullet types. The operation of the M16 bolt carrier group is managed by a mid-length gas system paired with a heavy tungsten buffer, resulting in an exceptionally smooth action. A good shot starts with the trigger, so that’s why the SAINT™ AR-15 features micro-polished and Nickel Boron treated components. While it offers the right pull weight for defensive use, you won’t feel it.Unlike most defensive rifles in its price range, the SAINT™ AR-15 includes top notch furniture designed to improve both shooting experience and operator performance. An all new, exclusive Bravo Company PKMT KeyMod handguard packs heat shields and flexible attachment points into a slim and easy to handle form factor.

I've owned this for about 3 years and it's been taken care of. It'll come with the MBUS rear sight to complement the fixed sight, I've replaced the factory handrail with a Daniel Defense free float rail, and it will also come with the AFG grip. If you'd like I can also throw in either a PMAG or metal mag. I'm open to all trades, but I'm primarily looking for a bolt gun in .308 or 6.5 creed., no shotguns, and please don't waste my time. I'd be willing to trade and add cash on my end for the right trade as well."
