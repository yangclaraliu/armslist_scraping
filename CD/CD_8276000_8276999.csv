You'll be blown away by how thin it is when you get your hands on it.
It comes with Talon grips pre-installed, which make it much easier to securely hold. If you don't like the Talon grips (though you almost certainly will), simply peel them off using a bit of rubbing alcohol. Comes with original box and original magazines (one with a pinky extension, one without). It was my only 380acp gun, so I'd be happy to sell you my remaining ammunition at a discounted rate if you are interested (over 200 rounds of Fiocchi target ammo and about 20 rounds of Hornday Critical Defense defensive ammo).
The gun is in excellent shape and runs perfectly. It has exactly 256 rounds through it. I'm selling because I just don't have as much occasion to carry it as I thought I would when I bought it. When I first bought it, the gun would occasionally not fully chamber the next round. I would never sell a gun without honestly believing it to be in working order, so I sent it into Beretta for service. Whatever they did to it clearly worked - it has been literally flawless since then.
I can meet you most anywhere in Atlanta and the immediate metro area, though the closer to Brookhaven, the better. I respond quickly to messages and I am very flexible on time. I will only sell to you if you can show me your valid Georgia Weapons License."

A simplification of the CZ 75’s hammer ignition method, the Omega’s trigger parts are interlocking in nature, allowing full disassembly and reassembly without the need for gunsmithing experience or tools.The best part of this system is its convertible decocker/safety system. Whether the user wants to carry the pistol cocked and locked like a 1911 or decocked for a double-action first pull of the trigger, a few minutes time allows the swapping of the safety for a decocking lever or vice versa.The P-07 received a facelift in 2014, removing any sharp edges and adding forward cocking serrations and interchangeable backstraps. Metal sights, new trigger and hammer designs and a fiber-reinforced polymer rounded out the updates, resulting in a pistol that’s even more comfortable for all-day carry, increasingly adaptable to user preferences and hardier than ever before."

I purchased this about 8 months ago however I have never taken it to the range. I already own a P220 45 combat so the Legion only gets taken out to get cleaned then back in the safe. Again this has never been fired. At this point its just taking up space and I'm hoping it can go to a home where someone will appreciate it and shoot this wonderful gun. The P220 Legion is an enhanced version of the gun that started it all for modern day SIG. Finished in a proprietary Legion gray coating and featuring custom G-10 grips with a Legion medallion, the P220 Legion is improved in nearly every way. The stainless-steel slide sports SIG SAUER Electro-Optics X-RAY high visibility day/night sights as well as front cocking serrations that provide greater purchase for cycling the action, clearing the firearm or conducting press checks. The P220 in DA/SA includes a reduced and contoured Elite beavertail, which allows for a higher grip and a reduced profile, thus eliminating printing. More aggressive front strap checkering and additional checkering under the trigger guard enhance the grip. An X-Five undercut has been applied to the trigger guard, allowing for a higher grip and greater control. The P220 Legion also features low-profile decocking and slide-catch levers to reduce the risk of snagging. An enhanced polished action with the SRT (Short-Reset Trigger) is augmented with a Grayguns, Inc. designed P-SAIT trigger. In addition, a solid steel guide rod adds weight where it matters most. MSRP is $1,415 so price is some what negotiable depending on payment method"

Many shooters feel this gives a slight speed-to-shoulder advantage. It represents a midpoint in design between ultra-speedy straight grips and extremely stable full pistol grips. If offers excellent control for whatever you are after -- fast-flying waterfowl, upland game or just shooting fun. Matching the rounded pistol grip is the forearm. It is nicely rounded at the fore-end and together, they give the name to this over under gun as ""Lightning Style,"" or in this case, the Citori Lightning model.The Citori Lightning over under shotgun features deeply blued barrels, receiver, top lever and trigger guard -- and gloss finished walnut stock. The trigger is gold in the classic Browning tradition. The checkering is a fine line 24 per inch cut that is true Browning with its sharpness and precision. This look and quality has long been the choice of serious hunters and gun writers. There is simply nothing to criticize. The absence of a recoil pad adds to the graceful look of its profile, and, of course, saves weight. Reduced weight is one of the primary advantages of this model. Plus, the general look of the Citori Lightning has its roots in early Browning Superposed shotguns -- from which this model evolved. It simply looks and shoots fantastically.BEST WAY TO CONTACT FOR SPEEDY REPLY IS BY EMAIL REDACTED"

This comes with the original case and papers, two mags, speed loader, backstraps, and the original barrel.  The current barrel is a Lone Wolf barrel; the previous owner said the few hundred he'd put through all went through the Lone Wolf, which leads me to believe that the original barrel has never been fired from.  I've only put one box through it myself.  The stock sights have also been replaced with Vogel Dynamics World Champion Glock Pistol Sights.  I'd entertain trade offers but it would need to be heavily in my favor.  I'm not trying to be a jerk, but I'm not interested in trading all of this as well as $300 of my hard earned dollars for the G19 you spent too much money upgrading.  Nor do I want a number of garbage firearms.  No shotguns, no black powder, no revolvers, no .40.  If it's a straight-up purchase, cash only.  I will only meet in a public location of my choosing on my end of town.  I will not travel.  CHL holders to the front of the line.  I will ask to see your Ohio Drivers License at the time of sale.Thanks for looking."

The LightTuck also has a velcro attachment point for the foam wedge which I will include. The foam wedge helps tuck the grip into your torso to reduce printing when carrying in the appendix position. However, the wedge can be removed from the velcro attachment. The case and the accessories that came with the case are also included, but I removed the foam from the case. I  also am including the Pachmyr baseplate grips, which helps you get a way better grip on the gun.

I'm selling this whole package because I want to move to a DA/SA hammer fired system, so the only thing I would trade all of this for is a maybe a Beretta PX4 compact or a CZ P-01/PCR in 9 mm.
