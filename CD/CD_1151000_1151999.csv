It comes with 3 17 round magazines and 3 20 round magazines and also a flush fitting 13 round magazine for carry purposes if needed be. Also has the beretta holster that was made for the gun along with original box ext, and a mag pouch. I have never carried this gun nor slipped it in and out of the holster 1000 times, just once it fit and got put away. I buy holsters for all my guns even the ones ill never carry. To me it a necessity not an accessory. like a case for a phone.

 3- 20 round OEM beretta magazines. Never used never even loaded.

 Now why am I selling it?? Even tho it impressed the fuck out of me with the accuracy and no malfunctions, I still am old school and prefer an all metal gun. I Also own the beretta PX4 storm super duty 45, and that is the only plastic gun I will own from here on out. I love it and highly recommend it!! 

 I would like to sell it all together, but if it is the Hi-cap magazines you want make an offer for all of them. I will not sell and ship them one at a time. Yes the mag pouch will come with it. the 13 round will stay with the gun. 
 as for the whole package Make an offer and be realistic. would consider some trades, but not many. I just about have every gun I want.

Description

M952V
The M952V Millennium® Universal WeaponLight attaches by means of an integral Swing-Lever™ rail clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. It utilizes one sealed LED unit to produce both brilliant white light and invisible infrared radiation for use with night vision devices. The white beam is configured for close- to medium-range applications. Changing back and forth from white output to infrared output is accomplished by a push/twist action on the M952V head, which self-locks into the selected output mode. The tailcap switch assembly features a momentary/constant-on pushbutton switch and a momentary-on tape switch (7-inch cable) that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. Available in Black and Desert Sand.

Have you thought about backup power in case of an emergency?  I have a heavy duty MEP-016D Yanmar powered diesel generator that is made for the US military.  You can see more details here:  http://yakima.craigslist.org/tls/REDACTED.html  I'm not trying to promote the sale, but rather I am posting her to see if someone is interested in making a trade.  I am only posting that link because it has pictures and detailed information on the generator.  If you are looking for a generator, then diesel is highly recommended because diesel powered generators are much more fuel efficient, heavier duty, and diesel fuel will store for years safely.  The junk gasoline (with alcohol) these days will sometimes break down and gum up your fuel system within 6 months.  Diesel is the way to go for a dependable generator."

The rifle operates great and the scope is zeroed in at 25-300 meters. The only issue with this rifle is the rear sight mount. It was welded on crooked and the rear sight has to be moved all the way to the right to adjust the windage. That is the reason for the installation of the Barska 4-16 power (green) lit retical optic. The rear sight and all of the parts were removed to mount the optic low. I will only meet in the local area and will not seperatly sell the magazines from the rifle.

UPDATE: I got slammed with emails for this. I am not trying to be a jerk however, Dont insult me with petty offers, demanding to meet and buy it from me right now, accuse me of not going to sell or trade it, etc. I have multiple guns, a good bank account and yes I am interested and will sell/trade for the right item. I am sorry if I havent been able to respond to eveyone as I stated I was slammed with emails all day. I tried to respond and keep them all straight however I am human. If you cant be civilized, dont respond. I am pondering a few offers on the table now and last resort will accept cash. Until then be respectful or you will get no response. Thank you"

SN#PT2 represents the absolute pinnacle of auto-loading firearms design and manufacturing exactness. SN2 performs at sub 1/2 MOA accuracy, with a statistical average of .3 MOA using match factory ammo. The FD308 boasts a much higher level quality design and manufacturing processes than all competitors including LWRC, Larue, POF, LMT, GAP, etc...

FD308 Features:

    308 Win, 17"" match chambered, 416 stainless barrel, lapped & polished bore, utilizing a high quality barrel by Krieger
    Unconstrained infinitely variable tuned piston system: NP3-Plus coated, all high-temp stainless components. Quickly breaks down for cleaning and inspection.
    Non-reciprocating side charging handle
    Meticulously machined matching lower receiver, upper receiver, and rail (all serialized): exclusive hand-forged 7075-T6 aluminum, hard anodized
    9.4 lbs with H4 heavy buffer, match contoured stainless barrel, and UBR stock; can be reduced to 8.4lbs with lightweight accessories
    Matched-pair bolt and extension: 9310 vacuum melted spacecraft grade alloy steel, case hardened, shot-peened, hand-polished, precision ground, lapped, and NP3-Plus coated
    Magpul 20-round P-mag; fits and feeds flawlessly
    Lifetime Transferable Warranty
    20 minute top rail cant, for added scope range
    Bolt-on barrel/rail configuration for quick and repeatable barrel swaps and inspection; maintains higher rigidity than barrel-nut designs, and consolidates the absolute lowest and most compact rail-height available to any piston system.

Other ""quick-change"" barrel systems maintain little to no axial force against the upper receiver (LMT). Axial barrel retaining force is one of the most significant structural contributors to accuracy and consistency of AR style rifles.

Richard Heinie is one of the most respected names in the 1911 community. His 1911s are cherished by collectors around the world. Don't look for one in the aftermarket arena because those who have them, keep them. He has enough customer orders left to keep him busy well into his mid-70s. What that translates to is that shooters who wanted a Heinie 1911 had no chance to get one, but all of that has changed.

Nighthawk had an occasion to meet Richard a couple of years ago at an off site event, and it happened that we had some of our 1911s there for test fire. After having had some time to critique our work, Richard approached us about building some of his models under his supervision. Needless to say, we jumped at the chance to carry on the legacy of his fine guns.

Recently Richard introduced a new 9mm model, known as the Lady Hawk, aimed at shooters that need a much thinner grip, so you can still ""buy the wife a gun"" and you can use it as well.

As evidenced in the following pictures, Richard is very involved in the building process of the guns that bear his name. He is a familiar sight in our booth at the SHOT Show, so if you would like to meet him in person, stop by our booth and we will be happy to introduce you. Richard is also well known for his innovative design work on the Heinie Slant-Pro Straight Eight Sights Series. We offer his sights on any of our guns at no additional charge.The latter giving you a choice of 4.25"" or 5"". Each one is built to Richard's exact specifications, and with the same attention to detail that his 1911s are famous for.

Heinie 10mm 6-inch Long Slide Ever since the introduction of the 10mm, handgun enthusiasts all over the country have developed a passion for it. When you look at the velocity and energy developed using full power 10mm loads they approach the 41 Magnum. Many people want this type of performance, but they want it in a platform that is a pleasure to carry as well. No wheel gun rides on your hip that the venerable 1911 does.

The Long Slide allows you to maximize the use of Nighthawk Custom’s fully adjustable rear sight. Our rear sights come standard with a green tritium front sight, and a yellow two-dot rear, and are adjustable for windage and elevation. The edges of the rear sight are tapered to keep from snagging on your gear, so they are a perfect compliment to this pistol.

Altogether the Heinie Long Slide is an excellent pistol when you need magnum- type velocity out of the venerable 1911. Add to that all of the craftsmanship and features that go into each one of our handguns and you have a winning combination.

Features of the 10mm Long Slide:
Match Grade full gunsmith-fit 6-inch barrel
Forged Frame and Slide
Tactical Magazine Release for quick magazine charges
25 lpi checkering on the front strap and mainspring housing
Ball radius cut on the slide
Complete Frame and Slide Preparation removing every sharp edge for comfortable carry

I also shoot every gun either before I post the add or before I ship to make sure there are no problems with ammo feeding or any other problem unless the caliber is rare in which case I may not have the ammo needed to fire it."

FRANKFORT, KY. — The Kentucky Senate approved a bill Monday 34-3 to reject any future gun control rules or laws by the federal government.

Supporters said Berea Republican Jared Carpenter’s Senate Bill 129 will prevent the federal government from violating Second Amendment gun rights, but opponents said the bill is unconstitutional.

The bill would nullify any future federal measure from being enforced in Kentucky that would restrict ownership or registration of certain firearms, magazines or other firearms accessories.
“People are alarmed, and rightfully so,” Carpenter said of talks at the federal level in the wake of the school shooting last year in Connecticut. “... If the administration tries to undermine the constitution in any way, our citizens will be protected.”

The ‘no’ votes came from three Democratic attorneys — Kathy Stein of Lexington and Louisvillians Morgan McGarvey and Gerald Neal.

McGarvey suggested that the Senate pass a resolution rather than a bill and said the legislation harkened back to 1798 when the state legislature said the federal Alien and Sedition Acts were unconstitutional. Similarly, he said lawmakers were passing a bill they know to be unconstitutional.

“We did not swear to uphold only parts (of the Constitution) with which we agree,” he said. “... It’s easy for us to do what’s easy. We need to do what’s right.”

“Rise above the temptation to pander to those who believe that something is happening in this nation that is not happening,” Stein said. “No one is coming to get your guns in this state.”

“I’m going to vote no because I respect the constitution,” Neal said.
Sen. Julian Carroll, the Frankfort Democrat, attorney and former governor, voted for the bill despite believing it’s unconstitutional — saying he didn’t want anyone to question his support for the Second Amendment.

Sen. Ray Jones, D-Pikeville and an attorney, supported the bill, saying that the government should work to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill but said that’s not what’s being discussed in gun-control talks at the federal level.

The Senate also passed Hazard Republican Brandon Smith’s SB 150, which would change the requirements for concealed carry gun permits.

The bill, which passed 36-1 with only Neal opposing, reduces the time for the Kentucky State Police to review applications from 90 to 60 days and removes a six-month residency requirement, while still requiring an applicant to be a resident."

The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
FACTS:
You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
The permit is valid for 5 years
We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

The Utah Non-Resident Concealed Weapons Permit allows you to carry in 36 states in conjunction with your South Carolina Permit!! It is the best way to maximize your concealed carry abilities and travel anywhere south of Maryland and east of Colorado without restriction! This permit in conjuction with your South Carolina CWP allows you to carry you weapon concealed in Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama and Pennslyvania, which you South Carolina permit alone does not allow.
FACTS:
You DO NOT have to be a resident of Utah to get the permit
We teach these classes in the Myrtle Beach area
The class is 4 hours long and requires no shooting and no test
The permit is valid for 5 years
We do the fingerprinting and required passport photo in the class so you don't have to go get it done at extra expense!!
Since there is no shooting, we can teach the class anywhere! Call us and we'll get a group together in your area.
Utah does not reciprocate with South Carolina so you still need to get your South Carolina Permit to carry in SC.

The cost of the class is $100 and includes your fingerprinting, passport photograph required by the State of Utah, the class and certification stamp. An additional $51 application fee is required to be sent with the packet to the State of Utah either by credit card or check (yes they accept personal checks).

We will cover multiple scenarios that could occur in your everyday life and how to appropriately respond (an intruder in your home, carjacking in a parking lot, purse snatching, assaults, targets advancing on you, moving targets, etc).  These scenarios will be in a live fire environment where you will be improving your skills and techniques involved in drawing your concealed weapon and engaging a target.  This is a vital aspect of carrying concealed that is rarely addressed, and without practice or knowing how to respond, the delay in decision making can mean the difference between success or failure.  You will be enhancing your skills in drawing from concealment, point shooting, tactical positioning, firing while moving, firing from a vehicle, flash sight picture, shooting from cover, and moving after shooting.  
The purpose of this class is to build your skills as a Concealed Weapons permit holder and practicing the skills needed to use your gun in a defensive confrontation.  Additionally, we will cover aspects of carrying concealed that are not discussed in the basic CWP class such as; identifying potentially dangerous persons/situations, awareness, how to react in adverse situations, and practical exercises related to everyday situations. Being prepared and ready for a confrontation is the first step to winning.  Through practical experience on the range, skill building, and being prepared you will lessen the probability of becoming the target of criminals.     
A large portion of the course will be on the range. At least 200-300 rounds will be fired. You are encouraged to bring the firearm you carry to the class along with your concealed carry holster.  This will allow you to make better decisions on how to carry your handgun based on your physical size and method of carry."

The studded leather greaves are in beautiful condition and are 17"" tall, measure from the top of your foot to the tip of your knee while you're sitting to see if you are the same size, last bot not least is pretty much a one size fits all chain maille  coif, i am wearing a thick hooded sweatshirt under it in the picture, i recomend doing the same, there is some surface rust on the mail in a few streaks but nothing serious that cant be buffed out, but i also think it adds charater, its not the riveted kind so you wont be doing and serious sword fighting iwth it anyway,i also have a chain mail hauberk of larger gauge than the coif, it is not riveted either, i believe i oiled it a bit before putting it in the attic, but there will probably be a bit of surface rust on it too but nothing serious, , i also have a set of paldrons/vambraces that are linked togther with a metal armor elbow peice, i had to cut the sleeves short on the hauberk to make sure you could wear it all together with full movemeent.  altogether including the items nto pictured, it is pretty much a suit of armor, the hauberk reaches to the leg armor so as long some padding is worn under the armor it would easily repel some animal/zombie attacks or whatever people would be worried enough about to wear this stuff, i bought this armor 6 years ago and probably used it more for halloween than anything else . the hauberk weighs upwards of 30lbs  and when the full set is worn it is quite intimidating and still have a wide range of movement. hopefully i can edit this posting later today when i dig the rest of the set out of the attic but for now, what is in the pictures is what i have available armor wise."

Comes with a TRUGLO scope, two magazines - 30 & 5. Also comes with a carrying strap and a box that was custom made from the previous owner (it is very heavy with everything stored in it).

Less than 2000 manufacturered 1947-1955.
For sale is a fully functional Hotchkiss 9mm Semi Automatic submachine made in France in 1950. From the research I done it appears that less than 2000 of these guns were produced. A small number of these entered the United States and were converted to semi-automatic. I have fired about 100 rounds through the rifle and it fired great and was quite accurate. This gun is in excellent condition. If further pictures are desired please email me.
 I am asking $4900 OBO, it interested you can text or call me on REDACTED 
I will allow you to test fire the gun for $100 plus ammo

Hotchkiss ""type Universal"" submachine gun is one of most unusual weapons that appeared during early post-WW2 period. It was announced by once famous French arms-making company Societe des Armes a Feu Portatives Hotchkiss et Cie in 1949, and was produced until about 1952. The idea behind this gun was to made it as compact as possible when carrying or storing; the intended market for such weapon could be either paratroopers or people engaged in all sorts of clandestine operations. As a result of development, the ""type Universal"" submachine gun was able to be folded into a rather small package, only 440mm long when completely ""collapsed"". On the minus side, resulting weapon was overly complicated and expensive to make. Small number of Hotchkiss ""Universal"" submachine guns saw action during earlier stages of war in the Indochina; few were purchased by Venezuela during early 1950s,

Uses a simple blowback action. It fires from open bolt, and capable of selective fire (fire mode selector is made in the form of cross-bolt button above pistol grip). The cocking handle has a sliding dustcover on its slot, and does not move when gun is fired. The sights consist of hooded front and flip-type aperture rear, marked for 50 and 100 meters.
 The buttstock and pistol grip are made from sheet steel. When gun need to be collapsed, the pistol grip is pivoted forward to cover trigger guard, and magazine housing is folded forward to lie below the barrel. The buttstock then folds down and forward, and locks to the outer walls of magazine housing. If gun has to be further collapsed, operator shall depress a special latch that is located at the front of receiver, below the barrel. barrel then can be pushed backwards and into the receiver."

It is the hard to get in this particular setup, green fiber optic and green tritium with green chevron Bullet drop compensator reticle.

This is an assault weapons ban rifle that can currently only receive single stack AK mags. It can readily be converted to accept 30 round double stack mags by a gunsmith or yourself. I've had a quote from a gunsmith for $75. All that needs to happen is to mill out the mag well. Here's a video on the conversion:

995,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1151995,For Sale:   M1 Carbine,"san Francisco, San Francisco, California","$ 2,000","Listed On: Wednesday, February 27, 2013",Handguns,Remington,no type,no type,no type,"I have my dads 45, 38, and M1 carbine. I have his discharge papers showing the 45 and 38 checked out to him. The 45 and M1 carbine come with extra stuff. The 38 is a S&W made for the government in October of 1943. I am selling all three for $2000, no trades.
The 45 is a Remington Rand. According to the serial no 1016319 and what I have been told it is a sand cast model. All the items that are in the picture with it were brought home at the same time except for the pair of grips on it,camo holster and the extended clip. The US holster is the one my Dad got with the gun. The rest was all my Dads personal gear issue to him. The three clips are the original clips that came with the gun.
The S&W 38 serial no is V424979 and according to that it was shipped in October of 1943. Guns without a top strap marking usually shipped per contracts with the Defense Supplies Corporation or the U.S. Maritime Commission. This would make sense as my Dad picked up the Mine Sweeper from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard Washington around Christmas 1943. I know this because he shipped out on the Mine Sweeper right after he married my Mom in Puget Sound. He only had a week before he shipped out.
The M1 Carbine was issue to him at the same time. It is an Inland Division of General Motors serial no 46458. The receiver was made somewhere between October, 1941 - April, 1942. The barrel is marked 5-43. The carbine was usually assembled and tested within two or three months after the barrel date. This is a very early one and is quite rare in this shape.
Do your homework on these guns. You will see that I am selling them below market value. Just the carbine alone is worth around $2000 in the condition it’s in. Go here to check: http://www.scott-duff.com click on M1 Carbine at the bottom of the page or anyone of the many internet listings."
