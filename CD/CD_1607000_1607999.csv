I'll just write out the list. I wouldn't mind some trades if anyone would be willing to trade for 6.5 grendel rounds or brass, or 223/556. I also have some primers I would be willing to trade for powder. 

1.) Hornady 50AE 300gr XTP HP listing them at the MSRP from Hornadys site at $37.50 per box of 20. I have 2 boxes and for some reason one extra round out of the box. I also have two 7 round IMI magazines for sale with it they are $40.00 they are used and have normal wear. Only fired the pistol about 3 times before I sold it, and this was left in the safe which is temp and humidity controlled. 

2.) Norinco grey box 7.62x39. This stuff is hard to come by. It is steel cased and non corrosive primer 20 per box. I know this seems mean, but the norinco is going at a premium and isn't easy to find. I will sell for $18 per box. 

3.) Cor-Bon DPX Ammunition 45 ACP +P 185 Grain Barnes XPB Hollow Point Lead-Free Box of 20 (the box is missing, so $30.00 on these) 

4.) somehow I came across 35 tulammmo 380 auto. These are steel cased and probably not even worth shipping. If anyone wants them and is close by just let me know. 

5.) 11 standard 1911 colt magazines. There are the standard 7 round mags all steel. Make an offer 

6.) 1 Nighthawk custom 1911 8 round magazine. Incredibly smooth and easy to load. Make an offer 

7.) 1 15 round extended 1911 magazine. Not double stack just twice the length of a standard 1911 mag. Make an offer 

8. ) Pre tumbled brass 

125 45 ACP mixed company PMC, CCI, Hornady, and RP 

21 Speer Nickel coated 50AE 

9 Winchester 308 Nickel coated 
55 mixed company 308 PMC, CBC, and FC 
9 Nato stamped 7.62x51 (berdan primed) 
20 30-06 (18RP and 2 FC) 

186 303 English to include (91 RP, 10 PPU, 19 WW Super, and 66 Frontier) 

161 40 S&W mixed company (PMC, Hornady, and RP) 


I do have primers that I may be willing to part with, but i'm pretty sure it is a huge pain to ship them. I have 1500 CCI small pistol and 1000 CCI small pistol magnum. 

Just send me a message as far as brass goes for how much you would want and what you're offering.

Light weight, short recoil, locked breech, May be fired in three modes: single-action, double-action and """"Fast Action"""". Comes with 1 12 rd. and 1 10 rd. magazine, some ammo. Very affordable for home defense or glove box ! Barrel: 4.1"""", Overall length: 7.5"""". Weight: 28.2 ozs."

Asking price for the whole package is $1,000 cash OBO (around $1,300 invested)

I am the guns first and only owner. Bought the gun in mid 2012. Ive shot this gun in about 7 or 8 matches since Dec. The gun has around 2,685 rounds put thru it give or take 25 or so.
Mitch Gibson put on the AEK and slightly polished some parts. The only thing missing from the AEK is the aftermarket trigger return spring. The stock one is in there now along with the rest of the kit. The trigger pull is smooth and crsip with a great reset. Probably pulling around 4lbs with the stock TRS in there. Stick the APEX TRS in there and you can pull it down to a sub 3lbs pull.
The gun has run flawlessly for me, I can remember just 2 FTE's due to my limp wristing of the gun thru a port. Iv'e dry fired the gun almost exclusively with snap caps so i wouldnt damage the striker.
Ive been using this gun to run in USPSA Limited Minor recently. The only thing to make it legal for production would be to take off the magwell and take off the TTI's from the mags.

I am looking for a local FTF deal.
If you wish to see more pictures please do not hesitate to ask.
I have written up a ""Gun Bill of Sale"" that i would have you fill out and sign. I would also need a copy of your drivers license.

This came off a 7x57 mm gun.  Normal nicks and small dings from a wartime gun of this age, but nothing that affects the utility of the stock.  Original finish with no sanding, hairline crack in the top handguard which has been glued, overall good condition. There are no other cracks or splits.  As best as I can tell thru 85 years of military finish, the stock is walnut, but I’m having to guess. The stock has all the metal hardware that these stocks are issued with, with the exception of the cleaning rod, and as far as I can tell, it’s original. The metal parts are not rusty, and many retain their bluing.  THIS IS FOR THE STOCK ONLY - NOT THE COMPLETE GUN.  West Mobile Area.  Available for pickup, shipping would be $15 via UPS 5 Day Ground.  Local payment by cash only, out of area payment by US Postal Money Order Only.  Other photos available by request.

The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target. This innovative design also allows for a full length barrel, which means no loss of down range ballistic accuracy. Near and far range accuracy is enhanced by the minimized recoil provided by a non-lubricated long stroke gas piston system. With the exception of a hand-specific locking bolt, the rifle is completely ambidextrous allowing for easy left-hand conversion of the operating handle, ejection port, fire-control safety, sling swivel receptacles and fore-mounted accessory Picatinny rail. The TAVOR is supplied with IDF-tested and approved magazines but you can also use your own AR-15/M16 style magazines"

This is an almost new Daniel Defense M4, the version 2 model with the 7"" rail, carbine-length gas system with triangle front gas block/sight. Barrel is 16"" chrome-lined 1:7 twist. Check their website for full details. New MSRP on this model is $1759 as listed on their website. It is completely stock except for replacing the stock pistol grip with an ergo grip. Comes with original DD A2 vertical grip and pmag. I will include 2 additional windowed 30rd pmags and 3 troy battle-mags and a couple of .223 snap-caps. This gun has only 418 rounds fired through it with no FTF or FTE's.  On top of the rifle and mags, you will get 1100+ rounds of all brass-cased .223 factory manufactured ammunition. Most of it is PMC and Aguilla with a little bit of Federal (all 55gr plinking stuff) with a .50cal ammo can. Price for all of this is $2000 firm. I can also throw in an aim point comp ML3 2MOA for an additional $400 (shown in photo). It has only been used about as much as the rifle and would come with a cheap cantilever mount to get you started but it is a terrible mount and would need to be replaced with something nicer like a LaRue or GG&G or the like. Please do not ask about buying just the ammunition as I will not sell it without the rifle.

I'm guessing this rifle has been fired very few times and carried quite carefully. Bluing is just about immaculate with a very uniform deep tone. You can see in the pics that there is just a bit of bluing wear at the very end of the barrel. Markings on the driver's side of the barrel suggest that it was manufactured in March of 1986... which is the first year that Remington offered the 700 as a lightweight mountain rifle. The jeweled bolt has a small corrosion mark on it... but it looks as it could be easily worked out. Sling studs and swivels that you see in the pics are included.

Go to www.slickguns.com and you'll see plenty of AR's (reputable builders) in stock at various online stores.  You can even get lowers for $99 shipped plus all the other parts you need to build a good AR for under $1000.  Stock is coming back in and prices are a bit higher, but not double.  

In addition, I'm a little surprised by all the BRAND NEW NEVER FIRED AR's listed for sale here.  I can understand if you bought it and then had something come up where you needed the money, but it seems to be many of the ones listed were bought in order to resale for a profit.  I think one seller has about 10-15 Bushmaster's for sale and he's not a dealer.  Hmmmmm.

There are some great custom AR builds listed on here for good prices, so not everyone is trying to screw the buyers.  Do your research before you jump on what seems to be a good deal only to find out later the seller bought the AR a few weeks ago for half what you paid him/her for it.  

Good luck to all.  I'm sure this will be flagged and removed, but I had to post it anyway."

The Model 597 is easily the most technologically advanced autoloading rimfire rifle on the market today.  The difference starts with our proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-grade steel guide rails for silky-smooth functioning, fast feeding reliability, and perfect bolt alignment on lock-up for excellent out-of-the-box accuracy.

To assure reliable, long-life accuracy, we’ve also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp.  The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597 all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon® plating for a smooth, dependable operation and ultra-crisp trigger pull (that stays that way).  Completing the breakthrough design is an innovative last-shot bolt “hold open” feature and our patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack detachable 10-round box magazine.

The Model 597 OD Green Synthetic Scope Combo has a 20"" carbon-steel barrel furnished clean with no sights set in a rugged olive drab green synthetic stock with a beaver tail fore-end.  The matching alloy receiver is grooved for standard rimfire mounts and drilled and tapped for the Model 597 Weaver-style one-piece base.  A 3-9x32mm scope with rings is included."

I am selling this bike for several reasons - the group I used to ride with have all quit riding, I have a street/trail I run all the time now, and I have difficulty kicking it over. Bike is too high for me to get a solid kick. The high compression milled head makes the bike significantly harder to kick over. But the bike handled so well that I refused to put lowering links on it. It is a very fun bike to ride though.

I have a nice T.A.C. Revolver made in Spain around the first of the 20th century from what info I can find on it.  It has nickel finish, probably about 75-80% there, with some wear from the 100 or so years of use.  It locks up tight and shoots perfectly.  I honestly (and embarrassingly) thought this was an actual S&W - it's that good a copy.  It was also manufactured to standards comparably to contemporary Colt and Smiths in my opinion.  The fit and finish is very good.  It has the following stamped one the 6"" barrel:  ""FOR 38 SPECIAL AND U.S. SERVICE CTG"" and ""BEST AMERICAN CARTRIDGES ARE THOSE THAT FIT BEST THE T.A.C.
