Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM™) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired. These do not include bolt carrier groups, charging handles or handguards.

As a note:  BCM™ barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly.  Prior to shipping, all BCM™ upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy.  As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistant with these quality control procedures.

Cold Hammer Forged Barrels
This process of manufacturing barrels has been used for European small arms for generations, and it is gaining popularity in the United States because of the increased barrel life and outstanding accuracy of a hammer forged barrel. The BCM BFH™ series of barrels are made right here in the USA!  (Just like all the BCM products.)

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver
In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels.

T-Marked Upper Receiver
The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission.

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate
The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics.

Mil-Spec Barrel Steel (Certified Mil-B-11595E)
BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E, and is independently certified. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. This Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber
One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning.

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish
Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base.

5.56 NATO Chambers
The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo.

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases
Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets.

Government Barrel Profiles
Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems.

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels
Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking."

313,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1565313,For Trade:  Pistol reloading powder / propellent; 9mm .40 ammo or components; 7.62 x 39 ammo,"Portland area; down to Grants Pass 5/4-5/5/13, Oregon, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Saturday, May 4, 2013",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"What I am needing mostly is smokeless powder to reload 9mm and .40 S&W. I'm also keeping my eyes open for FAIR deals on ammo for those calibers as well as 7.62X39 to a lesser extent (can't ever have too much!). I'm not in a hurry so I can afford to wait and skip the price gouging that is so rampant right now. 

In addition to the powder and ammo I also am interested in brass and bullets for the pistol calibers, for the right price.

I would prefer to trade but cash either way would also be considered--I don't have a lot of cash right now...but who does, right? (For the record I for the most part really would like get some powder and/or reloading components, so the ammo is only if part of the deal or a really good price.)

So my location is like this: I live in the Portland area, but we are driving down this afternoon (Saturday 5/4) to Grants Pass and then back up to Portland tomorrow (Sunday 5/5) afternoon/evening. If you are able to meet anywhere between here and there along I-5 during those times we can work out somewhere to meet. RESPOND QUICKLY BECAUSE WE LEAVE TOWN AT 2 P.M. TODAY

Let's help one another out and not use these times as an opportunity to make a quick buck or two with ridiculous prices. Our community is better than that, and we need each other right now more than ever."

Then I added a mil issued surefire tactical light with IR filter, great for keeping the lense safe
I dropped in a custom single stage 4lb trigger that is buttery smooth almost feels like 2 stage when you get used to it as its such a predictable break this leads to insane accuracy and great handling.

I'm also keeping my eyes open for FAIR deals on ammo for those calibers as well as 7.62X39 to a lesser extent (can't ever have too much!). I'm not in a hurry so I can afford to wait and skip the price gouging that is so rampant right now. 

In addition to the powder and ammo I also am interested in brass and bullets for the pistol calibers, for the right price.

I would prefer to trade but cash either way would also be considered--I don't have a lot of cash right now...but who does, right? (For the record I for the most part really would like get some powder and/or reloading components, so the ammo is only if part of the deal or a really good price.)

So my location is like this: I live in the Portland area, but we are driving down this afternoon (Saturday 5/4) to Grants Pass and then back up to Portland tomorrow (Sunday 5/5) afternoon/evening. If you are able to meet anywhere between here and there along I-5 during those times we can work out somewhere to meet. RESPOND QUICKLY BECAUSE WE LEAVE TOWN AT 2 P.M. TODAY

Let's help one another out and not use these times as an opportunity to make a quick buck or two with ridiculous prices. Our community is better than that, and we need each other right now more than ever."

OK, I have been trying to make trades for ammo for the last 6 months or so and it just never seems to pan out.  I have a sh*t load of ammo I bought 10+ years ago and I want to get rid of some of it to buy a few new guns.  It is also against my morals to sell it at the retard prices I see on here.  So here is the deal.  I am trying to sell this as one lot.  If split up I need it to be in large amounts, no haggling, no BS.  This is all good stuff that I was smart about when I bought it back in the day.  Like I said I m not going to split it up into 50 lots and nickel and dime people like I see on here.  Only a fool pays $1 a round for military rifle ammo...  

I need someone with set of nuts and some cash to take this lot.  Only trade would be a nice AR without a bunch of gay-ass video game looking sh*t attached to it + cash.

email link or text 425-Seven-Five-Three-9613

So here's what I got:

150 round can of Talon 50 BMG (steel core AP, not the lead core ball)

780 round can 7.62 x 54 Rimmed (I opened the crate and can to be sure it is OK) 

1400 rounds 8mm Mauser, I have more if needed (70 round bandoliers, 1940's Turkish) 

6 Bricks .22 (different ones, some 500 round, some 525s)

1000 round case Wolf 7.62 x 39mm (Hollow Point)

200 rounds 308 NATO ball ammo, newer, I think maybe South African

Do the math, I am asking almost 1/2 of the price this stuff goes for right now.  The BMG ammo runs $600 by itself, if you can find it...

This barrel is made for Palmetto State Armory by FN, using their proprietary blend of hammer forged chrome molly vanadium that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work-hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a carbine gas system.   Barrel has an A2 style profile, is Mil-spec phosphate coated, and is Mp and HP tested.

The circumference of the SF receiver is reduced at the ""backstrap"", which will appeal to shooters and offer increased comfort and control to all. The GLOCK 30 in the legendary .45 caliber offers excellent precision paired with the ballistic quality of a genuine big-bore caliber. The smooth design and the simple operation of the GLOCK pistol will allow for quick drawing of the pistol from a holster. Because of these advantages and especially because of its compact dimensions, the GLOCK 30 is the first choice of plainclothes officers and protection personnel.

Construction

    Glock became famous for creating the ""poly gun,"" a combination of polymer and steel construction that results in a much lighter handgun; it also works more smoothly under difficult conditions. The 30SF follows in this tradition, weighing less than 24 ounces. This is a significant weapon because, unlike a 9mm weapon, it is difficult to make a small gun that handles .45 caliber ammo and retains its accuracy. Glock has done so.

Safety

    The 30SF employs Glock's patented ""Safe Action"" trigger system. Safe Action is an automatic safety that prevents the gun from firing if dropped. Pulling the trigger causes Safe Action to disengage so the gun can be fired normally, but on release Safe Action automatically re-engages to prevent accidental discharge. Despite this additional mechanism inside the gun, the 30SF retains a standard 5.5-pound trigger pull weight, so it is no burden to use."

Still out performs all newer guns in it's class in my opinion. The rifle is in great shape. It has seen it's share of hunting trips but the wood is not all banged up, and there is absolutely no rust. A few nicks in the finish here and there but it's clean as a whistle. The only issue with it is one of the scope mounting screws is stripped out in the gun. I could have gotten fixed at the local gunsmith for 10 bucks but I haven't gotten around to it yet. The price is $330 firm, when you see this gun you will agree that that is a fair price and the gun is most definitely worth every penny. These rifles sell for $400-$450 new, but anyone who has owned a few of these knows that Marlin just doesn't make them like they used to. This 1976 will out perform any modern 336 guaranteed. 864-FIVE-OH-SIX-6440"

Also, just because someone is asking $1200 or so for a gun doesn't mean that's what they are going to get for it.  Realistically, someone asking $1200 is probably going to take $900-$1000 or so for the gun, which is competitive with with most of the cabelas type store and still beats most local gun shops (my local shop still charging over $1000 for complete uppers).  Also, a lot of the guns for sale on here that I have noticed come with a lot of extras that you won't get from any store, like multiple mags (which probably will be banned eventually), ammo, optics/sights and other accessories.  You are also paying a llittle more to not have uncle Sam involved in your gun sale which many people in this day in age do not want to have their names go on lists (which personally I think is a non-issue but many don't).

Bottom line: the market is what it is.  No sense in taking it personally.  After all, hell, tomorrow there could be another school shooting and then the threat of legislation will be much worse than ever before.  You as the consumer hold all the cards, buy or don't, it's up to you.  Wheel and deal and be willing to travel and shop around till you find a deal your comfortable with or wait months for your beloved cabelas to finally get a semi-steady stock of new ARs in.  Whining and crying on arms list doesn't help your cause one iota though, makes me wanna charge even more for the high quality ARs I have been building because unlike most consumers on here,  I actually bought my parts and accessories BEFORE it was a popular idea.  Btw, do you think stores like cabelas aren't making the same mark up?  Yeah, they might only charge $800-$1000 for a gun but I guarantee  you that they are on at least a 80% or more mark up over what they actually paid for the gun.  So it's ok for them to take you for 80+% but it's totally unethical for sellers on here to try to break even or make 10ish%?

Don't be mad, it is what it is.  Feel free to contact me if you want a fair deal on a nice AR-15 that you can buy right now, with cash in hand and no uncle Sam to mitigate your unalienable constitutional right to own one without the threat of one day having it confiscated."

These feature the Bullet Drop Compensation reticle, which helps you with hold-over out to 500-600 yards (depending on caliber).  Using the Nikon Spot On program (http://spoton.nikonsportoptics.com/spoton/) you can match your caliber and cartridge to the scope, which then tells you exactly which circle on the reticle to use at which range.

Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope w/ Burris 10x32mm Landmark Binoculars gives you a full spot-and-shoot package! This value package from Burris includes the Burris 3x-9x 40mm Fullfield-II Riflescope and the Burris Landmark 10x32mm Binoculars.

The Burris Fullfield II Rifle Scope has a one-piece main tube and eyepiece, Burris envied steel-on-steel adjustment system, and HiLume multi-coatings on every single air to glass lens surface. The Burris FullField-II Scope is even more forgiving for eye position, is a little shorter, and a good bit lighter. The magnification ring and eyepiece have been made into one solid unit requiring only two seals rather than three. To change magnification, simply turn the entire eyepiece. Burris Fullfield 2 Scope eliminated most of the potential leak paths in the eyepiece/power ring area and sealed the remainder with special quad seals instead of O-rings. The adjustment system has been moved to improve mounting options and the European-style adjustable eyepiece requires no locking mechanism. The Ballistic Plex reticle has a lower vertical crosshair with small ballistic lines that automatically compensate for bullet drop from 100 to 500 yards for many common cartridges. The Burris Fullfield-2 Riflescope is lighter, better sealed, and has a relocated adjustment system compared to the original Burris Fullfield.

The Burris Landmark Binoculars combine light weight, fully coated lenses and water resistant, fogproof construction. These Burris Binoculars also include a tough rubber armor coating and twist-up eyecups. Top all this off with a neck strap, carrying case, a full year warranty and a very affordable price and you have yourself a synonym for optical value.

Features of Burris 3-9x40mm Fullfield II Rifle Scope:

Waterproof: All Burris optics are proven to be absolutely waterproof. Each scope is submerged in water with a temperature of 50° C. The extremely hot water transfers its heat to the scope and the internal nitrogen expends 100% testing assures quality. Each scope is filled and purged at least 24 times with high quality, laboratory grade dry nitrogen. Each nitrogen cycle absorbs airborne and residual surface moisture that is evacuated from the scope. Burris uses specially made quad seals to provide double insurance against leakage.
Fog proof: The nitrogen contained in the scope is of high quality (ultra dry, laboratory grade nitrogen), ultra pure and ultra clean. To be sure that all airborne moisture and surfaces moisture within a scope is evacuated, testing consists of 24 cycles of pressurizing the scope and then subjecting it to a vacuum. The tests are both cost & time intensive.
Shock proof: Burris scopes are subjected to extreme recoil tests. An impact machine is used to measure and duplicate the recoil pulse acceleration and duration. This machine has been calibrated and verified by an independent laboratory to replicate the wave frequencies and shock impulses that a scope is subjected to.
Ballistic Plex reticle - with a basic crosshair reticle, calculating hold-over is a mix of art, science and just plain luck, which is why Burris developed the Ballistic Plex reticle. The key is the copyrighted lower vertical crosshair. With most common hunting cartridges, a shooter can use the reticle to compensate for bullet drop and aim dead-on at targets from 100 to 500 yards out. The need for hold-over guesstimation is eliminated. Using it is simple. Start by sighting-in your rifle at 100 or 200 yards at your scope's highest magnification. Then, once you determine the distance to your target, select the appropriate ballistic line. Add slight hold-over or hold-under for in-between yardages and take the shot.
Includes binoculars!

Winchester records
date it at 1949!  It’s actually marked .30 W.C.F which stood for Winchester Center Fire. It was Winchester’s version of the .30-30 as the two cartridges were identical.   Marlin called their lever rifles chambered for the cartridge .30-30 because they didn’t want to be associated with a cartridge named after Winchester.  Unfortunately for Winchester,
the .30-30 designation caught on and they changed the markings on their .30 W.C.F model 94's to .30-30 in 1952.   This is a very nice collectable and shootable top-ejecting Winchester model 94 with hooded front sight and buckhorn rear sight. Bore is clean, shiny and tight.   Priced to sell at $350.00.
