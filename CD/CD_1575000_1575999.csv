This Krag is one of the hard to find Norwegian Stomperud models in 6.5x55 Caliber. These rifles were MFG 1946-1951 and this is one out of 1572 pieces that Kongsberg made. They were assembled from different types of parts and rifles given to Kongsberg. They were called ""Bastard-Krag"" or ""Stomperud"" Krag. These are a part of the Norwegian Krag history, and this a great sample out of these. Low number of them, so a bit rare to find complete. These were civilian rifles with bayonet lugs to be sold to the public. The Stomperud Krag had the barrel shortened by 15 cm to 61.3 cm and the front of the stock was cut sum 18 cm shorter. This rifle is about the same length as a K98. These rifles are rather scarce with less than 1600 manufactured. The condition of this gun is very good. The serial number on the receiver is #85XXX and the date is stamped 1909. The receiver number revealed that in April 1940 it was an original m1894 Krag, stationarized at the IR3 (Infantry Regiment number 3). IR3 fought against the Germans for a few days, and this Krag can be one that were out in action and perhaps got some damage, so that it later were refurbished as a Stomperud? This is only speculation, but could be the history of the Receiver. The rifle is in very good shape with strong rifling and a clean bore. The only things that make this an excellent rifle rather than perfect is that is my grandfather varnished the stock back in the 60's and my dad wrote Norway on it about an inch long with an electric pencil in the mid 70's. ARMSLIST would only allow 3 pictures. I will email more pictures upon request

Has been well cleaned (ask me for pictures of my other weapons and you will see the OCD I have haha!). It has only been taken to the range at Palmetto State Armory twice. I’ve put approx 4 mags of ammo through (approx 50 rounds) while I’ve owned it. 

The XDm features: grip safety (1911 style; I prefer this to the Glock angled grip), loaded chamber indicator, striker status indicator (NOT on a Glock), MATCH GRADE barrel, Major Grasp serrations (front and back of slide), minimal reset trigger (one of the smoothest I’ve felt on a 45) and fixed dovetail white 3-dot sights. 

Pistol package includes: (2) 13-round magazines, molded holster and mag pouch, mag loading tool, cable lock, heavy-duty plastic case, and owner's manual.

The question most people like to ask; Why are you selling it?
The answer: I am selling it because I have 3 handguns already. I recently purchased an XD service model and a nice FN FNX. I would love to keep all three but I would rather save the money up for something else later or a new competition model XDm 45 (the 5.5” ported/compensated version). Really could use the money which is the main reason why I am not taking any trades.

Pricing: This package sells for right around 689.99. Fairly hard to find in the 4.5"". 

I do have more ammo for extra money. I have approx. 260 more rounds of brass casing .45 ACP."

420,http://www.armslist.com/posts/1575420,Want To Buy:  Whitney Wolverine (nickel- plated) original,"San Fernando Valley, Los Angeles, California","$ 1,000","Listed On: Saturday, July 13, 2013",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Wolverine was engineered by Robert Hillberg, who learned about aluminum casting during WWII while working with aircraft guns and later became research engineer for High Standard Manufacturing Company. Only 13,371 of these .22 semi automatic pistols were made in its short period of production between 1956 and 1958. There were approximately 500 nickel plated according to company records, the rest finished in varying shades of anodized blue.  The plastic grips came in either a black, dark brown or white (the white grips are found mostly on the nickel plated models). The frame being cast by Alcoa was a new idea for the gun industry at the time, now it is widely used by almost every major gun manufacturer today.

Its name ""Wolverine"" was drawn from  Mr. Hillberg's favorite football team, the University of Michigan Wolverines.  A victim of extremely poor marketing in the beginning, financial problems and then being under priced by $2.00 by both Ruger and Colt with their new semi-automatics .22, the company was doomed. The original retail price was $39.95 blue and $44.95 nickel plated. 

The Whitney Firearms, Inc., of North Haven, Connecticut manufactured and sold this unique futuristic-looking .22 semi-automatic design from 1955 to 1962. The Whitney pistol had a light alloy frame with raked-back butt and tubular receiver with cylindrical slide. Some say that the Whitney was among the most handsome pistols ever made.

Whitney called their pistols the ""Lightning"" in early sales literature, but they were marked ""WOLVERINE WHITNEY FIREARMS INC"" on the right side of the receiver and ""WHITNEY"" on the left. The Wolverine name was eventually dropped after the Lyman Sight Company claimed previous use on a telescope sight. The left-side markings were changed to ""CALIBER ,22 PATENT PENDING THE WHITNEY FIREARMS CO, HARTFORD CONN, USA"" around serial number 24000."

But - We just received a long awaited very small batch... These are the true AB2 type rifles with the heavier stamped receiver incorporating the reinforcement ridge on each side of the trunion. These receivers are widely regarded throughout the industry as the strongest of all the stamped AK receivers. In essence, these rifles are built like tanks. Rifle combines all matching Yugoslavian AK parts sets with a brand new U.S. barrel and receiver and a U.S made G-2 no slap trigger group. Rifle comes complete with 1-30 round mag and cleaning rod. Rifle also ships with a bonus. The original thread on grenade launcher/barrel extension is included. Rifle is fully compliant with all high cap mags and drums regardless of country of origin. Underfold stock has a push button release and locks up tightly in the extended position and firmly against the forearm in the closed position. The Yugo AK's are regarded as some of the finest quality AK rifles in the world and these are no exception. Extremely well made with very tight tolerances These rifles will feed, function and fire flawlessly for thousands and thousands of rounds. Do not confuse these with these with the AB2T - These are the true AB2 with the heavy reinforced receiver I keep one of these in my bug out kit - it is a highly practical, tough as nails defensive / survival weapon. 7.62x39 caliber, semi-auto, ammo and extra mags are plentiful and inexpensive."

I also ran some steel cased and had a few ftf (the bolt wouldn't cycle back far enough on a few rds). I believe a lighter buffer and it would run fine of lower pressure rounds but it wasn't a problem for me so I never switched. The upper has a bcm bcg(it will go with the upper unless your bcg is of lesser quality), and a Daniel defense lite 9"" rail.

Introduced in 1948, the Nosler Partition Bullet is the standard by which all others are measured.

The Partition’s has been favored worldwide as it has a legendary level of accuracy, controlled expansion and weight retention in any caliber, on any game, and in any situation.

It all begins with Nosler’s fully tapered copper alloy jacket. This jacket is designed to rupture instantly at the thin jacket mouth, yet the gradual thickening along the bullet’s axis controls expansion and curls the jacket uniformly outward at high or low velocities.

The dual-core construction of the Partition coupled with the special lead-alloy core provides superior mushrooming characteristics at virtually all impact velocities.

Nosler’s engineering efforts are shown, as every Partition bullet in the line delivers optimum length, weight and ogive design for maximum in flight and terminal performance.

The integral Partition supports the expanded mushroom and retains the rear lead-alloy core which retains more than two thirds of its original weight, ideal for deep penetration. Finally the special crimp locks Nosler puts into each Partition adds strength to resist deformation under the pressure of heavy magnums."

Never heard of them, well here is the story. Moore's Machine is a very high end manufacturer and full service machine company based right here in North Carolina. We have known about them for years and they are really good folks. Well. About 3 years ago they started building some AR-15 rifles. We watched from afar as they experimented with different tooling and went through the learning curve that comes along with being a firearms manufacturer. I even carried some of their early rifles that were marked as Rocky Point Guns right after they first started manufacturing, with mixed results. When I say mixed results the problem was basically this. They made a great looking rifle, and the price point and customer service was excellent, but in all honesty we did have some returns... Not a lot mind you, maybe one out of 20, and typically due to some type of feed issue that  ( the people at Moore's ) quickly resolved, but still to me any return is one too many. So i decided to discontinue the line and wait until they had all of the bugs worked out before jumping back in ... Well, i almost waited too long... Not only have they overcome any issues that they may have had in the past, but the MMC rifles are taking our region by storm... In fact they are now so tied up with Law Enforcement and Distributor Orders that i had to get in line and beg in order to get some rifles... But the payoff was worth it. I have torture tested these rifles and I would put them up against anything being sold for reliability... Now don't get me wrong... There is nothing fancy here... Just a basic M4 AR-15 Carbine... But if you want a great entry level AR, at a really great price.... Give this MMC AR-15 a try. Ships complete with a Carbine Length AR-15 Hard case and 1-30 round magazine.... Standard M4- Flat Top Rifle.... 

Note : Rifle comes to us as a Flat Top and is sold as such... 
Some photo's show rifle with Optional Rear Sight / Carry Handle or Barska  3x9x40 Scope Installed. .... 
Carry Handle , Scope, Extra Mags, Drum Mag, etc... may be purchased with rifle.....

Note - The scope you see in the photo's on the rifle is a Barska 3x9x40 Colorado series... This is a great scope for the price and comes with rings and mounts up to this AR-15 right out of the box.... The rings it comes with are low profile so it makes for a very low profile scope package.... If you like for your scope to ride higher on the riflejust replace these factory rings with any medium or high ring set. 

Also, many people ask, do you not see the front sight through the scope??? The answer is no.. You do not... I don't know why, it is right there in front of the lens... but it does not show up though the scope... You have an unobstructed clear as a bell view downrange as far as the eye can see..... It must be magic...

Note - We have tested these extensively and they work great, however, for some reason these rifles do not seem to like the Thermold brand mags... 
We recommend the Tapco, or C-Products mags..... Our Korean Military 100 round drum mags work great too."

From the manufacturers web site: Welcome to the All-American by Americans AR-15 manufacturer.  That’s right, all of our parts are made right here in the U.S.A.  The revolutionary U.S. Arms Patriot-15™ is among the strongest, lightest, most durable AR-15 polymer composite lower on the market today.  Say goodbye to the 1960’s same ol’ square, boring, offensive style composite Ar-15 lower.  Compare these outdated lowers to our new and improved AR-15 lower that represents this century. 

U.S. Arms, (through a subsidiary company) was the main investor of the first composite AR-15 lower company that hit the market 3 years ago.  Yes, the name was a little out there, some would say Plumcrazy, but the product was exceptional, functional and long lasting. We now have an updated product that is comprised of an even stronger, reinforced, longer lasting material that is far superior than anything either past or present.  Top it off with an industry first POLYMER BUFFER TUBE!!!!!!


U.S. Arms offers a price point that anyone can afford and followed it up with a customer satisfaction guarantee for all of our products.
