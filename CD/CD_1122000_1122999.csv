It comes with two 40 round magazines and a bayonet. I will even throw in 100 rounds of Wolf steel case so you can shoot it during the ammo shortage. With the exception of slight scuffing where the charging handle hits the stock, it's in as-new condition. I am fairly firm on price, but I am very open to partial or complete firearm trades.

In a FLAT/MATTE anodized black finish, it works with stock uppers and most after market uppers as well. Its thin design allows the entire barrel thread for most suppressors and muzzle breaks and is flush to the exterior barrel base. Easy installation with a clamp design for strength and a set screw for a tight fit. Fits standard 7/8x9 & 3/4 x 10 threaded barrels for Mac-10, MPA .45 acp & Vulcan .45 acp series.

Stock photo shown, but mine is the exact same model. Excellent condition, as new with only wear seen where it was mounted to lower. Used for only a couple range sessions. 

I also have the additional pic rail attached to the top. This is an addition 50 when you buy it new. 

Price is firm, cash only, FTF transaction.

Please dont email me saying, but I can get it online here for this much. If that's the case, then do it. I have considerably more in it than I'm asking.
Besides, everytime someone does that, they fail to read the full description noting that the 279.00 price is not as shown, with the rail and threaded barrel is another 50-75...blah blah.
Then there's shipping and your FFL transfer fee...yes..this item had a serial number and must be shipped to an FFL.

A chrome-lined barrel with chrome-lined chamber and bore along with beautiful walnut stock make these rifles the best AK-based rifles available in the US market. VEPR's parts are manufactured as the lightweight machinegun RPK. They have extra heavy duty reinforced receivers and hammer-forged heavy duty barrels which provide much better accuracy and durability. The rifle comes with a rail for a scope mount attached to the left side of the receiver. This allows for shooting from the rifle with an open sight without taking away a riflescope.

I got this rifle right after Sandy Hook as a back up and recently picked up another rifle. A friend is selling me a nice Beretta M9 so I want to put this money towards that.

i want 575 firm. no trades at this time thanks.
the good thing about this is it accepts all 40 cal glock mags and drums and all 9mm glock mags and drums. for roughly 100$ online you can get whats called a lone wolf 9mm conversion barrel and it effectivly makes it the glock 26 subcompact 9mm.
because the lower frames are virtually identical. magwells ect...infact the only difference of the two is the barrel size. unfortunatly the 26 cannot have the barrel swapped out to go to 40 cal thats why i purposley got the 27 because i knew it would be more useful and valuable in time.

LMT's product line was developed for the US Government / Professional Market. The civilian market is a secondary benefactor to this program. As such, the QC standards and priorities (and features) are different than that of a ""commercial market"" AR15 manufacturer. To the very overwhelming majority of shooters, this is a huge plus in the LMT column. It makes their product an extremely attractive option for a civilian shooter looking for a higher standard of product. 

With the primary focus being a high quality standard for military sales, there are some noteworthy differences in the product as you receive it. Specific to the LMT Upper Groups, they ALL come test fired and magnetic particle inspected (MP) from the factory. As such, every single real LMT Upper Group on the market will have brass, carbon, and handling marks on the group.   Everything LMT builds is focused on utility; and this is a very very good thing.

These bills have were rammed through their respective committees over the past few days in a veritable blitzkrieg to get them passed before gun owners could respond. All four will soon be heard by the senate.

 I urge you to contact your state senator as soon as possible and ask them to vote “no” on all of these bills. If you’re not sure who your local legislators are, you can find them here: http://votesmart.org/. You can also find your legislators’ contact information at http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLI...y?openFrameset for the House and http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLI...n?openframeset for the Senate. In addition to succinctly voicing your opinions on the bills, it may be helpful to remind your legislators that you will be keeping their actions in mind during the 2014 election.

 I would also encourage you to attend town hall meetings over the weekend. Such meetings are public forums where you can voice your opinions about issues affecting Colorado and your local community. We are trying to concentrate on the Senate townhalls, since the bills will be heard by the senate soon, but it would be great if you could let House members know how you feel. Also, if any of you are able to bring a video camera, we’d love to capture the meetings on film.

 Please call your local city council or Republican Party or do a Google search to find town hall meetings going on in your area. I’ve provided the times and locations of a few local meetings that will be going on soon:

Payment Options:

Trade Consideration: 

3 complete high quality 5.56 Bolt Carrier Groups only from a reputable manufacturer such as Bravo Co. or JP Enterprises, not interested in cheap USGI units.

Local sale/trade only, transacted in Redmond at my FFL’s location, FFL fee ($35.00 plus any sales tax) payable directly to dealer in cash.

Regarding my pricing; Yes, I am selling these at a premium over my cost (which includes FFL fee, shipping & sales tax that I paid), but I offer the ability to purchase & obtain a receiver set far faster than buying direct from Aero Precision or dealers (who are back ordered & will not tell you until after you pay for the purchase). 

Please keep in mind that Aero’s $200 price does not include shipping, sales tax or your FFL’s fees (typically $75 to $100+ w/local dealers) which makes your cost over $300 each. Also Aero takes up to 10 business day for handling plus UPS Ground shipping which can be up to an additional 5 business days.

At this time, Aero Precision is sold out of upper receivers with no indication when more will be available.

If you have a problem with my pricing, then please buy from someone else. Also note that I am not desperate or in need of money, so my prices are firm and first consideration will go to who ever pays first (including offers over my asking price)."

These are being built on PHNX-52 receiver sets.  The PHNX-52 lower receiver is an enhanced lower receiver with an integrated oversized all seasons trigger guard, a slight beveled mag well for faster reloads, 3M Pictograph on BOTH sides, and a Bolt Catch screw not a pin.  The upper receiver is a Gen 2 Upper with a beefier look and feel to them that compliment the enhanced lower.

Custom Builds are accepted and usually can be completed within 30 days unless custom finishes are included in the request then add another 30 days but we aim to surprise you and be faster if we can.

AR-15 Pistols.... WHY would you deal with the hassle of NFA paper work and get a SBR ever again!  The AR-15 Pistol is a great platform to run and have fun with and the recent ATF Determination Letters about Shoulder firing an AR-15 Pistol seals the fate of this great item.  Why deal with the hassle of registering your SBR everytime you move, if you want to travel out of State on short notice and want to take your SBR - it wont happen, and why wait the length of time to get a response & tax stamp required in order to even purchase a SBR?

SOoo I have become a fan of the AR-15 Pistol platform and what it now offers.

We also build Competition Ready rifles with precision 18"" Hvy SS Fluted Barrels and...
a Designated Marksmen Rifle with a precision 18"" barrel as well.
