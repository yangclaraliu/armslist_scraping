I recommend a more expensive gun for home defense or concealed carry because of the migration issue, which is why I'm selling the gun (I have to index the top round every time I carry it - YMMV).  The ergonomics of this gun are excellent, especially the grip.  Its small size is a plus also.  The weapon has a slide safety, loaded-chamber indicator and the gun has an internal lock for safer storage.  Trigger lock is included too.Wisconsin residents only.  Must have photo ID, sign a bill of sale and show a CCW permit OR military ID OR veteran OR LEO OR firefighter ID OR physician/nurse/clinician ID OR educator OR similar responsible party.  Must be 21 to purchase a handgun in Wisconsin.  Price drop: now $200.  Again, must meet the above criteria for sale (liability, ethics and safety issues)."

A little over 300,000 30 and AS models were manufactured, and are still considered to this day to be a very solid big game hunting rifle, among other target shooting achievements. Modeled after the Glenfield Model 30 rifles, the 30AS continued in a very similar manufacture model with the same 22inch microgroove barrel and the same physical design. The difference between these models is the stock is a different wood type (Beech) and the 39A models introduced a cross-bolt safety to the rifle line. With the limited overall number of the AS models specifically being manufactured through the 1980s, this is a sleeper value hit for decades to come. This fact has both been confirmed by the online records I have researched as well as an auctioning company I brought this rifle to for appraisal. This particular 39AS is in great condition, and I know for a fact the previous owner (my Father) regularly cleaned and serviced this weapon. It was very seldomly fired. I have a zip-up tote bag as pictured and included, and one box of ammunition as well. If you have any questions or need more specific photos of any part of the rifle, let me know! I will be happy to help."

The receivers are a perfect fit & with the perfect amount of cerakote in between the two they fit together with no wiggle at all. ****Also comes with the Sig Sauer Romeo 5 red dot sight."

Ideally, this revolver would be re-blued to restore it to the guns value of $825 - $950.For additional pictures or to purchase this revolver: https://www.israel-arms.com/SMITH-WESSON-MODEL-586-PRE-LOCK-MODEL-p/act5076.htm WHY PAY MORE FOR A PRE-LOCK S&W? In addition to being able to chamber and fire .357 Magnum cartridges, the 586 will chamber and fire .38 Special cartridges as well as.38 Special+P, as the .357 Magnum was developed from the .38 Special. The Magnum case is slightly longer (0.1 in) to prevent magnum rounds from being chambered and fired in handguns chambered only for the .38 Special. The 586 has been available with 2½ in, 3 in, 4 in, 6 in, and 8⅜"" in (64, 76, 102, 153, and 214 mm) barrel lengths as standard models and other barrel lengths either by special order from S & W's Performance Center custom shop, or acquired from or built by after-market gunsmiths.[1] The Model 586 uses S & W's L (medium) revolver frame, with a K-Frame sized grip mated to a larger diameter cylinder. During the 1980s, Smith & Wesson developed its L-Frame line of .357 Magnums: the Model 581, Model 586, Model 681 and Model 686. The Model 581 had a fixed notch type rear sight, whereas the 586 used a target style adjustable rear sight. These handguns had a major effect on both law enforcement and sporting markets. The 586 was introduced in 1980 and the 581 was discontinued in 1988It was manufactured in either blue or nickel-plated versions. A stainless steel version exists as the Model 686. Other variations, such as the Model 686+, chambered for 7 rounds, are available. In the late 1990s, Smith & Wesson discontinued production of all but a few blued revolvers, thus the Model 686 and its variants are the only models currently produced. In 1998 Smith and Wesson, in an agreement with the Clinton Administration, made internal changes to their revolver line including the 586. One change was the addition of an internal hammer locking mechanism. To lock the hammer, a key included with the revolver would be inserted on the left side of the revolver just above the cylinder release button. Once the key is inserted the hammer was disabled by turning the key counterclockwise. A metal plate would appear with the word 'Locked'. Turning the key clockwise would unlock the hammer and the metal plate would retract into the frame. The second change moved the firing pin from the hammer to the frame and a transfer bar was added. Other manufacturers have used transfer bar system in their revolvers. Many Smith and Wesson purists felt betrayed with what they feel is an unwarranted change. The internal lock has caused many revolvers to fail with the internal mechanism seized. The revolver would be rendered unusable. The news of this issue was thought to be a rumor. However, as time passed it was determined that this was a real issued and caused Smith and Wesson more problems. The 586 was discontinued in 1991. After a 13-year absence, Smith & Wesson reintroduced the 586 in 2012 with the aforementioned safety modifications. It is currently produced with 4-in. and 6-in. barrel lengths as part of its Classic line of revolvers. The 586-8 features a redesigned and improved yoke."

Revolver comes with the rubber and the correct factory wood grips. (see pictures) TheSmith & Wesson (S & W) Model 28, also known as the Highway Patrolman, is an N-frame revolver chambered for the .357 Magnum cartridge, in production from 1954 to 1986. It is a budget version of the S&W Model 27. Development The Model 28, also known as the Highway Patrolman, traces its heritage back to the Smith & Wesson Registered Magnum. The Registered Magnum morphed into the Model 27. Law enforcement agencies favored the Model 27, but its high-polish finish and labor-intensive topstrap checkering added expense with no added utility for a police carry gun. The Model 28 is unusual in that Smith & Wesson removed, rather than added, features to the Model 27 to create it, in order to reduce production costs with no reduction in utility. A classic N frame revolver, the Highway Patrolman is blued, but it is not polished, saving labor costs. The top strap and frame rounds are bead blasted to achieve a matte appearance. By the early 1950s, Smith & Wesson returned to manufacturing many of its pre-World War II models, including the .357 Magnum, the descendant of the famous Registered Magnum. However, the .357 Magnum was more costly than the standard .38 special revolver of the time. In the late 1940s and the first part of the 1950s Smith & Wesson was the only American gun company manufacturing a .357 magnum revolver. Since this relatively deluxe model was the only revolver available for this cartridge at the time, police departments, as well as individual officers and private shooters, requested from Smith & Wesson a more strictly utilitarian ""budget"" .357 magnum revolver. S&W responded with the Highway Patrolman (later renamed the Model 28 in 1957). The manufacturing changes made for a more affordable revolver, though mechanically the Highway Patrolman is the same as the more ornate Model 27. The Model 28 was in production from 1954 through 1986. For most of its production run, it was a steady seller with both police officers and civilian shooters.For additional pictures or to purchase this revolver: https://www.israel-arms.com/Smith-Wesson-Model-28-2-Highway-Patrolman-p/n100570.htm"

This is the same barrel RRA uses in their National Match target rifles. My experience has proven this to be an extremely accurate rifle upper. Have shot approximately 400-500 rounds through: exclusively 69gr SMKs, 52gr SMKs, 50gr VMax, and 36gr Barnes Varmint Grenades. My average groups across five 5-shot strings were typically 0.6-0.8"". Occasional groups from this upper fell below 0.5"" at 100yards. I just don't shoot it much anymore as I've found I prefer my bolt actions for precision shooting. Only selling to fund other projects. RRA's price for a new 20"" Predator Pursuit upper is $825. (Please note, I purchased this in 2012. RRA has since changed their PP to add an expensive rail to allow mounting a bunch of crap on the forend that is completely useless to a precision rifle like this. I'm pretty sure I paid $750 when purchased new, plus the $60 upgrade for the BCM charging handle)Asking $550 OBO. Absolutely worth the money if you're looking for a tack-driver for coyotes or just target shooting. I understand this is not a ""firearm"", but I will still require proof of FOID card and/or CCL information before buyer can take possession of the upper. I refuse to sell to anyone without proof of responsible firearm ownership. Anyone who takes offense to this need not contact me."

Ok here we go; first off FNH manufactures rifles for the U.S. Military not Colt. Another awesome example of the unions running a company into the toilet around 1986 Colt union employees went on strike and refused to return to work for like gee over two years- and were paid by the auto workers union for not working during that period. Military officially dumped Colt in 1988 and awarded all further contracts to FNH-USA. These USMC issue M16 rifles were manufactured by FNH and subsequently altered so they could be legally sold to civilians. Although the fire selector switch has SAFE / SEMI / AUTO on it the automatic fire capability has been deleted. Units are stamped M16 port side magwell. FN makes TWO collector versions available for civilian sale; these are the THIRD versions from Rockegroup, LLC. FIRST CIVILIAN LEGAL VERSION from FNH is the base M16 20 inch rifle as issued with one magazine, forend grip, and cardboard box (with Knight's rails). SECOND CIVILIAN LEGAL VERSION from FNH is the ""Collector's Edition"" which is the same M16 but also has a bayonet, sling, faux cleaning kit (aftermarket), one FN (non government issued) magazine, KAC rear sight, letter of authenticity from FN and comes in a cardboard box. THIRD CIVILIAN LEGAL VERSION from Rockegroup, LLC has everything the FNH SECOND version has but includes the actual real live issue ""stuff"" which follows: Real Trijicon ACOG USMC issue optics, real USMC issue bayonet (stamped USMC), real USMC issue KAC sights (stamped USMC), real issue USMC Technical manual, real issue Hardigg military M-16 case, real government issue magazines (5), real issue OTIS cleaning kit with NSN number which stores in the buttstock of the M16. Issue M-16 target included. Ok seems pretty clear I hope.. here's the details! MIL-SPEC means that it is approved by a U.S. government inspector. These inspections assure some important details, such as HPT/MPI testing of bolts and barrels, staked nuts on the gas key, .154” diameter pins for the fire control group, and proper feed ramps. These guns are what the military gets with the following minor changes: the lower parts set is not full auto, the receiver is not drilled for the auto sear, and there is no automatic sear assembly. Other than these differences the guns are identical to those delivered to the military. Stamped 5.56×45 mm NATO. Fixed A2 rifle butt-stock is attached to a MIL-SPEC buffer tube with issue OTIS cleaning kit inside the actual buttstock. Government UID Label. The upper receiver is a flat-top with a MIL-SPEC M-1913 rail at the 12 o’clock position. HPT/MPI mark on the bolt. The 20 inch mil spec barrel is adorned with a Knights Armament M5 RAS adapter rail, with rail adapter covers and down handle, as per government contract. These USMC issue M 16 rifles have the picatinny rails (KAC) with appropriate KAC covers; each individual mounting point is clearly denoted in white paint with it's alpha numeric; R29 is the right side 29th mounting point, L is for the left, T for top etc. These USMC units have the actual KAC rear sight with adjustments past 600 meters and are stamped USMC. Rear sight is removable. USMC issue Trijicon 4X ACOG mounted and zeroed for the specific M16 it is on. The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the USMC's M16A4 weapon system (20” barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Built specifically for the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. Reticle has crosshairs for each hundred meter distance to 800 meters. Target at 600 meters? Put the ""6"" on it, 700 the ""7"", etc. Includes USMC Tenebraex ARD anti reflective device and steel braid turret retaining devices. Front site post does not interfere with the ACOG. Unit has two mounting knurled knobs for quick (ish) removal if necessary. If removed the USMC KAC rear site simply ""pops up"" and instantly aligns with the front site post to keep you mission capable. USMC issue bayonet is stamped ""USMC"" on the starboard side and has the ""EGA"" symbol (Eagle, Globe, and Anchor) stamped on the port side. Bayonet has standard sharpening on the bottom with serrated tooth section and upper sharpening nigh to 1/2 blade length (when attached). Sharp point blade with upper and lower portions filed and sharpened denotes this as a killing blade not a tool. Includes issue sheath. Includes five (5) government issue magazines, 30 round. Aluminum issue magazines may be stamped Colt or USGI. All government issue magazines have a ""dry film finish"" sprayed on them prior to delivery. Finish will scratch at the touch and rub off becoming slick with use; in effect every new military issue magazines looks scratched since it has a dry film coating.

821,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8235821,For Sale:  Compact Carry 380 Bersa,"dallas, Dallas, Texas",$ 319,"Listed On: Monday, May 7, 2018",Handguns,no type,380 ACP                                                                                ,no type,Pistol,"Brand: Bersa
Caliber: 380
Condition: Terrific! Sharp looking, two tone model: silver frame and blue slide.
 
Bersa has been one of the best defensive pistol bargains on the market for several years now.
Top-notch set of features:
 
Double-action/single-action semi-automatic with many similarities to the Walther PPK, famously carried by the fictional secret agent James Bond.
Upgraded grips have a diamond shaped pattern for a sure grip that’s incredibly comfortable.
Slide features a rounded muzzle for easy holstering
3-dot sight system and rear cocking serrations.
External controls consist of a slide catch, round magazine release button and combination thumb safety/decocker are placed on the left side of the frame with the takedown lever located on the right side.
Safety lever automatically decocks the exposed hammer when it is pressed down into the ""Safe"" position, resulting in a double-action trigger pull for the first shot. Feels smooth and consistent throughout the arc of travel. After the first shot is fired, the hammer is cocked and ready to operate in single-action mode. Lots of added upgrades usually reserved for more pricey models. The metallic front sight is dovetailed into the slide. The adjustable rear sight has a small screw for windage adjustments instead of being drift adjustable or fixed in place. The top of the slide is checkered to reduce glare.
The front and back of the grip frame are grooved for improved purchase as is the face of the trigger.
Extended beavertail protects the shooter's hand from hammer bite.
The front edge of the roomy trigger guard is curved and textured to act as a finger rest.
The magazine release button is deeply checkered for positive operation.
Some little 380s hold just six or seven rounds in the magazine. The Bersa Thunder takes an eight-round magazine that ships with an extended finger rest to ensure a firm three-finger grip. The features, fit and function all add up to a gun that give you plenty of bang for the buck.  
Dismantling this pistol is quite simple. Swing and hold the takedown lever down in the 6 o'clock position while pulling back and up on the slide. The rear of the slide lifts off.
Handling: the combination of this pistol's smooth, clean trigger, comfortable grip and moderate levels of felt recoil left me wanting more time at the range instead of less.  Slim, light and comfortable on the hip. It feels so well balanced and the grip fits your hands comfortably. It's an ideal option for self-defense practitioners who are new to shooting or those who have been pulling triggers for years.   
Utterly reliable! !
