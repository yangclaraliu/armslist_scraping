Always cleaned, oiled, and stored in a humidity controlled safe. Benelli Montefeltro Silver 12ga 28"" semi auto shotgun (#10850) Light, slender, and quick-pointing never described a semi-auto better than the Benelli Montefeltro 12-gauge shotgun. The Inertia Driven® system in these Benelli shotguns requires no springs or gas cylinder under the forend. That allows the Montefeltro’s forend to be slim and graceful, while the lightweight, anodized aluminum receiver keeps weight to a minimum. Stocked with beautifully finished satin walnut, the Montefeltro is the gun for the wingshooting purist who wants the feel of a classic game gun with the added advantage of a semi-auto. Montefeltro Silver 12-Gauge has engraving as follows on the receiver - Right: Pair of Quail, Left: Pointing Setter. This is an incredibly beautiful shotgun for your collection. 

It will come with everything it come with from Benelli - Case, 5 chokes, shims, etc. Also included is a Limbsaver Recoil Pad and a Primos Jelly Head Vented Turkey Choke. This is a great gun but I scored an Elk hunt so I am selling this one to buy a rifle setup. Not interested in any trades.

MORE INFO FROM KIMBER

 Top quality U.S.-made smallbore target rifles have been a scarce commodity for many years. Winchester decided in the late 1970s that annual sales of the legendary Model 52 target gun, seldom numbering in the hundreds, were insufficient to justify continued production. 

 Since then the 40X rifles made in Remington's custom shop have been the only smallbore guns made by a major U.S. manufacturer. German makers, especially Anschutz, have dominated the field. Most U.S. manufacturers have abandoned the smallbore target rifle, but a government contract helped Kimber. 

 With the help of a big U.S. government contract, Kimber of Oregon has set out to change the situation. The firm won a contract to make 20,000.22 rimfire target rifles, all capable of firing .700"" or smaller groups at 50 yds. with target ammunition. 

 With completion of government deliveries near, Kimber now is offering the gun to the civilian market. This rifle differs from the military version only in that the sight set is an optional accessory that most smallbore shooters will, no doubt, want to order with the rifle. 

 The loading platform of the singleshot Model 82 is inserted in the receiver and incorporates the ejector. The action is securely fastened to the stock by a pair of heavy screws; one through the rear of the steel trigger guard into the rear tang and the other through the handstop rail into the recoil lug. The recoil lug is dovetailed to the receiver, which is grooved to accept the rear sight. 

 Most of the Australian-made rear sight components are steel, with the housing and mounting bar made of a non-ferrous alloy. The mounting base secures to the corresponding receiver dovetail with two heavy clamping screws. The entire mounting system appears abundantly secure and allows the sight to be removed and reinstalled with minimal impact change. 

 The adjustment knobs are heavily grooved for easy turning and are located at the top and left side of the sight. Each is clearly marked for direction and scale, allowing easy return to any previous setting. The adjustments are faithful to their claimed 1/5 minute of angle (m.o.a.) increments. No backlash was n6ted. 

 The front sight is of the standard globe type and is made of a non-ferrous alloy. The 10 interchangeable inserts and the screw-in sight face and back are steel. The three post sizes and seven apertures that make up the front sight insert set seem adequate for shooting at most ranges and under varying light conditions. 

 The safety lever is typical of Kimber sporting .22s and is ""rolled"" on and off to positive stops. It cannot be applied unless the action is cocked. The bolt handle is not locked when the safety is applied. 

 The trigger assembly is fully adjustable for weight of pull, overall travel and sear engagement. The manufacturer cautions against making adjustments before reading and understanding the pertinent instructions; and then that adjustment be undertaken only by an experienced gunsmith or armorer. 

 The three trigger adjusting screws (accessible after the barrelled action has been removed from the stock) are each provided with two locking screws. An inspection port allows viewing of the sear/trigger engagement. 

 The instruction book states that rifles are shipped with triggers adjusted to a pull weight between 3.5 and 4.5 lbs., and that the trigger should not be adjusted to less than 2 lbs. Notwithstanding all that, the sample rifle tested at a very crisp 3 lbs., and no further adjustment was deemed necessary. 

 The instructions further state that the rifle should not be dry-fired, but it may be uncocked by holding the trigger to the rear as the bolt is closed. 

 The cylindrical 25"" barrel, factoryfitted with three sight bases (for scope mounts and the front sight) has a diameter of .928"". It has a 1 in 16"" righthand twist and is completely freefloated. 

 The manufacturer warns against the use of all types of Short, Long or hypervelocity cartridges.

 As you can see the total of what I spent to build this is almost $1600 with the mags and ammo..... This everything you need to get shooting. Slap it on your lower and go! Im trying to recoup as much as I can for another project. I have 2 of these so one must go. This is not a cheap upper. If thats what you want, there are plenty of  $5-600 uppers on here. If you appreciate precision and reliability like I do then make an offer. The one with the offer closest to the mark wins! Oh, and also........ I will not give this away so lowballs will be ignored and.............. I WILL NOT SPLIT THESE ITEMS UP!!!!!!! DO NOT ASK!   also, NO TRADES.... cash only

I am the second owner of this fine gun--the first owner carried this while working in Alaska, and had to take down a charging bear--with one shot!  This is a very versatile firearm: for home defense, I load it 45 LC hollow points, and for bear country, I load it with 454 Casull.  This gun locks up tight, the bore is excellent, and there are no issues.  This comes with the holster pictured, and one box of 45 LC ammo.  I have high quality 45 and 454 defense ammo available, but it will cost extra if you want it.  Ask, and I can tell you what I have.  This comes with original box and keys too.  I also have more photos upon request.  

I really don't want to sell this, it pains me to do, so I am firm on the price.  Please email me with your number, be at least 21 years of age, no felons, and have a CO. ID and a CCW if you have one."

Glock 27. Comes with 2 mags and box + papers. Upgraded trigger package. This gun has a full trigger group replacement. All parts are Factory Glock.

Please keep in mind that while the gun scare might be winding down Colts are still pretty hard to come by. I called them up to ask about supply and they said it could take a year or better to resupply the market. Sig was the same when I talked to them.

I would like to congratulate both the ammo scalpers and those dumb enough to purchase.  Retail prices are now climbing to reach what you see here on armslist, gunbroker, etc.  You have shown the manufacturers that people are willing to pay $100 bucks for a box of .22 ammo and they are reacting with price increase through the distributors.  Now, when your friendly armslist ammo supplier has to pay double what your box of ammo is worth on the shelf, what do you think you are going to see here?  Shelf price is $26 for Federal 525s here.  Yep, I bought 3 to donate to local range for their Youth Field Day and people in line were mad at me because they could have sold them.  They actually told me that in front of everyone.  Didn't care a bit.

Buyers:  If you see it here for sale, most (NOT ALL) sellers intend to make a profit off you.  They want added compensation for their fuel, time, and bragging rights to buy anything they can get their hands on.  IF ITS NOT SHELF PRICE...LET THEM KEEP IT.  Ask to see a receipt.  Know what the price should be.  If you hand them twice the value, they have twice the money to play with on the next trip to the ammo store.  

Good luck to all as this wont stop until scalpers leave the ammo on the shelf.  There is no reason for them to do it while someone is willing to overpay."

 I am trying to track down a Rock Island Officer size 1911 that I sold back in 2010/2011. The 1911 was my fathers, and he recently passed away. It was the first gun I ever owned. I was going through the police academy at the time and needed to buy a Glock so like an idiot I sold the Rock Island to a guy in late 2010. 

Well I recently got ahold of him and he said he had traded it for a revolver around Feb 2012. The Rock Island had tan grips I believe at that time of its trading, it also may have come with a chip mccormick mag and a standard act mag.

If so is there any way you would be willing to Sell it or Trade it back to me? I would really like to have it again due to it being my fathers. If you do not own it anymore could you possibly give me any info about who may currently own it? 

Either way, thank you for your time. If you would please contact me through email here, I would greatly appreciate it. I know its a long shot....but it is all I have right now."

This gun was designed as the ultimate practical tactical shotgun. If it is not on this gun, it is unneccessary.

The cool thing about it is someone put a sticker on it from 1955 Post Sugar Crisp cereal giveaway. For 2 box tops and .25c you could have your choice of team stickers. The sticker is made from cotton not paper and that's why it has lasted this long. The team is the 'Milwaukee Braves' and they were a team from 1953-1967 and the star of the team was Hank Aaron who started his career with them in 1954. The sticker promotion is thought to be the 1st ever team endorsement/cereal box offer ever. I challenge you to find 1 of these stickers for sale somewhere. I believe the sticker is very rare and the combination of the 2 items makes for a really cool conversation piece/ paper weight. It's a cross between World War 2 and Major League Baseball. The anti tank round is inert(not explosive) and is about 8"" tall and 3"" round and is commonly referred to as a '6 pounder'."

(*All NFA rules apply) A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 9, 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.* Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by MagPul Industries. One magazine is included.

I just took them out of the packages to take pictures. ESEE Knives improved the ESEE-3 after noting improvements offered to us by soldiers and cops in the field. ESEE Knives took the popular ESEE-3, added 3/8"" of handle length, a glass-breaking pommel, larger handle screws, then differentially heat-treated the 1095 carbon steel and dressed up the Micarta slabs to build the ESEE-3 survival knife. The survival knife include coyote brown molded sheathing, boot clip, paracord, and cord lock. This model also includes the MOLLE Back.

ESEE Knives has a no-questions-asked lifetime guarantee against blade and handle breakage. This warranty does not cover normal wear and tear, coatings, cosmetics, edge chipping / dulling, or sheathing. Machetes are considered a professional tool.  Anyone purchasing a machete should already know how to properly use and maintain this tool. Due to the thin design, machetes are not designed to be used with a baton or as a prying tool.
The Second knife is a Cold Steel ""The Spike"" Self Defense Neck Knife

The Spike, designed by Barry Dawson, is a weapon pared down to its bare essentials.  Its thick, narrow blade is distal tapered and flat ground to a zero edge.  This creates a unique cross section that facilitates both penetration of the tip and cutting power previously unknown in such a thick, narrow blade.  The integral handle of the spike compliments its minimalist theme.  It has been carefully shaped out of solid steel, wrapped with cord and had all of its sharp edges ""melted"" so they don't irritate the hand.  Each spike comes with a sturdy Secure-Ex sheath and steel bead lanyard so you can wear it around your neck or lash it to a ""D"" ring, fanny pack, or other gear.

One is a Victor with Victor regulators, welding tip, torch head and rosebud.
The other is an Airco, with a Smith and a Victor regulator, torch head, and welding tip. This set is pretty much new.
There is one set of hoses, and a cart included.
One of the victor regulators has a bad gauge, but there are two sets here. None of this leaks.
I may even include a nice auto darkening welding helmet for the right trade.

There are a set of tanks pictured. The ox tank is empty, and the Acetylene has some left.
These tanks are included, but the torches are 400 WITH OR WITHOUT them.
I do not know anything about the tanks, as they were given to me, and will not answer a ton of questions about them.
The ad is for the torches. Take or leave the tanks.

$400 cash or trade. This is fair and FIRM.
This is not cheap knock off junk.
You will not find two full torch rigs cheaper.
I can help transport these to you AFTER deal is made and within a reasonable distance."

I'm a private seller, selling some of my dad's old guns. This means cash only (sorry, no trades). It also means no shipping or tax, no background fees, and no waiting.  I am located halfway between Poy Sippi and Redgranite, WI (approx 30 miles west of Oshkosh)

it is registered as a handgun so you can have it on a thigh holster and open carry with it or even conceal carry with it "" not kidding "" and if an assault weapon ban ever happend this is considered a handgun so it wouldnt be taken.

i have 4 magazines for it they take regular ar 15 magazines so if you have a bunch these will use them. it is also gas chamber operated so recoil is low you can easily one hand it as a pistol no problem.

comes with carrying case and 4 magazines, it does have rail attachments and a sling for carrying which where add ons not factory.

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system (14.5 barrel). It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

Remember--back in those days--there weren't a lot of options in firearms-If you owned a rifle at all it was most likely a Winchester or Colt. Initials, carvings etc. were a common past time for cowboys during the long winter months, as well as identifying their gun on a rack with a dozen others or sticking out of a saddle scabbard. This one has very exquisite carvings-not the usual crude ones. D.H.W. on one side and R.W.H. on the other,along with very nice scroll work. Truly a work of art and a gem to enhance any collection."

I am selling my .308 Remington R25 rifle with some accessories. This AR works and looks great. The gun does have a little rubbed off paint on the forearm of the gun, but other than that, it is in great condition. It has a threaded, bull barrel(not standard for this model) and a scope. I have it sighted it in and it shoots sub-MOA at 100 yards, which is very accurate for a semi-automatic rifle. 

I am including the gun, P.E.P.R. rings, Bushnell Elite 5-15x50 scope(waterproof, shockproof, and fog resistant), a scope sun shield, a really nice 2-point sling, recoil pad, a 5-round magazine(the original mag), four 20-round magazines(hard to find), and a box of .308 ammo. So, I've got over $2,700 in this gun.

I'm asking $2,350.00

For fastest response, call or text me at (615)four nine six-5760. Thanks. 

Note: If you send me an email, and I don't respond within a 24-hr period, I haven't gotten your email(because of my ""spam blocker""). If that happens, give me a call or text me.

Great gun, only about 200 rounds through her. I bought two cases of ammo when I had a Tantal and sold the gun but kept the ammo. I bought this and converted it and also kept the bolt hold open feature. I put the cold war era plum furniture because I thought it looked awesome and less railed out. 
It comes with 1590 rounds of surplus 5.45 (every time I fired this rifle I would scrub her down with windex) 2 brown mags which are an 8 rounder and a 9 rounder I THINK (they were converted when I bought them and didn't feed all the ammo), a bakolite mag which I plugged and 4 mag rebuild kits."

ABOUT RIFLE:
This rifle has everything you would want in a rifle but without spending upwards of $2500 on the rifle alone.  Best adjustable and crisp trigger in price under $1000.  Best bedded action and free floated barrel from a factory stock without spending money to have it glass bedded.  Best barrel rifling (5R) under 1/2"" MOA guaranteed.   Comes with a tactical oversized bolt handle from the factory.  Butt pad on the stock is so comfy you can shoot all day with no problems and combine this with a large muzzle break and this thing feels nearly like shooting  a .223/5.56.  This allows for faster follow up shots and better sight acquisition.  I researched rifles in .308 like the Remington 700, weatherby vanguard, Thompson center icon among others, and the savage 10 came out on top for me.  Hands down one of, if not best out of the box rifles made for a low to moderate budget rifle. 

Why it's for sale???

I have a savage fcpk in 308, I love the rifle and honestly don't really want to sell it but I really haven't been shooting much lately and would rather have the cash to buy a street bike, don't care for bank financing and trying to stay debt free.  The last time I shot the rifle i shot a 5 shot group 3/8"" center to center at 100yrds this is smaller than putting two of the bullets next to each other, and I'm no champion shooter...  Pretty accurate, this is shown in the photos below.  Keep in mind this a long range sniper rifle and is capable of being accurate and deadly out to 1000 yards plus.  I have $1500 in the rifle and scope setup alone...all in all everything here retail was over $2000.  Make some realistic offers...no low balls and no trades.  I will require ffl transfer or valid chl license to purchase as well as a bill of sale. 
I have about 700 rounds through this rifle.  It was broken in with care and has been cleaned regularly and put away properly.

Colt LE 6920 Rifle Specifications 

Designed specifically for lightweight mobility, speed of target acquisition, and potent firepower capability - the Colt® Law Enforcement Carbine delivers. This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military Colt M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Colt Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30.5 in (77.5 cm) in length and weighs only 6.8 lb (3.08 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's Law Enforcement Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. LE6920 comes equipped with a Magpul MBUS backup sight.

Pistol Grip Specifications 

The Pistol Grip used in this build is a mil-spec Magpul MOE Plus Pistol Grip. The MOE+ Grip combines reinforced polymer body construction with comfortable, wrap-around rubber overmolding for maximum weapon control in adverse environments. With a similar shape to a 'medium' sized MIAD, this AR15/M16 drop-in design features a hard-polymer bottom edge to reduce the possibility of equipment snags or grip damage. The MOE+ Grip accepts optional storage cores for gear stowage and includes a basic grip cap. This is the most comfortable pistol grip that Magpul makes. Don't settle for a cheap plastic pistol grip, make sure it's a Magpul.
Magazine Specifications 

The Magazine included in this build is a mil-spec Magpul PMag GEN M3. The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

Gas Block Specifications 

Yankee Hill Machine Gas Block Low Profile AR-15, LR-308 Standard Barrel .750"" Inside Diameter Steel Matte. Manufactured from high quality steel and finished with a mil spec phosphate coating, this low profile gas block makes it possible to mount a rifle length handguard to a carbine length barrel.

Free Float Quad Rail Specifications 

Yankee Hill Machine Diamond Free Float Tube Handguard Quad Rail AR-15 Aluminum Matte. These unique forearms are extremely strong, light weight forearms, they accept YHM end caps, and utilize anti-rotation screws for secure installation. The forearms and barrel nuts are made of 6061-T6 aluminum and hardcoated to military specifications. The jam nut and anti-rotation screws are steel and plated a matte black finish to match. This build also includes the Yankee Hill Machine End Cap which provides protection for the end of your forearm. It does not interfere with the free floating of the barrel and helps keep out debris.
Vertical Grip Specifications 

The Front Vertical Grip used in this build is a Bipod Grip. GPS02 Military model. Developed for military use and made from advanced, reinforced polymers, the GPS.02/Military Model is light enough to preserve weapon balance and deployment, yet still tough enough to withstand hard use, due to its hardened polymer covered stainless steel legs.
Muzzle Break Specifications 

DPMS Muzzle Brake Miculek 1/2""-28 Thread AR-15 Steel Matte. Muzzle brakes are used to increase muzzle control while also adding a custom look to any firearm with the correct muzzle thread.

Colt LE 6920 Rifle Specifications 

Designed specifically for lightweight mobility, speed of target acquisition, and potent firepower capability - the Colt® Law Enforcement Carbine delivers. This specially designed law enforcement weapon system features many of the combat proven advantages of the military Colt M4. With the 4-position buttstock fully retracted, the Colt Law Enforcement Carbine is less than 30.5 in (77.5 cm) in length and weighs only 6.8 lb (3.08 kg) - ideal for tactical deployment and traditional patrol. Colt's Law Enforcement Carbine is available with a step-cut barrel that allows it to accept a grenade launcher for non-lethal options. Furthermore, the handguard has dual aluminum shielding for more effective heat protection. LE6920 comes equipped with a Magpul MBUS backup sight.

Pistol Grip Specifications 

The Pistol Grip used in this build is a mil-spec Magpul MOE Plus Pistol Grip. The MOE+ Grip combines reinforced polymer body construction with comfortable, wrap-around rubber overmolding for maximum weapon control in adverse environments. With a similar shape to a 'medium' sized MIAD, this AR15/M16 drop-in design features a hard-polymer bottom edge to reduce the possibility of equipment snags or grip damage. The MOE+ Grip accepts optional storage cores for gear stowage and includes a basic grip cap. This is the most comfortable pistol grip that Magpul makes. Don't settle for a cheap plastic pistol grip, make sure it's a Magpul.
Magazine Specifications 

The Magazine included in this build is a mil-spec Magpul PMag GEN M3. The next-generation PMAG 30 GEN M3 is a 30-round 5.56x45 NATO (.223 Remington) polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons. Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Similar to the MOE PMAG, the GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower and constant-curve internal geometry for reliable feeding, and simple tool-less disassembly to ease cleaning. In addition, an included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage during storage and transit. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification. The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches.

This build also includes the Yankee Hill Machine End Cap which provides protection for the end of your forearm. It does not interfere with the free floating of the barrel and helps keep out debris.
Vertical Grip Specifications
