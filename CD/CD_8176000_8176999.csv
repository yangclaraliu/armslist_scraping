Product Info for Surefire Z2X Combatlight LED Flashlight w/ Momentary Tailcap Switch, 320 Lumens
The Surefire Z2X CombatLight Tactical LED Flashlight was made with tactical use in mind right from the start.

The CombatGrip design-reduced-diameter mid-section and rubber grip ring-is perfect for flashlight/handgun techniques and also provides a secure hold even with wet, cold, or gloved hands. The Surefire Z2X CombatLight Tactical LED Light features ergonomic tactical switching - press the tailcap switch for momentary-on, twist the tailcap for constant-on.

This pistol was shipped Dec.13 1944 in a shipment of 1,000 to the Transportation Officer at Springfield Armory. The finish is worn but the pistol is very good mechanically and will be an excellent candidate that you won't be afraid to take out and shoot. The pistol is 100% correct and original. All parts are original to the gun. The wear marks all line up perfectly to tell that story. The rifling and bore are very good with some light pitting from the old corrosive ammo. But nothing that will affect accuracy. This came with the accompanying 1944 Boyt holster rig and the 3 magazines shown. The rig is in excellent shape. It's hard to find an original holster in it's original russett color that hasn't been darkened by oil over the years. These generally go for $150 alone! The whole rig would cost about $250-$300 alone. It is original to the gun so must go with it as a package. Nearly impossible to find a WW2 Colt in good shape this cheap anymore! $1,850.00 plus actual shipping. I NEVER charge more than it costs ME to ship! The first ""I'll take it"" posted here and followed up with an IMMEDIATE email to me at REDACTED or call Shawn at REDACTED. Must go to an 03 C&R FFL or better. MUST BE SHIPPED OVERNIGHT UPS IF GOING TO A C&R!!!  I take USPS money orders, personal checks with CLEAR TIME (WHAT MY BANK SAYS, NOT YOURS) OR DISCREET Paypal . No credit cards on this one as it is my personal gun.  CHECK OUT MY WEBSITE AT DOGFACESUPPLY.COM FOR MORE SURPLUS ARMS AND MILITARIA!"

First imported and marketed in the United States in 1991 by ChinaSports Inc., NHM-91's were modified to meet the requirements of a 1989 Executive Order by President George H. W. Bush prohibiting importation of certain 'assault rifle' configurations of military-style semi-automatic rifles such as the Norinco AKM/AK-47. These modifications included a one-piece U.S.-made thumbhole stock to replace the separate Chinese-made buttstock and pistol grip of the original AKM/RPK rifle and the inclusion of a rivet on the receiver preventing use of standard AK-47, RPK, or AKM magazines. All Chinese rifles were banned under the 1994 Clinton administration or AWB Ban and no Chinese AK variants were allowed to be imported.Based on the Russian RPK light machine gun, the NHM features a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches (508mm) compared to the 590 mm (23.2 in) of the original RPK, along with a forward-mounted steel bipod. Like the RPK, the NHM-91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or European AKM."

No trades, only selling because I upgraded to a Remington 870 police max so I am looking to recoup some of the funds. Selling cheap to get rid of it fast, it’s a solid reliable shotgun and would be perfect for home defense or get a longer barrel and take it hunting. All laws will be followed no exceptions. Thanks."

Short story, when I started taking my son's with me target shooting over 25 years ago my boy's would always pick up the spent brass and bring it home. I decided I would start reloading someday but as many ideas it just never came to pass. All of this brass or at least 90% has been fired once by myself or by my sons the other 10% was by friends and they would dump it in our brass bucket. I spent about a month worth of weekends separating it by calibers and thats when I decided that I was never going to reload all of this, so I am parting with it. The calibers range from 380 9 mm 40 s&w 45 acp 357 mag 38 sp. 223/5.56 30.06 30mm 308 and some other odds and ends. Most has been separated by caliber and there is still a box that hasn't.

976,http://www.armslist.com/posts/8176976,For Sale:  Japanese Type 2 Paratrooper Rifle,"Clarksville, Clarksville, Tennessee","$ 2,500","Listed On: Saturday, April 7, 2018",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For your consideration is this Japanese type 2 Paratrooper Rifle. The primary difference between this rifle and the Type 99 was the fact that it had a bolt that locked the two pieces into place rather than being made of a single piece. The purpose for this was to allow the Japanese paratroopers to carry them in a bag while they jumped and then piece it together on the ground. There were only 17000 of these types of rifles made throughout the duration of the war. Compare this to the millions of K98s, M1 Garands, Nagants, and even T99s and you can understand why it’s a unique bird. The rifle still has a full imperial Chrysanthemum that has not been defaced as well as anti aircraft sites on it. Both halves Match however the bolt is ~50 numbers off from the remainder of the rifle. This is commonly seen on rifles brought back from the Pacific Campaigns as it was common procedures to confiscate the bolt while in transit back to the states. Once back they often just grabbed a random bolt assembly from a large group of readil available ones. This rifle displays well and will be a great addition to any advanced World War 2 firearm collection. I will be bringing it to the WW2 Militaria show this Saturday (Easter Weekend) if you would like to see it. Primary reason for me letting it go is to fund a WW2 era Luger, matching holster and magazines"
