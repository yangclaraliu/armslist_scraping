It is a great gun that iwas designed to be an alternative to officer size 1911 for CCW. If you know anything about Sig Sauer then you know this is a quality handgun. It use to be known as the Sig P245 but renamed it after some improvements. The magazines are interchangeable between the two however. 

I bought it thinking I was going to conceal carry it since I normally train with Sig DA/SA trigger with the decocker. Unfortunately this isn't so as I still carry my P229 or my P232 in the warmer months. Because of that, this fine piece from my collection is for sale. I paid around $850 from Nellis only a few months ago so I am asking a fair price on this as accordance to Gunbroker.

The P220 comes with the original hard case as well as the manuals and two 6 rounder magazines. It has trijicon factory nightsights and approximately 150 rounds through it and never been holster or carry. Here are the spec:

The back story on this beauty is I just bought it a few days ago, it is a 2003 model, and I bought it New Old Stock so it never been shot until today. I went to the range and shot exactly 50 rounds of WWB through but realized I like my H&K usp more so this will never leave the safe. There is nothing wrong with it and it was a bit dirty but it is all clean and lubed now.

Not interest in trades, just trying to get my money back for what I paid four days ago for it. Again, she is a gem and even a bit of a rarer piece for if you know anything about it. 

I will give a bit of history: The gun was made by Beretta in the 90's but after they acquired Stoeger, they need a new flagship gun for the new company so they ship all the equipments to make the cougar out to Turkey and now manufacture it as Stoeger Cougar. Never the less this one is the original Beretta Cougar that was made in Italy so that makes it rarer and even rarer that it has 50 rounds fired through her.

Please leave a number and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks for looking"

 Mossberg International's new lightweight Tactical .22 combines the look and feel of today's AR-style platforms with Mossberg International's reliable and affordable .22 autoloader. Taking cues from the proven 702 autoloader, the Tactical .22 matches an 18"" barrel to a quad-rail forend, giving any shooter the opportunity to easily customize the Tactical .22 with lights, lasers or any number of AR accessories currently in the marketplace. The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13"" length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4"" - 14.5"" LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights. Other features included with the Tactical .22 are sling mounts and a ten round magazine.

 Mossberg International's new lightweight Tactical .22 combines the look and feel of today's AR-style platforms with Mossberg International's reliable and affordable .22 autoloader. Taking cues from the proven 702 autoloader, the Tactical .22 matches an 18"" barrel to a quad-rail forend, giving any shooter the opportunity to easily customize the Tactical .22 with lights, lasers or any number of AR accessories currently in the marketplace. The Tactical .22 is available in two stock configurations; a fixed stock with a standard 13"" length of pull or a six-position polymer adjustable stock that offers a 10-3/4"" - 14.5"" LOP that accommodates smaller shooters as well as adults. The Tactical .22 features an integrated A2-style carry handle with rear sight and includes an optional handle-mount Picatinny rail which allows versatility in mounting scopes and other optics while providing the clearance necessary to utilize the open sights. Other features included with the Tactical .22 are sling mounts and a ten round magazine.

You have to wonder what was behind the thinking here. This is a Winchester Model 55 single-shot rifle. Chambered for the .22 Long Rifle, it's an ""automatic single-shot""...that is to say that after cocking, a single cartridge is hand loaded through the top port and upon firing the empty case is ejected through the bottom port and the action is recocked. When another shell is pushed down through the gate for loading, the safety automatically resets. The barrel measures 21-3/4"" in length and is fitted with iron sights. The walnut stock is in very good shape, free of cracks or chips, and never been sanded or refinished. The mechanics are in good working order and the bore is excellent. These were made in somewhat limited numbers between 1958-1961...a strange concept that was probably doomed from the start...but an interesting and collectible Winchester rifle.

Colorado Magazine Ban to be Heard in Committee Tuesday
Let Your Voice Be Heard and Oppose HB13-1224
HB13-1224 is proposed legislation that prohibits the sale, transfer, or possession of an ammunition feeding device capable of accepting, or that can be converted to accept, more than 10 rounds of ammunition or more than 5 shotgun shells. A hearing on this bill will be held before the House Judiciary Committee this Tuesday, Feb. 12.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation is urging all sportsmen, hunters and gun owners to attend Tuesday's public hearing to be held at the State Capitol building in the Old Supreme Court Chambers which could be adjourned as early as 9 am. NSSF urges Colorado citizens to contact their state representative, senator and all members of the House Judiciary Committee immediately, urging them to oppose this magazine ban. 
This Tuesday might be the only chance for your voice to be heard before legislators push through legislation that will seriously affect not only your Second Amendment rights, but also the magazines you use in your rifles and handguns. Colorado manufacturers will be directly affected, as well, resulting in the loss of good paying jobs and badly needed tax revenue to the state.
If this bill passes, law-abiding gun owners, retailers and manufacturers will be the only ones to comply since criminals won't abide by a magazine restriction. Arbitrarily limiting magazine capacity and threatening law-abiding gun owners with possible confiscation and felony charges represents serious legislative overreach. As part of the 1994 ""Assault Weapons"" ban, the production of higher capacity magazines was halted. A comprehensive study by the Centers for Disease Control looked at the full panoply of gun-control measures, including this ban, and concluded that none could be proven to reduce crime. Another study, commissioned by Congress, found that bans were not effective since ""the banned weapons and magazines were never used in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders.""

If you are a New York resident, and you want to buy this gun I will remove the threads from the barrel prior to sale so that the sale is safe act compliant. If you are an out of state resident where this rifle is legal, then I can sell it to you as is. 

This gun is about a year and a half old and has had only one box of ammo through it. It fed and functioned perfectly, for the little I used it. It is in excellent condition. It uses AR-15 magazines and comes with two ten round magazines. It does NOT come with the high capacity pre-ban magazines shown in the pictures. 

This is the ""CA"" model. It has a heavy contour chrome lined barrel and nice ghost ring sights.

Trades: I’m no longer interested in semi-autos, but I’d consider other firearms as trades or partial trades. I'm most interested in an Ithaca Model 37 (with 20 inch non-rifled slug barrel), a T/C Encore and H&R single shots. Feel free to email me with any questions, all trade offers will be considered.

I have 1000 rds of Lake City 5.56 62gr. green tip rounds and a box of Hornady 5.56 match for trade.  I am only interested in .308 Winchester ammo.  I would like to trade for 500 rounds of quality .308 Win (preferably Lake City).  Do not waste yours or my time with an offer of cheap or steel ammo.  Anyone who knows ammo, knows that Lake City makes quality ammo and that .308 is historically twice as much as 5.56. unless you buy match grade.  

I (along with alot of other folks) am not getting swept up in this whole ammo gouging nonsense.  Make me a fair offer and I'll most likely accept.  If you have match ammo, I don't expect 500 rounds but we can work out a number.

I have a brand new, only fired 20 times AAC handi rifle in 300 blackout w/ a Redfield Revenge 2-7x34mm on Burris Xtreme extra high rings. Purchased new in November 2012.

Marlin 1895 Guide Gun in .45-70 with about 50 rounds through it. It is in perfect condition. Purchased new December 2011.


1942 Izhevsk 91/30 Mosin Nagant w/ a Reproduction P/U scope installed by a competent gunsmith. To the eye the barrel looks brand new and Im 99.99% sure It has full rifling. It has normal wear on the stock. The bolt is bent and not a ""screw on knob"". I only have about 10-20 rounds through this one to sight in the scope, and it held a very nice 1in group at 50. Im sure if i took more time it could of been a lot better. (no corrosive ammo used) Purchased in early 2010.
*just to be clear, this is a normal wartime 91/30 and has no markings of an ""ex sniper"". I wanted to make a P/U repo and this mosin was fresh out of a crate at a local store and i picked it because It had a perfect barrel and I liked the action. 



Excellent Winchester M1917 Enfield in .30-06 marked 1-18. This rifle is absolute beautiful and is the best condition I have ever personally seen one in. The stock has only minor scratches. The finish is pretty and it shoots dead on. I really enjoy the trigger on this one, its kind of like a 2 stage. I have about 40-60 rounds through it. Purchased in early 2011.

excellent 1933 iz Hex mosin. A very beautiful mosin. I haven't shot it yet. Nice action and nice trigger. circle k and concentric 0s.

1942 Izhevsk 91/30 Mosin Nagant w/ a Reproduction P/U scope installed by a competent gunsmith. To the eye the barrel looks brand new and Im 99.99% sure It has full rifling. It has normal wear on the stock. The bolt is bent and not a ""screw on knob"". I only have about 10-20 rounds through this one to sight in the scope, and it held a very nice 1in group at 50. Im sure if i took more time it could of been a lot better. (no corrosive ammo used) Purchased in early 2010.
*just to be clear, this is a normal wartime 91/30 and has no markings of an ""ex sniper"". I wanted to make a P/U repo and this mosin was fresh out of a crate at a local store and i picked it because It had a perfect barrel and I liked the action. 



Excellent Winchester M1917 Enfield in .30-06 marked 1-18. This rifle is absolute beautiful and is the best condition I have ever personally seen one in. The stock has only minor scratches. The finish is pretty and it shoots dead on. I really enjoy the trigger on this one, its kind of like a 2 stage. I have about 40-60 rounds through it. Purchased in early 2011.

excellent 1933 iz Hex mosin. A very beautiful mosin. I haven't shot it yet. Nice action and nice trigger. circle k and concentric 0s.

Quality wise I would compare them with Remington UMC, Federal/American Eagle, or Winchester White Box.

The bullets are LEAD CORE, not steel core (a lot of rifle ranges will not allow you to use steel core ammunition). They pass the magnet test. Fully reloadable brass cases, not the unreloadable steel cases (save and sell the brass if you don't want to reload them and recoup $5-$10 per box).

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .223 ammo, I believe they will sell quickly.

In response to the need for smaller and lighter tactical sights, Aimpoint is proud to introduce the new Micro T-1 electronic red-dot sight. Built to offer the same battleproven ruggedness as larger Aimpoint sights, the Micro T-1 is able to perform under extreme conditions while adding negligible weight to your weapon.

This new compact sight is suitable for use on rifles, carbines, shotguns, submachineguns and handguns. The Aimpoint Micro T-1 is ideal as a stand-alone sight, and can also be piggybacked on top of larger magnifying scopes, night vision, or thermal imaging optics. The Micro T-1 weighs in at only 3.6 ounces, and comes complete with a patent-pending integral Picatinny mount that is keyed into the sight body to absorb recoil.

The Micro T-1 is a 1X (non magnifying) parallax-free optic that features a 4 minute of angle (MOA) red dot for fast target acquisition. No tools are required to zero the sight, as the top of the caps covering the windage and elevation screws fit directly into holes on the adjustment screws to make the adjustment. The Micro T-1 is waterproof to 25 meters (80 feet) and tough enough to stand up to the worst field conditions. Optimized for use with all generations of night vision devices, the Micro T-1 features a manual adjustment switch with 6 night vision compatible settings and 7 daylight settings (including one extra bright setting for use in desert sunlight or with laser protection filters). Aimpoint s state-of-the-art ACET diode technology allows the Micro T-1 to operate continuously for over 5 years on a single CR-2032 battery(May come as Duracell DL2032 or Energizer ECR2032).

The barrel is stamped “Western Auto Supply Co.”  Sometime in the 1940s or 1950s, or possibly earlier, Western Auto started selling rifles and sold until the 1970’s from my research.

in Turkey by Ucyildiz Arms.  The MKA 1919 not only resembles the M16 rifle
but the control and function are similar.  The MKA 1919 is unlike any other
12 gauge shotgun in the U.S. as it is very light, ergonomic, and magazine
fed.  The MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun uses a conventional gas-operated
action which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel.
 The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is
concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard.  The MKA 1919 barrel can be
very easily removed from the upper receiver.   The upper receiver is
manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, pistol grip,
and stock are manufactured as one piece from impact resistant polymer.  The
MKA 1919 comes with two 5-round metal detachable magazines and 3 internal
chokes.  The magazine release button mimics the M16 rifle location.  The
manual safety also duplicates the M16 style being located on the left side
of the receiver above the pistol grip.  The top of the receiver has a
carrying handle and  integral picatinny rail for mounting rear sights, or
any optical accessories.  The MKA 1919 12 gauge shotgun is appropriate for
all levels of hunting and sporting enthusiasts.

This is Ultramax bulk ammo purchased from Dicks.  I sold my AR's a while back and it has been sitting in my safe since.  It does have some Hornady rounds mixed in (maybe 15 rounds), so the round count is actually higher than 100.  I have no use for it now and know that .223 ammo is out of stock everywhere and I could use the money.  My price is firm at $50 and thats more than fair if you look at some of the prices on these posts.  Not to mention EVERY website is out of stock.

The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. 

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation.
