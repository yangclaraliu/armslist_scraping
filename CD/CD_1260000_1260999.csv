Price is $7 per box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

I personally haven't seen any .22LR for sale in a retail store in about 2 months. The only reason I have these is they were purchased a while ago. These are likely the last ones I'll have for sale for a long time.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .22lr ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't delay. These are going FAST.

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales. You will need to take all 19 boxes for me to ship (not worth the hassle to ship a smaller quantity).

Remington Mohawk Hi-Speed round nose- 11 boxes
Remington Thunderbolt 40 grain 1255fps round nose- 5 boxes
Remington Subsonic 38 grain 1050fps round nose- 3 boxes

Price is $7 per box FIRM. If I can't get what I'm asking I'll just hold onto them, I'm in no rush.

I personally haven't seen any .22LR for sale in a retail store in about 2 months. The only reason I have these is they were purchased a while ago. These are likely the last ones I'll have for sale for a long time.

These are listed on gunbroker as well, and based on the current availability of .22lr ammo, I believe they will sell quickly. If you don't want to wait 3-6+ months to get ammo for your rifle, don't delay. These are going FAST.

I will be happy to ship this ammo @ prevailing Fedex Ground cost (email me with quantity and zip code if you need a shipping quote). Payment to be made by USPS money order for all non-FTF sales. You will need to take all 19 boxes for me to ship (not worth the hassle to ship a smaller quantity).

Butch Searcy has been building rifles for over 30 years. When he first designed and built his own rifle in 1993, his goal was to produce an extremely reliable, accurate, and affordable tool for serious hunters. Searcy rifles are built in Boron, California with 100% American-made parts, earning their nickname ""The All-American Double Rifle."" Searcy rifles are CNC-machined with receivers of 416 stainless steel, PAC-NOR barrels, fine wood from Jim Preslick or Luxus Walnut Co., and sights from New England Custom Guns. This combo includes a 24"" .500/.416 Nitro Express barrel, a 24"" .500, 3-1/4"" Nitro Express barrel, both with fixed sights, and a Leica 1.75-6x32mm scope with Duplex cosshairs and quick-release scope-mounting rings. The rifle's wood and metal are in good condition and its bore is in very good condition."

I bought it used and not sure how many rounds were put through it before I got it but it looked pretty clean when I got it. 
I originally got this gun to be used as a combination home defense weapon and a CCW but it's bigger than I want for CCW. I'm not desperate to sell or anything but since magazines, especially 20-round ones, can be hard to come by I figured that combined with a nice, clean subcompact there'd be someone interested in giving it a new home.

Send me an OFFER. Worse I can say is no. I'll also take trades for other rifles in 308, 30-06, 270, gas generators, etc.

I bought this off another person planning to make this into a project rifle but things change and I need to sell this rifle. It's a very nice rifle with synthetic stock. Rough enough to take out into the brush without worries of scratching it up. 

It's a 300WSM caliber meant to take down large game. If you intend to hunt large game or are into long range shooting, this rifle is for you. This rifle has a lot of different versatile ammo you can choose from w/ more than plenty knock-down power you'll ever need. 

Has a very nice recoil pad to absorb all recoil. The trigger is extremely smooth with no creep. Feels like a 2.5lb (same as my featherweight m70). The Bolt and action is very tight and smooth with no sloppiness. Bolt is jeweled and very slick. You wont be disappointed. 

What you receive when purchased:
---Rifle only (no scope, no rings, bipod)
---Custom machine muzzle break ($80 value)
---The 20MOA piccatinny ($50) rail 

I put the scope show. The 20MOA piccatinny ($50) rail is brand new and so is the Bushnell XTR 600 DOA Reticle ($200). Belongs on my other rifle. The bushnell 600 DOA allows hold overs for shots at 100-200-300-400-500-600 yards without doping (adjusting elevation) the scope in each and every time."

This Mac11/9mm is new only had 25 rnds thru it and stored for some time, upgraded 16"" barrel with heat shield fore guard for accuracy, if you know Mac's, the sights suck so I had a Green laser installed, you can now hip fire & hit bulls-eye's, green laser is visible in daylight & really adds the ""holy shit factor""

Mac 11/9mm are also known for bad trigger & horrendous trigger slap, this did actually make my finger sting after 4 rounds, so I had a gunsmith give it a trigger job that not only gave it a clean crisper break, but go rid of the trigger slap
Nice gun now, really quite compared to my 9mm pistol & waaaay more accurate, perfect close quarters home defense weapon.

comes with 2 Cobray 32 rnd mags and 3 new ProMags 32 rnd magazines, I feel the ProMag are actually better mags & come with a lifetime guarantee.

Also comes with  Urban Cammo Hard Cover Locking Case
This cool fur lined lockable Tennis Racket Case is new and  actually a better gun case than my true gun case's,  Velcro straps hold the Mac11 and the tennis ball compartment holds 100rnds

 To those who believe that personal defense starts with the numbers ""4"" and ""5"" (and in that order) the GLOCK model 21 has been the answer to their prayers. Compensated/ported for excellent controllability. To many Americans, there is only one caliber for a personal defense handgun and that''s the .45 Auto. GLOCK acknowledged that sentiment with the development of the GLOCK 21. The magazine capacity is 10 rounds.
 Constructed in the Glock factory, the Glock 21C features the ultimate American round: the .45 AUTO. Built with exclusively top grade materials to the strict specifications of the master gunsmiths at Glock, this Glock .45 pistol has compensator slits at the top of its slide to reduce recoil, allowing faster second shot recovery and more control in rapid fire situations. The Glock 21C.45 also features:
• Glock “Safe Action” Trigger System
• Overall Length: 193mm/7.59”
• Overall Height: 139mm/5.47”
• Width: 32.5mm/1.27”

With a 1 in 7” twist, ammunition selection is virtually unlimited. Colt teamed up with Magpul Industries to outfit this carbine with the most highly sought after accessories.

I have for sale brand new in the box Colt M4 LE 6920 LE carbine chambered in 5.56MM. This is identical to the M4 used by the US armed forces with just one exception; this rifle only fires semi-automatic .  All the internals and components are the same as the US Government rifles, the only difference being semi auto v. select fire. This is the rifle Colt markets to law enforcement agencies across the world. Again, this is a true Mil Spec rifle, not a civilian knock off AR. The rifle is absolutely brand new and was only taken out of the box to take the pictures. The rifle has never been fired and comes with a  factory Magpul 30 round magazine, rear flip up sight, fore grip, box, papers, and all accessories from the factory.

MADE IN 1897, 24"" octagonal barrel with ORIGINAL OPTIONAL BEECH combination front sight and buckhorn rear. Round top receiver marked ""MARLIN 1897"" on the tang, has a serial # in the first 3000 made. Full length tube magazine (squeeze latch type) holds OVER 20 long rifles AND a mixture of shorts longs, and LR's can be loaded in the tube together and feed properly. The finish is grey/brown more than blue, the bore has nice rifling but some darkness, as not all boys could afford ""KLEENBORE"" ammo. The action is smooth and tight. The black walnut stock and fore arm look good BUT there is a 1/4"" X 1"" chip off the heel. It doesn't look bad but it's there and an imperfection. The rifle shows honest wear from use, never polished, the patina is pleasing. Like all MARLIN lever .22's, IT'S A TAKE DOWN, so easy to clean and maintain and it will keep on shooting despite the age while those fancy ""ASSAULT .22""s ARE JAMMING. SORRY, I CAN'T DO PICTURES.

Description from the Remington site:
The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Our Exclusive ArmorLokt™ process seal the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

For 2010, our new Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18 1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem™ Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail.
