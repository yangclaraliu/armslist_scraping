If you're unsure what exactly that means you'll have to watch a YouTube video on it because it's hard to explain with just words. I picked the gun up new at the beginning of February. It's a great gun but I just got a performance center shield that I carry. This model has the real deal tritium night sights. Some models have the glow paint, which in my opinion aren't true night sights. I also have a +1 pinky extender that I had to order extra and that cost me around 30 bucks. This model with tritium sights on Grabagun is around 650 which is very cheap. In gun  shops they usually charge well over 700. I'm really looking for a fair trade but I'd prob take 550 cash. Guns I'm interested in are...chiappa rhino 200 or 300ds.sig 229,226, 220, arex zero 1, m&p9 2.0. Really I'd be open to any modern guns that aren't true subcompacts.

Free shipping.Check out the video on the Fox Kives website to see the Emerson Wave feature and to see how nasty this knife is.From the manufacturer's website:The Fox 479 G10 Black Folding Karambit is the best self-defense tool and utility knife utilizing the most effective and effecient advancement in the knife industry today: The patented Emerson Wave. When removed from the pocket, this wave shaped protrusion on the spine of the blade catches the edge of the pocket, instantly deploying the blade with only one hand without the use of springs! It doesn't get any faster than that in a self-defense situation.Manufactured by Fox Knives in Maniago, Italy, using one the highest quality and strongest steels: NC690Co Stainless Steel. This provides a fine and consistent edge, enhanced edge retention and sharpening receptivity, and corrosion resistance for those far off and exreme locations. The Fox Karambit Model 479 features a retention ring that can be used for blunt force impact as well as a more sure and secure grip.The tiger claw shaped and black teflon coated blade provides devestatingly sharp tip and blade surface with a thickness of .12"" and 3"" in length, offering a total of 7.5"" when fully extended, and 5"" when closed. It utilizes a liner lock and weighs in at a mere 4.02oz. The adjustable pocket clip allows ambidextrous use. It designed for tip-up carry with the Emerson Wave feature for fast deployment in a reverse grip to most effectively utilize its slashing power from its pocketed resting position in an upward motion, but can also be utilized in the forward grip.This tool has been field tested in the most extreme climates and and proven to be of the highest quality on the market today. Whether you need to a utility knife to open boxes or clamshell packaging, or a self-defense tool to open a can of whoop ass, the Fox karambit is a force to be reckoned with of the highest quality and the most reliability in any situation where a need arises."

Caliber: 380
 
Condition: Terrific!
 
 
 
Bersa has beem one of the best defensive pistol bargains on the market for several years now.
 
Top-notch set of features:
 
Double-action/single-action semi-automatic with many similarities to the Walther PPK, famously carried by the fictional secret agent James Bond.
 
Sharp looking green grips.  Upgraded rubber grips for an excellent, sure grip.
 
Slide features a rounded muzzle for easy holstering
 
3-dot sight system and rear cocking serrations.
External controls consist of a slide catch, round magazine release button and combination thumb safety/decocker are placed on the left side of the frame with the takedown lever located on the right side.
 
Safety lever automatically decocks the exposed hammer when it is pressed down into the ""Safe"" position, resulting in a double-action trigger pull for the first shot. Feels smooth and consistent throughout the arc of travel. After the first shot is fired, the hammer is cocked and ready to operate in single-action mode. Lots of added upgrades usually reserved for more pricey models. The metallic front sight is dovetailed into the slide. The adjustable rear sight has a small screw for windage adjustments instead of being drift adjustable or fixed in place. The top of the slide is checkered to reduce glare.
 
The front and back of the grip frame are grooved for improved purchase as is the face of the trigger.
 
Extended beavertail protects the shooter's hand from hammer bite.
 
The front edge of the roomy trigger guard is curved and textured to act as a finger rest.
 
The magazine release button is deeply checkered for positive operation.
Some little 380s hold just six or seven rounds in the magazine. The Bersa Thunder takes an eight-round magazine that ships with an extended finger rest to ensure a firm three-finger grip. The features, fit and function all add up to a gun that give you plenty of bang for the buck.  
 
Dismantling this pistol is quite simple. Swing and hold the takedown lever down in the 6 o'clock position while pulling back and up on the slide. The rear of the slide lifts off.
 
Handling: the combination of this pistol's smooth, clean trigger, comfortable grip and moderate levels of felt recoil left me wanting more time at the range instead of less.  Slim, light and comfortable on the hip. It feels so well balanced and the grip fits your hands comfortably. It's an ideal option for self-defense practitioners who are new to shooting or those who have been pulling triggers for years.   
 
Utterly reliable! !

Style: CompactCaliber:  9 mm

Springfield compact carry. A practical carry gun upon which you can bet your life.

Built with Springfield’s legendary reliability and workmanship!  Includes heavy plastic case from factory, TWO magazines, paper work it came with, etc.Condition:  EXCELLENT!

 

FEATURES:

Proven 3-dot sights. Fully Supported Ramp sights.  Front and rear sights are dovetailed into the steel of the slide.

 

Springfield’s famous comfortable ergonomics and grip angle.

TWO factory magazines: There is one a finger grip extension that holds 12 rounds. A second mag that holds 9 rounds makes the pistol smaller and is flush with frame.
In the accuracy department, the Springfield Sub-Compact is tremendous!  Many say better that Glock.
 
Safeties: Grip safety, the gun can only be fired when the hand firmly depresses the safety located at the rear of the handle.  Patented Ultra Safety Assurance trigger system, which guards against accidental discharge. The USA only allows the gun to be fired when direct rearward pressure is applied to the trigger, eliminating the possibility of an accidental discharge if the gun is dropped or bumped. The XD has a striker status indicator that protrudes from the rear of the steel slide when the striker mechanism is cocked. In addition, it has a loaded chamber indicator, which is a thin piece of metal that pops up when a round is in the chamber.
 
Picatinny rail for mounting a laser, light, and other accessories.
 
Dual spring and guide rod system - less torque is placed upon the guide rod and spring.
 
Weighing a little more than the Glock, the Springfield Sub-Compact manages recoil more confidently than the Glock, enabling accurate “follow-up” shots.

Note the absence of machine marks, a characteristic of higher end firearms.
FEATURES: Safeties:  ambidextrous safety on both sides of frame. 
Military style sights.
Loaded chamber indicator along side barrel.
Single and double action. Single action has a nice clean break -- it’s short, light (about five pounds) and crisp!
Real hammer fired – this is the classic hammer you can pull back with your thumb and actually feel and see firing the gun, a feature favored by many shooters as a more authentic shooting experience.
Breech-locking mechanism uses a Walther-style tilting locking block.
Construction: Steel barrel and slide.  Sturdy metal alloy frame.   No plastic guns here!
5 inch barrel and military/ergonomic frame achieves legendary pointability and accuracy.
Recoil is very manageable. Strong, planted grip with checkered wood grips means that the recoil does not snap or kick  --  more of a ""push"" and really cushions the recoil.  Even shooters accustomed to a lighter round will be able to handle it very easily.
Beautiful Brazilian Walnut Grips!
Double stack, high capacity magazine.
Field stripping is a snap, using Beretta’s sure-footed, quick lever takedown that easily removes the slide from the frame. From there, the recoil spring, guide tube and barrel are easily removed.
Unbeatable Taurus lifetime warranty (transferrable to all subsequent owners). 
Carry options: Drop the hammer all the way down and carry it chambered, hammer down, off safe for a first double action shot.  You can also keep the safety on, then thumb it off with and have a first double action shot.  If you are a 1911 fan, then you can also carry cocked and locked which is the hammer cocked, safety on with a first shot being single action.
Includes high capacity magazine.* * This item is for sale.  It is not necessary to ask if it is still available.  If you are reading the ad, it is available.(No trades. No silly low offers – these messages will not be returned.)"

Size: Medium frame. 

Flexible platform: Comes with extended 13 round magazine with custom Springfield Mag X-tension sleeve – this is like a full size weapon.  Or you can buy the shorter magazine that holds 10 rounds (without the extension sleeve) -- this transforms the gun into a smaller, easier to carry weapon.

XD®’s come loaded with features that set them apart from the competition. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator give the shooter instant tactile and visual feedback about the condition of the pistol. This means you can know at a glance – or at a touch – if there is a chambered round and if the striker is cocked. Three separate safeties guard against accidental discharges and provide extra peace of mind. The Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ prevents unintentional rearward movement of the trigger. The grip safety keeps the pistol from firing unless the shooter has a firm grasp on it. And an internal firing pin block goes the extra mile to bring you a pistol fully designed with safety in mind.

The accessory rail that comes standard on every XD® gives you the flexibility to mount a light, laser or other accessory on your pistol. An ambidextrous magazine release means the XD® doesn’t care whether or not you’re a lefty. And the high polish stainless steel magazines drop free with refreshing eagerness.* This item is for sale.  It is not necessary to ask if it is still available.  If you are reading the ad, it is available.(No trades.

From their website:
Springfield Armory® XD45 is an ergonomically designed Semi-Auto Pistol that is extremely accurate, points naturally, and offers great controllability when firing the powerful 45 ACP cartridge. Springfield XD semi-automatic pistols have durable polymer frames and Melonite®-coated forged steel slides for long-lasting durability and reliability. An integral accessory rail in front of the trigger guard accommodates tactical lights and laser sights. The XD has a grip safety and an articulated safety lever built into the trigger to prevent accidental discharge; and a loaded chamber indicator and striker status indicator give both visual and tactile indication whether the gun is loaded and ready to fire in any lighting condition. Posi-wedge slide serrations provide a solid hold on the slide when loading and unloading the pistol. Three dot steel sights, dovetailed to the slide, provide rapid sight acquisition. The Springfield Armory XD45 Semi-Auto Pistol is simple to takedown for cleaning and maintenance. The pistol comes with one stainless steel magazine. An ambidextrous magazine release drops the mag from either side."

This would be an amazing shooter Python. I've learned a lot about this gun in the last few weeks. Things that I know:1) The serial numbers match. I'll provide it to those interested;2) Colt didn't use Nickel as a finish until 1960. What you're looking at is a gun that was originally Royal Blue, and has been re-finished in Nickel. The finish has no blemishes or wear;3) The grips aren't original. They're aftermarket. They don't even appear to be the exact same wood on each panel. They ARE the same model or style. They have no blemishes or wear;4) The front and rear sights aren't original. They're more of the style of the 60's and forward. They look brand new without blemishes or wear;5) The cylinder action is tight and clean. The trigger pull is crisp and has a clean break;6) The gun has been in my family's possession for at least 5 years. It hasn't been fired in that time;7) I personally spent hours recently meticulously cleaning it with solvents and oils that won't hurt Nickel or wood;  8) No box. No case;9) No trades. Cash Only. Local Pickup desired; and10) State ID and CCW Permits and written agreement required. You'll get a copy. If no valid State of Ohio CCW permit, buyer purchases and submits to Licensed FFL transfer. Non-negotiable. If you have any questions, please ask. I can take pictures of whatever you want. The price is firm. This is not a collector Python, but an amazing shooter just waiting to be taken out for a match, or just an hour at the range. I want this snake to go to a good home where someone will care for it and USE it. Thanks for looking!"
