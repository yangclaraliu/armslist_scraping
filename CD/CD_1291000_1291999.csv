The Samozaryadnaya Vintovka Tokareva (SVT-40) was designed by Soviet Arms Designer Fedor Tokarev. It was manufactured between 1941 and 1945. The SVT-40 is an improved and simplified rifle design over the SVT-38. During WWII SVT-40 rifles were highly prized captures by both German and Finnish troops. Many pictures in books of German troops on the eastern front carrying the SVT-40. The biggest issue with the SVT 40 is the ejection of the spent casing due to improper gas cartridge adjustment and improper powder loads. DO NOT use any loads over 150 grain as this will destroy the gas chamber. Overall condition is rated as fair to good for an old surplus military rifle that will never be imported again into the USA. 10 magazine is an aftermarket, so not all original, all other numbers match THAT I CAN TELL. Wood stock has 3 cracks/splits at rear top of receiver and at bottom of mag well. Gun has some surface rust spots. I would grade gun and bore as fair to good condition."

It even has a Toyoda Jidoshoki Seisakusho marked bayonet and a small cotton flag hanging from it. 

This is one of the cleanest bringback examples I have ever seen. The stock has some bumps and nicks and overall it is a little dusty from being displayed, but it's not every day you will find one like this!

Have three items I don't need, hoping you have something I do need.

#1: Mossberg Model 85 bolt action shotgun

20 gauge shotgun from the 1930s. Really cool old gun, not in amazing shape but had it at the range last week and it works. Bought it so my girlfriend could try something lower power than my 12 gauge. She didn't really like it, so moving on. More on that later.

#2: Ramline 50 round magazine for Ruger 10/22 USED

Shooting 50 in a row is cool! But, don't really need it as I have plenty of other mags. Used, sometimes has a hard time feeding rounds 49 and 50 depending on the ammo, but works fine otherwise.

#3: Box of Federal Bulk .22LR ammo: 325 rounds

Selling all three items for $225.00. If you want only part, make an offer.

TRADE!! What I REALLY want is a .22 lr handgun of some sort, next idea for the girlfriend to try. Willing to to trade up or down. Up for Ruger MKII, Walther P22, or similar. Down for H&R 929 sidekick or similar. No mini-revolvers or derringers. Let me know what you have and an offer.

NOTE: Probably not going to sell the .22 ammo on its own, but will include as part of a trade.

There are a lot of weapons listed, for instance the DPMS carbine listed on Saturday the 16th that comes with a drum mag, 5 PMAGs, a bayonet and lug, and telescoping stock.  I have offered to purchase this weapon as out out-of-state buyer where the weapon and accessories will be transferred in PA where they are legal, and will remain after sale.  So far I have had no response, which leads me to believe that the buyer is either too lazy to drive to an FFL in PA to conduct the sale, or too lazy to have the buyer (me) pay shipping for an FFL in NY to transfer the weapon and all accessories to an FFL in PA where I can then pick it up.  One would think an offer to buy would solicit a response.

... or the seller is an investigator trying to collar a few people with a felony for the crime of exercising one's right to arms and right to property.  This ""seller"" wants the transaction to take place in NY most likely so his buddies dressed up as mall ninjas can give the prospective buyer a free pair of silver bracelets.

Stay vigilant, gentlemen.  While many police are honorable people who will exercise good judgement in the course of their duties, there are liberal district attorneys and other officers in the state police who will take the stance that ""the law is the law,"" and will actively try to ruin someone's life who is only trying to acquire an AR or AK before the registration period ends in 2014 because they were not afforded the ability to buy one with Cuomo's blitzkrieg legislative tactic.  They will actively try to enforce the largely unenforceable ban on private sales by conducting sting operations with plenty of press coverage to keep others from selling their property to others before the registration period closes.

It's quite simple, conduct your private sales out of state... all it takes is a little extra time and gas money.  I would be extremely leery of sellers who are unwilling to ship to an FFL out of state, or are unwilling to conduct the transaction out of state, especially when the accessories are not legal in NYS."

This guitar plays like a dream and sounds incredible. It is absolutely Gorgeous and any guitarist would be proud to show up playing this baby.

The not as good.....
I have arthritis in my right hand and since this guitar was made by me,Unfortunately there are a couple of unnoticeable cosmetic blunders that you probably wouldn't notice unless you were looking for them.
one is the string ferrells on the back of the guitar are just a little out of line, A small gap just below the bridge plate (most teles have this) and a paint chip around the input cup.(which I painted). and a crack in the paint around the neck cavity.
None of these effect the playability of this Guitar. It notes perfect and the tone is so sweet,has very low string height. light weight and no shims were used in setting this guitar up.

Also have this Guitar listed another  CG.....

I just got a full size 1911 so I'm not feeling the need to keep this handgun.  Made in Bellevue, WA in the 80's this is an older, original Detonics, that will only grow in value.  In great condition.  The person I bought it from had only put maybe 50 rounds through it and I probably haven't even done that.  It has quite a kick but is super reliable and accurate.  6 + 1.  Comes with original factory box, one factory stainless 6-round mag and one factory blued 6-round mag.  I will also include an Uncle Mike's holster and black hard shell case.  Asking $825 or best offer.  Can email or call 802-350-thirtythirty."

Its in great condition, shoots great, no rust except minimal wear on front sight. I have shot 100s of rounds through it with no FTFs or FTEs. Kept well cleaned & oiled & in a safe.
Comes with 3 32rd magazines & a sling (not pictured). I also have limited quantities of 9mm ammo I could sell with the firearm.
I may consider trades but there isn't much I'm looking for, maybe a quality FAL or might consider partial cash trades for a Beretta Nano or FS92. It never hurts to ask!

This gun has been used so there is areas of bluing that have been rubbed through and dings in the wood. There are no major gouges or dents and the gun performs perfect. No operational issues at all. 
There is some minor corrosion at the end of the forcing cones in both tubes other than that the tubes are bright. I don’t know how the last owner cleaned the gun but after shooting a round of clays I run a brass brush in the barrels, wipe them out, and the put a light film of oil through and have had no issues at all.

The SCAR-L, for ""light"", is chambered in the 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and the SCAR-H, for ""heavy"", fires 7.62×51mm NATO. Both are available in Long Barrel and Close Quarters Combat variants.

The FN SCAR systems completed low rate initial production testing in June 2007.[11] After some delays, the first rifles began being issued to operational units in April 2009, and a battalion of the US 75th Ranger Regiment was the first large unit deployed into combat with 600 of the rifles in 2009.[12] The US Special Operations Command has currently cancelled their purchase of the Mk 16 SCAR-L and are planning to remove the rifle from their inventory by 2013. However, they plan to purchase 5.56 mm conversion kits for the Mk 17, supplanting the loss of the Mk 16.[13] The SCAR is now one of the competing weapons in the Individual Carbine competition which aims to find a replacement for the M4 Carbine.[14]
