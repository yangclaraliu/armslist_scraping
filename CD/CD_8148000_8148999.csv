I hate to part with it, but I need to put money towards something else this week, so have to let it go. A just bought it brand new a short time ago & have the papers for it, but I've been so busy I never even got to go to the firing range to use it.First gun I ever bought or had to sell, so obviously I'm not a dealer.Here's some specs I've pulled up:The SR9c is a stricker-fired, compact, double-stack design. The grip is only 1.18″ thick, making it one of the thinnest double-stack handguns available.Overall length is 6.85″ (barrel is 3.5″), width (across safety levers) is 1.27″, height is 4.61″ It weighs just 23.4 oz. CaliberThis version of the SR series is chambered for 9mm.  Muzzle rise is reduced due to a low slide profile. Overall it is a very easy and fun gun to shoot.There are numerous safety features on this handgun. It has a Glock-like “trigger within the trigger”, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, magazine disconnect (more on this later), plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator on the top of the slide.It also has an ambidextrous manual thumb safety."

The stock isn't difficult to take apart but is very time consuming. I shoot alot and a couple hours to clean the .22 isnt worth it for me.

The muzzle device pictured is not included and will be replaced with the birdcage it came with.This rifle is unfired. Edit to add: Emails asking if I still have it will be ignored. If you are seeing this, it is still available. Also, I realize stuff happens, but if you come at me all like ""I want this!"" and for whatever reason, you decide against it, please be courteous enough to let me know you changed your mind. Stopping all communication is a crappy way to back out. If you let know you no longer want it, I can move on to other potential buyers/traders. Thank you.I ask that the buyer not be prohibited from owning a firearm. I would like to see proof of residency and a CWP. I don't mind meeting NC residents at an FFL, but I would like to keep my drive under an hour, one way.Trades considered, but please try to be fairly close to equal value."
