This is a dual/single action pistol so you can carry one in the chamber without it being cocked, and all you have to do is flip the safety off and pull the trigger. Hold 9 rounds. Shoots 9x18 or 9mm Makarov, which is the same thing.  I bought this gun new and shot about 10 clips through it or so. It is really accurate.  I put an aftermarket spring kit in it.  It is aluminum framed, not plastic, with a steel slide. Extremely reliable, never a jam or ftf.  Very easy to break down and is light.

I thought someday it may become something unique following the expired ban. I have noticed through the years several other types of the AR pistols have become available on the market. 

The latest Type 97S offered by Bushmaster has a ribbed hand guard, whereas this one is smooth. There are other variants of the Bushmaster pistol without hand guards, and one without the lower rails. These were offered for less money.

Before posting this Bushmaster for sale, I searched other websites offering these Bushmaster pistols for sale and haven’t been successful. Not in stock and no back order. My best guess is if you want a Bushmaster 97S pistol like mine you are likely to buy one here on Armslist or another auction.

I believe I priced this one $100 below all other listings for a quick sale. I am asking $997. If you can find one in stock at a lower price please send me the link to verify and I will let the Bushmaster go for that price once verified.

I will include 5 new 20 round magazines with the 30 round factory magazine for the right price. Again this is new unfired and flawless.

Pricing is firm.

What's Included:
Qty 1 - Smith & Wesson M&P 15 Sport - Like New Condition - Maybe 1000 rounds fired through it.
Qty 1 - NCStar 4x32 P4 Sniper Scope
Qty 10 - MagPul PMags - Each magazine has had perhaps 90 rounds fired from it for testing.
Qty 1 - 100-round double-drum magazine - Has only had 100 rounds fired from it for testing.
Qty 1 - LULA Magazine loader
Qty 2000 - Federal XM193BK 5.56 55gr FMJ ammo
Qty 135 - Federal .223 Remington 50gr JHP ammo

If you buy the entire kit all at once, I will throw in a UTC 26"" Covert Carry Bag and 15 rounds of Green Tip Penetrator rounds for free.

M&P 15 Details:
This AR-15 is the Smith & Wesson ""Sport"" model. That means it has the Magpul flip-up rear sight, does not have a dust cover, no forward assist, and the barrel is lined with melonite instead of chrome. The stock handguard has been replaced with a Magpul MOE. I will include the stock handguard with it. It also comes with one 30-round PMAG. I will also include an NCStar 4x32 scope with red/green illuminated reticle and bullet drop compensator.

Condition: I have not fired more than 1000 rounds through this rifle. The first 150 rounds were fired 30 at a time, slowly, with a quick barrel cleaning between each set of 30. It has only been fired rapidly twice, less than 100 rounds each time. It has been treated very gently. Basically, it comes to you in ""like new"" condition, used enough to prove that it functions flawlessly, but not enough to create any wear.

100-round magazine details:
This is identical, to, but is not the BETA brand magazine. Fits 100 rounds, comes with loader, tubes of graphite, magazine cover, and carrying case. I loaded this magazine up once, fired 100 rounds at the range, cleaned it, reloaded it, and stored it.

2000 rounds of Federal XM193BK 5.56x45mm NATO 55 grain FMJBT:
 - 1 box of bulk packaged ammo, 1000 rds.
 - 5 bags of loose ammo, 200 rds each.
**Sold in 200-round bags minimum**

135 rounds of Federal American Eagle .223 Rem 50 Gr Jacketed Hollow Point
 - 1 bag of loose ammo.


Separate Pricing:
Note: I will NOT sell any ammo separately until the rifle is gone. Want the ammo but not the rifle? Find a buddy who wants the rifle and bring him along.
Rifle, 1 PMag, and Scope: $850
PMags: $30 each
100-round magazine: $225
Federal XM193BK 5.56: $0.70/round **only after the AR-15 is gone**

As a gun community we need to come together to rid ourselves of one of the deadliest sins - greed. We are all tired of seeing $500 AK-47s listed at $2000, and $800 fully upgraded AR-15s posted for $4500. Guess what? As gun buyers and members on this and other forums, we are just as responsible for the state of our society as the price gougers and hoarders. We need to come together and do two thing: (1) STOP BUYING AT THESE RIDICULOUS PRICES and (2) click on the ad, go to ""Flag"" at the top, and press ""overpriced."" This whole process takes 1.3968 seconds.

These price criminals only have business if someone is ignorant enough to buy and if they spread their advertisement. NOTE TO GUN COMMUNITY: Guns aren't going anywhere. Ammo isn't going anywhere. Magazines are the biggest threat of changing but let's face it, do we really need 100 round drums or is that more of a want? Every time you skip over a $10,000 ad for a $3000 purchased SCAR 17, you have just became part of the problem. Send them a hate email showing the prices before hoarding and then promptly flag their ad so we can get prices back under the 1000s where they all belong. For the uninformed or misinformed audience, I have put together a short list of reasonable prices for standard guns. What I am asking is that everyone read this post and then immediately copy and paste it to another state's listing in the US. Add your own two cents in if you'd like or if I got anything wrong. The regularity will only return if we make it.

Pricing is firm.

Qty 1 - Smith & Wesson M&P 15 Sport - Like New Condition - Maybe 1000 rounds fired through it.
Qty 1 - NCStar 4x32 P4 Sniper Scope
Qty 10 - MagPul PMags - Each magazine has had perhaps 90 rounds fired from it for testing.
Qty 1 - 100-round double-drum magazine - Has only had 100 rounds fired from it for testing.
Qty 1 - LULA Magazine loader

If you buy the entire kit all at once, I will throw in a UTC 26"" Covert Carry Bag and 15 rounds of Green Tip Penetrator rounds for free.

M&P 15 Details:
This AR-15 is the Smith & Wesson ""Sport"" model. That means it has the Magpul flip-up rear sight, does not have a dust cover, no forward assist, and the barrel is lined with melonite instead of chrome. The stock handguard has been replaced with a Magpul MOE. I will include the stock handguard with it. It also comes with one 30-round PMAG. I will also include an NCStar 4x32 scope with red/green illuminated reticle and bullet drop compensator.

Condition: I have not fired more than 1000 rounds through this rifle. The first 150 rounds were fired 30 at a time, slowly, with a quick barrel cleaning between each set of 30. It has only been fired rapidly twice, less than 100 rounds each time. It has been treated very gently. Basically, it comes to you in ""like new"" condition, used enough to prove that it functions flawlessly, but not enough to create any wear.

100-round magazine details:
This is identical, to, but is not the BETA brand magazine. Fits 100 rounds, comes with loader, tubes of graphite, magazine cover, and carrying case. I loaded this magazine up once, fired 100 rounds at the range, cleaned it, reloaded it, and stored it.

2000 rounds of Federal XM193BK 5.56x45mm NATO 55 grain FMJBT:
 - 1 box of bulk packaged ammo, 1000 rds.
 - 5 bags of loose ammo, 200 rds each.
**Sold in 200-round bags minimum**

135 rounds of Federal American Eagle .223 Rem 50 Gr Jacketed Hollow Point
 - 1 bag of loose ammo.


Separate Pricing:
Note: I will NOT sell any ammo separately until the rifle is gone. Want the ammo but not the rifle? Find a buddy who wants the rifle and bring him along.
Rifle, 1 PMag, and Scope: $850
PMags: $30 each

Pricing is firm.

Qty 1 - Smith & Wesson M&P 15 Sport - Like New Condition - Maybe 1000 rounds fired through it.
Qty 1 - NCStar 4x32 P4 Sniper Scope
Qty 10 - MagPul PMags - Each magazine has had perhaps 90 rounds fired from it for testing.
Qty 1 - 100-round double-drum magazine - Has only had 100 rounds fired from it for testing.
If you buy the entire kit all at once, I will throw in a UTC 26"" Covert Carry Bag and 15 rounds of Green Tip Penetrator rounds for free.

M&P 15 Details:
This AR-15 is the Smith & Wesson ""Sport"" model. That means it has the Magpul flip-up rear sight, does not have a dust cover, no forward assist, and the barrel is lined with melonite instead of chrome. The stock handguard has been replaced with a Magpul MOE. I will include the stock handguard with it. It also comes with one 30-round PMAG. I will also include an NCStar 4x32 scope with red/green illuminated reticle and bullet drop compensator.

Condition: I have not fired more than 1000 rounds through this rifle. The first 150 rounds were fired 30 at a time, slowly, with a quick barrel cleaning between each set of 30. It has only been fired rapidly twice, less than 100 rounds each time. It has been treated very gently. Basically, it comes to you in ""like new"" condition, used enough to prove that it functions flawlessly, but not enough to create any wear.

100-round magazine details:
This is identical, to, but is not the BETA brand magazine. Fits 100 rounds, comes with loader, tubes of graphite, magazine cover, and carrying case. I loaded this magazine up once, fired 100 rounds at the range, cleaned it, reloaded it, and stored it.

2000 rounds of Federal XM193BK 5.56x45mm NATO 55 grain FMJBT:
 - 1 box of bulk packaged ammo, 1000 rds.
 - 5 bags of loose ammo, 200 rds each.
**Sold in 200-round bags minimum**

135 rounds of Federal American Eagle .223 Rem 50 Gr Jacketed Hollow Point
 - 1 bag of loose ammo.


Separate Pricing:
Note: I will NOT sell any ammo separately until the rifle is gone. Want the ammo but not the rifle? Find a buddy who wants the rifle and bring him along.
Rifle, 1 PMag, and Scope: $800
PMags: $25 each

142 rounds of 7.62x54R - all but five rounds are chek silver tip, berdan primed with steel cases.  Not sure on the grain size of the bullet.  It is standard Russian military issue, if that helps at all.  Five rounds have a soft nose, and appear to have steel case, as well.  This ammo shot great out of my Mosin, without ever misfiring.

53 stripper clips for a Mosin Nagant.  These will feed either the infantry rifles or the carbine variants.  Not sure on the Sniper models due to scope placement.

Various cleaning parts.  This appears to be at least one full cleaning kit for a Mosin Nagant, plus some extras.

The Timney AR-10 trigger is a self-contained, 100% drop-in unit ready to install in an AR-10 rifle for an exceptionally smooth, crisp, single-stage trigger pull. No gunsmithing, fitting, or adjusting required. Pull weight is factory set at 4 pounds. Lightweight, 6061 T6 alloy housing is anodized for superior durability. Hammer is EDM machined from S7 tool steel that combines hardness to resist wear with superior impact resistance to withstand heavy use without chipping or breaking. Finally, a Teflon Nickel coating is applied to the hammer to deliver a super smooth trigger pull with superior lubricity. Other components are EDM cut from A2 tool steel, then heat treated to Rc 56−60 for longer service life. Trigger Module installs using your rifle’s original hammer/trigger pins; proprietary design eliminates pin rotation and walkout.

This is a great concealed carry handgun.  Any specifications about it can be looked up online, but this handgun has 3-dot tritium night sights, an ambidextrous thumb safety, and an adjustable trigger.

Some particular things about this gun.  The barrel feed ramp has been polished for reliability, and hollowpoints feed great.  I also replaced the grip screws with stainless steel thin grip screws from Brownells since the factory ones are less than good.  All in all, this gun is stupid accurate and conceals great since it is thin.  I got this handgun for my own carry and so a family member who likes 1911's can shoot it since he has arthritis and can't shoot .45's.  That family member has since passed so I am selling this.

This handgun comes with the original case and accessories, and I will throw in a Galco Kingtuk IWB holster if you want it."

I just recently tried to take it apart and do the initial post-purchase cleaning, as I was going to go shooting with it for the first time this week, and the plastic takedown lever snapped off and broke. Smith and Wesson will fix it for free, whether I send it in or you buy it from me and you send it in. I will sell it now, or you can email me and arrange to buy it after I send it in to have it fixed. Never fired! Gun is still fully operational, just can't be taken apart until it gets fixed.

The discoloration in the photo is from cleaning oil, as my camera is not hi-res. If this ad is still posted, then I still have the gun in my possession and haven't shipped it off to S&W yet.

This handgun is a limited run Ruger re-production of their GP100 .357 magnum. This handgun was inspired by the infamous Wiley Clapp and is therefore known as the ""Wiley Clapp Edition"". These guns are designed specifically as a DEFENSE/ COMBAT .357 and as such have many features not found on the standard GP100's.
This revolver features a 3 inch full underlug barrel (which in my humble opinion is the MINIMUM barrel length necessary for tapping into the .357 magnums power).  It also has low profile and snag free NOVAK sights factory installed.
The Standard GP100 in the 3 in. model does not come with a rear sight. This model comes with a dovetailed Novak Front and Rear sight.   The Front sight has the highly visible fiber optic rod for quick target acquisition. 
***These dovetailed sights allow the user to replace the front and rear sights with TRIJICON Tritium nights sights or some other variant of night sight***.  
The standard GP100 has a reflective stainless finish. This gun has a specialized non-reflective matte finish called the ""Hawkeye finish"". These are just a few of the UPGRADES made only to this model GP100. Please see the specs listed below as taken from Ruger's website:

Material: Stainless Steel Finish: Matte Stainless
Front Sight: Fiber Optic Novak Rear Sight: Lo-Mount Novak
Barrel Length: 3.00"" Overall Length: 8.50""
Weight: 36.00 oz. Grips: Black Rubber
Twist: 1:18.75"" RH Grooves: 5
Capacity: 6 Avalable From: TALO

This revolver is Like New in box (as I am the original owner and fired less than 25 INCREDIBLY accurate rounds through it). It comes with EVERYTHING as new, including paperwork, fired casing, lock, and Ruger Plastic Box. Get this AWESOME revolver without a wait and the soon to be MANDATORY paper TRAIL...... This revolver is considerably light weight (only 36 oz.) for an all stainless gun that is designed for a lifetime of the hottest .357 rounds. This revolver is considered a Limitted edition and as such, these are investments that will only increase in value. I am not thrilled to let it go.... but need to fund other things...

This Mosin is in such incredible condition.  Just but a few years ago it was pulled from stock in Russia and sent to the states to be sold as surplus.  It is so unused that it is STILL full of grease.  So I guess the only down side is that you have to disassemble and clean out all the packing grease.  It comes with bayonet, cleaning kits, and sling, all original to the weapon and in perfect condition - no marks, scratches, etc.

  In addition to this prestine weapon, I also have a ammo can full of brand new 7.62x54r ammunition for the Mosin.  This is not surplus ammo, it is brand new.  Approximately 450-500 rounds.  Do the math...20 rounds of this ammo at Academy or Cabela's runs approximately $23.99.  If you round down to $1.00 a round, that means that there are approximately $450.00 - $500.00 is prestine ammunition included for this weapon...when rounded down. 

  I am open to trades, however they must be of equal or more value, please don't waste yours or my time.  I am always interested in trades outside of firearms as well, just let me know what you have. The price to start is $600 obo, this is negotiable within reason.  I know you may think that this is a lot but please take a look at other Mosin Nagants on the web.  They're usually not even close to the condition this is, they're not pre World War II (they're usually 1943 and 1946), do not come with all the accessories, are not as unused, and definitely don't come with 450-500 rounds of NEW ammunition....

I am in the military and currently stationed in texas, I will be driving all of my firearms and vehicle home to maryland for storage before I leave to go back overseas, I will sell the mosin at that time. It should be within the first or second week of may. This is for serious individuals only. Please do not waste my time. I am not hardpressed for sale as this would be a great heirloom to hand down when I have children old enough, by that time this will be close to 100 years old. Email me for a quick response"

Let me make you money for doing nothing but collecting it for me!

Here's how it will work. Save me your brass, pick up brass from the range, ask your buddies to save theirs etc... You then give it to me and I will sort it, clean it, list it, mail it, sell it etc... After I receive payment from buyer, I will simply send you money via Paypal or check (PayPal preferred). It's that simple! Here's the break down.

If you sort it by caliper 50/50 less shipping and listing fees
If you just hand me a bucket or large lot and I have to sort, 65/35 less shipping and listing fees.
