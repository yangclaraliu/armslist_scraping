Combine that with the also Patented brace functionality and you have the new king of the market. The brace is injection molded out of reinforced polymer for rigidity and strength. It provides the perfect balance between size, weight, comfort and rigidity that everyone has been wishing for.

As an added feature, the outsides are smooth for comfortable cheeking.

They have exactly 350 rounds of new 115gn fmj through them, used together in my 19x. Decided to go another way. Both are super clean and tidy. Only evidence they are even used is the beginning of finish wear on the barrel hood, two ""kiss"" marks on the side of the barrel just behind the threading where the set screws hit, and some minor remnants of loctite on the screws.Both come in the OEM packaging and the comp comes with the three set screws (1 extra). I did the best I could to get all the loctite off everything. Threads are all in good shape, and everything screws together as it should, free and clear without stickiness or binding. I oiled the threads after cleaning, so you'll want to degrease them before you install.$185 Shipped."

The P229-1 flush barrel has about 700-800 rounds through it. The M11-A1 threaded barrel has never had a bullet fired through it. The X-ray night sights feature a tritium lamp surrounded by a bright green fiber optic in the front sight. While the rear sight is nearly blacked out during the day, but the tritium lamps illuminate in low light conditions. The M11-A1 has Sig's SRT trigger installed from the factory. Aiding in a shorter reset and smooth 4.5 lb single action trigger pull. The internals of the gun are phosphate coated for resistance to corrosion, and for improved durability. All of the controls are enlarged for easier weapon manipulations. I had an IWB concealed kydex holster made by We Plead The 2nd fitted for the gun. I'll include a Blackhawk double stack polymer mag pouch to go with the kydex holster. The gun will come with both barrels and both sets of night sights. It also will come with three 15 round magazines. Asking $750 OBO. Must provide an Arizona Driver's license or an Arizona CCW permit upon purchase.
