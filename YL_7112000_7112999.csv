This pistol looks like it spent a lot more time being appreciated than actually fired. Amazing finish with no scratches and only minimal signs on the grips that it was ever carried. These are getting harder to find and will only go up in value.Asking 600 obo for this excelent pistol and most in similar condition on gun broker go for more or the box is an extra 120$ so dont miss out.520 405-nine 3 three 7 IN resident with AZ cell"

MANUFACTURERS DESCRIPTION:
 
The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01.
 
The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.6” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
 
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

Do you like the look of a pistol grip stock on a classic rifle like the '73? Read on if you do, because there is no doubt that there is something entirely cool about a pistol grip stock that has been combined with an octagon barrel. It has the look more of a dedicated rifleman than a working cowboy. You may love this rifle for other reasons, but the fact remains that a '73 like this is purely a classic. But Winchester have taken it a step beyond with a walnut stock with fine Grade II/III walnut that simply gives it the look of the special limited rifles produced by Winchester in the mid-1800's that became the legend of stories and movies. Displayed images are stock photos. Any questions please feel free to ask. Thanks and happy bidding."

I may be doing it wrong, or it's stuck. Wood stock shows signs of moderate use, it's been in a war not sitting on a shelf. Blue on the barrel is mostly there, but has some specks where it has come off. I think it still takes the old style 50mm ammo because I don't see the mark where it should be if it was upgraded. Looking to get $400 for it, can ship since it's an antique. Call Jon at REDACTED pickup in cleveland."

There was some minor external wear on the barrel, however I just had it cerakoted. The chassis has some scratch marks on it, they are only aesthetic and will not affect function by any means. You will absolutely be able to put thousands of rounds through this barrel as I have taken good care of it. I am only selling the rifle as it comes stock from AI. This is with a Harris bi-pod attachment point and no optic. The model I am selling does not have a folding stock.

Its quite possible that the only rounds fired with this pistol were by me when I test-fired it. Its a little on the heavy side for a concealable weapon, but the weight absorbs a lot of the recoil - making this a very pleasant gun to shoot. It comes with 1 x 5 round magazine. The bore and rifling look new and this would be a great addition to anyone's collection."
