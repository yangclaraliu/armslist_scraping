This knife is brand new and has not been sharpened other than by the Randall factory. In addition to the original factory sheath, I had a custom leather shoulder rig made by Rowe's Leather of Hope Arkansas. The shoulder rig comfortably places the knife handle-down under my left arm where is doesn't interfere with a pistol holster on my right hip.  The thumb-break release allows for a quick, smooth draw. I'll sell the knife and factory sheath separately for $600 and keep the custom sheath if a shoulder rig isn't your thing."

I have a really nice AR-9 that I shoot and in the process of filing for an SBR, and I was gonna SBR this Scorpion but decided I really didn't need two 9mm SBR weapons. This Scorpion is loaded. This is the CZ Scorpion Carbine, full-length handguard and the Silencerco Faux Suppressor. It has the HB reduced weight trigger spring kit that basically cuts the trigger pull in half and it shoots like a dream. Also has the Skeletonized THETA Forward trigger, and HB AK Style Safety Selector installed. Optics include EOTech 518-2 on a QD Mount, and the EOTech G33 3x magnifier on Flip-To-Side QD Mount. I will also add four 30-round mags and two 20-round mags with this deal. I only have about 300 rounds through it so it's basically new and in great condition. I am looking for $1700 firm cash, and $2100 trade value. I will consider trades plus cash, but your trade and the cash needs to be worth $2100. You can price this build very easily and add in the fact that these are little harder to find locally right now but I am in no rush to sell this at a lowball price. My cash price is very firm and my trade value is firm. Just be fair with your offers. Don't pad your pistols price with some crazy custom upgrade that only you wanted.

Please don't waste my time and please come at me with a complete offer. Don't ask me ""how much cash would I require"", you have the numbers, only you can value your trade, do the math and then hit me up. I have my CHL as well, serious inquiries only. REDACTED"

The Remington Model 8 rifle is long recoil-operated and uses a rotating bolt head. After firing, the barrel and bolt, still locked together, move rearward inside the receiver and compress two recoil springs. Then the bolt is held back while the barrel is returned forward by one of the springs permitting extraction and ejection. Once the barrel is returned, the bolt is returned forward by the second spring; in so doing it picks up a fresh round from the magazine and chambers it. The Remington Model 8 has a fixed 5-shot magazine and bolt hold-open device which engages after the magazine is empty. It is a takedown design, meaning that the barrel and receiver are easily separated with no tools, allowing for a smaller package for transport.
 
Remington created four new calibers for the Model 8 rifle: .25 Remington, .30 Remington, .32 Remington and .35 Remington.[4] These cartridges were rimless designs to allow reliable feeding from box magazines. The Model 8 was offered in five grades of finish (Standard, Special, Peerless, Expert and Premier) [7] and was the first truly reliable medium power semiautomatic rifle ever commercialized (1906)[5]From Wikipedia"
