This new laser trainer fits .22 caliber weapons by mounting in the barrel and has a sound activated switch showing bullet impact with a laser dot. Every time your hammer or striker fires the small laser dot will flash for 100 milliseconds simulating bullet impact.   This model installs from the muzzle of the barrel and fits tight with the use of LaserLyte’s patented arbor and taper system. The system will fit the weapons chambered in 22LR, 22WMR, 22Short, 22Long and .223 that have a minimum of a 1.875 inch barrel. The LT-LR will also fit other .22 caliber barrels like the 22-250 and 220 Swift.   The trainer will only extend past your barrel less than an inch. This setup will be versatile for any location to effectively laser train. One can instruct a new shooter on a rifle or practice their skills. You can use your favorite pistol along with the trig­ger pull you are used to. (LaserLyte strongly recommends the use of snap caps.)   This is simply the easiest way to train without ammo for any of your pistols with a 1.875 inch barrel or longer. The popular calibers listed above can be expensive and hard to find for regular practice. This is the most effective laser training sys­tem that will meet all your needs.     SPECIFICATIONS: -Product Number: LT-LR -Compatible with: 22LR, 22WMR, 22 Short, 22 Long, .223 REM with at least a 1.875"" barrel -Length: 3.0 inches  Diameter: .20"" Min./ .76 inch Max  -Battery Life: 10,000 shots -Batteries: 1 x 1632 Lithium -Activation: Sound of striker or hammer"

The Caliber .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps), a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, better ergonomics, and more ambidextrous controls. Along with the HK45 Compact, the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected. The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance. Using HK s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability and minimum 20,000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors. Variant 1 is a double action/single action with ""SAFE position. Control lever (manual safety/decocking lever) on left side of frame.
