I'm adding this update so folks won't think it's still available.
Thanks to everyone who inquired about the AR. 
I sold it today. I wish the new owner many happy range days with it. :)
I can build one like this for a similat price if anyone is interested.
Email me at elmojo at hotmail dot com for details and options.
Thanks again!


New DTI AR-15 in M4 configuration.
Made in NC, support a local company!
Totally stock (okay, mostly stock now :) ) and ready for someone to go nuts tricking it out.
I was gonna make this my personal project gun, but I decided to go with the mid-length version, so I'm selling this one bare so I can buy the parts to make another.
The gun was assembled and tested under the supervision of a qualified gunsmith (my father), who is available to do additional work or add accessories later, if you need any help.

- Includes (1) Black (matches the gun) 30-round metal mag
NEW - Low profile block (no front sight in the way)
NEW - Carbine length free floating quad rail hand guard with rail covers
- 16"" 1x9 twist cro-moly barrel with launcher attachment point
- M4 feed ramps on barrel extension
- 6 Position collapsible stock (stronger than 4-pos stock)

The price of $850 now includes the quad rail and gas block. 
Basically you're saving about $75 off what it would have been with those accessories added.

More photos available upon request.
Will consider partial or full trades

--UPDATE (12/10)--
I removed the front sight tower, installed a quad rail free floating hand guard (with covers), and a low profile gas block. Noted above.
The other accessories noted below are still available.

--UPDATE (11/22)--
I have purchased several accessories for this rifle. I just couldn't help myself. :)
I am making the rifle available either stock, as noted in the ad above,
or with your choice of add-ons, for additional cost.
A full list of accessories with details and photos provided upon request.
The short list...
- 6x42 ACOG-style compact scope with illuminated reticle and Quick Release mount - $100 (installed and bore-sighted)
- See-through picatinny riser to elevate the scope if desired - $15
- Mid-length rail-mounted bipod (clears 30-round mags) - $45 installed and adjusted
- Free floating quad rail handguard with covers - INSTALLED
- Green laser sight (high-powered, not the cheap 5mW junk) - $75 installed and rough-sighted (NOT RECEIVED YET)
- Single point tactical sling - $20 installed"

Let me know what you have and price. Pictures are always prefered."

85,http://www.armslist.com/posts/68085,"For Sale:  S&W M&P 38 Model of 1905, Fourth Change","Oxford, Mississippi, United States",$ 500,"Listed On: Friday, November 12, 2010",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is a S&W 38 M&P Model of 1905 4th change.  According to this article, 458,300 were mfg. 1915 - 1942.  This gun, bearing S/N 542650, was manufactured in 1926 according to Roy at S&W.  The gun is nickel plated with either a 6 or 6.5 inch barrel.  The caliber, of course, is
38 spl.  This gun sat on a shelf for about the last 50 or so years and has not been shot in a long time.  I am happy to test it for any serious buyer.  In fact, I wouldn't mind the opportunity.  :thumbup: S&W says it is good with any modern ammo except +P.

The gun shows typical finish wear, particularly in the gate area.  I tried to take a photo of this but the shiny finish made it very hard.  
Anyway, I would say the finish is equivalent to or better than on most
84 year old guns. I am happy to allow a buyer to inspect.  Mechanically I am aware of no problems.

The gun also comes with a unique leather holster.  The holster is stamped ""Biffar Chicago"".  Under the flap is scratched ""B. Norwood"".  I do not know the story of how the holster and gun came to be a pair, but I must say they are quite a nice duo.

The price is $500 for the pair. I prefer FTF but will ship at buyer's cost.  I travel regularly and will be going the length of the state within the next month, so I can arrange a meeting.

It is a Chilean Mauser, pre-1899.  Some of the most expensive work in building this up has been done.  It has been buffed out (the crest is buffed out completely) and has an old reblue. The bolt handle has been bent down for scope clearance and it has been drilled and tapped for mounts.  This is a small ring Mauser and would be acceptable for a 7x57 Mauser or whatever other caliber conversion would be suitable for a small ring Mauser.  

All Chilean Mausers made by Ludwig Loewe are antique. All DWM Chilean Mausers with serial number prefixes that begin with A through K are antique.  This one still has its' serial number and the prefix is a G.  It has the anchor stamped in the receiver indicating that it was made at the DWM plant at Oberndorf. You will need to buy the parts to complete the bolt and trigger assembly.  Antique actions are not classified as firearms under federal regulations.

I will trade my Glock 32 chambered in .357 sig. Sig Sauer and Federal worked together to make a round that could be put in an auto pistol that mimics the velocity and power of the .357 magnum. The .357 Sig actually surpasses the .357 magnum. If you look at the bullistic charts between the two, you will see this is the truth. The .357 Sig also has a better OSS (One Shot Stop) rating than the 9mm, .40 S&W, and .357 magnum. This means in police reports, they dropped the bad guy with one shot almost every time, more often than with a 9mm, .357 mag, or .40 cal. The reason I am trading it is because the M9 style pistol is my gun. I'm much more accurate with that bodystyle because I'm used to it. I'm also a good shot with an H&K USP. So if you have a USP I would be willing to trade for that too, but of course the USP would have to be in less than great shape for my Glock 32 to match it's trade value. *NO TAURUS PT's PLEASE* Local deals only. I will go as far as Ralleigh or Wilmington if I can. Thanks for your interest."

That one may have been captured, but more likely was taken from a depot in Japan at the end of the war. The engraving is typical Japanese, so it is reasonable to suppose that either the first American owner or a subsequent one was stationed in Japan and had the engraving done there. After the war, the Japanese economy was in bad shape and Japanese engravers did such work at modest cost. In fact, that kind of engraving was often called ""carton of cigarettes"" engraving because that was the usual cost. Perhaps the grip work earned the Japanese workman another carton!

It is hard to tell the quality of the engraving, but it doesn't look bad. I suspect those grips may be real ivory. I think that grip could be repaired, but I would want to consult an expert in that area. My WAG is that the gun could easily bring $1000 or more, but I would defer to anyone who may be more expert in that area.

AFAIK, Kijiro Nambu had nothing to do with that gun, it being a bit before his time. It was a mixture of Western designs, but mostly is derived from the Austrian Rast-Gasser, with a little Smith & Wesson thrown in for good measure. The caliber is 9mm Japanese, which is not readily available, but .38 S&W can be used by trinning the rim down from the front.

A word of caution. To disassemble the gun, DO NOT PRY anything. The trigger guard can be unlatched at the rear, then swung down. This allows the sideplate to be swung to the side and back, exposing the mechanism.""

This handgun has had maybe 900 rounds through it and the bore is sharp and clean.  This firearm is also very accurate and has been kept in excellent shape.  There are not any magazines included with this handgun as I sold off the 10 round magazines that came with it and decided I just didn't shoot it enough to hang on to it.

This great rifle was made in Germany for the Argentine War and is an extremely accurate shooters rifle great for hunting. It has been tapped for a scope and you would have to pay three times this price to get the same quality in a new non military rifle. My rifle was made by Berlin's Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken (DWM), one of the better-known German Mauser manufacturers at the time. This rifle has the Argentine Crest intact – many of the rifles that were imported in the 50,s had these beautiful crests ground off. To many collectors, this superbly made bolt-action military rifle represents the crown jewel of all Model 98 variants.

Description below on this rifle are excerpts from a writer with Guns & Ammo:

Fit and finish of the metal parts are beyond mere imagination. Few custom rifles these days are better finished, both internally and externally. In fact, the 1909 Argentine action became one of the favorites of custom riflemakers for decades. This was because it was not only extremely strong but also dimensionally correct and consistent. Some of the finest custom rifles made have 1909 actions at their core."

It is made by snap-on but blue point is a less expensive brand that snap on produces.  It is as still heavy duty and solid built but without all the chrome and fancy details. It is about 5 to 6 years old and has been used very little. I used it after college for about a year and then recently got out of the auto shop a few years ago. I have a really good amount of tools in this box, most of the tools are craftsman, some snap-on, some blue point, some matco.  I have mostly all sockets and wrenches you will ever need. I have a nice air ratchet by blue point, and some china made air tools but they work pretty good. I have an 19.2 volt drill and an angle head drill with 2 batteries. I really just have about all you would need to start out in the auto trade or make a great kit for the garage at home. The box alone is worth at least $900 bucks but I would be willing to sell the whole tool box and tools for $1000. If the price goes down then I remove tools and if you dont need all the tools we can make a deal. I also would be willing to trade for guns. A few that I am interested in are AR-15, AK-47, walther pk380, remington 1100, small subcompact pistol. just email me and I can see if we can make a deal. Sorry for the unorganization of the tools and it needs cleaning up so I will try to tackle that this week.

Package includes the original box and accessories as well as the factory standard 2 magazines.

The gun has 250 rounds through it.  I've merely saved you the trouble (and expense) of breaking it in :).

This is a perfect option for those with larger hands, or looking for a longer barrel and sight radius on their Kahr.  Or, perhaps those looking for a polymer pistol that is slimmer than a Glock/XD/M&P.

For more info, check out Kahr's website http://www.kahr.com/PA-1_9mm_tp.html

This is the 8 round capacity model, purchased new at the end of August this year.

This is a good candidate gun for a grip chop. All the polymer Kahrs use the same mag release placement throughout the size range, so smaller models can accept magazines from larger models. This *also* means that you can chop the grip down to a more compact length and use the magazines from the corresponding smaller model. Cutting a TP9 down to P9 size is a popular option, giving you the larger sight radius and muzzle control of the larger slide, but the smaller grip for easier concealment. 

The best part about grip chops on polymer guns is that it's easy to perform on your own with a hacksaw and some files. Anyone who is reasonably patient and handy with common tools should be able to make some clean work out of it.

I am willing to travel within an hour of Manhattan to make an exchange."

I shot it a couple days ago putting 100 rounds of 8mm through it and never once had a problem with it. At 50yrds standing up and no supports I was shooting within 3/4s and inch of a 2 inch orange dot. 


I know what this rifle is worth, so trades should be within the ball park range or 150-200 dollars, I am not looking for an expensive gun to trade for, and I am not looking to put cash ontop of the mauser for a trade.


I collect and shoot mosins, so if you have one for trade I'd be willing to trade it for that.

Unlicensed copies of the gun were also manufactured in Spain and China in the first half of the 20th century. This single-action semi-auto pistol has a 5 ½” barrel with a fixed front iron sight. It features an adjustable rear sight marked up to 1000 meters, thumb safety, all steel construction, internal box magazine, and a wood pistol grip. It has an attachment for a rear stock. It comes with a rear wood stock that attaches to the pistol and has an empty compartment that the pistol will fit in for easier carrying. It also has a lanyard loop on the bottom of the grip and a sling attachment on the left side of the stock. It has some light scratches and dings with some minor bluing wear and some very light surface rust on the left side of the slide. It has an excellent bore. Weight: 3 lbs. 12 oz. Log: 24114.
