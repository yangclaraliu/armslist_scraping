It is in almost new condition worth close to $1100.

The Upper is a Spike's Tactical ST-22. A Dedicated 16"" 22LR M4 Upper with a Barrel that is CNC machined out of a Chrome Moly Match Grade Green Mountain Blank with a Mil Spec Parkerized Finish. It has the Proper 1:16 Twist Rate for the 22LR Round.  The 16"" Barrel fits into the receiver approximately 1.5"", so the Upper has the true M4 Military 14.5"" look to it. But, it is NOT an SBR Upper! The ST-22 Upper is complete with dedicated .22LR Bolt and Charging Handle. It utilizes the Ciener design to Avoid Using Proprietary Design Parts. Parts are are Machined From Heat Treated 4140 Chromoly with a NP3 Nickel Teflon Finish. 

This rifle is different than most AR-22s because it has a true AR-15 lower. The lower is a Stag Arms model Stag-15. It was built with a DPMS lower parts kit. The stock is a Command Arms 6 position collapsible stock. The stock looks cool and has a compartment to hold batteries. It is a commercial sized buffer tube. The buffer and spring are brand new because I have only used this lower with my 22LR.

I have two 25 round magazines. They are made by Black Dog Machine.

The scope on the rifle is a BSA sweet 22 3-9x40 with Nikon P-series mounts. The scope has an adjustable elevation turret that is ballistically matched to the 22LR round with marks from 50 yards to 175 yards. I'm including all three turrets for 36, 38 or 40 grain 22LR rounds.

I'm also including 300 rounds of 40 grain CCI mini-mags. At today's 22LR prices that is like $150! Ha Ha - Just kidding, sort of.

Some personal notes: This is an awesome rifle. It shoots groups twice as tight as my Ruger 10/22. I've shot less than 500 rounds through the rifle. I can adjust the turret on the scope and easily shoot tight groups at 100 yards. I like that it has the same configuration as my M-4.  I'm selling it because I want to get a really nice bolt action 308 for my wife. 

If you are interested in the upper only, I will sell it along with the 2 magazines for $580."

The 11.5"" carbine system is maximized for speed & accuracy with the lower-mass S/A carrier, custom spring set, & SOCOM-D profile barrel. The end result is a very manueverable, fast cycling weapon that runs flat & smooth, and displays remarkable accuracy for this length of barrel.

It is very accurate but still light enough to carry comfortably. 
The 25-06 is considered by many (including myself) to be the ultimate long range flat shooting cartridge for deer and coyotes and such. 
High quality ammo (85 to 120 grain bullets) is readily available in Wall-Marts and gun stores. 
The case capacity allows you to push a 120 grain bullet over 3200 fps. and a 85 gr at over 3700 fps with the 24 in. barrel.

Anyways, this MSAR STG-556 is OD Green and comes with EOTech, Side-Rail, Forward Grip, SIX (6) 42rd high capacity magazines and one 10rd magazine. Also comes with spare ratworkx RH bolt, 2 extra firing pins w/ springs. Complete with polished stainless steel Nu-Trigger sear/trigger pack modification (smoother trigger pull). Piston action keeps bolt/action from getting dirty. Chrome piston, firing pin, chromed barrel, M16 / AR-15 style flash hider, bayonet threads. 

Gun shoots very accurate with EOTech and is fun to rapid-fire with the giant magazines, but does have some intermittent double-feed issues. I haven't checked it out, but I think it's only an issue with the huge magazines or adjusting the gas piston valve to the ammo.

Traded off my last one for something so I'd like to get another one.

I have a lightly used Taurus M856, its lightly used and in pretty good shape. Very accurate with minimal recoil, +P rated. This is the relatively rare six shot M856, not the M85; it is one of the very few 6 shot J frame sized .38 snubs out there. Easily pocket carriable which is a plus in the summer heat. Will include the gun and box it came with, around 50 rounds of assorted .38 special, two Bianchi speed strips, and an ankle holster.

I also have a brand new, unfired ASI PASI1 12 gauge HD/tactical style shotgun. These are patterned after the Benellia Nova and will accept 3 inch shells. These are made in the same ISO NATO certified facilities in Turkey that make the Canik TP9 and CZ75 clones as well as the Girsan 1911's, Tisas Zigana handguns, and many others.

I'm looking for a compact or subcompact 9mm. Primarily interested in a Glock 26 or 19, XD9 subcompact or XDm 3.8 compact, or other similar handguns. Not looking for anything full sized, but feel free to let me know what you have. No Kel Tecs. Looking at 9mm's primarily, but may consider the same guns in .40.

If not interested in trading I'll sell them together for $500.

I have no need for duplicate guns, even if the calibers are different.

This gun is PERFECT in all ways. I paid to get it certified as correct and straight gun. I do have the paperwork showing the certification was done. I did this to ensure the are no canted sights or gas blocks. It is like new because I just picked it up Tuesday. It only has 40 rounds down the tube and it shoots great.

I removed the weld holding on the thread protector. I also installed the flash hider detent. The detent was purchased separately, it does not come with it. The stocks were cleaned up and stained with Minwax Sedona Red. Then a clear coat was applied followed by wet sanding followed by another coat of clear coat followed by another wet sanding and finally an application of wax. The stocks are beautiful and like glass.

I will include the factory grip with screw, an aftermarket grip and a 30 round steel magazine. It will also include the factory thread protector that I notched so the detent will hold it in place.

This gun is 100% perfect, both in looks and function.

Asking $500 and the only trade I would consider is a Mini, not Micro, Draco pistol. Through JG Sales these are ~$570 shipped to Tennessee but they do not offer the certification. I purchased this through CNC Warrior. Through CNC Warrior these are $515. their certification, which I have, is another $20. The detent kit was $9. So save yourself $44 for the gun and accessories as well as the cost for a background and transfer. And you can have it immediately without the wait for them to do the certification and ship it.

The photo of the gun is the stock photo, the actual gun looks better. The other photos are the certification and warranty card. The originals will NOT have the serial number blocked out.

It will go quickly at this price and is firm."

With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level. Match Grade Select Fit Barrel and XD(M) Gear included. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M)® isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. The XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry. The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Here for sale is a Walther P22 pistol.  It's Black and looks awesome. 3.5"" barrel.

It's lightly used, I have only fired it at the range and once in my backyard at a wayward possum. I'm thinking about 300 rounds. It's broken in and operating well. I have kept it cleaned and oiled.

It also comes with the factory laser which is a $140 retail value. Laser is great for home defense and useful for shooting critters in the backyard at night!

Lightweight and small grip make this a perfect choice for a child/teen's first pistol, as well as the ladies.  Well-behaved and balanced, it's a great learners weapon, but also really fun for us men to do duels at the range, or eradicate varmints on the homefront.

Price is $350 for Pistol w/laser and $300 for pistol only.

Face to Face, CASH ONLY - No trades.

You must have either a valid MI CPL, or Michigan Ten Day Handgun Purchase Permit (TDHPP) from your local sheriff's office.  You must bring your Valid MI driver's license.  You must be at least 18 years old."

Chambered in 9x18mm Makarov, which is similar to 380 acp but ballistically superior. This is a solid milled steel, military grade firearm with a chrome lined barrel. Cosmetically similar to the Walther PPK, it will fit in holsters designed for the PPK. DA/SA with a decocker and loaded chamber indicator.
This is a 1968 model with a rounded hammer for snagless drawing. The frame, barrel, slide, and all other applicable parts have been professionally media blasted and refinished in graphite black cerakote, which very closely matches the original finish and is very hard wearing. I have also added custom walnut grips that give a more ergonomic fit than the originals. Comes with two magazines, one that has a matching serial number and one that does not. I have ground down the finger rest on the non matching mag to better facilitate pocket carry. Will also include a box of Hornady xtp defense rounds and the original grips.
With the gun, refinishing service, and grips, I have just over $500 into this pistol and that is the basis I will use for any trades.
Looking to trade for a Sig P938 plus cash on my end. Offering an additional $100 for a basic model, more for a higher end model (SAS, Blackwood, Equinox) and/or additional mags.
Though not my first choice, would also consider a straight trade for a Sig p238.

This is a great handgun for concealed carry and has surprising power! This weapon is absolutely perfect for someone who wants to carry a weapon at all times comfortably and have the element of surprise in their corner! 

LOOK AT MY DEAL...If you bought this weapon new it retails WITHOUT the Crimson Trace laser for $340 to $389.00 plus tax. The Crimson Trace Laser would be an additional $179.00 accessory plus tax. I'm INCLUDING IT in my entire selling price of $400.00!!!! But that's not all as you'll see down below!

UNLIKE OTHER LASERS the Crimson Trace laser is activated when the gun is gripped...and wherever the red dot is...that's where the bullet is going! No more worrying about hitting your target! There are cheaper manual on-off switch lasers like LaserMax and LaserLyte out there for around $100-$150, but they are not even close to the product quality of Crimson Trace. 

I'm also including an Elite ""inside the pocket"" holster which makes the weapon completely unnoticeable while carrying it in your pocket and so comfortable you can actually forget that you have a weapon in your pocket. If you went out and purchased an Elite pocket holster it retails for $27 plus tax. Again...I'M INCLUDING IT!

And finally...the Golden Saber +P ammo is a personal favorite ammo choice of mine for the shear ballistic power. It's an additional $25 if you went out and purchased it...but I'M INCLUDING IT free of charge in the deal! 

Weapon comes in the original box with a Ruger logo nylon zipper pouch.

That makes MY entire package valued at nearly $600 retail when adding everything up. 

BUT I'M SELLING IT ALL TO THE FIRST $400 FIRM! THAT'S RIGHT...$400 FIRM!!!
