This is a short  37” version (17 inch barrel) that was manufactured as a carbine for special troops like mortar crews and motorcycle troops.  This gun was probably manufactured between 1940 and 1945. This example has obviously received some special treatment; the chrome trigger guard, butt plate, and bayonet mount may not be original features unless this was manufactured as a special ceremonial rifle or gift of some kind; which is possible but may be difficult to verify.  Special ceremonial versions were manufactured.  On the other hand I don’t know why someone would take the trouble to chrome plate these parts. If the chrome is an original feature, this is a very rare example. Actually, no matter how you look at it this is a rare example of a WWII era Carcano rifle. 

The rifle is in excellent condition and fully functional although it will need a good cleaning. These rifles also have excellent ballistic characteristics with muzzle velocities around 2,000 fps. The short barrel limits its effective range somewhat as far as hunting is concerned but I had good luck with it in the woods of Northern MN."

Reduced dimensions and light weight are as important as magazine capacity and power. Kimber Ultra Carry pistols in .45 ACP and 9 mm have it all, and put it together in a 1911 package that simply outperforms any other type of semi-automatic. To ensure dependability, Ultra Carry lightweight aluminum frames are machined on the same computer-driven machines and to the same unequaled tolerances as Kimber steel frames. Each model has standard Kimber features like rounded and blended edges, beveled magazine well, extended thumb safety and bumped beavertail grip safety. Magazine capacity is 7 rounds in .45 ACP. They fit almost any size hand and point naturally. Best of all, the crisp, clean single action trigger eliminates long travel, heavy pull and the guessing that goes with it. For concealed carry, nothing beats a 1911–and no 1911 beats a Kimber."

Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). 


The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

This is a beautiful, classic 1911 style rendition of an All American power house handgun. This gun can hit steel silhouettes at 100 yards with its match grade barrel full length barrel and slide. 100% accurate and reliable. Why pay for a Kimber or go to a gun store to shell out extra tax dollars and fees when this baby can be on your hip for only $700!

You want a defense pistol? This pistol is it. You want an awesome pistol for shooting competition? This pistol was MADE for that. This 1911 is an awesome classic look, but also has the same practicality you'd expect from the awesome 1911 design. 

I never used it as my carry handgun, so no holster scrapes or normal wear and tear you'll find on other, older 1911s on this site. I cleaned it after every range trip and put it right back in its case with a light coat of oil. This comes in a package:

1911 features-
-Beautiful wood grips
-Full length slide
-5"" Stainless Steel match grade barrel (this gun is accurate as hell)
-Lightweight manufacturer trigger (5-6 pounds)
-Adjustable target sights so you can dial in those 100yd Die Hard shots

Extras!
-Nice Springfield Armory case
-Hogue Tactical Palm Swell grips (you can throw these on or off within a few minutes, replacing the wood handgrips so you can really hammer some rapid, accurate, rounds down range)
-Paddle Holster
-3 1911 Magazines
-Springfield Armory gun lock

393,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3829393,For Sale:  I-594 tied to china?,"pierce, Seattle, Washington",FREE,"Listed On: Friday, December 19, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"In order to keep its head about water for just one more day, the Federal Reserve has now permitted Chinese-controlled banks to take stakes in US banks. This is a nefarious invasion of the U.S. economy. Subsequently, we have witnessed a major shift in the percentage of the U.S. debt owned by Chinese vs. the Federal Reserve. This is the beginning of the end for the dollar, the U.S. economy, your standard of living, your assets, your freedoms and for many of you, your very lives.

China Owns the Federal Reserve and Here’s How It Happened

At the end of January 2009, the month President Barack Obama was first inaugurated, Communist China owned $744.2 billion in U.S. government debt and the Fed owned $475.129 billion. In May of 2012, the Federal Reserve has approved applications by three big Chinese government-controlled banks to set up branches and take stakes in US banks after deciding they were adequately regulated in their home market.

The Chinese ownership of U.S. debt, compared to the Federal Reserve, appears to be unchanged in 2014. However, the Chinese are slowly but surely acquiring the Federal Reserve and thus, are acquiring a greater amount of U.S. government debt. Therefore, much of the debt owned by the Federal Reserve, is now owned by the Chinese and their new partners consisting of two large Spanish banks, a German bank and the Chinese. The complete Chinese takeover of our economy is silent but undeniably insidious. It would be appropriate to think of this development as the United States government doing a debt consolidation of all its treasury bonds because it can no longer pay or service the debt and the Chinese and their partners are acquiring the assets of America for pennies on the dollar. It will soon be announced that China is in the process of purchasing major Western banks (e.g. Bank of America, Wells Fargo) and physical assets. These banks make up the majority owners of the Federal Reserve. By purchasing these banks as distressed properties, the Chinese, will in effect, have purchased the Federal Reserve because these banks own the Federal Reserve. surabachiFor the naysayers that will write to me and say there is no way that this will ever take place, I will respond by telling you that you are a day late and a “distressed dollar” short with your anxiety over the future of the American economy.

Late last year, China purchased the JP Morgan building in Manhattan for $725 million. This was a symbolic move like planting the U.S. flag on top of Iwo Jima’s Mount Surabachi during the famous WW II battle. This signified that the Chinese have laid claim to all assets in the United States. One might  reason that the Chinese have in fact purchased all of JP Morgan. When this happens in earnest, it will come in the midst of a dollar devaluation and we are only months away from this happening.

The Death of Our Asset Holdings

The Chinese yuan, also known as the renmimbi, is China’s national currency. The yuan has an important role in keeping China’s economy competitive. China keeps the yuan pegged to a basket of currencies, most notably the U.S. dollar. The yuan is worth a little more than fifteen cents.

This is all about to change. China has the ability to sell its Treasury holdings, putting the value of the U.S. dollar into free fall. However, it’s not in China’s best interests to do so. By threatening to sell U.S. Treasuries, China would quickly devalue its own holdings. Even so, it’s been unwise for the U.S. to allow itself to become so indebted to any other country. However, the Chinese now have partners who are willing to purchase U.S. treasuries and shoulder the burden of owning most of the U.S. debt which will result in the total collapse of the US economy. These large investors are busy purchasing the Federal Reserve through the back door. For example, the Spanish Bank, Banco, is purchasing Citigroup in Spain according to the Wall Street Journal. The buyoff of the major investors in the Federal Reserve is well underway. China, and their BRICS country allies, and a consortium of international interests (e.g. the previously identified Spanish and German banks), will through the I.M.F., manage the U.S. debt through exchange rate increases and trade tariffs.

Dr. Jim Garrow announced that a devaluation is near as the dollar will soon be valued on a 6 to 1 ratio in favor of the Chinese renmimbi. Let’s talk about the ramifications of this event. If you own a mortgage on your home for $150,000, you now owe the Chinese interests controlling your bank, who holds your mortgage note, $900,000 dollars. If you owe the bank $20,000 for your automobile, following the 2014 dollar devaluation, you now owe $120,000.  Your grocery bill for your family just went up by a factor of six. What about your retirement and social security? What retirement and social security? Long before most of you will be able to collect, your retirement will collateralized against the debt. The same is true for your 401K and your saving account holdings. It would be wise to spend your money now on elements of survival that you will need.

There is also an important aspect that nobody is talking about. When the Chinese come to claim your home, your car and your retirement, what legal recourse will you have? The answer is you will have no due process rights because your economic situation will be adjudicated in accordance with Chinese law. Under Chinese law, you will truly have the right to remain silent. When one considers the net effect of this Chinese takeover of the Federal Reserve, it is not far-fetched to postulate that Americans will actually be starving to death.

It is completely understandable that Americans will be fleeing the country. However, the Chinese will no doubt put controls in place that may allow you to leave, but your assets will stay inside the country.

The Bigger Picture

Elements, not the entire government, have sold our country out. Reid, Feinstein, Clinton, Pelosi and of course, Obama, have committed treason against the United States by participating in this planned demise. Yes, the planned demise is in full view.

The Bundy Affair is the most significant event in present day America. It exposes the fact that the Chinese will soon control our new solar based energy delivery systems through the Solar Energy Zones. These Solar Energy Zones lie on top of an estimated $228 trillion dollars of underground mineral assets. They also lie adjacent to major military installations and international corridor of interstate highways which will all soon be controlled by the Chinese.

Please note that all the rising economies of the world are tying their currencies to gold as Dr. Garrow astutely pointed out on my show. The United States is not one of these countries. He is correct as the China and India have been trading in gold, as opposed to the dollar, for several years. The present set of events represents the fulfillment of our demise which has been planned by the global elite for quite some time. If there is a silver lining, America will soon shed much of its sheep’s wool and America will fight. Hence, the real reason behind Obama’s push for gun confiscation and the fact that John Kerry signed the UN gun ban treaty last year. Now that you know that the Chinese own the very clothes on your back, it is time to take a look at how the Chinese will soon be exerting complete dictatorial control over the United States.

To date, we have largely been conquered by stealth. Soon, the specter of Chinese and Russian troops along with their DHS allies will be opposing Americans in the street"

(traditional SA/DA) These were the first handguns manufactured by HK and were imported by Harrington & Richardson (H&R) from 1967 through the mid 1970's. Besides it being an HK-4 which is a hard to find pistol in itself today, this one is particularly special being one of the H&R 100th anniversary HK-4's with ""HR"" serial # prefix. 

This particular example is in excellent shape and has lived an easy life; staying clean and lubed. It includes one original magazine with finger extension. You'll be hard pressed to find another in similar condition. Nice collector and/or carry gun!

It doesn't get shot so I'm offering it for trade. I'd consider nice rifle or handgun trades. I'd also consider a reasonable cash offer too.

Cooper was the stateside maker of Accuracy International  barrels.

Here  are 3 Remington 700 .30 cal unchambered and unfinished barrels. They are 5R and 1-12 twist.  They have not been chambered or crowned or anything like that. The two regular barrels are 26 7/8 TOTAL inches long (muzzle to end). Muzzle end is .895 dia and chamber is 1.22 dia. As you can see, there is a slight taper about an inch from the chamber and then it is straight to the muzzle. Again, it has not been chambered, so you can use it on your 700 for what ever .30 cal you like $250 each

The other 700 barrel is a shorter (21 inches overall) fluted barrel (6 flutes). No chamber. 5R, 1-12 twist.  Chamber is 1.22 dia and muzzle is 1.03 dia. $250

Any of these barrels will make solid shooters. They are every bit as good as any other top of the line barrel you will find. Take it to a local gun smith and let them run a chamber on it and watch your 308 stretch its legs out to 1000 yards. I recommend Predator Custom Shop.

I paid $716 and some change out the door, I have the receipt which I can double check at your request, this can be a great Christmas/xmas gift to a gun enthusiast, or a gun for the working man on the right side of the law. I have never shot it (I haven't found the time/nor reason), i am including 2x 10 capacity clips (cal standard), im also including the speed loader, as well as 46 armscor 10mm 180gr fmj ammo. I will throw in a lock so you can avoid that fee as well as a cleaning brush, also the original brochures, paperwork and what not, along with glock case, and a flambeau carry bag will be included.

before contacting me via email please understand/keep in mind that I am not charging retail, so therefore am not going down on price, check around at how much these are selling for, no dealer nor/private seller is charging less than i am for a BRAND NEW 10mm especially glock brand. I only accept cash, and i would prefer/only meet at licensed ffl dealer located in east county.(do to my lack of transportation) hence why I am selling gun. the price is $520 though i will take $500 because of the cosmetic damage I have done to this wonderful gun, which is the factory sights and scratch on the factory back plate. Even though its cosmetic and is a $20 fix its not very visible. the dealer also saw this on the gun and said it doesn't alter performance and would still be considered 100%

we can even do the math together and you will be a winner in this situation, its my loss your gain."

The BLACKOUT® is inherently stronger and more impact resistant than four prong designs, while not being subject to the rapid erosion of closed-ended units. A high strength corrosion-resistant aerospace alloy, and ultra-hard Nitride finish provide the highest level of durability. Military tested and selected.

Browning Medallion firearms walk the fine line between ""tool"" and ""art"", and the BPS Medallion is no exception. The scrolled Engraving on the sides of the receiver features game birds in flight. The bluing on the action and barrel has been polished to a reflective sheen. Likewise the Grade II/III Walnut used for the stock and forearm are Checkered and finished with a durable gloss. The Medallion stands out from the rest of the BPS line, but don't be afraid to take it out and use it - with proper care and cleaning, it will retain it's beauty for generations. Aside from the aesthetic features of the BPS Medallion, it still retains the rock solid construction that makes the BPS line stand apart from the competition. A solid forged and machined steel receiver with dual action bars for strength, bottom ejection and feeding for ergonomics, and Browning's Total Barrel Dynamics for superior barrel life and shot patterning. •RECEIVER – Forged and machined steel; Polished blued finish; Scroll Engraving • BARREL – Gloss blued finish; Ventilated rib • ACTION – 12 gauge 31/2” chamber; Bottom ejection; Dual steel action bars; Top-tang safety • STOCK – High gloss Grade II/III Walnut • Silver colored front bead sight

 I'm looking to sell this rifle to fund another project, I do not NEED the money. I explain this up front to keep us from wasting each others time with low ball offers. If you wish to purchase this rifle you'll either need a carry permit or be willing to transfer through my FFL. His fee will be subtracted from the final price. If this upsets you, that's your problem. Not mine.

 Alright, that said.. What I am selling is not a full ""custom"" build. I purchased a complete upper/bcg/charging handle & merely assembled the lower. I have over $950 in this gun & it is still very nice to brand new condition. It has exactly 150 rounds through it, with 0 malfunctions. I'm going to list every part below for those who are as interested in detail as I.

She's very clean with a outstanding bore with zero pitting and or rust and frosting and again It's kind of amazing how clean this pistol is considering she's all original and a oldie. She's a real shooter, it's striker fired with a 6 round single stack heel release magazine so you can do 6 plus 1 in the chamber as I've done when carrying, altho it's to nice to be carried in my eyes (just my 2 cents). Also the Royale is all Nickel plated with some very nice detailed engravings theres just a little natural patina where the safety sits under the slide. I'm mainly interested in trading but if the price is right I will consider letting this firearm leave my collection. I feel its time to see what else might be out there as I'm mainly interested in trading for another handgun something like a 380 auto or a compact 9mill or 1911 style 9mil or 1911 style 40cal or Revolvers chambered in .357mag. I also have 5 boxes of unopened brand new ammo to go with the trade, I got 3 boxes of Remington Metal case 71grain FMJ rounds and I have 2 new boxes of Winchester SilverTip 60grain JHP personal defense rounds. So I have a total of 250 brand new rounds I just placed a online order this month as my local Walmart sold out of .32 auto when I was ready to go hit the range recently and the Gun is so much fun to shoot with little to no recoil you can shoot for hours with no fatigue on your hands or palms and I've never had a hiccup with this pistol yet either. I agree to follow all state and federal and local law as I will need to see a valid MA LTC if the time comes for a Transfer and we could do a FFL or we Could do FTF Online.
