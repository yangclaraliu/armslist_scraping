BUSHMASTER Patrolman Rifle Specifics:

Patrolman AR15 M4 Carbine, .223/5.56 16"" W/Detachable Carry Handle, Telescoping Stock, Black Finish 30 Round Mag
Chrome lined barrel and chamber. Features A2 bird cage style suppressor. A3 type removable carry handle features 1 MOA elevation and 1/2 MOA windage adjustments. Picatinny type rail base. Flat-top upper receiver. Non-reflective mil spec hard anodized aluminum receiver. Six-position telestock. Shipped with 30 round magazine, carrying sling, chamber flag and operator's manual.

One of our ALL TIME BEST Carbine models, the M4 Type features a distinctive Military Barrel Profile and Six Position Telestock – great for 3 Gun Match Shooting, Home Defense and Law Enforcement use.

The Bushmaster A2 & A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are modeled after our M4 Type Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individual officers (semi-automatic configuration with 16"" barrel).

The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. 

Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling. 

The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material. The handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. 

The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage).

Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs. 

You must be of legal age and a Washington resident. I will only meet locally here in the Lacey area for transaction and you must have $1,200 cash only.

Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with ATI folding stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

Marlin 60 22LR with last shot hold-open. I bought this rifle about 2 months ago for a rapid fire plinker. The seller had a few available as he apparently refurbishes Marlin 60s as a hobby. Of the three he had available, one was outfitted with a scope. Since I had planned on an optic anyway, I selected the scoped offering. The scope is a very basic Bushnell 4X, but perfect for a 22 plinker. The rifle proved to be very accurate and reliable with both CCI mini-mag and Lapua match ammo. Upon removing the scope I discovered that the barrel is rotated to the left by about 5 degrees. I contacted the seller and received an explanation of why it was so, but no apology and no offer to rectify the matter. Clearly, there was a reason that rifle was offered with a scope already mounted! Caveat emptor.

I believe in full disclosure. So, here it is:

Marlin Model 60
15+(?) tubular magazine
Last shot hold-open
light marks on stock with a couple of minor scratches
Metal is in generally good shape with freckling on the barrel and receiver
Bushnell 4X scope and rings
Custom, 5-degree (or so) counter-clockwise barrel rotation

The rifle functions as it should, and the flaw with the barrel is not obvious unless you are attempting to use the iron sights. My problem with the rifle is that it reminds me that I got screwed every time I look at it. I paid $170. I will sell the rifle and the scope for $125 or best offer.

I live in Poulsbo, so I would be willing to travel as far as the ferry terminal at Bainbridge or Kingston. Valid Washington ID required for purchase. More pictures are available upon request.

Thanks for reading."

I was fortunate enough to be able to acquire a custom built FN Sniper Rifle chambered in .308. This rifle was built by FN in the 90s for the West Virginia State Police. A total of three were made and this happens to be one of them. The rifle features a beautifully blued and blueprinted FN mauser action made in Belgium with the serial number A102. The trigger is made by FN and is set at 2lbs.  The barrel is a 24 inch heavy stainless barrel (premium grade) made by Douglass. The stock is a top grade walnut stock from FN. On top, the rifle has a Redfield 4-12x accu-trac scope. This scope was made in the 70s to 80s before Leupold bought Redfield out. The same model scope was used by the USMC and is based on a 200 yard zero. This is truly one of a kind rifle, and I personally have shot 3 inch groups with it 300 yards with factory ammunition.  I am located in Rocky Mount, NC and respond to both email and text. Cell number is 2five2-four5eight-7zerofour9. Thank you.

As such, it is in impeccable condition and only shows light wear around the outside of the barrel from normal use. I have the red box and band to prove it. Comes with box, manual, and two magazines. I will also include a partial box of .40 S&W defense HP rounds.
This pistol shoots any kind of ammo problem free and has a great trigger- that being said, I am just more interested in the 1911 platform.
As such, I would like to make a trade for a mid-range 1911. The main one I would be interested in would be a Springfield Armory Mil-Spec. Otherwise would be interested in anything comparable, like models from Para-Ordanance, Ruger, Remington, etc. Sorry, no Rock Islands this time. Mainly interested in a commander size, but will consider full and officer size models as well.
I also have a like new Diamondback DB380 listed as well I would be willing to throw in for something a little higher end.

This is essentially the same gun as the Beretta M9 but made by Taurus. In fact, in 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, Taurus has taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever."

PS:I am posting this question from another member as I think others may benefit from my response and may have similar questions of their own


I am interested in the smith 360 you have listed. I have to admit though that I am always worried a little at buying a gun that has been modified. I mean no disrespect as you may be an expert. Can you elaborate on the work performed?

Thanks for your time 
****

No disrespect taken, I understand your concern. Please let me start by saying I wouldn't list the gun if there were any reliability or safety issues with the minor modifications I performed. Aside from the deburring and polishing, the springs can be replaced back to stock as I still have them, they are included with the gun. In short, its a basic trigger job, any parts that mate and move underneath the side plate have been smoothed on lapping stone, like sharpening a knife. I dont actually remove any substantial material, just polish off high spots and remove any rough mating surfaces. I have been doing this type of action work to all my firearms for the last several years, and while I would not consider myself an ""expert"", I am very skilled in the art of mechanics and ""tinkering"". I've been restoring cars and motorcycles with my family since i was 8 yrs old, I'm now 36 and again out of respect for the men who have taught me, I'm not an expert (in my mind an expert is just someone who has made all the mistakes there are to make in any given profession, I'm still a work in progress), but am much more skilled than most.

I have included a link to what is basically the same sort of action job I have done, its a nutnfancy video so I hope you dont have anything to do for the next 3 days, lol.

Then after i started shooting it i realized this isn’t some piece of junk, borderline cardboard boombox that will fall apart after 2 or 3 shots. 

You get the 12 ga. Stoeger Condor shotgun with 26"" barrel, 3"" chamber, 2 standard choke tubes, PLUS 2 X-full tubes for turkey hunting too. There's not a scratch on this Gun either. This thing is rugged, heavy and ready to get out there and work ... AND FOR A GREAT PRICE you have everything you’re going to need to get out there and start destroying clays. 

We’ve been very happy with this gun. It’s solid and worked every time we pulled the trigger…

Yes there are nicer guns out there but this isn’t a Browning or Beretta. This is a working man’s gun .... like a pickup truck.  SPEND YOUR MONEY on a plain gun that will be a good friend. Sale includes a sling and very nice case...***Don't miss out on this Christmas present***"

    This is a heavy barrel, 9mm (9x19) version of the legendary K-frame, 6-shot M&P revolver. S&W made 10,270 of these from 1980-1985; 6486 round with butt (and 3"" barrel), and 3784 with a square butt and 4"" barrel (one listed). Supposedly, this was the most difficult-to-manufacture revolver that S&W ever made.
 In the late 1970's, the Israelis wanted to arm the Palestinian Police force with a 9mm handgun, but didn't trust them with an auto loading pistol. Instead, they wanted a simple-to-use a revolver chambered in 9mm (and by ""simple-to-use"", they meant ""no-moon-clips""). They contracted with Smith & Wesson to make it for them. Instead of the usual ""star"" type extractor, the Model 547 features a horn-shaped extractor with small beryllium-copper spring tabs that grab the rim of each case.
 Soon after Smith & Wesson delivered the first shipment of these revolvers, the Israeli government cancelled the rest of the order and instead bought an IMI revolver that was a Model 547 knockoff. S&W released the remaining guns to the civilian market, and ended production due to extremely high manufacturing costs.  Consider trade on a S&W 44 mag with short barrel 4"" & under."
