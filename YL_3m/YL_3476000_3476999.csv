REVIEW (http://www.christiangunowner.com/taurus-pt145-review.html):

This is purely a defensive pistol. It does come in smaller calibers, but I'm of the opinion that the .45 ACP is the best combat/defensive round there is. Keep in mind that the gun is a compact .45. It does not have the mass that a Commander style 1911 has so your body is absorbing the energy. The gun is very light and compact. Its effective range when drawing and firing is 20 yards. Beyond that, drop compensation is not consistent. What I love about it is that I can carry it inside the waist band with only a t-shirt draped over the belt-line. Great for summer. A simple and reliable design with a 10 + 1 capacity.

Review (http://www.rc-trucks.org/smith-and-wesson-sigma-sw40ve-pistol-review.htm):

RELIABILITY:  This Smith and Wesson Sigma SW40VE pistol review will be based on a collection of feedback from many different users.  First of all, for those worried about jamming, let's just say that many SW40VE pistol owners have shot THOUSANDS of rounds through their pistol without problems with jamming.  So, right out of the box, most people find that this pistol performs very well.  You will find that some experienced gun owners will recommend taking any brand new pistol and breaking it down for a good cleaning.  After a thorough cleaning and light lube (NOT too much oil), many have found this simple preventative maintenance can help many auto pistols work even more reliably.  Occasionally, new guns can have residue left over from manufacturing or just have too much lube applied from the factory.  Cleaning this out and lightly lubricating critical areas can make things work more smoothly - especially a brand new semi-automatic gun that has not yet been broken in.

ACCURACY:  Many owners have found the Sigma to be a good, accurate pistol.  As with any hand gun with a short barrel, you can not expect it to shoot with the accuracy of a long barrel rifle or revolver.  It's just a simple issue of ballistics and physics.  A longer barrel will yield better accuracy.  But, for it's intended purpose (short range defense) the Sigma SW40VE does a good job at getting the job done.  Many people have reported good accuracy and stated that they would stake their life on it as a concealed carry self defense pistol.  And that's the real issue here.... the Sigma's 4"" barrel was not designed to be a firearm used for hunting wild game at long range!  This is all very obvious to most gun owners, but occasionally you get someone inexperienced that expects a compact, concealed-carry type of pistol to shoot as accurate as a high powered hunting rifle.  If you set your expectations accurately, then you will get a more accurate assessment of a gun's ability. 

ERGONOMICS:  The 18 degree angled grip was specifically designed to provide a very comfortable and natural hand position while shooting the Sigma.  The one area of the Smith and Wesson model SW40VE pistol that many people complain about is the heavy trigger pull.  Some people have found that this heavy trigger pull can make them pull the gun off target while squeezing the trigger, and they say it affects their accuracy.  This is something that many people have gotten used to with practice.  This heavier trigger pull is not by accident.  To reduce the chance of an accidental discharge, the trigger pull is purposely set to require more force.  This is not an area where Smith and Wesson will likely want to change anything because of safety and liability issues.  Keep in mind that after some use, as the parts wear in to each other, the trigger pull can smoothen out on it's own.  Also, it is a fairly simple matter for an experienced gunsmith to work over a gun to lighten the trigger pull.  Most people can get use to the trigger pull as is.   

VALUE:  At the time of this writing, the MSRP on a Smith and Wesson Model SW40VE is $482.  Actual street price can be much lower than this.  Many people have purchased their pistol for between $300 - $400.  Some people have even gotten great deals along with factory rebates and picked up a Sigma SW40VE for around $300 - which is a very good price for this gun!  Comparable pistols made by Glock or other manufacturers can cost much more. 

CONCLUSION:  There will always be people around that will find something to complain about on just about any gun.  For some people, only the most expensive brands will do.  If that's the case for you, then fine.  Each person is entitled to spend their money however they see fit.  There is some truth to the old saying ""you get what you pay for"".  HOWEVER, the issue is how much more are YOU willing to pay for small incremental improvements.  If overall value and ""bang for your buck"" is important to you, then you might want to consider the Sigma.  With everything in mind (good reliability, accuracy, price), this Smith and Wesson Sigma SW40VE pistol review would consider this handgun to be a good buy.

REVIEW (http://concealednation.org/2014/06/glock-23-gen4-review-for-concealed-carry/:)

Glock. You know the name, but do you trust the brand? Choosing the right concealed carry firearm is an important decision; a decision that should never be rushed.

Size

The Glock 23 is classified as a compact .40 S&W that measures 7.36″ long, 4.99″ high and just 1.18″ thick. Compared to it’s little sister Glock 27, it’s nearly an inch longer and roughly 3/4″ taller. On my frame (5′ 7″, 130lbs), it feels quite larger in a holster.

Unlike the 27, the 23 offers a full frame to give that pinky of yours a rest. While your pinky having a spot on the grip shouldn’t be necessary for shooting accurately, it does offer some additional comfort. To me, it feels a bit awkward sometimes when my pinky isn’t on the grip.

Caliber

One of the most popular calibers out there for concealed carry, the 40 S&W is a tried and true cartridge with great stopping power. It’s my personal favorite for concealed carry. Hmm, not too sure what else to say about this. Moving on!

Safeties

No external safeties here (well, except the trigger safety). Sometimes people overlook the fact that thumb safeties have been known to get caught up in clothing while drawing. With the Glock, your safeties are all internal and do just what they’re supposed to do. During a stressful situation, there is no need to potentially fumble with an external safety.

Furthermore, if anyone tells you that they practice disengaging their safety and it would never be an issue in a stressful situation, don’t listen to them unless they have already had to draw in a stressful situation. No person on earth will know exactly how they will react until the time comes, regardless of how much practice or experience they have. That firearm will never discharge unless you pull the trigger.

Reliability

My rule of thumb is as follows: If I can buy a brand new firearm and put 500 consecutive rounds through it without a single hiccup, it’s deemed worthy for carry. If though, even one little thing goes wrong that isn’t the fault of the ammo, the firearm is sidelined for carry. It’s just how I run my ship.

Here is what I can say about the Glock 23 and every other Glock that I’ve ever owned; I have never had a Glock malfunction. Not even once.

Compatibility

As many fans of Glock know, they have many interchangeable parts that are easy to come by. They also provide the same solutions for different firearms. Let’s say you buy a  G23 and a molded IWB holster. If one day you decide to purchase a G19 (9mm), you are able to use it in that same holster because the frames and slides are identical. Glock also has the added benefit of interchangeable magazines, and there are even some manufacturers that make conversion barrels to turn your 40 S&W into a 9mm.

Grip

The new style Gen4 grip feels much better in my hands than the Gen3′s ever did. It seems to add a little better traction and better feel, plus the new look isn’t bad either.

Simplicity

With simple items comes simple maintenance. Glocks are known for easy take-down. Now I’m not talking field strip here (although that’s super easy as well), I’m taking your full-blown take-everything-apart-one-piece-at-a-time-until-you-have-all-34-pieces-of-the-gun sitting in front of you (this includes the magazine). It’s so easy in fact, that I did it in roughly 4 minutes on my very first try, without directions.

REVIEW (http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2012/06/chris-dumm/gun-review-taurus-247-g2-45-acp/):

I approached this review with more than my typical skepticism, because I’ve had very guarded opinions about Taurus semi-automatics for decades. After shooting the 24/7 a lot, I’ve come away impressed: it comes very close to being a world-class fighting handgun.

It’s got excellent ergonomics and accuracy but it begs for a lighter trigger, and ammo sensitivity is not a mark of greatness. I give it a solid ‘B’ for effort.

This is a very unusual anomaly.

DEF STAN 91-57/2 
NATO Code: G-353 

This hiqh quality, aircraft grade synthetic grease contains Molybdenum Disulfide (aka ""Moly""), and is intended for applications that encounter extremely high temperatures and pressures. It is the specified grease for AR-10 & AR-15 barrel installations. It is also highly effective on other firearm components (i.e trigger groups).

1 fluid ounce of AeroShell 30MS is more than enough to properly install multiple AR barrels. Simply apply a small amount of grease to the outside of your barrel extension and on the threads of your barrel nut during assembly. A 1 fluid ounce container will last the occasional user years, if not a lifetime.

Please don't make the mistake of using inexpensive moly grease from your neighborhood automotive store that may contain graphite, as it can cause galling and corrosion between aluminum and steel!

The correct pistol grip cap is seen on the stock with correct feathered screw. Overall, supurb deluxe 3X grade stocks.

The metal finish on the gun is a gorgous restored vivid Color case hardened in 98%+ condition. Beautiful vibrant case color hardening is present on the Frame, lever, hammer, and end cap. The barrel is a beautiful 26 inch barrel in 38-56 with strong blue finish. Both the front and rear sights are period correct and standard. The front is a No. 21 Silver blade front sight. The rear is a Semi-buckhorn sight with correct elevator. All markings such as serial number, barrel markings are correct and show very well. The function and mechanics of this gun is excellent. The action cycles smoothly and the lock up is tight. The rifle sports a special factory ordered single set trigger that works perfectly. The screws are perfect.

The difference starts with our proprietary bolt-guidance system, which features a unique set of twin tool-steel guide rails for better stability, feeding reliability and greater out-of-the-box accuracy.

Of course, we didn’t stop there. The bolt, hammer and sear of the Model 597™ all feature an exclusive nickel-Teflon® plating for smooth, dependable operation and an ultra-crisp trigger pull. To assure reliable, long-term accuracy, we’ve also incorporated a unique positive-locking, permanently rigid barrel attachment clamp. Receivers are grooved for standard rimfire mounts and tapped/drilled for Weaver-style bases. Completing the breakthrough design are an innovative last-shot “hold open” magazine feature and our patented, easy-to-use staggered-stack magazine.

Notes from Gary Roberts, gunsmith/custom builder regarding his method of range testing after a custom build:
I take them to the range. I fire one round in a magazine to insure the gun works at all. Then a magazine with two rounds to insure the sear does not allow the gun to go full auto, then a magazine at a target at 15 yards to check accuracy. If need be I adjust the sights to make sure it has a grouping of less two inches. 
   Then I run a torture test. I load eight magazines with mixed ammo, ball, semi wad cutter, JHP. These are mixed in every magazine. I run these magazines as fast as possible through the gun. I drop the mag to the ground and slam in a new mag until these are all gone. Any failure at all I stop check the gun and disassemble and check or swap parts as needed. The gun only passes when it can go through all eight mags with no failures.
   This gun has passed the test and has one of the nicest triggers I have ever built. Precise 3.8 pound pull with no creep and perfect reset."

Well used by one our Country's Finest. Needs to be sharpened, but functions perfectly. What you see is what you get. Thanks!

""The 9050SBK is based on Benchmade's original automatic knife, the model 9000 AFO. The difference between the standard model 9050 AFO and the 9050SBT is the unique BK1® proprietary coating. BK1 coating is a matte black coating that provides excellent corrosion protection, which exceeds the ASTM-117 spec for saltwater while possessing higher scratch resistance.

The 9050SBK features handles machined of solid 6061-T6 aluminum. After machining the handles are bead blasted, to provide a sure grip, and then hard anodized for maximum protection against the elements. The blade is ground from high carbon 154CM stainless steel, and is hardened to 59-61 RC. These blades also feature our ComboEdge™ serration pattern, which is particularly well suited for cutting fibrous materials like rope or nylon webbing. The 9050 model also features a thumb safety to keep the blade from opening/closing when you don't want it to.

The 9050SBK has many features that make it superior to other knives for search and rescue (SAR) or tactical applications. Chief among these is the time proven automatic opening mechanism. This reliable system allows for rapid deployment, even with gloves or under water, yet still allows the knife to be easily closed with one hand and safely returned to the sheath. This is a major safety advantage over fixed blade knives.

Bolt locks up nice and tight, trigger is set at about 2lbs, very accurate gun.  Also included is a Harris knock-off bipod that extends from 12""-24"" and a stock sleeve that holds 9 rounds.  The 6.5 x 55 is an excellent caliber, Google it if you don't know much about it.  Factory ammo is readily available online and I am including all the reloading equipment necessary to do it yourself if you already hand load.  Comes with a bore snake and the following reloading supplies: 1)  70pcs. of cleaned brass(tumbled with walnut shell media), 2) 15pcs. of used brass not yet cleaned, 3) One 100ct. box of Federal large rifle primers, 4) a half pound of IMR 4350 smokeless powder, 5) one box (85ct) of Hornady Interbond ballistic tip 129 grain bullets, 6) RCBS reloading dies that have been used once.  I bought this rifle about 3 years ago with the intention of using it as a deer rifle up north.  As it turns out, I don't have any time to go up north so rather than see it sit I would like someone else to have it and put it to good use.  This is a relatively short gun at about 41"" overall length so it would make a good gun for an adult or a youth.

Get them dove!  :-)

This is the Mossberg 500 Special Hunter edition with a 28"" ported barrel.  It comes with a three chokes, a gun lock, the owners manual and I am including a FREE sling!

I am an FFL and can ship this to any other FFL in the country or you can pick up the Shotgun locally if you live in the San Antonio Area.

This Shotgun retails for $359, but I am taking $50 off the price since I took it bird hunting last weekend and now I cannot sell it as new...  It has three boxes of shells through it and I have thoroughly cleaned it.  I can personally confirm that it is a bird slayer!  Bacon wrapped dove breast - yum!

Mossberg is a well established shotgun manufacturer with a great reputation.

If you have any questions, feel free to call me, Scott, at REDACTED.

They have a long history in North Carolina not only as master machinist but as shooters, armorers and craftsmen. Until now Bear Creek has been mostly known behind the scenes in the firearms community for making custom barrels, complex receivers, and high end private label rifle parts for builders across the country. More recently, their sister company, Moore's Machine, introduced a base level AR-15 to the market. Recently, in their ongoing effort to produce the finest rifle possible, the Moore family has taken the entire MMC operation and moved it to their dedicated custom facility at their Bear Creek Arsenal location. At Bear Creek Arsenal, each rifle is built from the ground up on dedicated equipment and under the direct oversight and quality control of the Moore family themselves. They re-introduced the MMC rifles in late 2013 the quality has always been good, but now under the new Bear Creek Arsenal banner, I think it is even better. Buyers will notice a nicer finish, smoother lines, higher quality markings, and a more professional fit and finish than ever before. They feed as smooth as glass and the accuracy rivals that of many custom guns. I am convinced that these are the best bang for the rifle buck of any gun in America! For shooters, by shooters, that is Bear Creek Arsenal."

You were running late to meet up with your friends and ended up parking a lot further than anticipated. Now it's after 0200 a.m. and you find yourself walking along a dark, isolated street…and now your situation is about to get hairy. This is a scenario that plays itself out more than ever with financial times as tough as they have been in decades. Like countless military, law enforcement, and concealed carry aficionados I carry a GLOCK for just such an occasion. GLOCK is used by law enforcement and security personal world wide as well as here in the USA because of their rugged dependability and combat reliability. In fact when it comes to iconic firearms GLOCK is at the top of any list because of their innovation and quality components that GLOCK is world famous for. No other firearm is relied on more than a GLOCK for defense and duty use. Pick up a GLOCK 17, 21, 22, 31 for duty use; GLOCK 19, 23, 32, 30 for duty and carry, or GLOCK 26, 27, 33, 36 for deep concealment.

Superior versatility is available with this high-performance, 10mm Auto pistol. With reduced dimensions compared to the standard size GLOCK 20, the subcompact GLOCK 29 is also suitable for concealed carry. In addition to the use as a backup weapon for hunting, more and more security personnel on patrol appreciate the comfortable firing characteristics and the grip ergonomics of the G29 10mm with its standard 10 round magazine.

It was owned by my great great grandfather Col Ephraim Francis Truesdell Sr. (1842-1906)  
Ephraim's father. Erastus. enlisted in the cavalry. It soon became apparent that Erastus' advancing age and the care of his large family would necessitate that he remain at home. His son. Ephraim, only 19 years of age, stepped forward to volunteer in his father's place. Ephraim saw action at Lebanon, Kentucky; Snow Hill, McMinnville,Tullahoma, Shelbyville, and various locations in Tennessee. (Karl Truesdell Genealogy): ""Civil War: enlisted in Plymouth, Mich. 26 Jul, 1862; Pvt. Co.
