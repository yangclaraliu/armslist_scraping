This is a legit 9mm MP5 not that 22lr look alike. Made by Turner Fabrications who has been making MP5's for a long damn time, its the closest you will get to an Genuine HK MP5 without taking out a second Mortgage! Note, HK does not make MP5's anymore, they havent for awhile, finding one for sale is near impossible, and if you do it is going to cost a but load. This thing is in perfect condition and functions flawlessly.

So here it is:
-MP5, All parts German HK, minus the US made Receiver(LSC Manf.)!!!!! There is one on Gunbroker right now being sold by Turner Fabrications for $3100, Ill value mine at $2800.

-Fluted Salt Nitrate barrel, Threaded 1/2x28 and 3-Lug for both types of suppressors.

-NAVY SEF trigger group/housing (this MP5 shoots Semi-Auto ONLY tho)

-Has a ""Action 3"" bolt group with F style bolt carrier, this means it will fire F/A with a NFA Registered F/A Trigger pack. These bolt groups are banned from further importation and cost about $1,000, check hkparts.net(SOLD OUT) to confirm for yourself. Couple this with a registered F/A Sear installed in a F/A pack and your ready to blast rounds. Obviously NFA Rules apply if you take this route, and it costs $$$.

-MFI Low Profile claw mount($130)

-3 Mags ($50 ea)

-Bushnell TRS Red Dot(~$100)

-Brand New Folding stock($140) in separate box, I was going to make this MP5 an SBR but spent money on a suppressor instead and just haven't done it yet. I probably will if I keep it, so get it while its a Non-NFA Weapon and SBR it yourself!

-1,000+ rnds of factory 9mm, most are American Eagle, some Remington and Winchester too.($300 @ $0.30/rnd)

----Note, installing the Stock on this ""Pistol"" makes it a SBR(Short Barreled Rifle), which needs to be Registered with the NFA branch of the ATF. Do not install it without registering it first, you will be getting pounded by a big fat guy in prison if you do and get caught.


Serious offers only, do your research before making a Low Ball Offer, also have an offer ready when contacting me, please no emails like ""How much do you want for it"".

Asking $700, keep in mind this comes with TRUGLO Sights and 5x mags and if you know H&K, you know the mags aren't cheap. I see this gun all over gunbroker and armslist for the same price if not more with only two mags and stock sites..."

The .40 caliber C-100 is hard to find here in the states and was only released here recently. Functions well but I didn't like it like I thought I would.

I'd be interested in trading it for a different mid sized .40 or one of the police trade in Glock 22's that have flooded the market lately. I just bought an engagement ring for my girlfriend so I have no cash to add to a trade, so looking for an even trade only. Really only interested in .40's but would still consider 9mm's.

It was designed to meet three important objectives: be optimized for competition, be durable and easy to maintain, and be natural-pointing and low-recoil. With this in mind, the SV10 Prevail III features a vault-like low-profile action, a self-adjusting fore-end mechanism that ensures consistent contact points with the barrels for best accuracy, an advanced recoil-reducing device (on select models) that dramatically cuts down recoil, muzzle jump and vibration, and super-durable OptimaBore barrels. All this and more make the SV10 Prevail III the shotgun for the most ambitious challenges.

I found this at a garage sale about 20 years ago. Originally it came with a metal bracket that turned down on both sides. I thought perhaps it was mounted on the bumper of a warden's car. A couple of years ago I showed it to a retired game warden, now in his 80s. He said that Wisconsin experimented with motorcycles for game wardens back in the 30s or 40s. This badge would have been handlebar-mounted. Unfortunately, I had taken the mount off some years back so I could display it. Now the mount is gone. I have had 20 years to enjoy this rare item and now am willing to let someone else use it to generate oohs, ahhs and conversations. Look closely at the close-up photo -- it's the seal of the Great State of Wisconsin. It would look good on the handlebars of a vintage Harley. A new bracket would be easy to make. I can even send a drawing of how the bracket looked."

The pistol has close to 600rds through it with zero issues. Has some holster wear but is still in good shape. 

I take exceptional care of my firearms, this has been thoroughly cleaned and lubricated after every range session. I love this gun; only reason I am selling this is that I'd like to get something in 9mm.

Has 3 mags, speed loader, Hoppes boresnake, box, and all the standard issue Glock paperwork.

Would prefer to sell outright but will accept trades for similar valued 9mm. PLEASE do not waste my time and yours with an offer for some BS gun. I am also interested in certain Sig Sauer pistols and I would throw in money on top of the value of this gun.

The price is extremely fair, so please do not try to haggle. It is $425 FIRM if buying outright.

Brand new from Taurus in 2013, the fully revamped PT111 MP G2! This is a wonderful medium-capacity compact, concealable 9mm pistol. The frame, grip, ergonomics, trigger system, slide, and machining are all updated and improved from previous models. The result is a much more pleasing pistol suitable for concealed carry. While it is a striker-fired pistol, this design includes a rare double-strike capability to allow re-striking a round that fails to fire. It is brand-new, and includes a plastic hard case, lock, owner's manual, and two 12-round magazines.

Factory Part # JXF9F21 THIS GUN COMES WITH DAVIDSON'S LIFETIME REPLACEMENT GUARANTEE!! Item #:	JXF9F21 UPC_Code:	REDACTED19 Description:	BTA PX4 STORM F 9MM PST 17RD Manufacturer:	Beretta Model #:	PX4 Storm Type F Type:	Pistol: Semi-Auto Finish:	Bruniton (Matte Black) Stock: Black Plastic Grips, Interchangeable Backstraps Sights:	3-Dot Sights Barrel Length:	4"" Overall Length:	7.59"" Weight:	27.5 oz Caliber:	9MM Capacity:	17+1 Action:	Double Action # of Mags:	2 Features:	Picatinny Accessory Rail Product Info : The NATO-certified Beretta Px4 Storm double/single-action semiauto is the culmination Berettaâs experience in engineering pistols for military and law enforcement. Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering. The lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand. This pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooterâs hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame.

Perfectly sized and balanced, it is equally suited for concealed carry, home- or personal defense as well as recreational shooting. As you read this, the PX4 Storm in its various configurations is being carried by countless law-enforcement and military organizations around the world, in every environment imaginable. This is because it is engineered to be absolutely reliable and ultra-durable, and it is capable of shooting well over 100,000 rounds without any part breakage. And its dimensions that fall right in between the full-size PX4 Storm and its sub-compact counterpart make it perfect for everyday holster carry (concealed or open), offering light weight and smaller proportions while still affording a full grip. The Px4 Storm Compact offers a plethora of features that make it easily adaptable to your preferences. Its modular construction allows you to interchange backstraps to perfectly fit your hand and shooting style, while the slide lock and safety are ambidextrous; in addition, the magazine release is reversible, meaning that you can easily train with and use your PX4 with either hand. Other features include a retractable lanyard loop, as well as user-adjustable sights and a number of accessories that make this pistol a true champion in its class. This handgun offers intuitive controls and an absolutely safe mechanism. In a holster or purse, an automatic firing-pin block and a manual safety enable you to confidently carry it all day--day after day, without any worries. Furthermore, it is easy to use and take apart for cleaning, and its tough Bruniton finish make it even more trouble-free to maintain. In short, the PX4 Storm Compact will give you years and years--and thousands upon thousands of rounds--of reliable service, accuracy and safety for personal or home defense.

I left 3 messages on his phone and emailed the night before but he didn't take the time to tell me he was not coming or he had sold the rifle.  I even told him I had to drive 5 hours 1 way to get there.  He may be on the up and up, but I would not waste my time driving over an hour to meet this person.  I emailed him last night and ask him to pull this ad if he was not going to follow through as to not to waste someone else's time or gas money, but as you can verify, the ad is still on here.

CTFail SafeÂ® bullets are unique dual chamber designs that provide deep penetration on virtually any big game animal. The front of the bullet is a metallurgical breakthrough--the uniquely designed hollow point expands perfectly and retains the bulk of its mass while resisting fragmentation. The rear core, on the other hand, is hardened lead enclosed in a combination of copper alloy jacket and Winchester's patented steel cup. The added strength of steel prevents bullet deformation and promotes exceptional penetration in heavy muscle or bone.
     1. Specially constructed noseâdeep hollowpoint in samegenous, specially treated copper alloy nose causes dramatic expansion with high weight retention, resulting in a large diameter wound channel.
     2. Integral separation between front and rear chambersâhard separating wall halts expansion and shields rear core from deformation at high impact velocities.
     3. Winchester's patented steel cupâtough steel cup further protects rear core from deformation, allows bullet to penetrate deeply and pevents post-impact bullet deflection.
     4. Hardened lead rear coreâlead alloy rear core is extremely concentric and form fitted to jacket for maximum accuracy and weight retention.
     5. Positive heel closureâheel closure disc prevents core slippage or separation on impact, maximizing retained mass and providing deep penetration.
     6. Molybdenum Disulfide exterior bullet coatingâreduces fouling, pressure and friction between bullet and bore.

So here is the story, and you can believe it or not, your choice... but it was told to me by the old man, and I have no reason to doubt him.  During the war, OSS agents who were inserted behind enemy lines were most often in disguise as German officers.  All you history buffs out there will know that the OSS was the first incarnation of the CIA as we know it now.  German officers of higher rank did not carry the ubiquitous P38, but as a status symbol, the more elegant and refined PP.  It was a way to psychologically separate them as the even more superior of the officers.  The Allies infiltrated the officer corps with an unknown number of spies, and needed them to be as inconspicuous as possible, so they issued the Walther PP to them.  Problem: Walther factories were in Germany, and thus all weapon serial numbers were fairly easily traceable.  Solution: The OSS issued non-serial numbered weapons as expendable and untraceable to their agents in the field.  This weapon is one of those.  Bought it from a good friend who's grandfather was in the OSS during the war, and have no reason to doubt his authenticity or story.  The Facts:  This is a Waffenfabrik Walther, Zella-Mehlis (Thur) Model PP 7.65mm (.32 ACP) pistol.  It has NO SERIAL NUMBER!  It has not been modified/obliterated/drilled out/removed in any way, it never had one.  I have completely disassembled it, and there are no proof marks, no serial numbers, no nothing to indicated any kind of age/issue/useage.    Original Bakelite grips and magazine finger extension.  It has some age/carry rubbing of the bluing, but it is original bluing, and in very good condition for it's age.  Barrel is in Excellent condition, with bright, crisp grooves, which tells me it has rarely been fired.  Unknown round count.  Will come with 2 boxes of .32 ACP.  Cycles and shoots beautifully...like a Walther should!  Live round indicator.  9+1 capacity.  Hammer block safety.  Hold open on last round, but no slide lock otherwise.  Here is a chance to own a beautiful piece of history, that will not be on the books...anywhwere.  Will want to see a good guy card and DL so I know you're legit, and I am happy to show you my CPL and DL if you want it as well.

the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed 
carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The 
Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt
to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs 
the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured 
technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly 
substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine 
catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed 
operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail 
for your attachments."
