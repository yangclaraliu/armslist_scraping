What I have is a championship winning High Standard 10-X model 9372 custom target pistol built between 1981 and 1982. If you're familiar with this pistol, you know that there wasn't a single 10-X sold that wasn't capable of a 5 shot group with less than 0.310"" spread. This one is no different and has won the Colorado State Silhouette Championship. I'm well aware how rare it is to come across this weapon and moreso aware of what the last one that landed on an auction site went for so talking to me about blue book ""value"" isn't relevant in any form and won't be replied to. This is possibly one of the rarest 10-X's available as the gunsmith double stamped his initials. I've been trying to find out if he can be contacted to find out if this was the case with many, or just a handful, but either way, the only other 10-X I've found is lightyears away in condition. My 10-X has Box, Tool, 3 magazines and has been meticulously maintained. The one on the auction site has visible signs of degradation, no box, and the one magazine has the initials carved into it. The last one that came available in similar condition as mine was sold for ~$5600. I don't expect to get that but I also don't want to see a bunch of emails asking if I'd take $1500

This gun is in absolutely wonderful condition, slick and smooth action.

Barrel, full length magazine tube and receiver have bright blue. Exceptional color on the lever and hammer.Wood fits quite nicely, is solid with no splits or cracks. There is a nice knot on the stock, right side. The condition of the rifling is very good. The crescent butt plate is checkered steel. It is in great working order with no major dents, scratches, or dings. I have used this gun gently over the years, probably less than 200 rounds have been fired. I have taken good care of the gun, it is completely original. It does have some scratches and dings, which are minor overall. The dings are from transporting and bumping the butt, not dropping it in the dirt.

This will be an excellent addition to any collection.

I purchased 4000 of these projectiles planning to reload in this caliber, but I have sold all of my 40 S&W caliber pistols so I no longer need these heavy boxes hanging around in the house.  I purchased them directly from Midway USA I paid $542.95 with shipping.  I am asking for $140 per 1000.  If you buy all 4000 in one shot then I will drop the price to $500 which is a couple bucks under the per 1000 price I paid and I am eating the shipping fees. 

Description straight from MidwayUSA website:

Rainier LeadSafe Bullets 40 S&W, 10mm Auto (400 Diameter) 180 Grain Plated Hollow Point

Rainier offers a large selection of swaged lead core copper plated bullets that are low in cost but substantially high in accuracy. Rainier swages their bullets twice with lead wire in an effort to ensure the tightest uniformity as well as prevention of premature wearing of barrels. While Rainier doesn't publish their own reloading information, they recommended using lead bullet load data when loading their bullets as well as a slight taper crimp. Rainier recommends a maximum velocity of 1,500 fps. 

These bullets feature a lead core that is completely covered by copper plating. They are resized after being plated with approximately 0.004"" of copper plating. This unique design makes them suitable for most indoor ranges, which often require the use of bullets with no exposed lead. The base is slightly concave to maximize the bullet to bore seal."

In my opinion this is the perfect 22 auto-pistol - stainless and polymer for ease of maintenance coupled with Ruger's legendary durability. It was last listed in the Ruger catalog in 2011 and had a suggested retail price of $448!

I bought this 22/45 new and it is an excellent shooting gun with only around 500 rounds down the pipe. It shoots any ammo (even the cheap stuff) without problems. I also have the original case, lock and all paperwork.

I really like the gun but I recently acquired a Blackhawk and re-discovered that I'm a 'revolver guy' and love the single actions."

Product Description
Weighing in at just 7.3 pounds and only 20"" axle to axle, this bow is no doubt a game changer. It may be lighter and faster than its predecessor, the Ghost 400, but the 410 has maintained some of its most impressive features. Like the 400, the 410 features Barnett's proprietary Carbonlite Riser Technology (CRT), which shifts the balance point away from the riser and back to the shoulder of the shooter. Barnett's unique patent-protected, ultra-light, super-strong Carbonlite riser boasts an incredible 5-to-1 safety factor and provides the perfect balance of weight and speed.

The Smith and Wesson Model 49 revolver is for the most part the S&W Model 38 however, with a steel “J” style frame. The Model 49, a member of the “Bodyguard” line of weapons, was introduced in 1957 and fires five .38 Special rounds. While having a unique hump-back shape, the revolver was designed with a mainly internal hammer that can be cocked and fired from within a users pocket without snagging on clothing. Being primarily a defensive weapon, and as the name indicates, it is used mostly by bodyguards or citizens who wish to be casually, and unobtrusively armed.

This is a 5.56/223 pistol that uses regular AR-15 magazines.  Because it's a pistol, it can be carried in a vehicle loaded and because of it's light weight and small size, it could potentially even be carried concealed.  It has a 9"" barrel but it's design makes it only 18.5"" in total length and only weighs about 3 pounds.

Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is available in 9 mm Luger or .40 S&W calibers.

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

The 9mm SUB-2000 can be configured in the following magazine types: GLK17, GLK19, S&W59, BERETTA92,  SIG226.

This 338 Win. Mag. load offers the rapid initial expansion of the tipped (TTSX) TSX bullet, yet it still penetrates deeply as do all TSX style bullets. This bullet is best suited for use on animals under 800 lbs where the greater impact damage is beneficial and where enormous amounts of penetration are wasted. Even though I have killed 1500lb moose (with one shot) with this exact load, I prefer the deeper penetration of our item 52B (225gr. TSX) for animals that large.

Both my 338’s have custom 22 inch barrels as the below velocities show. For your reference, 24 inch barrels will GENERALLY give almost 75 fps more velocity than 22 inch barrels and 26 inch barrels will GENERALLY give 50 to 60 fps more than 24 inch barrels.

New condition, this kit was never used and the only use it has seen is being taken out of the shipping box and having the components mounted onto the belt. The kit was purchased directly from Blue Force Gear. It's a great kit, but it doesn't quite suit my needs so I am selling it.

The Beltminus Patrol Kit is an excellent belt rig by Blue Force Gear, great for anyone who wants a light weight, all-in-one support system for their AR or AK rifle. The kit comes with four double AR-15/M4/M16 magazine pouches (can also fit AK-47/AK-74 Mags, though they will be a little more snug) for a total of 8 mags, with the ability to add more with the addition of more pouches. Also included are two Blue Force Gear medium utility pouches, and a single Blue Force Gear Trauma Kit NOW IFAK (no medical supplies included). The belt also has spaces left in the MOLLE with this size for more magazine pouches, dump pouches, or anything else that will fit. All pouches and the Trauma Kit NOW can be detached and moved around to suit your needs, and can also be removed and mounted onto traditional MOLLE gear as well.

The Beltminus Patrol Kit uses Blue Force Gear's MOLLEminus system, an extremely light weight and durable MOLLE system that is still 100% backwards compatible with traditional MOLLE/PALS systems, and is equal to or stronger than 1000D Cordura while being up to 60% lighter.

Blue Force Gear only makes quality products. Their equipment is standard issue now for the USMC and many other elite military forces. For more info on the Beltminus Patrol Kit and more detailed specs go to: https://www.blueforcegear.com/beltminus-patrol-kit.html

The “Baby” of the Desert Eagle family offers an excellent handgun value and plenty of firepower. The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market. 
Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free.

This particular rifle was used as a demo by the manufacturer at trade shows around the world. Consequently it has seen very little use. The rifle comes with a classic arrowhead muzzle brake on a 29"" barrel. It is fitted with an 18"" 27 MOA taper picatinny rail and comes with iron sights. The spiked bipod is generally seen on the military version of the rifle and is considered an upgrade. The monopod, carry handle, the ten round magazine and the manual complete this package. All of this comes in the original pelican hard case as seen in the pictures. I am an individual seller located in Reno, NV. As such, I am limited in the number of payment options I can accept. I will accept USPS money orders, cashiers cheques, personal cheques, and am even willing to go through the escrow route. Either way, the weapon only ships once the payments have cleared.

For additionally safety and piece of mind for both parties, I am ok with having this item transferred to your FFL from ANY FFL of your choice in the Reno, NV area. So follow me on this. Assuming you want to purchase the gun, you pick ANY FFL of your choice in the Reno, NV area.(Preferably a reputable store front like Silver State Arms or Maccabee Arms etc...) I will hand them the gun to be shipped to you. You can confirm they have possession of the weapon. Once the payment has cleared, I will give them the go ahead to ship. Does this sound reasonable?? Other ideas are also welcomed.

This item is new, we are a licensed gun shop and we received it from the manufacturer or a distributor. It has never been fired and since our shop specializes in more expensive, higher end merchandise we are not open to the public. This usually means you will get a pristine, mint condition example that has never been handled by anybody as most of our inventory is received and shipped out in the same box it arrived in and never even opened.

Hello and Thank you for checking out our auction. Up for auction is a brand new in box Barrett M107A1 CQ .50 BMG with a 20"" barrel. Please check availability before bidding.

A whole new legend.
It may be related to the Model M82A1, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs four pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough.

Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett® M107. An all-new bolt carrier group has been designed that is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. its titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor.

The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel, anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold.

Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. A titanium barrel key and fully chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle’s durability."

 Like new Savage Arms Model 10 BAS-K in 308: Shot only once to get sighted in. Otherwise sitting in safe.

 I borrowed this description from hunting rifles review:
 ""The Savage Arms Model 10 BAS-K is offered with a heavy 24"" button-riffled, free-floating fluted barrel that is outfitted with a muzzle brake which will not only reduce the felt recoil, but at the same time will significantly enhance rapid target acquisition on follow-up shots. The model features detachable box magazines and wraparound rails for optics and accessories. The detachable box magazine can hold 10 rounds of .308 Winchester ammunition. The model also features M4-style interchangeable buttstock with variable-length adjustment.""

 Not a blemish on it. Maybe (conservative) 30-40 rounds down pipe. Has a bipod (Harris clone) that works well. Mounted on top is a Bushnell Elite 4200 6-24x 40mm scope. One 10 round magazine. Has great AccuTrigger. This is a tack driver out of the box. Sighted it in at 300 yards.

Put around 200 rounds through; never a hiccup. I LOVE IT!  Problem is I'm very small framed and it's too bulky for me for conceled carry and I can't afford to just buy another gun. 
As far as mods go, three things: 
1. I put a ""SiderLock"" trigger on it. Basically same pull as factory with the exception of having an integrated safety, and all metal construction. From all my research it's a better trigger. 
2. I personally rounded the trigger guard. It is a clean job, though no stippling done. I'm a finish carpenter and took my time with it so it looks good. It's actually hard to tell unless you look for it. 
3. I put a glue-on clip on it for those times I've carried iwb without a holster (rarely). 
I don't use the safety much.  I put the saftey on there so I'd have the option. I did my research on it and reviews are great. There's very little chance of engaging it inadvertently and it's a nice option to have.  I've found it especially useful when teaching someone to shoot and basic safety rules like finger off the trigger. It just gives me that added security that they don't make a rookie mistake. And they can and do. Ask me how I know lol!

When you need a concealed carry pistol that offers uncompromising power and versatility, check out the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in .45ACP. You’ll find yourself amazed at how enjoyable it is to shoot a pistol that’s so small and so powerful. In fact, you might end up spending more time at the range than you planned. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack turns Springfield Armory®’s single stack XD-S® platform into a mid-sized pistol. The sub-compact frame extends to full-size length when you insert an X-Tension™ magazine, adding capacity and controllability for your time at the range. Use a flush fitting magazine for concealed carry, and you’ll forget it’s there. Choosing a multi-purpose handgun doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. The .45 ACP is a cartridge that compromises nothing in the power department, and the XD-S® is a concealed carry pistol without compromise.

Installed on the pistol's frame, this conversion kit maintains the feel and profile of its centerfire counterpart, providing the user with a familiar grip angle and operating controls for economical, yet useful and realistic practice. The kit is compatible with single-stack or STI wide-body frame designs with the appropriate magazine inserted. The 10-round magazines lock the slide to the rear when depleted, a unique attribute that is often overlooked on rimfire conversions.
