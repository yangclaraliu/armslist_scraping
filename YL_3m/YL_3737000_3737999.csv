Great drum, can be swapped out with feeders for the 10/22 and PPS conversion. Excellent drum mag for your conversion or dedicated .22 AR upper.

From Blackdog:
THIS WILL NOT FIT THE SMITH AND WESSON RIFLE ALSO KNOWN AS THE S&W.22 LR.

Features: Built with an interchangeable feed tower. You can easily disassemble the drum, slide your AR-22 tower out and replace it with the new Black Dog 10-22 or S&W.22 feed towers.

Material: Polycarbonate & Glass Filled Nylon

We do not guarantee that the drum will work in full-auto setups.  However, many customers report that with a little fine tuning they can get the drum to work in full-auto.

Recommended Ammunition: Federal, CCI/Blazer, American Eagle. Use a round nosed bullet. Stay away from hollow points. Ammunition not listed will not feed well in our products.



Black dummy rounds: The plastic black dummy rounds are an important part of the drum assembly. They feed the ammo from the drum body to the tower. BDM does not recommend using dummy rounds as real bullets.

Clear rubber bands: Each drum is assembled with one clear rubber band and two extra bands taped to the inside of the drum box.

Spring Tension: If you come across feeding issues, the drum spring may be too tight causing ammo to rush up and out the tower. You may also have feeding issues if the spring is too loose. Spring tension may also be required to adjust to your rifle’s bolt speed. The manual provided will guide you through disassembly & assembly. The manual is also available as a PDF on our website.

Winding Rotor: Pulling the rotor counter clockwise and letting go will most likely damage the drum.  It can cause the internal followers to break."

I'm embarking on a pricey SBR build, and thought I would put this out there as a small offset of that cost. Buyer must have CPL and willing to complete a BoS for my records, or if no CPL then go through an FFL. No trades.

Selling all or nothing - please don't ask me about parting it out. I've shot only non-corrosive through it, and given it thorough cleanings. Previous owner shot corrosive through it (I still have some ammo) and was diligent about neutralizing the salts after shooting. Good rifle - just don't get to shoot it much and as mentioned wanting to make room for the new gun.

Well i end up fimding this one in a long shot milled receiver and it is am arsenal sas m7 classic uf . So i never seen one really on sale and always wanted to build a classic Bulgarian akm with the milled parts kit you see surfacing the web. All numbers match and is 922 compliance.  I do have alot in this rifle and really do not want to sell but xmas os right around the corner car needs some fixing up and i figured i can build another one around tax time. Everything is pretty much bought through kvar the number one arsenal dealer in America.  This rifle has everything you would wamt to have that true russian Bulgarian look. I absolutely love this rifle and i sat my ar and this side by side and is making one of the toughest desicions i have made when it comes to guns. I will probably never be able to own one ever again they are a diamond in a rough.  Especially with the arsenal receiver.  Shoots great have probably 40 through it.  Chromed lined barrel sights are dead center amd accurate.  I love this rifle so please absolutely no low balls nor trades unless they are quality firearms plus cash on your end. No shotguns no black powder, just dont try being an idiot and think your Remington 700 plus 300 cash will do it. Comes with one waffle arsenal mag and Bulgarian sling.  I do have barrel nut still but the slant brake i think looks much better. Accepting offers if you dont hear back obviously im not interested.  God bless and good luck finding one of these again. I almost forgot i been waiting for bob to get his list down i think its around 5 months now but it does need finished. I would be upset if whoever bought it painted it with diracoat or ceracoat. These are met to be blued the older ones anyway.  And yes i built this gun. And yes i would take it as a service rifle in a heart beat. Never once have it had a hung up or anything.  Its an ak everything is pressed and pinned it will last forever"

299,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3737299,"For Sale/Trade:  Troy-Bilt Bronco 19hp Kohler 42"" cut riding mower","valdese, Hickory / Lenoir, North Carolina",$ 700,"Listed On: Sunday, November 23, 2014",Farming,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This Troy-Bilt Bronco is an outstanding and user friendly riding mower. It has The 19hp Kohler motor in it that runs smooth and strong, giving you plenty of power to cut even tall grass without a problem. The automatic transmission is very user friendly and operates by  the push of a pedal (on the right side) much like a car's throttle pedal.  The brakes (the pedal on the left side of the mower) work good and are independent of the clutch and throttle like other riding mowers with the auto transmission. Giving the operator much more control in tight corners or hills etc.. There is also a brake lock on the dash for parking on hills or trailers or whatever the circumstance may be.  The 42"" cut mowing deck  is easy to maintain and if needed, to take off for changing belts. It is controlled by the two levers on the right side of the seat, one controlling the height of the deck and one that turns the blades on and off. The larger discharge shoot that this model has helps reduce any grass clumping that may occur in wet grass. It also has turf saving wheels on the deck. The frame is a fully welded step through model that is very easy to get on and off of and it even has a cup holder (awesome).  Next to the cup holder is the shifter for forward, neutral and reverse. The throttle control on the dash works properly and has full movement. all the way down is for low idle which this mower, at the low idle, runs smooth and quiet. Move the throttle up and you can feel the power of the 19hp engine as it climbs a big hill or attacks the tall grass. All the way up on the throttle is the choke for cold starts but I've found I rarely have to use it. It has an easy to grip wide steering wheel that smoothly turns on a dime. The wide leather seat is very comfortable and is not scratched or torn. This mower was bought new in May and has maybe 15 hours of easy grass time. I have had no problems out of it other than having to put a deck belt on it when a small stick was lodged in between the pulley and made the belt break. A really easy 20 minute fix and I didn't even have to take the deck off. I unplugged the safety switch that shuts the mower off if you try to mow in reverse. This was aggravating if I had to turn around or something while mowing but it can easily be plugged back up for whatever reason if the buyer wishes to. I apologize for the bad pictures. I had just finished mowing when these were taken and it had turned dark outside. I regret having to sell this incredible lawn mower but sometimes life demands sacrifices. feel free to email me any questions or for more pics etc.. thanks"

Bought it new earlier this week, and its only had 50 rounds through it, will come with its case, mag loader, and two 12 round magazines.  These are solid steel CZ75 clones if you aren't familiar with them, uses CZ pattern mags and can be carried cocked and locked or hammer down.  The .40 caliber C-100 is hard to find here in the states and was only released here recently.  Functions well but I didn't like it like I thought I would.

I'd be interested in trading it for a different mid sized .40 or one of the police trade in Glock 22's that have flooded the market lately.  I just bought an engagement ring for my girlfriend so I have no cash to add to a trade, so looking for an even trade only.  Really only interested in .40's and not interested in rifles or shotguns at this time, but I might make an exception for a nice .357 revolver or a Taurus PT92.

I bought it earlier this year (paid $749) to hunt white tails and unfortunately I can't handle the recoil of a 44 Magnum revolver. I have shot thousands and thousands of 9mm and figured this wouldn't be much different, but I quickly developed a flinch that I never had before. It will come with a few rounds of Hornady 44 Magnum 240 grain FXT factory ammunition and about 60 rounds of Winchester White Box Deer load 240 grain. I have shot about 60 rounds through it in the last couple days and she is in great condition. There is a small nick on one of the grip panels. Also includes Factory (amazing) scope rings that return to zero if you want to scope it some times and remove it other times...

I am celebrating Thanksgiving and hunting this week in Illinois near Terre Haute. I am willing to meet back in my home state of Indiana in Terre Haute (will need to see IN DL and LTCH) to sell this or if you are from Illinois I can meet you at an Illinois FFL to arrange the transfer near me (on your dime).


Bonus: I also have a BRAND NEW IN BOX Simmons Pro Hunter 2-6x Handgun scope that the buyer can add to for $125. I just paid $179 for it and will just return it if the buyer doesn't want it / doesn't help sell the gun quickly. I am pricing this low to try and free up some black Friday $ ASAP.

This is my bottom dollar. If I don't have $ in my hand by Tuesday I will remove ad/adjust price to a more favorable number to me. Like I said, priced to sell quick!

The M7X Matrix™ model features the same fine qualities as the other Matrix holsters.
It is a durable thermoplastic holster that is lightweight, comfortable, and nearly maintenance free! The M7X is also fast, very concealable, and easy on the budget.
Setting it apart from other thermoplastic belt holsters, the patent-pending snap-on belt loops of the M7X – similar to those found on our deluxe Side Snap Scabbard – make it fast and easy to attach and remove from the belt.

The M7X is a strong side belt holster that uses a butt-forward cant to enhance conceal-ability. The open top makes the draw quick and easy, while the molding and shaping retains the pistol securely. Unlike so many other harsh, mechanical-looking plastic holsters, the Matrix resembles a hand-molded Galco leather holster.
The M7X features easy on/off belt loops that fit belts up to 1 1/2"".

I have for sale a nice West German made Sig Sauer P226 chambered in 9mm. It was made in 1990 which is a hard year to find as the will fell in 1991. It has some holster wear but still looks very nice and functions perfectly.  The gun is all matching numbers including the barrel which is rare.  The inside of the gun proves that it has not seen very many rounds and the bore is perfect and new looking. It comes with the original box with the original German manual and target.  It also comes with the two original West German mags that originally came with the gun new and I also have another West German mag as well, so a total of three 15 round mags.  I am asking $500 or best offer as these are becoming more and more rare and the manufacture year of this particular one is rare.  Text REDACTED if interested."

The revolver comes in its original, serial matching, box with all the documents from S&W that came with it new.

The front sight is a red ramp, the rear is a nice adjustable sight.

Hi there. Made the decision to switch back to 9mm. Got rid of my Glock 23, and now I'm looking to get rid of the Glock 22 as well. I am looking to trade for a Glock 26 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com) 

Comes with everything in the original box. 5 mags (3 factory, 2 brand new extended 31 round), lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me.

The quality of pictures are severely reduced when uploaded to armslist so it can make some textures look strange (like on the extended mags.) If you'd like the full size pictures, I can email them to you."
