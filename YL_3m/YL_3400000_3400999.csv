I just dont get out and fire it as much as I would like. I am asking 400 OBO to sell my gun. You can text me at REDACTED or shoot me an email. Thank you."

127,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3400127,For Trade:  Reloading Brass For Trade,"Tolland, CT, Connecticut, United States",Offer,"Listed On: Sunday, May 20, 2018",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm wanting to trade these reloadable brass cases. I'm looking for boxer primed brass 7.62x39 or 10mm AUTO that are in good condition. Good condition means the brass is not cracked, heavily dented, corroded or tarnished and can be reloaded several times. With that being said, once fired brass is still preffered. Because I've been asked numerous times in the past, 7.62x39 is NOT the same as military 308 winchester which is 7.62x51 NATO.In addition to wanting 7.62x39 and 10mm AUTO I will consider trading for other calibers if you want some of my brass 380 acp, 9mm, 40 S&W, 223 Rem, 243 Win, 30-30 Win, 30-06 sprg or aluminum 45 acp. The other calibers I want to reserve for 7.62x39 and 10mm trading.I'm also looking to possibly find some 6.5 Grendel, 45 GAP and 25 acp for a friend.All of my brass has been de-primed and wet tumbled clean with stainless steel pins except for the aluminum 45 acp, brass 40 S&W & 9mm.Some brass has been sized and they will be listed separate from the others.Some calibers have also been sorted by headstamp. Lists of those will be at the bottom.Trades are based on the value of each caliber. An example is if one caliber has a value of 20 cents each and another caliber is 10 cents each that would be a 1 for 2 trade ratio, but I'll still lean the ratios in your favor as an incentive.Trades should be large enough to use a padded flat rate USPS envelope, but larger trades using a medium or large flat rate USPS box are preferred even more.HS is an abbreviation for "" Head Stamp ""I have what is listed below:--UNCLEANED--(50,000+) 9mm brass mixed HS(2628) 45 ACP Boxer Primed ALUMINUM (600) 40 S&W brass mixed HS--DEPRIMED, SIZED & CLEANED--(8876) 380 ACP(1528) 30-30 WIN(865) 30-06 SPRG(422) 243 Win--DEPRIMED & CLEANED-- (2500) 223 Federal HS (3000) 45 ACP LPP Federal HS (1500) 223 PMC HS(922) 357 Sig(860) 30 Carbine(294) 32 ACP(220) 32 S&W Long(215) 50 AE mostly Hornady HS(178) 303 British(174) 7mm Magnum(158) 35 Remington(131) 9mm Makarov(120) 7.62x38R Nagant Revolver PPU HS(116) 38 Super mostly nickel plated(72) 7.7x58 Jap PPU HS(60) 300 WSM brass and nickel(50) 6.5x55mm Swede NEW BRASS Winchester HS(50) 32 S&W Short(47) 327 Federal Magnum FC HS(44) 6.5x55mm Swede once fired(43) 300 Savage RP HS(40) 44 Special(36) 25-06 converted from 270 mostly WIN HS(32) 22 Hornet(32) 32 H&R Magnum(31) 25-06 converted from 30-06 WIN HS(24) 8mm Mauser(24) 6.8 SPC FC HS(24) 7.62x25 Tok(21) 44-40(21) 7.63×25mm Mauser PPU HS(16) 300 Win Mag(14) 25-06 Remington(12) 30 Luger(12) 7mm-08 RP HS(11) 41 Rem Mag(11) 22-250 Remington(6) 300 Rem SA Ultra Mag(5) 7.65x53mm Argentine Mauser(5) 6mm Remington(5) 280 Remington(3) 6.5x52mm Carcano(1) 257 Roberts(1) 7.62x54R ---- Head Stamps Listed Below ------DEPRIMED & CLEANED--(211) 50 AE Hornady HS(3) 50 AE Starline HS(1) 50 AE Speer HS--DEPRIMED & CLEANED--(84) 303 British Herter's HS(35) 303 British Remington HS HS(30) 303 British PPU HS(16) 303 British S&B HS(12) 303 British Federal HS(1) 303 British WCC 81 HS--DEPRIMED & CLEANED--(103) 35 Remington Remington HS(32) 35 Remington Hornady HS(18) 35 Remington W-W Super HS(5) 35 Remington Federal HS--DEPRIMED & CLEANED--(33) 32 S&W Short CBC HS(16) 32 S&W Short Rem UMC HS(1) 32 S&W Short WRA HS--DEPRIMED & CLEANED--(184) 32 S&W Long PPU HS(32) 32 S&W Long Remington HS(3) 32 S&W Long W-W HS(1) 32 S&W Long WRA HS--DEPRIMED & CLEANED--(35) 300 WSM Nickel Plated Winchester HS(20) 300 WSM Federal HS(4) 300 WSM Nickel Plated Browning HS(1) 300 WSM Winchester HS--DEPRIMED & CLEANED--(7) 300 Win Mag Nickel Plated W-W Super HS(6) 300 Win Mag Remington HS(1) 300 Win Mag Federal HS(1) 300 Win Mag W-W Super HS(1) 300 Win Mag PMC HS--DEPRIMED & CLEANED--(82) 7mm MAG Remington HS(61) 7mm MAG W-W Super HS(17) 7mm MAG Federal HS(9) 7mm MAG Hornady HS(3) 7mm MAG Nosler HS(2) 7mm MAG Norma HS--FULL LENGTH SIZED & CLEANED--(603) 30-30 WIN Remington HS(491) 30-30 WIN Winchester HS(305) 30-30 WIN Federal HS(129) 30-30 WIN Hornady HS--FULL LENGTH SIZED & CLEANED--(139) 243 WIN Federal HS(131) 243 WIN Hornady HS(103) 243 WIN Winchester HS(49) 243 WIN Remington HS--FULL LENGTH SIZED & CLEANED--(330) 30-06 SPRG Remington HS(169) 30-06 SPRG Federal HS(129) 30-06 SPRG Winchester HS(86) 30-06 SPRG HXP HS(38) 30-06 SPRG PPU HS(30) 30-06 SPRG Lake City HS(29) 30-06 SPRG Nickel Plated Federal HS(26) 30-06 SPRG FC 30-M1 HS(16) 30-06 SPRG Nickel Plated Winchester HS(12) 30-06 SPRG Hornady HS"

I believe this is the 6"" model and from my understanding it is somewhat rare. At least from what google could dig up. It has a half inch of ported barrel extending past the front sight. Does this increase value? I do not know, maybe if you're specifically looking for it, it does. Comes with 2 mags, box and I'm sure I still have the manual. I'm mostly looking to trade but I guess I'd put the value on it somewhere around $300. Looking for an SKS but open to offers. Worse I can say is no thanks. I do not have any PPP's so no hand guns.

Description from Sig: 



The SIG SAUER® P220® defines accuracy – and reliability – in a .45ACP. But many SIG shooters have asked for a P220 with a longer slide, one that would compete head-to-head with other five inch barreled 45's. The result? The first P220 Match prototype went to our testing range where it shot an eight-round group measuring 0.64” at 20 yards. Our engineers after extensive review concluded that this was a good starting point.

The P220 Match Elite adds the most sought after features to the P220 Match - beavertail stainless frame, front strap checkering, adjustable target sights, SIG's innovative Short Reset Trigger (a DA/SA trigger system with a 60% reduction in trigger reset) and black anodize aluminum grips.

It's the 10.5 inch barrel version. I've only put 300 rounds through it. The previous owner was a family friend. They never fired it, so it only has the 300 down the tube. I put up a picture of some damage to the finish near the windage drum. I bought a cheap NC Star sighting tool and the hole wasn't big enough for the windage drum to move into. I thought the drum was just stiff from being new-ish. Me being an idiot, I gave the tool a couple extra whacks with a hammer and made it clamp even harder on the finish. That's what happened there. Besides that, the gun has always shot very reliably and is a fun gun to shoot. I'll include at least a steel mag and a tapco mag. If you have any questions or want a pic of anything else, just shoot me a message. Thanks!

Your Dispenser will take it from there, depositing your powder directly into the powder pan resting on the Scale. The Scale tells the Dispenser the actual charge weight as it's being dispensed using our infrared data port. The information from the Scale allows the dispenser to precisely meter the charges, trickling the last few tenths. In other words, each load is as accurate as it would be if you weighed each charge, trickling each one to the correct weight by hand. Scale can be used alone.

I purchased this Jeep stock in June of 2011. It is smogged and registered until May of next year; It currently has custom plates with a Yosemite background.

These past few weeks I had the catalytic converter and oxygen sensor replaced. Since I've owned it it has also gotten other newer parts, (battery, alternator, serpentine belt, etc). The issues: The headliner is coming down, it has an oil leak, and the windshield is cracked. There is also a small rust spot near the top of the windshield.

The sights? They adjust. That's what they do. They're very flexible. They can go up or down. That's options right there. The grips are in fantastic shape. Basically, you should buy this gun and be all giddy with glee. That's all I'm sayin'.

Teeter tottering on whether I want to even think about selling/trading this gun but I'd like to see what's out there for trade. Thinking about switching back to 7.62 all the way. I just added up all the mods this gun has and it's around $665 without even factoring in the gun itself, the conversion work or the barrel cutting and rethreading. I'd be interested in a Yugo M70AB2 underfolder(pref not century) with bulk ammo, or maybe a Maadi AKM with bulk ammo(must have Arabic script on RSB).  Also interested in Romanian md63/65 or md90 sidefolder. Possible other underfolders, or sidefolders. Maybe a high end 7.62 AK or multi gun trade.

It shoots between .5 to .75 MOA (that is 1/2"" to 3/4"" groups at 100 yards).  The rifle is built on a Howa 1500 heavy barreled action which is a push feed style bolt action. There is a sako style extractor as well as a three position safety. The barrel is a heavy contour with a muzzle diameter of .815"". The bottom of the action is flat providing a solid mounting area and there is a hinged floorplate with an internal magazine that holds 5 rounds. The metal finish is a semi-matte black color.  

The stock is a Bell & Carlson Medalist stock with a full aluminum bedding block. The barrels are free floated all the way to the action. The B&C Mk2 style stock is a tactical style stock that has a flat forend and a vertical pistol grip. The pistol grip is fairly large and fills the hand nicely.

It has a Harris Bipod.

Nothing wrong with the rifle at all.  It is fun to shoot.  I bought it with the idea to carry it in my Law Enforcement job, but our Department changed policy to only carrying AR type rifles, so I need to build an AR-10.

I will take trade for AR-10 type rifles."

It is silver in color, and has the fine duplex reticle. This scope has been used but is in near new condition with the exception of some extremely minor ring marks that my digital camera could not even capture.

This scope has been on a Browning rifle that has spent much of its time in the safe. It has always had lens covers on to protect the glass, and that is evident in the scratch free and perfect condition lenses.

This scope is and always will be under the Leupold Gold Ring warranty. The Vari-X series is considered by most to be Leupold's best line ever. They used quality materials in constructing these scopes and stand behind their products. With this you can feel safe knowing what you're getting.

The scope has the fine duplex reticle which is rare to come by and by far Leupold's best reticle. It is plenty big enough to zero in on an animal, and not so intrusive like the regular and heavy duplex reticle a that disturb the field of view. The scope has 3x to 10x magnification, which functions perfectly and doesn't move around like some of the cheaper scopes. The amount of light it is able to capture is amazing in low-light conditions.

The only reason I am selling the scope is because I am trading the rifle out for a collector piece that will not have a scope mounted on it. I shot the rifle with this scope last year, and it performed perfectly!

The scope will be shipped in a Leupold box, however, please note that the box is not for this exact scope. I was able to locate all the paperwork for this scope, but have not been able to find the box, so I am just selling it with a box from one of my other Leupold's.

I stand behind everything I sell, and I can assure you that this scope will not disappoint. Please let me know if you have any questions in regard to any of the above. Thank you!"

History
----------------------
This is my private rifle. It has exactly 54 rounds through it. No less, no more. I enjoy this rifle greatly however due to the new NY SAFE ACT laws, it prohibits me to keep it because of the pistol grip.

This is a rock solid rifle and I am unable to change out the pistol grip for a sportier ranch type - there is no aftermarket stock for this customized gun.

It's a magnificent design that was created from the ground up for it's tactical purpose. My loss, your gain! It is virtually new. I only shot 1 box of 50 bullets and 4 of another box totaling only 54 rounds. I am including the remaining ammo that I original purchased for it."

I have an immaculate condition Keltec Sub2000 in 40 cal which I ordered this year before I found out we are pregnant. I've used it maybe 4 or 5 times, maybe a total of 200 rounds put through it. The weapon works flawlessly, has never been serviced. I ordered the sub2000 along with all the red lion precision gear at the same time. Red Lion Precision upgrades were installed at a gun smith. This is a very hard to find item, difficult to order since supply is very limited. The red lion upgrades are very expensive, but worth it. Optics can be added, lights, grips, anything you need. I have a Yankee Hill Machine 1/2 inch riser (50.00 part) that is useful if you add a Bushnell TRS-25 red dot (80.00) which is a highly recommended sight for this rifle (with riser) to allow for perfect cowitness between the sights. I have the tacticool cheek guard accessory to protect against heat and I have an upgraded charging handle cover to make charging easier. I did not alter the internal part of rifle at all, everything inside is stock and untouched. The front sight from keltec (plastic part removed and in my possession) was taken off and the red lion front sight put in. The keltec plastic hand guards were removed and the red lion precision rotating guard was installed. Two red lion rails were purchased, one for top and one for bottom. Red lion muzzle compensator was installed and I have one backup. TandemKross hex screw upgrade set was installed on all rifle screws. Rubber magpul guards were installed around red lion part for aesthetic and grip. A folding foregrip is included and has a bipod attachment. Also pictured is a butt stock universal addon cushion. I have an official Glock extended mag 22 round to go with the 15 round stock magazine, official glock also. There is a hogue randall glock grip on rifle also. As said, I'm the original owner, gun purchased at Nagels Gun store, I have the box, manual, and my receipts. Shown with the gun is a glock 22 40 cal full size pistol with night sights and grip. Extended mag release and usa flag plug on the grip butt opening. 

If someone is willing to purchase the set, to have a great combo pistol and rifle with interchangeable mags, then I'd be willing to negotiate on the price for both as a pair. As I mentioned, I'm having a child and I'm interesting in acquiring money to help pay for the 4 or 5 thousand dollars it costs in medical for my wife and child.  I envy those on welfare/medicaid at the moment. 

I have many more pictures, I didn't realize only three are uploaded. I'd be happy to meet at public location to show rifle and all parts. Please take a look at all the parts on the keltec box. Everything is related to the sub2000 and included in purchase. Only the glock 22 pistol and glock pistol holster are not in the 800 dollar price. 

Please also look up Red Lion Precision, look up youtube videos on sub2000's with the upgrades. Look up tandemkross and tacticool. 

For those taking the pair I can even add an unopened 100 box round of ammo very cheaply."
