The COMPLETED upper with BCM bolt carrier group was purchased from BCM. I did not assemble this upper myself. The upper consists of a BCM forged upper, Midwest industries 12"" Super light weight keymod rail, BCM 16"" pencil profile barrel chambered in 5.56 w/ 1 in 7 twist rate with the standard A2 birdcage flash hider. The barrel has approximately 3500-4000 rounds through it and is still very accurate. At 100 yards on a bench with the aimpoint pro using 60gr amax projectiles, 23gr of H335 powder, we were averaging 2 inch to 4 inch groups. The rifle definitely performs better then we were capable of shooting with the red dot at 100 yards, though I never used any magnification on the rifle, so its true accuracy is not known to me. Based on my use of the rifle, with proper benching and magnification you could get 1inch groups with ease and even smaller gorups with practice. This rifle is amazingly light and a great above average entry level rifle for anyone looking to get into the AR 15 world or even for 3 gun competitions.

The lower receiver is a Spikes Tactical Pirate lower with a standard mil spec parts kit installed. It has a Magpul CTR stock and a BCM Mod 0 grip with rubberized bottom compartment for storage.

The aimpoint Pro is a 2moa dot and comes with the ratchet locking mount and is in perfect working condition. Has been running for approximately 6 months out of its 3 year battery life. The battery is cheap to replace with a 3 year lifespan.

The new G33 magnifier is shorter and lighter than the G23. It offers a new and improved mount providing faster transitioning from 3x to 1x, tool free azimuth adjustment, larger field of view and an adjustable diopter for improved, more precise focusing. This new G33 is an affordable magnified solution that will transition a fielded HWS into a lethal medium range optic. Superior light transmission and a large field of view helps this magnifier put the competition to shame. This rugged, streamlined optic offers split-second transitioning from CQB to medium range targeting.

This is the 3rd Generation of L3 EOTech magnifiers. It offers more eye relief with windage and elevation adjustments that can be manipulated by hand, without any tools. The new slap to side mount is incredibly durable and operates with the slap of your hand, knocking the mount to the side. The G33 also offers a locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal of both the optic and the mount. This magnifier aligns perfectly with standard height sights and comes with a 7mm riser to accommodate the 7mm raised sights.

G33 with new Quick Switch to Side (STS) mount is faster than ever, just push the magnifier to the side and it will lock securely in that position until you push it back into place for magnified viewing.

Custom built Montana Rifle Company model 1999 stainless action with a 24 inch MRC CM #2 .300 WSM chambered barrel.  Bought the barreled action after it was sent to Kevin of Weaver Rifles to have them put it all together.  They squared up the action and bolt faces, lapped in the lugs and adjusted the trigger to break at 2.5lbs.  High Tech Industries installed a High Tech synthetic stock with Marine Tex bedding, a one inch Pachmayr Decelerator pad and a Recoil Suppressor. Stock is setup for a Ching sling with three swivel studs.   Accurate Plating and Weaponry matte hard chrome the entire rifle.  Wild West Guns chambered the action once it was completed.  Does not include scope, sling or butt cuff.  Does include Leupold mounts and rings and all shipping charges.  The rifle has only been fired 40 times for a break-in of the barrel but never hunted with.  I have over $2500 in the rifle, but will sell for $2000.

It came with one magazine and I have purchased two additional 12 round magazines at $50 each.  I have all the original box and papers and I will throw in over 300 rounds of ammo.  160 rounds of premium personal defense and 175+ rounds of FMJ (Winchester and Federal).

Well, my loss is your gain.  I have a Kel-Tec P-32 for sale. . . .This is the ideal pocket pistol.  I just frankly don't carry it enough to justify keeping ammo for it, safe space, etc.  IMHO, these are about the best real pocket pistol solution.  Other guns are usually too big or too heavy to really hide, IME.

Basic Specs:
Length - 5.1""
Width - .75""
Height - 3.5""
Weight - 6.6 oz unloaded + 2.8 oz for loaded
Mag Capacity - 7+1
Finish - Parkerized
Condition - Look at the pics.  This gun has been carried some, but the finish has held up very well.  It has minimal finish wear.  No wear through spots.

Reliability - For me, this gun has always proven reliable.  I have never had a hiccup.

The price($220) is for the gun +1 magazine + 36 rounds of CCI Blazer ammo.  

I can add a Don Hume pocket holster($25), custom almost matching Rafter S Gunleather pocket mag holder($25), an extra factory(Mecgar) magazine($20) and 50 rounds of Win32 Auto FMJ($20) unless they are sold first.

We can do a package deal for $290.

Need to see an OH state issued ID.  You can cover the personal info.  I just need to see name, pic and OH.

It's brand new and has never been fired.  The GSG-552 SD was a clone of the H&K MP5 SD and after some legal action they were no longer able to manufacture these awesome weapons.  It's a suppressor shroud, not the real thing, and I'll just give my first impressions here:

First and foremost, this weapon does not feel cheap and plastic like a lot of tactical .22LRs do.  It's robust and heavy and gives the impression that it's one well built firearm.  Second, it's a step away from the AR15 style rifles, so while everyone and their brother has one, this will definitely stand out of a crowd.  I couldn't get it out of the store I found it without every single person at the counter inquiring about it.

It comes with the original factory box, 3 22rd mags, the multi-tool, all of the original literature/stickers/extra sights/etc, and a lock.  What I'm also going to do is toss in just over 1,500rds of .22LR ammunition of varying makes.  It's almost impossible to find .22LR now a days and what good is a rifle with no ammo, especially if it becomes a Christmas present!

I'm asking $700 and please, no low ball offers, this weapon is no longer being manufactured and is incredibly rare to find. I will require a bill of sale be made out, which I will provide, and a valid Florida driver's license. Also, I can only do a local pick up as I have two small children and I work quite a lot, but I'll work with the buyer as much as possible to make the deal go smoothly."

At the breech top there are light engraved initials ""JS"" likely the maker of the barrel.  it has a 9"" octagonal barrel, with a nice aged looking patina. Stock is beautifully tiger striped wood & the curled but end is finely shaped.  The ramrod has a threaded end for attaching a jag. 
It's perfect for hunting small game, as it has mounted sights, has a waterproof frizzen/pan so you can carry it around primed, a perfectly rifled bore, high quality lock, & a thick barrel ideal for ""magnum"" or heavy charges. Trigger pull is very smooth & easy, and the lock is strong. It feels very comfortable in the hand. Overall a very reliable flintlock weapon that should last centuries.
   I have not ever fired it or even put priming powder in the pan to test-burn it. when i bought it it was not indicated to be used so i assume it is new (although not 100% certain). 
aside from a tiny stain on the side of the barrel at the tang, condition is Like New

This is a great gun; lightweight, easy to clean, and accurate!

I have put half a brick of federal copper jacket ammo through it and cleaned and oiled it religiously.

Retail on the whole set up would run you about $350, brand new.

Ok so, as far as the magazines, they are illegal to sell and transfer in the State of MD so in accordance with the law... I can meet you over the border in Pennsylvania and sell you the magazines separately OR, subtract $40 from the price and I keep the magazines."

Imbel kit built on an Entreprise Arms Type III Metric receiver.  Rifle was parkerized when built so that finish on all the parts matches.  Headspace is excellent - close to minimum spec, so it has a lot of life left in it.  Only fired about 500 rounds since being built several years ago.  Built by a local builder, but the workmanship is top shelf.  Gun shoots under 2 MOA with current production Lake City XM80 ammo.  I hit a 6"" gong at 240 yards with it consistently using iron sights.  The only reason I am selling it is I am downsizing and decided to keep my FAL carbine rather than the full sized rifle.  Excellent finish with the only wear being where there are moving parts (safety, charging handle, etc).  The linty looking stuff in the pics is just that - lint from the cotton rag I used to oil the gun last time I had it out.  Excellent bore.  Excellent mechanics.  Nothing to not like on this one.  If you want excellent shooting FAL in your collection, this one is hard to beat.  Comes with two excellent military metric mags.  I have a number of them.  $850 FIRM for the gun for a face to face deal in Hickory, NC.  Will have it at the Morganton gun show this weekend.  A steal for this excellent rifle.  Not interested in lower offers.  Will consider trades.  If you have a trade offer, please email me with specifics of what you have and how you want to trade.  Thank you for looking!"

I do not know which owner of this rifle I am, since I bought it used about 10 years ago at the Burlington Pawn & Gun in Burlington, NC.

The can of 3F contains 11.4 ounces.  The can is in good shape and doesn't have rust damage to the paint or exposed metal except a few blackened tiny blackened spots on the bottom of the can.  This can is 71% full,  The price is $12.   If you need a little less than a pound to go hunting or to shoot some tin cans off the fence, this deal is for you.  

The can of 2F contains 15.7 ounces.  The can is in even better condition and doesn't have anything written in Sharpie on it.  The can is still shiny and would be practical for regular use, then the empty can could be used for decoration in the man cave.  This can is $17.

Both cans, in the process of having their contents weighed, were poured out as completely as practical.  There were no clumps, oddly colored particles and the grain size within each can was uniform (all of the 3F's were about the same size and all of the 2F's were about the same size). Neither can's contents smelled sour or ""off"".

The amounts quoted in the ad are the current contents of each can.  I initially removed 0.1 oz from each can in order to verify that the powder ignites properly. They were tested individually and both tests were successful.

Please drop me a note if you are ready to execute a deal.  I have as much desire to see another shooter enjoying this stuff as the lucky buyer will be to get it and get shooting.  I know this stuff was scarce a couple of years ago.  Why not buy these to shoot and keep a few of those sealed cans on the shelf?"

Edit | Favorite
 'Tactical' styled 597 varmit target rifle. Heavy barrel that I took to the gunsmith and had threaded about a year ago. Threading is 1/2x28 same any ar15 uses. Has thread protector on threads. Rifle is in great shape I just never seem to find the time to shoot it so time to pass it on to someone that will enjoy it. Comes with three 10 round magazines and two 30 round magazines. Has an ebay quad rail free float style handguard on it thats far from quality and is kind if wobbly really but it serves it 'tacticool' purpose of giving it that look I suppose. Has adjustable stock just like an ar15 as well. Rear grip as well as handguard threads on receiver and stock mount on rear of receiver are all same as ar15 as well. It really doesn't matter to me if it sells or not its just something I dont use and id like to turn it into something I will use. Price is $300 cash. No other forms of payment, NO trades. Face to face sale only. No shipping. Located south of versailles indiana. TO CONTACT ME PLEASE TEXT. T E X T. TEXT ME AT 812599six4one8. Will reply asap. Thanks."

Through the years the AR-7’s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.

Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5″ long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.
When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that’s coated with Teflon™ for complete protection against corrosion. It’s engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

The receiver is also coated with Teflon™ for superior weatherproofing and waterproof protection, even in harsh saltwater environments. The updated receiver is grooved, making it easy to top off with your favorite optics.

I have maybe 100 rounds through the gun.
Must be willing to meet face to face.
