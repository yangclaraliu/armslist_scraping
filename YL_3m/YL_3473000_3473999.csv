This has the full auto bolt so it would make an excellent surrogate if you have a registered full auto lower. These are hard to find and are only going to go up in value.

I have another conceal carry firearm and I want a Ruger Vaquero (I have my eye on a 45lc), so I'm reluctantly letting this go.  They're around $400 new, and this one has a new $35 extended mag (2 magazines), the original box, nylon carrier, manual and safety mag.  There's only 50 rounds through this, so it's not even broken in yet.  This one also has an awesome trigger pull at 5 pounds, and it breaks at half the distance as the original.  I need $350 for it, and unless you have a Vaquero or possible a Blackhawk or Redhawk, I probably won't be interested in a trade.  I do like Glocks, so hit me up if you have one for trade.  There's no ammo included in this sale.  

All state and federal laws apply, and buyer pays for his own background check and transfer fee, which is usually $20 total.  I live by Snoopy's in Frederick and there's a Gander Mountain off of 104th and Grant that do FFL private transfers."

Pistol is a clone/improvement over the Smith and wesson/Walther p99 9mm.

Pistol comes in factory with case with all factory accessories.

8) Padded, form fit case.
Pistol has a decocker on top of slide that works well and has a 2 stage trigger that removes the creep and slack of most striker fired pistols. The striker has a red rear face that protrudes from the slide to show it is cocked. This is one of the only true double action striker pistols i have found. The first stage of the trigger removes the slack. Once pulled to that point it catches on the second stage, the second stage has the typical slight creep but is a clean and predictable let off. Pistol recoils nicely and Has had no malfunctions being fed winchester white box and self defense ammo. 
Ive started playing cowboy on the weekends and am in need of boosting my six gun collection. will trade for cowboy action six gun. either cap and ball, a cap and ball converted to cartridge or single action 6. would truly love to trade for a Ruger old army or vaquero in 45lc/38spcl or an 1860 army converted to cartridge

414,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3473414,For Sale:  Lifted 2002 Z71 Avalanche,"Santa Clara, Eugene, Oregon","$ 10,500","Listed On: Sunday, September 7, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I came to the sad realization a short time ago that unless I want to start living in it; I can't afford to keep my truck AND go back to school as I plan to do. This means I'm forced to sell it; sad as it makes me. let me apologize in advance for the long ad, there's just a lot to know about the truck.

- 5.3 Liter LM7 engine, I'm a certified GM technician, I've seen these engines take some pretty serious abuse and come out begging for more

- Z71 off road suspension package

-Tow package

- M30 4 speed auto trans, with tow/haul mode

-Trailer brake module

- Power moon roof

-Fog lamps

- Automatic climate control with rear vents

-Power mirrors

- 4 inch lift kit

-G80 locking rear diff, previous owner had it rebuilt last year, I have invoice to prove it

- Brand new front wheel hub/bearings

- Electric 4 wheel drive selection, including automatic mode

- Power leather heated seats, with position memory for two drivers, this is seriously a luxury that you think of as silly until you have it and realize just how awesome it really is. 

-Kicker audio speakers, Sony MP3 loading stereo head, MP3 player goes inside and controlled through stereo head, previous owner had a sub-woofer in it but I didn't want it, all the cables are still there and ready to be hooked up. 

- CB/PA, needs antenna and speaker, previous owner installed, I never finished it, pretty neat though. 

-MB Chaos 5 wheels, 31"" Goodyear Duratrac tires with moderate tread life left, I planned on running them at least another winter. They are a little noisy, but that's what you get with off road tires.

- Spectre performance air intake kit

-Running boards

The avalanche also features a folding rear wall which opens to bed into the cab, makes for a great sleeper if you camp and don't feel like putting up a tent. Two locking compartments on either side of the bed make great storage for things you want with you but don't want to shuffle around constantly, and are large enough to accommodate a decent sized rifle, or fishing rods, or whatever you want to put in them. 

All that said; it's tough, and it's nice, but it's not perfect. The exhaust tips are pretty haggard, I planned on replacing them but never got to it. Has a few blemishes in the paint, no major dents. The rear bumper is a little cock-eyed on the right side, previous owner says someone backed into it... I think he lightly tapped a stump, who knows. The bed isn't totally water tight, leaks just a little on the rear corners, but it's a lot dryer than an open bed. The On-star doesn't work, GM decommissioned all analog onstar systems awhile back. You can buy a digital conversion kit for it, but they're kinda spendy. It has keyless entry locks and an alarm, but the last remote I had broke and I didn't bother to replace it. Water pump just developed a slow leak I've noticed. 

All in all it's a fantastic truck and I've had a lot of fun with it. If I thought there was any way I could cut my hours back and keep this truck I would. But I can't. Text or call Stan at REDACTED for an opportunity to take a look and to go for a test drive. Pretty firm on price, credit union holds the title so I have to be able to pay them off. However I may be able to give some credit to a trade of the right Japanese wheeler. Thanks for reading, I look forward to hearing from you."

447,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3473447,For Sale:  Hi-Point C9 w/ accessories,"NE Salem, Salem, Oregon",$ 160,"Listed On: Sunday, September 7, 2014",Handguns,Hi Point                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Like all Hi-Point products, the C9 is a semiautomatic single-stack, chambered for 9mm Luger and +P certified.  Previous owner bought it new and fired about a hundred rounds.  I never got the chance to fire this pistol myself.  Other than a little chamber-wear from its limited use, it's still in like-new condition.  The optional peephole sight has been installed, though the original rear sight (notch and two orange dots) is included if you'd prefer it, and can be installed with a the same small, flat-blade screwdriver you'd need to adjust the signts at all.  Personally, I'd stick with the peephole; at self-defense ranges, if any portion of your target, and any part of the forward sight's yellow stripe, are both within the circle, you're going to hit close enough.

One standard magazine (8 rounds) and one extended magazine (10 rounds) are included, cross-compatible with Hi-Point's .380ACP model.  Original case included, heavy-duty plastic, padding, and a (bought) keyed padlock that fits its holes.  Up to three holsters are also included.  One, really suited for a slightly smaller pistol, I bought from the FFL that handled the swap that got me this pistol in the first place, just because I needed it for a job the very next day (in Arizona, where being openly armed while helping a lady at the farmer's market had already prevented one robbery attempt).  The second holster, bought off of Hi-Point's website, fits much better and has a pouch for an extra magazine, fitting both standard and extended.  The third is only for concealed carry, as it looks like a black leather fanny-pack, and I'll only include that one if shown an up-to-date CCW permit by the buyer.

Sixty-odd rounds of reloaded 9mm FMJ will be included, enough to familiarize yourself with the pistol at the range, plus a few rounds of assorted hollow points, with enough name-brand +P's to fill either magazine and one in the chamber, but not both mags at once.  I generally carried it with the standard mag and 8+1 +P's, and ten FMJs in the extended in either the holster's ammo pouch or the fanny-pack's rear pocket.

Cash much preferred, as one of the things I'm selling this for is so I can get Oregon ID after my move, meaning check cashing is a bit problematic, at least 'til my freelance tech support business gets off the ground again."

Google Gun Review:
The Charter Arms Undercover is a gun whose owners come hungry for self-defense, and leave satisfied that their attacker ate lead. Whatever else you can—or cannot—say about this mid-priced revolver, it’s one accurate gun of a son.

 But a recent experience with the Charter Arms Target Mag Pug left me wondering if a reasonably competent shooter equipped with any of Charter’s products could hit the broadside of a barn. I’m pleased to report that the Undercover is one of the most accurate .38s I’ve ever fired. The collection of dots in the target’s center (at twenty feet) was so well-gathered that Adam at American Firearms School challenged me to repeat the feat using double action. Only I’d already punched the paper in double action mode.

It is cerakoted in Icon Grey. It will come with a geissele SSA, IWC charging handle, Argonauts ReInc handguard with extension. The barrel has been cut, reprofiled infront of the gas block, and an AAC brakeout was pinned on it for a total of 16"". 

It balances a LOT better than a stock ACR. This is truly one of my favorite guns, however, one has to go and this is the only rifle I own that is not an NFA item.

 It has maybe 3000 rounds through the gun. If you think this is a high round count, you do not need to buy this rifle. This is a rifle that is built to shoot and take abuse. The handguard is missing a little of the cerakote and the top of the handguard broke at one point but functionally it is completely fine. There is not a lot of scratches or anything on the rest of the rifle, it is in good shape. I do not shoot this one as much as I should due to this being my second ACR. 

I am looking to get 2300 for it. You couldn't buy one and build one like this for less than 2700 and that is only if you get a really good deal on the base gun. 

If you want, we can meet at a range and you can shoot it before you buy it.

Outstanding accuracy, this rifle will perform on the same level as an FAL or HK regardless of what you feed it (they don't call it a Precision Target Rifle for nothing).

This thing is the real deal with will shoot better than most are capable of, and with a stock that's directly in line with the barrel, recoil is surprisingly light for a 308.  Could be a great 3-gun competition rifle.

Only selling to thin out the collection, open to trade offers for quality AK pattern rifles (either 47 or 74), not wasr or Romanian.  Maybe willing to trade for high end handguns.

I've also got an IMI Desert Eagle 9mm for sale on here and would cut you a deal if you were interested in both.  Depending on what you've got and are looking to trade, cash can go either way.  Never hurts to ask, right?
