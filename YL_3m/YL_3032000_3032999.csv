You can still use the iron sights with it on there. Shoots very accurate and never have a failure to feed unless I load the clip full. I usually only stick 15 in and it does just fine.  I heard the 25 round cllips aren't the greatest for these. My buddies Mossberg usually fails to feed the last 2 round s in the clip for some reason.

 This rifle is extremely accurate. I have shot it out to 600 yards and it will slap steel all day at that range.(I have the videos on my phone to prove it) It functions as it should and is in excellent condition and kept clean. I don't know the exact round count, but it is under 500. I am mainly looking to trade because I didn't join the rifle range this year so I wont be doing any long range shooting. I want to trade for something I can get a little more use out of. I have plenty of the mk262 ammo that I would like to keep, but could go with it for the right deal. Prefer to keep together, but I could possibly separate upper/optics for the right deal as well."

Along with the HK45 Compact, the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance.

Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life. Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability and minimum 20,000 round service life of the famed USP45 series with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 models can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors.

Each HK45 comes standard with an extra backstrap; medium and small interchangeable backstraps ensure an optimal fit for most shooter’s hands and complement the ergonomic profile grip.

An improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted on the HK45 and is quickly accessible. The HK45 control lever has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

By using the modular approach to the internal components first pioneered by HK on the USP, the control lever function of the HK45 can be switched from the left to the right side of the pistol to accommodate left-handed shooters (additional parts required). Left and right mounted control levers provide safety and/or decocking functions as required and can be fitted to the pistol simply by changing parts. For true ambidextrous use, a control lever can also be mounted on both sides of the pistol if required.

Well-suited for personal defense use, the HK45 is available in, or can be converted to, a wide variety of variants that use different trigger firing modes, including double action/single action (DA/SA) and DAO (double action only). The DAO mode uses the unique Heckler & Koch LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) firing system for improved double action trigger pull."

Finally the bead was removed from this gun with intentions of replacing the sights. This has left a .5"" x 1"" area that needs to be blued. I plan on replacing the bead and re-blueing.

The Rossi Matched Pair has set the standard for 2-barrel guns. This combination long gun package is unequalled, having been recognized as the best 'youth-size' gun and a top notch 'full-size' backpack take-along. We start with one of our popular single shot rifles, then hand fit a shotgun barrel to create the Matched Pair. The result is a highly reliable rifle with adjustable sights and a button rifled barrel for enhanced accuracy, which quickly swaps barrels to become your favorite shotgun. This makes the Matched Pair the perfect gun for hunting or a fun day at the range. Available combinations are listed below. Change Barrels Faster Than You Can Change Your Mind To change barrels, make sure the firearm is unloaded. Loosen the front swivel and remove the forend and swivel. Open the action and insert the barrel, replace forend, tighten the swivel and you are done and ready to shoot. One screw, one minute, no tool, no kidding!

I dont have a sig, but knowing how hard these are to come by at a reasonable price, I picked them up.  The bluing was in rough shape so I used a scouring pad and cleaned them up.  I put a light coat of flat black paint on them to keep them from rusting.  As you will see in the pictures, there are some imperfections from the bluing, but other than cosmetic, they are in really good condition.  Followers do not appear to be worn at all (have NO rock at all, very level), the springs have good tension, and they dont appear to have ever been dropped/abused (really they dont appear to have ever been shot, if so, then only a round or two).  I'll sell 1 for $30 or both for $50 (+ shipping if your not close).

I'm going to post the pics showing the imperfections as best as I can.  If you are interested, let me know and I will get you more pictures.

***Please know your state laws.  I WILL NOT ship to states that have laws restricting ""high capacity"" magazines.***

The XL1500 features a handsome, checkered, hardwood stock. With its daunting 24 ft-lbs of muzzle energy, and shot velocities of up to 1500 fps*, small game – it’s game over.

I'm only interested in trading for a subcompact but I guess it doesn't hurt to offer other items of interest. I'm also willing to consider cash offers. I know that some guys ask a lot for these guns when in good shape, but I just want enough to buy a reasonably good quality subcompact 9mm. I'm pretty familiar with what's out there and have a few in mind that I prefer, so please don't offer poor quality stuff. If you don't think my gun is worth anything all you have to do is go on to the next listing. Text or call 269-229-zero-593 Thanks for looking."

available for civilian in a format exactly like what POST police
academies offer. This is great training for the serious Concealed Carry
individual that will prove invaluable to you if you are ever involved
in a shooting.

See below:

FMT Shooting Simulator – The VirTra 100LE Judgment Simulator

Few people who own firearms for personal protection have the skills and
decision making ability to deal appropriately with a threat under
real-life stress situations. Shooting
practice alone will not solve this problem. That is why law enforcement
and military special operations personnel all use shooting simulators
as a critical part of their training. 

FMT owns a state-of-the-art shooting simulator, and has made it
available for use by civilians. Our simulator is one of only three
such training tools available for use by civilians in the Western United
States, and it is the only one available to civilians in Idaho.

Our simulator is the closest thing you can get to honing your skills in
real life experiences. In a single 45-minute training session, our
instructors will coach you through several of the hundreds of scenarios
available, providing valuable guidance on how to improve your
performance and decision making under stress conditions.

If you currently have a concealed weapons permit, or are contemplating
getting a concealed weapons permit, or you keep a gun for home
protection, we highly recommend that you spend time practicing life and
death decision making on our simulator, while at the same time receiving
guidance from our highly qualified instructors.

When training in our simulator room, you will be given a Glock 22
training weapon. Our training weapons are designed to have a recoil
that is nearly identically to a .9mm hand gun. Each weapon is outfitted
with a laser tracking device so that both you and the instructor can
replay your scenarios and see where your shots landed.

Our simulator is not a video game. It is a high quality training tool.
The simulator screen is 14 feet wide and 10 feet tall, offering life
sized, HD quality simulations. The simulations are filmed using
professional actors with special effects that create heightened realism.
You will even have the option of wearing a device that provides a mild
electric shock to signal you when you have been shot by a simulated bad
guy.

Each scenario includes a number of branching options. These branching
options enable the instructor to control how each scenario will play
out. You will be the one who decides whether or not to use force, to
give verbal commands, or to use other options to mitigate the risk,
while your instructor controls whether the actors cooperate, fight,
shoot, or become verbally aggressive. Your own decision making skills
determine the outcome of each scenario, and the instructor de-briefs you
on each completed scenario, making recommendations on how to improve
your performance, your response time, you’re your decision making.

Keeping a gun for safety in the home, or carrying a concealed weapon can
be a huge liability unless you are trained in the decision making
processes that help ensure that you will use your weapon properly under
high stress situations. Being properly prepared means more than simply
owning a weapon and getting a permit.

It was written by Plutarch that King Leonidas of the Spartans replied ""Molon Labe"" in response to the Persian army's demand that the Spartans lay down their weapons at the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C.

Solid aluminum trigger. Slide stop is serrated on bottom, which matches serrations on top of slide stop. Ed Brown's famous high-rise beavertail grip safety with memory grooves.

Very old turn of the century weapon.

Shotguns of that era used a 2 9/16ths "" shot shell.
So a qualified gunsmith should be consulted to determine if modern ammunition can be used.

What I was able to research  was that  all NEWPORT shotguns were made by either Crescent Fire Arm Company, Iver Johnson's Arms & Cycle Works, W. H. Davenport Arms Company or Stevens Arms & Tool Co. Again according to my research. the Model CN and Model WN were made by both Crescent and Iver Johnson.

I f found that Aguila makes a #7 1/2 shot 1.75"" 'mini' shell that will work for this gun.
http://www.midwayusa.com/Product/255579 ... -box-of-20

Shotgun is in good shape, no rust and appropriate patina for age.
Matching serials on forearm ( pic included )
Forearm a touch "" wobbly ""

Again, a qualified gunsmith should determine if this weapon is safe to fire and the weapon is being sold as is.

If nothing else, it would make a great wall hanger for an antique side by side enthusiast.

More pics upon request. I only seem to be able to load two pics on Armslist.
