It's a newer Waffen Werks/DDI AK74 in 5.45x39mm.

Waffen Werks had problems in 2013 but DDI bought them out and rebuilt most of their rifles on in-spec receivers.  They are still honoring past warranties and so far all DDI rebuilds have been pretty top notch. This one was rebuilt by DDI.  It passes the bullet test and seems to be put together very well.  Straight sights, decent wood, etc.

This rifle is built on a Bulgarian Circle 10 parts kit with a US made barrel, receiver, pistol grip and fire control group.  The polymer stock is US made and the upper black handguard is marked US made.

Available in traditional wood furniture or black polymer. Comes with 1 Tapco Black AK74 magazine.  I do have a Black Circle 21 also available for an additional $20.

**AMMO NOTICE**
This rifle did not perform well with Red Army Standard 69gr 5.45x39mm.  If you read online you can see others are having issues with the same ammo. I would stay away from RAS 69gr.  Performed flawlessly with Wolf 60gr 5.45x39mm.


*** LEGAL JUNK ***

The sale MUST take place in Lake County, Illinois. All Illinois residents must provide a copy of their FOID card and must be verified by Illinois State Police. All waiting periods apply. No sales in banned areas. Buyer is responsible for following their own local municipal laws. Buyer must sign a form of firearm transfer provided by the Illinois State Police.

FN 5.7
Combined with the 5.7x28mm ammunition, the FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol is adapted to different types of close quarter defensive and training scenarios. Optimized to be used in any condition the operator may encounter.

Extremely low recoil results in quick and accurate firing.
High Capacity Magazine

The FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol can accept up to 20 rounds in the magazine.
Extremely Light and Ergonomic

The light weight of the slide and barrel, made possible by the 5.7mm calibre, and the reduced weight of the cartridge make the loaded weapon much lighter than traditional handguns.

Fully Safe

The FN Five-seveN® MK2 pistol features an ambidextrous manual safety that blocks the trigger mechanism and avoids any accidental firing."

There are three truths about these guns. One, Ruger put a hell of a trigger on them. Two, they built a heck of a gun. Three, they put a crappy finish on it. That's why this looks like it does, and is priced as such. I took a touchup pen to cover the wear keeping it in a Galco holster caused. It got to a point where I was mad and covered the whole thing with it in a fit of rage. It now sits in the safe as the purpose I bought it for (shot shells for snakes and carry piece while working in a machine shop) is being taken care of by something else. No rust. No gouges. No abuse. Just a crappy finish.

It has the LWRC Mark 1 ARM-R rail system and utilizes LWRC’s patented short-stroke gas-piston operating system. Brand new gas block system installed by LWRC customer service. Pairs with any AR15 lower. Approximately 750 rounds down range. VERY reliable and accurate. This model comes with a lifetime warranty. 

If you aren't familiar with 5.45, it is very similar to 223/5.56 and was manufactured by Russia to compete with the 5.56 NATO round. They are excellent to use as practice ammo since they only run $0.20-$0.25 per round. The 500 rounds I have now are steel core which are armor piercing (no longer imported) but regular soft core 5.45 is produced domestically within the same price range and readily available. 

Open to various trade offers to try something different. The upper retails for $1350, mags $50, and ammo value around $100 new (total of $1500) but willing to consider trades valued at over $1000. Let's negotiate! Located in Farmington but will travel for the right deal. Text me REDACTED."

Ballistic CQ reticles were developed for competitive shooters, law enforcement, and military applications. They’re fast and accurate, making them perfect for close-range tactical applications and the perfect configuration for the MTAC 1x-4x-24mm and 1.5x-6x-40mm models. The circular center provides ultra-fast engagement at close distances, while the smaller dots of the reticle provide trajectory compensation out to 600 yards for the popular 5.56 and 7.62 cartridges. Illumination reduces time for shooter to get on target in any lighting condition and dramatically increases accuracy when target is dark.

Also included is a brand new Kramer gunleather horsehide holster and double mag pouch. 

The Glock has a very low round count...approximately 600 rounds. It does show some holster wear on the slide, towards the muzzle.

The install package from L&M was approximately $800 (the Trijicon night sites were more than his standard BUIS package). A Glock, conservatively is about $450 and then the leather was over $200. I think a fair price would be $1,100 for everything.

It comes with two mags with footers, the original case, snap caps and the original factory target.

Barrel: A proprietary blend of cold hammer forged chrome-moly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system. The pencil profile style barrel is high pressure tested, magnetic particle inspected, phosphate coated, and is finished off with a Midwest Industries SS12G2 free-float rail, low profile gas block, and A2 flash hider.

 The Most detailed review of this particular model, trigger, PRICING, and range video (but in 9mm) is on you tube ""HK P30 Pistol Review"" by Sootch00 from May 2014. For those unfamiliar with its PRICING ""theARMORYchannel"" on you tube has a GREAT video review on its feel, quality, lightness, and history titled ""Hk P30 9mm Ergonomic Perfection!"" And a hilarious one ""HK UP CLOSE"" about the pricing in 2010 (a little lower). LIKE THE GLOCK, the .40 cal P30 is the same exact size as the 9mm P30 and is also more expensive. About the same size as the GLOCK 19/23*****THIS IS NOT THE USP MODEL THAT HAS NO RAIL FOR ATTACTHMENTS, this does!!"

Short Video of my brother shooting it: https://www.facebook.com/7.62x39fans or http://www.discountfiling.com/SS/ (One is bound to work)

The muzzle device accepts Chevy oil filters (not saying I would ever do it legal eagles) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29-qI9WnQco). Up top is a Primary Arms optic and I just installed a Magpul buttpad which gives a perfect feel.

I cut the barrel down to 16.25"" (OA 26.25"") with the brake permanently attached to the threaded and crowned barrel. I removed the strap lug and blended that smoothly also.

I finished it in Graphite Black Cerakote. I had it notched it to accept 30 rd mags but found them impossible to change so I have the 4 hard to find tanker mags that do the job, 2 of them have weak springs, they had a few hiccups when they got down to the last rounds and the other two did perfect. (Just found out 20 rd tapcos are available and cheap) The railed gas tube on it to hold the optic was loose but some AR rings made a perfect reliable seal and the factory one comes with it also that does not need the rings. 

The gun is a ton of fun to shoot and the trigger feels good. I tried to include everything I could think of but ask me anything you can think of.
I am a little leery parting with it but have more fun building stuff than anything."

I have a Walther PPS in excellent condition for sale.  It is 40 S&W and it has had zero malfunctions for the 250 or so rounds that I have shot through it.  It shoots beautifully.  It is a very thin gun so it conceals very easily.  It will come in the original box with the manual, factory fired brass, lock, and two magazines (6 and 7 round magazines).  I am looking for a quick sale so I have priced it pretty aggressively compared to what is out there on the market right now.  I check my email often so I will be pretty quick to respond.  If the ad is up I still have it."

This has the safety with no decocker so it's single-action only. What you see in the pics is what you'd be buying.

Hard to let go but my interest is shifting slowly but surely to another caliber. Had the gun since March, been nothing but reliable. I won't deceive by saying ""low round count"" to try squeezing more money out of you. Since March there have been many range sessions where I've put it through it's paces and I have not been disappointed in the least. There was even a two and a half month period where I didn't shoot it; left it in Vegas while I PCS'd here until I went back on leave and got it. The next time I shot the gun it did not miss a beat. I'd estimate 900-1000 rds through it: zero malfunctions! Great pistol...it's a CZ.

I realize money is tight for many people so as usual I'm willing to give a great deal, $375 firm. I'm the original owner, bought it for almost twice what I'm selling it for. My experience, if Glock is supposedly the standard for reliability this CZ has exceeded that (I had a Glock 19 that stove-piped about 7 times in a thousand rounds). My hope is that the next owner is someone in need of a good, reliable self/home defense gun. This is the one for you. 

I haven't even mentioned that this feels GREAT in the hand!

No shipping. If you're in the vicinity of either Pensacola or Fort Walton Beach I can drive to you but will not go any further. No trades. $375 firm. Email or text REDACTED. Thanks for looking.

Edit: Serious inquiries only. Not trying to be mean, just asking you to please do your research before contacting me. Had a gentleman think this was a full size comparable to a Glock 17 but it's actually a compact like the G19. 
I forgot to include them in the pics, will also add a pistol lock and an Uplula speed loader which I bought for $34. Does not alter the selling price, still $375.  Thanks."

These are made in the same ISO NATO certified facilities in Turkey that make the Canik TP9 and CZ75 clones as well as the Girsan 1911's, Tisas Zigana handguns, and many others.

It's a full framed polymer compact made by Tangfoglio and imported by EAA. It is one of the first polymer framed versions imported(according to the serial number). I would rate the cosmetic condition 7.5/10 and the performance/parts condition 9/10. It shows some age with the bluing fading a little and some scratches/markings on the slide, but functionability is perfect and it shoots where it aims. It has a 3.6"" barrel, 8-rd mag, weighs less than 30 oz unloaded, is very concealable, and has a great DA/SA pull despite the low retail price. The SA is better than any gun I've ever shot/owned(in my opinion), and that includes a couple sigs, an hk, and my FNH FNP-40. It is a lot of gun for the price and is able to accept 10-rd mags and 14-rd mags(I haven't personally tried the 14), so can still be a carry .45 with 10 or 14 round magazines.
