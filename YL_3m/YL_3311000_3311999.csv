Serial Number: 74900

What a fantastic Parker we have found here! A very nice condition Parker 10ga. on a #3 frame with 32"" fine damascus barrels with great bores, unaltered 2 7/8"" chambers choked IM/F, tight ribs with barrels that ring like ""church bells"", gorgeous DH engraving that is clear and sharp, retaining 60% factory case colors (fading), excellent screws, beautifully figured English grip stock with skeleton butt plate and high modern dimensions. Really a great waterfowler or turkey gun, or for that vintage side by side big bore shoot, this gun is ready to go. The butt stock has been professionally replaced, complete with the original blank stock shield, perfect wood to metal fit, Parker checkering including mullered border, with perfect layout for longevity of use. It could not have been done better. Forend is original to the gun and in excellent refinished condition, no cracks or repairs anywhere on the wood. Serial number 74900 was finished in 1892 (antique, no paper work) as a DH 10ga. hammerless, one of only 633 ever made, only 227 with 32"" barrels and likely only a few left in this kind of condition. The hinge pin and locking bolt have been replaced so the gun is like new on hinge and tight on breech face. Bores are bright, .779 bore diameter, choked constrictions of .029/.033, minimum barrel wall thickness of 30 thou right, 33 thou left, no dents, damascus restored to perfection, clear lettering on rib, no pits or dents anywhere. Action is in extraordinary factory original condition with lots of case color and really nice engraving, mechanically perfect. Stock measures 14 3/8"" LOP, 2"" DAH, 1 3/8"" DAC, neutral cast. Gun weighs 8lbs. 12.9 oz. and handles nicely balanced 3/4"" forward of the hinge pin. No stopping your swing with this gun! I see a lot of old Parkers, and this gun is an awesome collectible shooter that will continue to increase in value as you break it back in from its like new mechanical condition."

A gunsmith recently described it as in excellent condition. Comes with 2 mags and 3 boxes of .45 winmag ammo. 

This is a L.A.R. Grizzly Win Mag Mark I Semi-automatic Pistol chambered for the .45 Win Mag cartridge. The Grizzly Win Mag pistols were conceived, invented, designed, engineered, and developed in the 1980’s by the sole inventor, Perry Arnett, who licensed the patented technology to L.A.R. Manufacturing Inc. For a time they were the most powerful production semiautomatic handguns in the world. The pistols are an upsized version of the Colt M1911 design, and many parts are interchangeable. They were developed to fire the much more powerful .45 Winchester Magnum rounds instead of .45 ACP, with conversion kits available to fire other powerful pistol ammunition, such as 10mm Auto and .357 Magnum. 

This particular example features the matte-blued frame and slide and the 5-1/2” barrel. The front sight has a fluorescent orange marking with a white outline on the adjustable rear sight. Additionally, it is fitted with an ambidextrous safety and black, L.A.R. wrap-around, rubber grips. Finally, this listing includes 2 7-round magazines and 3 boxes of .45 winmag ammo.

This firearm is rated as being in excellent condition."

Les Baer makes some of the best hand assembled 1911 and tactical rifles on the market! A sniper can be confident that his scope isn't going to move once it's adjusted... even on repeated follow-up shots. with the MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail system integrated into the upper receiver, the upper and mounting system on this smoking new .308 become a rock solid one-piece unit. And, since the upper and the lower are already precision machined from 7075-T6-51 and hand fit so they fit like a single unit, the scope isn't going anywhere. Like Les Baer's .308 Ultimate Match and .308 Ultimate Sniper rifles, the Monolith SWAT model includes these features:

•No forward assist • LBC Carrier, Chromed • LBC Precision Bolt, Chromed • LBC Precision Extractor, Chromed • Geissele Two Stage Trigger Group • LBC Steel Gas Block With Picatinny Rail On Top • LBC Bench Rest 416R Stainless Steel 20"" Barrel with Precision Cut Rifling, 1 X 10 Twist • Magpul PRS™ Stock • Special Versa Pod And Adapter • LBC Custom Grip with Extra Material Under The Trigger Guard • Integral Trigger Guard Is Bowed On The Bottom To Allow Wearing Gloves • Two (2) Twenty Round Magpul Magazines • LBC Soft Rifle Case With Pouches • DuPont S Coating On Barrel

It doesn't matter what you put the red dot on, the round goes exactly in that spot. Top slide rail and this one has had the Smith factory  upgrade in case you were wondering.  Pass up that Buckmark II if you  want to have the quality of a Smith. I am asking $350 cash for the  package deal. Please don't call me unless you have $350 and Texas  ID. NO TRADES. NO SHIPPING.

The end of the 1890s and early 1900s saw great international military interest in semiautomatic weapons, particularly handguns. The famous Borchardt design and the Mauser C96 pistol are both examples of this interest at the turn of the century. The German Army expressed interest in a pistol-carbine for artillery use in 1907 and several designs were submitted, including the Borchardt, the C96 by Mauser and others but none were considered satisfactory. The next year, the German Army adopted the new semi-automatic design that was called the Pistole 08 or P08, which is the classic Luger design. The German War Ministry then decided to raise the issue of the pistol-carbine for artillery use again with a view towards creating a design based on the P08 design. Captain Adolf Fischer of the German Army led a team that worked with Deutsche Waffen-und Munitionsfabriken (DWM) to develop a Luger pistol-carbine for German Army artillery units.

The Luger had been around for several years prior to the German Army's adoption of the P08 and, in fact, long-barreled versions had been available in the South American market since 1900. The Imperial German Navy even beat the German Army to the punch with the adoption of their pistol-carbine, the Selbstladepistolen 04 in 1904. Captain Fischer was able to use these designs as a starting point in the development of a pistol-carbine for artillery use. Within a short period of time, Captain Fischer and his team from DWM settled on the standard Luger frame with an 8-inch barrel and an adjustable rear sight calibrated out to 800 meters with a shoulder stock and holster. These first Army qualification trial pistols were made by DWM between 1912 and 1913 and totaled only about 50 pistols. These early weapons had a prototype stock similar to the shoulder stock used on the C96, wherein the pistol itself could be stored. This stock was not retained for the final, accepted version. Ultimately, the design was finalized and the Kaiser himself, Wilhelm II, approved what became the Lange Pistole 08 on June 3, 1913. But because the new weapon was initially developed for Imperial German Artillery units, it has been commonly called the Artillery Luger ever since even though its more technical name is simply Long Pistol 08.

These guns were used by the STASI (East German Police). You can field strip them, clean and reassemble in less than 3 min. It was still in the box when I bought it approx. 20 years ago. It’s similar in appearance and basic to the German Walther PP. Blowback operated, double action pistol.

The info on this gun is below. Mine is 62 AO Version. A great collectible or carry gun from my collection.

The Ernst Thaelman factory in Suhl, Thueringen made what are considered by some to be the finest pre-fall-of-the-Berlin Wall Makarovs. The finish is nice, the fit and machining is of quality you'd expect from a German shop, and they shoot like a dream. Almost all that came into this country had already seen service, so their quality varies by how they were treated by the person who carried them. Nonetheless, most have more holster wear than bore wear. They occasionally still pop up at dealers and at gun shows, but not often.

This is the entire year of 1971 including the Bar Book and The Women of The World issue. All issues are complete with centerfolds and some still even have subscription cards. The only reason Im selling this is because the wife tells me I dont need them anymore. I tell her I just collected them and glanced at the old timey ads (I especially love the 70's tech ads ... ahh the good ol days) before putting them in storage, but she isnt buying it. I was born in '71 and had fun collecting Playboys from that year. I saw a 1973 Playboy collection go for $340 on eBay and it was missing the bar book. Im willing to let this go for reletively cheap just to make the wife happy... the sooner the better.

These units come complete with all production parts and accessories, tools and instructions and are packed in a non branded box.

With over 2 years of development and research using direct feedback from law enforcement,
military and civilian users we have created the absolute best 4 power magnifier available.
One of the main comments we heard was the fact there was not a quality 4 power magnifier
available with all the competitor brands only offering 3 power. Second was the ability to focus
the magnifier vs a fixed focus like the styles available on the market now. This along with the
new fixed and lock windage and elevation setting are combined to create this all new approach.

The Only High Quality True 4 Power Magnifier Available On The Market.
6061 Hard Anodized Housing With Matt Black Finish.
Swiss Optic Coated Lenses And Nitrogen Charging For Clear Picture Field.

The MRAD adapts to a variety of user needs without sacrificing performance. With unfailing accuracy, this bolt-action system continues to define a whole new class of long-range precision rifles. The MRAD rifle's user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun's modularity. The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. During transport the stock folds and locks onto the bolt handle maintaining the same rifle width whether folded or extended. Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle's length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button. From its quick-detach sling mounts to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color that blends into any environment - every detail of the MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle. The Atlas BT10-LW17 Bipod is constructed of T6061 Aluminum and is hard anodized.

This bipod mounts directly to any 1913 style Picatinny rail using the included ADM 170-S lever. This bipod features built in pan and cant up to 15° +/- preload. The legs are stainless steel and are notched for a positive lock on your desired length (5 positions) and have a knurled grip area. The feet are removable by pressing the pin and can be replaced with any of the other Atlas feet (not included). The Atlas BT10-LW17 Bipod is proudly Made in the USA! NP-R1 RETICLE 1 MOA elevation spacing and 2 MOA windage spacing are ideal for precision long range shooting, benchrest and all-around use. The fine reticle subtensions are effective for rangefinding objects of various sizes. NP-R1 reticles in Nightforce 5.5-22x50. Originally developed for the U.S. military’s extreme long range shooting and hard target interdiction, both 5.5-22 Nightforce NXS models provide a broad magnification range, four inches of eye relief and 100 MOA of elevation travel. These characteristics, combined with the extreme ruggedness and reliability of every Nightforce riflescope, make them ideal for even the largest calibers. The slim profile of the 5.5-22 x 50 NXS makes it easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems. Its superb resolution at high magnification opens an entirely new world of extended range shooting for the accomplished marksman; Nightforce shooters are now accurately reaching to 2000 yards and beyond."

639,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3311639,For Sale/Trade:  1922 d 'no mint mark' wheat penny,"Westminster, Colorado, United States",$ 600,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 23, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The 1922 ""plain"" or ""no d"" can be produced from four different die pairs. Die Pairs #1, #3 and #4 produce either 
a ""weak D"" or a ""No D"". Die Pair #2, which is the most desirable of the four die pairs, always produces a ""No D"". 

In 1922 only the Denver Mint was responsible for producing Lincoln Cents. Both Mints were busy producing 
millions of Silver Dollars. No nickels, dimes, quarters, or half dollars were produced in 1922. The creation of all 
four die pairs was the result of the Denver Mint running out of usable dies with thousands of cents needed to be 
struck to fill their quota. 

Die Pairs #1, #3 and #4 were the result of ""mint grease"", which is a combination of dirt, metal, and oil, filling the 
area of the mintmark. Mint grease would fill the mintmark gradually, resulting in different levels of ""weakness"". It 
is believed that the mint grease would fall out, then refill creating a cycle of normal D's, broken D's, weak D's, and 
no D's. When looking at circulated examples of 1922 D's, keep in mind that the mintmark could have simply be 
worn from use. Die Pairs #1, #3 and #4 have ""weak reverses"" because they were struck with worn reverse dies. 

Die Pair #2 is not believed to be the result of ""mint grease"". A pair of dies that were creating 1922 D's clashed 
together. The clash resulted in damage to both the obverse and reverse die. The reverse die was badly 
damaged, and replaced with a newer less worn die. The obverse die was reworked by a mint employee who 
erased all traces of the D mintmark while repairing and polishing the die. The result is a worn obverse die with no 
trace of a mintmark and a strong reverse die. 

All 1922 weak D or No D coins fall into one of 7 categories:
1. Die Pair #1 Weak D (Weak Reverse)
2. Die Pair #1 No D (Weak Reverse)
3. Die Pair #2 No D (Strong Reverse) also called 1922 Plain **************************
4. Die Pair #3 Weak D (Weak Reverse)
5. Die Pair #3 No D (Weak Reverse)
6. Die Pair #4 Weak D (Weak Reverse)
7. Die Pair #4 No D (Weak Reverse)

The MRAD adapts to a variety of user needs without sacrificing performance. With unfailing accuracy, this bolt-action system continues to define a whole new class of long-range precision rifles. The MRAD rifle's user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun's modularity. The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper"

New Gen4 Rough-Textured Frames 
Enlarged, reversible magazine releases 
Dual recoil spring assemblies 
Three backstraps included to customize fit 

Glock''s Gen4 series of semiautomatic pistols incorporate all the features and benefits Glock is famous for, along with upgrades to enhance performance and shootability. This series still boasts nearly indestructible polymer frames that are stronger than steel. Tenifer-coating on slides and barrels makes them as impervious to the elements as their predecessors. And Safe-Action-Pistol integrated safety features are still standard. Upgrades includes Rough-Textured Frames (RTF) to make them even easier to handle in extreme conditions. RTF improves Glock''s all-weather performance when shooting with or without gloves. Each Gen4 includes three differently sized backstraps, so shooters can adjust the grips for a custom fit. Magazine-release buttons are larger and reversible to make them easier to operate for both right- and left-handed shooters. Dual recoil spring assemblies increase durability and reduce recoil and muzzle flip

The MRAD adapts to a variety of user needs without sacrificing performance. With unfailing accuracy, this bolt-action system continues to define a whole new class of long-range precision rifles. The MRAD rifle's user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun's modularity. The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper"

You can still find em for 700-850 if you look. And while new ones are banned from import, the thousand  still here in the USA will still be here. And parts kits are still allowed to be brought in. Even as a parts kit you can still get one together for less than these douche bag opportunists. It's the same situation with .22 ammo. If a$$holes would stop buying it up to resell for profit, the store shelves would fill back up. I understand it's America, land of opportunity. But as a pro gun avid 2nd amendment supporter,I believe we should be sticking together as one. Especially with so many anti gunners out there working non stop to take that away from us. Instead of trying to profit off your fellow man, or woman, we should be working as a team. I'm not saying give it away for free but quit buying it all up just to make a buck off another. Leave it for people who want it to use. To use to teach the next generation the wonderful world of having guns and using them safely. *rant off*. Don't fall for the ""they're banned"" hype.

It comes with all original paperwork, box, back straps and magazines. The stock sights have been replaced with Trijicon HD night sights and the trigger bar has been replaced with a Ghost Rocket trigger connector that has been custom fitted by a smith to the G19. No modification to the actual pistol itself has been done.

The Ghost Rocket trigger is designed to reduce trigger over travel, and if it is simply dropped in, will not result in a reduction over trigger over travel, when firing. The custom fitting, to the Glock, makes it so at the break, the trigger stops traveling and increases accuracy, as most accuracy issues are with individuals and not with the firearm.

It comes with the original trigger connector as well.

Also with the G19 is a threaded barrel from Stromlake that has had 1 round through it, for function test. Included is a Galco IWB holster.

The only trade I'm interested in is a HK VP9.

Entire package for 700 USD. I have original receipt of purchase, to prove that I'm the original owner and I do have a valid WA CPL and Utah CPL.

Can do FTF sale or through your FFL of your choice. Prefer to sell to CPL holder.
