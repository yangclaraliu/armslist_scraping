Hi there. Made the decision to switch back to 9mm. Got rid of my Glock 23, and now I'm looking to get rid of the Glock 22 as well. I am looking to trade for a Glock 17 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com) 

Comes with everything in the original box. 5 mags (3 factory, 2 brand new extended 31 round), lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me.

The quality of pictures are severely reduced when uploaded to armslist so it can make some textures look strange (like on the extended mags.) If you'd like the full size pictures, I can email them to you."

Weighing in at just 7.3 pounds and only 20"" axle to axle, this bow is no doubt a game changer. It may be lighter and faster than its predecessor, the Ghost 400, but the 410 has maintained some of its most impressive features. Like the 400, the 410 features Barnett's proprietary Carbonlite Riser Technology (CRT), which shifts the balance point away from the riser and back to the shoulder of the shooter. Barnett's unique patent-protected, ultra-light, super-strong Carbonlite riser boasts an incredible 5-to-1 safety factor and provides the perfect balance of weight and speed.

The Helwan is the Egyptian copy of the Berretta M1951 Brigadier that was licensed to the Maadi arms factory in Egypt. The pistol is best described as a smaller, single stack version of the Berretta 92. This pistol has all the original Egyptian (Arabic) markings on the slide, above the trigger, as well as on the barrel. The barrel is also threaded.

This is the same pattern pistol as the Iraqi Tariq, so if you have set of bringback grips they would make this look pretty cool. I've only used the pistol for display with all our other trinkets from times when when my wife and I have been to the Middle East and aside from firing it once when I bought it, it's sat unused for several years. The only issue with this pistol is that the barrel lock block is a little snug, common for these pistols, so sometimes it takes ""man strength"" to rack the slide manually. The ammo is Egyptian surplus, with Arabic markings on the rounds and box labels, that I randomly acquired a few backs. All in all I think it's a neat little gun that helps to fill the niche left by us not being able to bring back weapons from Iraq/Afghanistan like people used to during Vietnam/WW2.

I have not fired this gun, I inherited it and I am selling it in the condition in which I received it. It comes apart fine, the hammer cocks back and releases when you pull the trigger, you can see the firing pin move forward when the hammer hits it, but the trigger seems to be lacking a return spring. I looked it up and the spring can be purchased for $2.90 at Numrich Gun parts (I will include the parts diagram and part number for the spring). It also has an ejector for the shell.

Add 6.25% tax if in IL.  Shipping to your FFL is an additional $20.00

Lone Wolf R&D LLC proudly introduces the WolfPack™ Series Replacement Frame.

If you had the ability to build your own custom Glock frame, this is what it would look like.

The TimberWolf is intended as a direct replacement for your 3rd generation Glock frame or use it as the foundation to build your own custom Glock pistol.  It incorporates all of the most desirable features custom builders offer including: a choice of 2 quick change grips, rounded trigger guard, extended beaver tail, round mag catch, improved checkering, higher grip angle and improved rail system.

Slap the slim grip on your new TimberWolf frame and you instantly have the smallest sculpted grip in the industry. No grip reduction can compete with this custom fit or feel. Many claim it is better than any double stack 1911 offered! Install the swelled grip and try to decide, is it an XD or a Sig. Either way, it takes less than a second to try them both.

This new, shooter friendly polymer replacement frame works with Gen3 Glock models: G/17, 17L, 22, 24, 31, 34, 35 and 37. The Timberwolf frame includes the basic parts unique to it: round mag catch and two grips. All remaining Gen3 Glock factory parts are standard ""fit and function"". Other than a ""Slim Frame Trigger housing is needed"" Parts # LWD-30275 or GLO-30275 for 9mm, LWD-28927 or GLO-28927. Drop them in, perform the basic safety function test and you are ready to go.


    Must ship to FFL

WARNING: Use of the improper locking block (any part other then GLO-1447) can result in frame damage and is not covered under warranty.

This handgun has been worked on by one of the best (if not the best) Sig armorer in the country. I sent the pistol to Gray Guns in Spray, OR back in June. They switched out the Sig adjustable combat rear sights for their custom fixed sights, disassembled and polished every surface of the pistol, conducted a full feed and reliability test, and upgraded the trigger to Gray Guns Precision Intermediate Trigger (P-SPIT). The Dark Elite comes stock with Sigs Short Reset Trigger (SRT) which reduces reset 
travel up to 60%. The trigger work Gray Guns performed reduced reset travel by 80% and further smoothed the DA trigger pull.  

Pistol comes with two (15) round magazines, Sig aluminum grips, the original box, original receipt, and all associated paperwork.

Must be willing to travel to Murfreesboro (or relatively close) and meet in a public venue. I have well over 1500.00 in this firearm, but the price is negotiable. Only trade I am interested in is a M11-A1.

Lone Wolf R&D LLC proudly introduces the WolfPack™ Series Replacement Frame.

If you had the ability to build your own custom Glock frame, this is what it would look like.

The TimberWolf is intended as a direct replacement for your 3rd generation Glock frame or use it as the foundation to build your own custom Glock pistol.  It incorporates all of the most desirable features custom builders offer including: a choice of 2 quick change grips, rounded trigger guard, extended beaver tail, round mag catch, improved checkering, higher grip angle and improved rail system.

Slap the slim grip on your new TimberWolf frame and you instantly have the smallest sculpted grip in the industry. No grip reduction can compete with this custom fit or feel. Many claim it is better than any double stack 1911 offered! Install the swelled grip and try to decide, is it an XD or a Sig. Either way, it takes less than a second to try them both.

This new, shooter friendly polymer replacement frame works with Gen3 Glock models: G/19,23,32,38. The Timberwolf frame includes the basic parts unique to it: round mag catch and two grips. All remaining Gen3 Glock factory parts are standard ""fit and function"". Drop them in, perform the basic safety function test and you are ready to go."

Its in better condition than the ones I see on Armslist that are listed for more than my price.  It is numbers matching on the bolt, receiver and stock.  It has flip up adjustable sights and shoots well.  Made in the Royal Ordnance Factory Fazakerley, Liverpool.  The guy I got it from a couple years ago was a collector and he said he had never shot it.  I test fired it maybe 10 shots to see that it worked then put it away.  

Before shooting I took it apart to verify that it was original and not a copy.  The No.5  had additional metal shaved away from the barrel, the underside, left, and right sides of the receiver when manufactured.  This additional milling is the gold standard of identification for a true No.5 carbine and not a fake and the milling was there so it checked good.  I then cleaned it out and the barrel was full of a green grease that smelled like real old web gear.  The rifling looks brand new and I'm curious that it may have never been shot when I got it.  I have one bandolier with rounds on stripper clips minus the few that I shot.  

I have a CCL and would like the purchaser to have a CCL to show they care legit to own this.  We will write up a bill of sale/transfer of rifle.  Don't offer me junk in trade or a low ball offer I don't need to sell it and it doesn't take a lot of room up in my safe.  I just don't use it so would rather have something I would use.

Anyone who has chatted with me knows I'm a fan of Bersas, easily one of the best-kept secrets in handguns. This is the .380CC model, a carry friendly version of the classic Bersa Thunder 380 pistol, and includes a very nice holster. Featuring low-profile sights, bobbed hammer, slimmer grips & a flat-bottom mag(will still accept the std pinky-extension mags), this blaster is even easier to tuck away than the original .380 Thunder.

NOTE: The bore is dark, but can see spiraling.  Be a perfect gun to shoot as it or rebarrel to 7.62x39 as this can be done with this gun.

I lowered the price from $450 to $275 to reflect the barrel condition.

This gun has not been fired since imported to Century Arms from the Czech Republic in the early 1990's.  It still has the Century Arms hang tag on it.

Also includes 75 rounds of 7.62x45 ammo on stripper clips.  The ammo alone is worth $75- $100.

The gun has a few areas where the black paint that Century painted these with is flaking off.  One could fix this or strip the paint off entirely and typically the wood has a nice character where I have seen this done.

FTF in Allendale at this time.  May ship in a few weeks, but shipping with be at least $50 as the ammo will need to be shipped separately.

Own a piece of Cold War history not fired since leaving the Czech Republic.

700,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3689700,For Sale:  FLIR Scout PS32 Thermal Night Vision Monocular,"Urbandale, Des Moines, Iowa","$ 2,499","Listed On: Sunday, November 9, 2014",Hunting,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm selling a FLIR Scout PS32 that I purchased last Christmas.  I have used it for a total of maybe 5 hours and it's in like-new condition, with the original box and all accessories.  If you're not familiar with thermal, it's almost magical in it's ability to see in complete darkness, and specifically to pick out the heat signatures of animals.  Check out the link below for a good overview.  I'm not looking to trade anything for this.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUDlaZ2U-Go

From the manufacturer:
The compact, lightweight FLIR Scout PS32 provides clear, crisp thermal imagery from dawn to dusk and through the dead of night. It fits easily and naturally into the palm of your hand and features simplified operation making it an ideal choice for sportsmen, hikers, ranchers, rangers, or backyard nature enthusiasts. If you can’t bear to miss a thing while exploring the great outdoors, the Scout PS32 thermal imager is a great entry-level device.

Like all FLIR thermal imagers, the Scout PS32 creates images from heat, not light, giving you a tactical advantage out in the wild. You can navigate rough terrain to scope out the “perfect spot” at dusk, before dawn and even when it’s pitch black outside. You can discover nocturnal animals, find wandering members of your party, locate lost livestock or spot downed game. You can use Scout to help see through light fog, smoke or trail dust and even use it to help insulate your home, check out things that go bump in the night, and much more.

The FLIR Scout PS32 has been long-awaited. Its compact form factor fits in the palm of your hand and its price tag makes it the most affordable thermal imager in its class. In fact, the PS32 costs less and performs better than its competition. The unit is easily carried and fits in most cargo pockets. The lightweight housing is easy to hold up for extended periods of time. Controls are laid out across the top of the unit (except for a focus knob on the side) and are easy to access in the dark. No menus to scroll through or confusing buttons. The PS32 is a no-frills device. It is a thermal imager only – no camera, no weapon mount, etc. This helps to keep the cost, size, and weight to a minimum. It uses an internal, rechargeable battery that charges via an included USB cable.

The performance of the PS32 is great for the price. Its 320×240 sensor allows detection of animals out to about 500 yards. Resolution is crisp and allows you to see definition in the gray scale. Also included is FLIR’s proprietary “Instalert” mode that shades moving objects in red. We were able to literally, plug and play with the PS32. The pictograms on the buttons are no-brainers and a quick look at them allowed us to get started. The housing is comfortable to hold and extremely lightweight.

The PS32 has all the same features as the PS24, but has an upgraded 320×240 sensor and an added 2x electronic zoom."

This gun has been looked at by two different gunsmiths who both agreed this gun is ready to get a deer this season. The bore is clean and smooth and the firing pin works. The butt stock cover plate is missing it was removed to allow a recoil pad to fit on. I found you can order a replacement online but i wanted to keep this as original as possible. Finish is stil very good for a gun over 100 years old. Price is $600 and i am only selling this to someone that lives in michigan, i am not looking to have to ship this and deal with an FFL transfer.

Stock Configuration & Condition: The one piece stock is WALNUT (not a laminate or picture of walnut ), with impressed checkering on the pistol grip and the forearm areas. The comb of the butt stock is Monte Carlo style and there is a Marlin hard black plastic butt plate with white spacer. The stock is fitted with sling swivels, sling is attached, and has the traditional Marlin ""Bullseye"". The LOP measures 13 ¾"" from the front of the trigger to the rear of the butt stock.

Assessment: This Marlin looks as if it may never have been fired, but since it was, I can not sell it as new. Purchased just after return from Vietnam and stored it very carefully in a humidity controlled display case in Michigan with other collectables. This rifle appears ""like new"". Chambered in .22 W.M.R. this rifle is an excellent gun for pests or small varmint control, particularly when out fitted with a scope.  This rifle will make a fine present for a young man learning to shoot with the best rifle he will ever own, or for a collection piece of Marlin Rifle history. You will be impressed with the condition of this 37 year old perfect rifle!! Send me your best offer, I will consider all reasonable offers."

I've had this rifle for about 10 years and it's been very well maintained, and has good tight action.  This one is JM stamped.  .35 is a great brush gun, and accurate out to 300+ yards.  .35 rem provides a great platform for deer with 150gr ammo, or can put down bear with 200gr no problem.  I've read that it's perfectly suitable for elk as well, though I've not been lucky enough to test that, I dont doubt it one bit.  The 35, if you're unfamiliar with it, is essentially a step up from the 30-30, which makes it a very versatile rifle.

I'm asking $550 OBO, for the rifle with scope rings only, make offer,  not really looking to trade,  but may depending.  Will consider selling the leupold scope for an additional $200.  I've got 20 or 25 rounds of 200gr that will come with the rifle.   CCL required or must fill out a bill of sale at time of purchase.

Has new Lee reloading die and comes with two full boxes factory ammo and I believe that I have close to two boxes once fired brass also have approximately 90 117gr sst bullets to load .For those who are unfamiliar with this caliber it is the ballistic twin of the 25-06, only difference is that one is on a standard long action and the other being a super short mag case.  The barrel length is 22"" long but has the shorter stock for easy lite weight carrying, which is perfect for a smaller framed person such as a woman or child. I would prefer to sell than trade but would consider trades as along as they are good bolt guns in 7-08, 308, possible 300win etc. Asking $600 for everything any questions feel free to contact me at REDACTED thank you"

$450 Sig P6- This Sig P6 was a West German police trade in. I had the finish on the slide restored, the barrel and lug polished, the springs replaced, sights replaced (dot and post.) and new grips installed. The hammer was also changed from the P6 style to the P225 style. This is a great piece, fits well in the hand, shoots well. I have a lot of similar 9mm pistols though so it's a little redundant. It's up for grabs as a result. 

$400 Kahr CM9- The Kahr is a great carry gun. It's got a hogue grip installed, and shoots extremely well. Never had an issue with it. I typically carry my Glock 19 and this one is again, redundant. 

Let me know if interested, you pay transfer fees. Not particularly interested in trades, need cash at this time, however I might be interested in a two for one or a trade where cash is added on your end.

Below is a link giving the specifics of this same rifle for sale (except the stock). The rifle is 100% factory installed, not a ""parts gun"". Daniel Defense is widely considered the premier MIL SPEC AR15/M4 platforms being made.

https://danieldefense.com/firearms/mid-length/daniel-defense-m4-carbine-v5.html

I purchased and added on to this rifle after doing many months of research on creating the ""perfect weapon system"" for any defensive/offensive situation in virtually any scenario that would come up. ONLY reason I am selling is because I am saving up for a another project, so my baby has to go...

As part of building this weapon system, I chose the:

-Daniel Defense M4 Carbine because it kept popping up in list after list of the ""best of the best"" because of its durability, attention to detail/quality, and adherence to Military Specifications/tolerances. Watch this video on YouTube and you'll see why the DDM4 is the best M4/AR15 on the market from a durability standpoint http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kX0nCEh5E

-Burris MTAC Ballistic CQ/LR (Close Quarter/Long Range) tactical optic because it offers both Close Quarters and Medium/Long Range capabilities in the same platform and the same time. Using ""true 1x"" it allows for both eyes open use (just like a red dot...AimPoint for example), and up to 4x magnification with built in 5.56 BDC reticles for effective engagements up to 600 yards. Just zero for 100 yards (which it already is) and your ready to go out to 600 yards using the built in BDC dots. It is extremely clear, has illuminated reticle (which work even if the battery dies), weather and shock proof, with a lifetime warranty. It is just like having both a Red Dot and a Tactical magnified scope in one, giving you the best of both worlds in one small, lightweight package.

-5.11 LED Tactical Lightweight High Output Weapons light because of it's superior performance inside of an extremely light frame. It is weather/shock proof with high, low, and strobe capabilities. Mounts perfect along side the foregrip for easy of use in any conditions.

-45 degree backup sight for obvious reasons; just in case something were to happen the MTAC optic this rifle can still be effective at close and medium/long ranges.

-Viking VTAC battle sling after much research in the best sling for all situations. Check out how awesome this sling is here: 
http://www.vikingtactics.com/product-p/vtac-mk2.htm

-Quick detach Harris bipod. Small and compact, but adjustable and sturdy. Can be added/removed to the M4 very quickly if the situation requires it. Quickly turns this M4 from a close quarters machine into a medium/long tactical precision weapon. 

Comes with everything listed above, plus:

Hard Carrying case, (4) 30 round mags, 90 rounds of ammo, scope lenses covers, and original boxes for most accessories.

I have well over $2500 invested in this barely used and meticulously cleaned piece of art. Asking $1900 for the entire package as listed, OBO. You will NOT regret taking this beauty home. Please be realistic with your offers or they will be ignored.

FTF only, no shipping. Must be 18 with an OHIO ID. CCW preferred (I'll show you mine as well). 

I have extra mags and ammo for purchase to buyer ONLY."

I am taking a hit here so please do not waste your time lowballing (please) only reasonable offers will be accepted/responded to. That being said I am just trying to get a fair price--- All things in this world are negotiable and cash is king! Mostly seeking cash but would entertain possible trade/partial trades as well, please send photos and specific offers. Willing to meet part way for the right deal/no shipping at this time.  
VERY HARD TO BEAT PACKAGE WITH OUT SPENDING 2,3,4 TIMES AS MUCH!!! As for the glass (EXPLORE) you may not be familiar but it was the third one I bought from them and think they're great. Honestly I have spent two or three times the cost on scopes that I was not impressed with like I am these... Read the reviews online or whatever, I support the small guy when I can and these are well worth it. 

Prefer not to separate at this time but open to offers if serious/reasonable.
