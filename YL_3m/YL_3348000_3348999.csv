This thing was babied. Almost no external wear and the internals have always been spotless. The bore was broken in and conditioned using Tubb's Bore Conditioning System.  Depending on the loads I used, I could get 1/2""-3/4"" groups at 100yds.

This rifle was $1200 brand new. So, I'm not one of these delusional gun owners that thinks their rifle appreciates in value as it gets used. I also don't need to sell or trade this thing, so don't insult me by offering garbage or lowball offers.

This rifle is in excellent condition. I am selling it to fund other projects but may consider trades listed. I removed the action from the plastic factory stock and installed it into a HS Precision Pro Series M24 Vertical Stock, installed Dynacomp muzzle device, and installed a EGW Heavy Duty scope base and had it bedded. This bolt gun shoots sub MOA all day. The 5R rifling increases accuracy and helps with cleaning and the Dynacomp tames the muzzle rise. Please feel free to make me an offer or to ask any questions.

Tactical chest rig, made from a USGI TAP and a USGI 3L Camelbak carrier. TAP has 8 magazine pouches, as well as three inner pouches for maps, wet wipes, etc. The TAP is brand new and never worn (goes on Ebay by itself for around $100.00). Camelbak carrier includes a 3L bladder. I'm including a pistol magazine panel, which holds 3 mags, a Gerber multi-tool, a 2-mag pouch, a large dump-pouch that converts to an admin/possibles pouch, and a 1-qt canteen/utility pouch. Most of the rig is Multicam or OD Green. You can adjust the rig for size. I can include a complete IFAK insert with all contents (QuiKlot, Combat Tourniquet, Israeli Dressing, Gauze, Tape, Nasal Pharyngeal Tube, Gloves, etc) for an additional charge.

AR-15 and Handgun Gear: Otis MOLLE cleaning kit, 100% new and unused. Has my name written on the cover, but that's it. I added a front/rear sight adjustment tool as well as a take-down pin tool to this kit. Next is a Wolf-hook single point sling, which mounts up to a kit like the one I'm selling above. It lets you carry your rifle at a single point, and is quick-detach. Sling is new and un-used. For handguns, I have an ACU double mag pouch, which fits MOLLE, ALICE, or normal belt loops. It'll hold single or double mags, and holds them with a plastic compression clip, so that you can leave the pouch covers open, for quick mag changes.

USGI poncho. Used but still completely serviceable.

Pair of knives. First is a Kukri. 12"" blade, 17"" OAL. Blade is filed and stoned to a rough but sharp edge. It's like a really sharp hatchet, ax, or machete; it'll cut, but you can chop with it without nicking the edge. Next is a Pakistani-made Bowie, which is similar to an M49, and was probably made in the 1960s. The blade is very sharp. It's 15"" OAL, with a 10"" blade. Tip of the blade is rounded off and sharpened. Not sure if that's how it was made, or if it was rounded off at some point for better field use. Both have sheaths, and Kukri has two small accessory blades. Both blades have a light coating of cold-blue, but you can remove it if you prefer shiny metal.

Finally, I've got a bunch of Paracord stuff: 400' spool of 550-cord (actual 550-Lb test parachute cord: not the hobby store crap). 325' is Foliage Green, 75' is OD Green. Included are 30 3/4"" Fastex-style strap clips, and 8 small carabiners.

Prices:
-Kit: $60.00 for all items, add $25.00 for IFAK insert w/ contents (will post image on request).
-Poncho: $25.00
-Knives: $25 for the Kurki, $15 for the Bowie, or $35 for the pair. 
-Otis cleaning kit with additions: $20.00
-Wolf-Hook sling: $10.00
-London Bridge pistol mag pouch: $10.00
-Paracord stuff: $30.00 for the lot

I'd do $125 for everything, and $150.00 for everything plus the mentioned IFAK.

Buyer pays shipping. I'll cut you a break on pricing if you buy multiple items. My location is Conyers, GA (30094), and method of payment is PayPal."

This is an incredibly nice upper. It is a 16"" BCM with a chrome lined bore and chamber, and a free floating VTAC Alpha Rail hand guard (FDE). It also has a BCM gunfighter muzzle brake/ flash hider.

Here is what the manufacturer has to say about it:
OVERVIEW:

When it’s time to reach out and crush a big bird, reach for the awesome speed, bone-crushing power and swift pointing characteristics of our Model 11-87™ Super Magnum. Offered in specialized waterfowl and turkey configurations, as well as in a standard black synthetic version with a 28"" Rem™ Choke barrel, these shotguns tame the biggest, baddest 3 1/2"", 12-gauge rounds with a soft-shooting action and our revolutionary new ultra-shock-dissipating SuperCell™ recoil pad. Along with world-renowned dependability, these shotguns are equipped with a wealth of specialized features for your game of choice.

The Model 11-87 Sportsman Super Magnum ShurShot™ Turkey is the cutting edge in comfort and precision shot placement. Our new ambidextrous ShurShot synthetic pistol-grip stock provides right- and left-handed shooters alike with a rock-steady hold and awesome maneuverability. Its design also aids in lessening felt recoil. When you combine this attribute with the world-leading recoil-suppressing capability of our SuperCell™ recoil pad, you have one soft-shooting machine. The quick-pointing 23"" barrel has fully adjustable TruGlo® fiber-optic sights for pinpoint shot placement. We’ve also included a Wingmaster HD™ Turkey extended Rem™ Choke that’ll help you flatten gobblers at the farthest reaches of shotgun range.

KEY FEATURES:

Ergonomically designed for superior handling
Constructed with solid steel receivers for strength and durability
Features smooth-operating actions that reduce wear and provide quick follow-up shots
Fully covered in Mossy Oak® ™
23"" Rem™ Choke barrel with an extended turkey super full choke tube and modified choke tube.
HiViz® interchangeable sight system

Wood retains no original finish but is solid and clean with no splits, cracks or chips but handling marks consistent with its age and use – especially around the sling swivel studs. The metal work retains a mix of original finish and plum brown patina with no pitting, dents or scars. The bore is bright and shiny with strong rifling. I rate the bore a good 8 out of 10. It has a barrel mounted sight and is an unaltered specimen except for having been equipped with sling studs. I have fired the rifle and it shoots and cycles fine. Includes one leather sling. I will consider any serious offer. Shipping cost will be $30 for UPS ground to continental US locations and includes a carry case for shipping purposes. Payment accepted by US Postal Service money order only and payment must be received before shipping. Proof of age and copy of FFL for transfer must accompany payment.

 I'm offering you a chance to come down and try out one of the biggest badass rifles made!!!
 with the Muzzle brake on this rifle it has the kick of a .243 hunting rifle, even a 7yr old could shoot this rifle!!!!
 I'm disabled and had to sell my Barrett because it beat me up to much, this rifle cost me double what the Barrett cost.
 So here is my offer....
 I'm willing to meet down here by my farm to take you out to shoot up to a 1000yrd shot
 will cost $125 per person for 3rds down range,
 will do a full mag of 10rds for $200 per person
 will do up to 5 people in a group, with minimum 2 shooters.
 also will consider kids from ages 10 up who have gone through gun safety....
 or for $50 per person I will do a about hr long safety class with them first before going out. to make sure they understand firearms and how Dangerous or Fun they can be if handled properly.
 it takes me over 2hrs to tear down the rifle and clean it, and hr to put it back together
 this doesn't include ware on rifle from shooting, this is over a $9k rifle set up
 so only will to see how this plays out if I keep doing it.......
 if you want, we can go to one of the only gun ranges that allows these rifles you will cover the range fee's, is located in Rochester. I live Southbend/Raymond Area
 but I live out in the country and we can legally shoot in the woods where we have a mountain as a back stop because of how far this rd will travel..
 we always take safety first!!!!
 not many people will offer you to come shoot a $9,000. rifle for kicks and bragging rights so this might not be up long will see how it plays out....
 *First and for most no one who can NOT own a firearm will be allowed to shot this rifle.
 THIS MEANS...
 NO Felony's OR PENDING....
 NO DV Cases OR PENDING....
 NO Restraining orders Against you! OR PENDING....
 and last if you have been declared with a Mental Illness...

 if you Carry a *CWP/CPL this is a plus and I won't have to have your name ran by the Sheriff's before going out to shoot.
 *Warning* if any of these apply to you understand it is against the law and 1 yr in jail for being around/shooting/owning firearms when you can't.....
 don't want anyone to get in trouble so warning you in advance not to write and try to shoot this rifle. because the Sheriffs will have your info and will deal with it, so best just not write...
 ok now that we got that out there...
 I will also do part trade part cash 1/2 & 1/2 for other firearms/rifles
 just ask most I can do is say no thank you...

 **minimum of 2 shooters to bring this big rifle out.**

It was shipped to have the conversion done the very month that Jim Clark, Sr. passed away. If you're familiar with Jim Clark's fame both as a National Bullseye Champion shooter as well as the first President of the American Pistolsmith's Guild, then you already know what the famous meltdown package is about. But if not, what follows is the complete work included in this package.

From the work order:
Adjust extractor tension		King Palm Swell GS		Accuracy package
Big bushing & reverse plug		Lower ejection port		Cocobolo smooth grips
Combat hammer				Meltdown dehorn		Hex head grip screws
Extra power mag spring		Rear sight-Clark		        Grip screw bushing
Front sight-long			        Throat & polish
Function Test wHP ammo		Trigger job
King extended thumb safety

Included is the original Colt box and all papers, tool, original Colt grips, etc. as well as all the paperwork from Clark Custom Guns (including the test target initialed by the pistolsmith and the list of ammunition used for the test.) I put this pistol in the safe and have never fired it since the conversion. I am old now and am simply never going to take this gun to the range. It's a beautifully understated piece, in my opinion, and I've never seen another with the deep matte blue this one has. And how to say this in the nicest possible way: I'll be using the funds from this sale to enhance my granddaughter's college account, so please don't waste my time and yours with lowball offers or trades. Thanks, but I'm not interested. If you're looking at Armslist from outside Colorado, yes, I will ship this gun from my dealer to yours for $30. If your in the Denver metro area, I will pay for the BGC fees at Gander Mountain in Thornton. I also have links to nine large photos (1024) or can send them to you vial email. Thanks for looking."
