It is a GUYOT which produced extremely ornate pistols, shotguns, and rifles for Europe's most wealthy.  

On the barrel you can read, ""acier"" which is the French word for steel. The second word partly visible is ""fondu"" which roughly translated means, ""well-blended.""  The phrase ACIER FONDU is found on many French and Belgian guns.

This GUYOT piece is a pin fire from the 1840’s to 1880’s.  GUYOT is not one specific maker. A number of fine shotguns and hand guns were sold under the name, it is rather a retailer in Paris France. The European version of a ""Trade Name."" It would be similar to purchasing a firearm from Tiffany’s or 5th Avenue in NYC.  The English, Belgium and Spanish and French all did the same in Europe. 

Pin fire means that each cartridge (round of ammunition) had its own firing pin, sticking up through the little slots at the back end of the cylinder.

This is the first time though I've seen an antique revolver marked on the grips. This leads me to believe it must ebony, a rare and exotic material for the time period.  The scroll work (engravings) are absolutely amazing.  This piece has engravings on every part of the metal include the folding trigger.  

I have search Armslist upside down and backwards and you will not find another GUYOT pistol like it listed."

This is the real Magpul and not one of those PTS clones.  Made in the USA!

Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Features 
• Polymer three-piece design with an interchangeable finger shelf that allows for a flat ""A1-style"" surface or an ""A2-style"" finger nub
• Mounts to MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny and NATO STANAG 4694 rails (min. of ~4"" recommended)
• All mounting hardware included.

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches and weighing just under a pound the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally the SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

This is the LT755 Tall version. I have an Aimpoint T-1 and for my eyes, I needed the short mount for the magnifier. Most people use the Tall version for other Aimpoints like the CompM4, and for most people's eyes, the Tall works great with the T-1/H-1.

Included is the original mounting hardware/wrenches that came with it.

I'll even throw in most of the famous Larue swag. (I'm keeping the Constitutions, but the Dillo Dust Rub, Beverage Entry Tool, and Bumper Stickers are all yours).

The fire control group on the other hand can be expensive, especially the original set's but no need to worry as the majority of the parts are hear except for a tension spring that is also not hard to find. The upper except for the barrel seems completely and doesn't show signs of any use. The lower on the other hand is in my opinion just to be used as scrap, it would make a good doener of a magwell and possibly some other piece but the welds are wrought and the guy went a little crazy with the grinder and was not at all precice with the folding of the cobra company flat receiver.

This is a Hungarian made AK47, originally designed for paratroopers and use in confined spaces.  Barrel is 12"" with is 4"" muzzle break, which is spot-wielded on to make it the legal 16"" total.  
This is a very cool and unique gun with a GREAT receiver.  Has had EXACTLY 40 rounds fired through it (all flawlessly).  
From Wikipedia:
""The AMD-65 has been exported to the West Bank and Gaza, as well as Afghanistan. An increasing number of western security forces, including contract employees of the former Blackwater Worldwide (now known as ""Academi"") who are serving in the latter two countries, use highly modified AMD-65s rather than conventional 5.56mm based rifles. The combination of a larger caliber and shorter size provides better punch during short range combat. The metal front handguard lends itself well to a relatively easy refit with multiple Picatinny rails, allowing use of red-dot optics, tactical lamps and other accessories. The wire buttstock rod can be reshaped to allow use of 75-round RPK drum magazines even with the stock folded, and the weapon's internal mechanism can be tuned with aftermarket recoil dampers for smoother behaviour in full-auto mode.""

I am looking for a single 6 (22 obviously) Would like to have the mag cylinder also but will purchase one without it for the right price. If there is someone just wanting to trade down I have a LNIB Heritage rough Rider with the 6"" barrel with both cylinders. The LR cylinder has been fired 12 times and the mag cylinder never fired. Its still in the wrap. It's a good little gun I just personally don't like the fixed sights on it. After looking on armslist today, seems everyone wants new price or MORE for their firearms. I also have ammo or other things I could trade.  May also consider an H&R 22 revolver. May trade a ruger super blackhawk 44 mag for the right single 6. To see the blackhawk  please click on my other listings. Just posted a pic of the 44 on this listing. Please look at other listings for possible trade combinations. Also looking for a 5.7 and a warthog. Can be reached at 615 476 two thousand. I will only do FTF deals. DO NOT CONTACT ME ABOUT SHIPPING ME ONE PLEASE."

I also got rid of the standard plastic trigger guard and went with a heavy duty steel one from DI Products. Same goes for the magazine well.

The scope is a Bushnell 3-9x40. I just re-mounted it on this rifle and it will probably need to be bore sighted again. 

Included are one five round mag and two ten round ones. All 3 mags are blued steel. 

As I said, this gun is fun to shoot and super accurate. 

I am still flexible on the price, but please be realistic. I don't want lowball offers.

Desert Eagle XIX 44mag is an amazing firearm, as long as you shoot 240gr brass loaded rounds. also NO cast loaded rounds, due to the polygonal rifling and the gas system can get lead fouling. FMJ or jacketed softpoints are fine. has around 50 rounds through.

Trades just offer, worst i can say is no. with that in mind be realistic on your trade. im very easy to deal with and will respond politely.
