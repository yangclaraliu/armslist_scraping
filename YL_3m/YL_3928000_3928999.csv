This gun is one of two I bought a few months ago. Shoots both 2 3/4"" and 3"". Have put <250 rds through it; just enough to set it perfectly and properly break it in. If you know anything about these, you know that the magazines usually need to be significantly filed to fit each well, and that ejection problems are a given until they are properly calibrated. All of which is a big pain and makes each new gun something of a project. This one was taken right from the factory and set up by a friend/ Kalashnikov expert from Russia. Result: the mags fit perfectly, and the shells go right where they should. It runs like a clock. 

Barrel is in great condition. Used gently, still looks great outside. Has some minor scratches from wear. This one is ready to use, right out of the box. Just add an optic and go have a blast. These are of varying quality; this is one of the good ones. Made by Izhmash in Mother Russia and upgraded properly here in the USA. Will shoot hydrashock, sabot; you name it. Set up for slug, as it should be.

Great deal on a preban gun; no more will be imported. Awesome looking, solid, and accurate weapon that was configured for reliability, rather than as a range toy. Every time I shoot this it gets a lot of interest.

This rifle has a 22"" barrel with 6 groove precision rifling and a recessed muzzle. It has a heat treated receiver and extra strong bolt lock up, and features a 3-position safety, and a bolt face wrapped in 3 layers of 4140 steel, a highly visible cocking indicator and a shrouded striker.

This rifle was only produced during 1996-1999. This one was produced in 1997. These rifles can be hard to find these days. Rumor has it production ceased because it infringed on patents for the Model 700. It borrows several features from several popular rifles. The bolt design was taken from the Remington Model 700, the wing style safety is from the Winchester Model 70, the ""dogleg"" bolt handle is from the Ruger Model 77, and the detachable mag on the floor plate is from the Browning A-Bolt."

The EB-X reticle has a fine crosshair with four heavy posts and three holdover subtension marks that provide secondary aiming points compatible with the ballistics of most moderate caliber hunting rifles. This refined model of the Grand Slam series includes features that offer improved handling and functionality compared to previous Grand Slam riflescope versions. As the flagship series of Weaver's riflescope line, the Grand Slam delivers fully multicoated optics and shockproof construction at a reasonable price.

Weaver's proprietary Micro-Trac windage and elevation adjustment system has been improved to deliver more consistent performance and precise 1/4 MOA aiming point correction. Two springs on each correction axis deliver enhanced durability, and improve the scope's ability to maintain zero even when used on heavy caliber firearms. Curved grooves on the scope's turret caps and ocular focus dial are designed to provide sleek aesthetics, as well as tactile feedback when wearing gloves.

This configuration of the Grand Slam series features a 4-16x magnification range that is well-suited for most shooting distances at the target range or on the hunt. For improved accuracy at the higher end of the magnification range, this riflescope includes a parallax adjustment knob for setting the target distance beyond a 40-yard (36m) range.

Complementing the durability and functionality of the 4-16x Grand Slam is a 44mm objective lens and fully multicoated optical path that transmit sufficient light to help a shooter acquire their target during the final hour of daylight. The argon-filled fogproof housing, single-piece aluminum tube, and 3"" long eye relief and make the Grand Slam a well-equipped riflescope for a wide range of shooting tasks.

To commemorate this historic event, Sig Sauer manufactured a very limited number of these U.S. Army ""Night Stalkers"" rifles. Sig Sauer is no longer taking orders on these 5.56 NATO's. The legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in this 160th SOAR (A) commemorative semiautomatic with the silhouette that takes you back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate. The Night Stalker Medicine features a Swiss-type folding stock. Sig Sauer shaved a pound off this model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor. This weapon is the best of the AK-47 and AR-15! The Night Stalker Medicine emblem is engraved on the receiver.  This is A Sig, not a DPMS, or Bushmaster! With a MSRP of $1,266.00 you're getting a deal! Asking $1,100 but all reasonable offers will be considered.

The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.

Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system. The 416’s pistol grip and buttstock are authentic in that they include storage compartments for small tools or batteries.

The .22 caliber HK 416 D145RS operates on a blowback system. The dust cover functions and the bolt holds open when the magazine empties. Its sights are on-rail and the rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation. Its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’. Take down for basic cleaning is simple—there are no loose parts. Just remove the rear receiver pin and pivot the upper receiver to open.

Does the gun come with box and all papers?   Yes
How many mags? FOUR extended mags, 15+1
Will you consider a trade?  NO
What is your best price?  The prices listed
When can I get the gun?  After all Illinois laws are followed for in-state transfer. 72 hours, etc.
What do you need from me to buy?  A copy of your FOID, so I can run the ISP check & prepare a bill of sale
How does the rail light work?  You have three options and can either flip the light on steadily or just hold it on with your finger (when you let go, it shuts off).  You have a choice of flashlight only, laser only or both on at the same time (I leave it with both coming on)."

up for sale is my lightly used EOTECH EXPS 3-4 + G33 magnifier package (latest generation). For those that need info on the HHS 1 package a simple google search will pull up all the details.

it comes with all of the factory included items + the two cases. 

I have it mounted on my HK MR762 and only has seen a few hundred rounds. It is still in pristine condition and i'll even throw in some of those expensive CR123A batteries! 

Amazon has it listed for 1059+ dollars; I will sell it for 950 OBO shipped to your door.

For those that are wondering why eotech made a 4 dot system, I believe its made for the DMR / SPR rifle systems as you can actually calculate what the value of each dot is for ANY rifle system (this is an advantage over the BDC reticles which always gets you ""in the ball park""). Why settle for a BDC reticle that is caliber, rifle and ammo specific when you can put this eotech on and off ANY rifle, ANY system and have the exact values of each dot? Hunters can value from this very much as semi auto hunting is gaining popularity, especially with a 308 caliber.

Late series rifles made during this time are thus called ""last ditch"" and feature somewhat crude construction compared to rifles made earlier. This makes it an interesting collectors piece. It is chambered in 7.7x58mm.

It still has its Chrysanthemum intact, which is somewhat rare and implies the rifle was captured in the field as opposed to being turned over at the end of the war. Most of these rifles had their 'mum ground off completely to preserve the Japanese emperors honor. It has plain iron sights with no anti-aircraft calipers like earlier rifles did. It does not have any of the typical Arisaka accessories such as the bayonet, monopod or dust cover. 

The serial number on the striker matches the one on the receiver, however there is no serial number at all on the bolt body, safety knob, or bayonet lug. This is typical of a last ditch Arisaka. Being a war souvenir captured in the field, it does not have any import marks. There is a bit of rust on the receiver and barrel, partly because the metal on last ditch rifles was not given as nice a finish, but it could easily be cleaned up. The striker mechanism is still in great condition and it seems to dry fire perfectly."

I purchased this rifle new back in November of 2012. The rifle has only seen Remington .308 match grade 168 grain ammo through it and is extremely accurate. Its been taken to the range twice and professionally cleaned after every range day. It is stored away in a climate controlled room in my gun safe and periodically cleaned and inspected twice a year.

Made by Charter Arms in Bridgeport Connecticut. It is the Explorer model, .chambered for .22LR. These have been used by the Air Force for survival situations. It comes with a Tasco scope, an 8 round magazine. They are designed to be taken apart to take up less space in a pack, they are very light weight, virtually no recoil. They are an ideal gun for a survival situation. There were several different makers of this gun and several models. Bore and rifling is in very good condition, but the outer parts of the gun do show some signs of wear. The stock on this model is adjustable and the scope has a clean view. It fires and chambers fine. Cash sale is 225. For extra I can throw in approximately 80-90 rounds of .22LR Winchester Wildcats. Lebanon Indiana area.

I also have three 10 round magazines for the Henry model AR7.  I believe these will work with this gun but have not had a chance to test them yet.  $10 each or 30 for all.
