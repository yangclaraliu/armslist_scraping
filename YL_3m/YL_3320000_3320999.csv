I've only put about 600 rounds through it, and I always field strip and clean all areas prone to corrosion promptly after a shooting session; the barrel still looks factory new. If you want a specific picture or info I will do my best to provide it. The gun will come with all the little accessories such as the cleaning supplies and the rod and oil bottle the factory provides and it's default 5rd magazine. I also have a bulgarian circle 10, polish ribbed steel, and a plum russian made magazine, all of which hold 30 rds. I'm asking $15 for the polish magazine, $30 for the bulgarian, and $35 for the Russian, or you can buy them all from me with the gun for $60 just so I can get rid of them.

My gun is priced competitively to other sources such as Gunbroker, due to the scarcity of these guns lately due to certain recent sanctions against Russian items.

I'm not looking for trades; cash is king. I do not have a cell phone. you can call me at REDACTED and ask for Jeremy, or you can leave an e-mail at REDACTED, which I check often and encourage. I would prefer you come to my house, which is conveniently only a block from the local police station, and we can coordinate a time to meet, or if it's somewhat close a mutual meeting place that doesn't seem sketchy. I will print up a bill of sale for convenience.

EDIT: Ok, I don't know what it is about gun owners/enthusiasts in general, but it is NOT OK to talk to me about politics over the phone. I don't give A SHIT about your political views, at all.

Comes with the optional velcro attachment that hides the imprint a little more.  You can remove the velcro for a smaller feel in your pocket.

Quoted from the mfg site:

When DeSantis designed the original Nemesis, they thought that it would remain the best pocket holster forever! Well, it just got even better! The Super Fly has outdone even the best! Super Fly's new exclusive sticky rubberized fabric is even more viscous than the Nemesis. They have also added a removable, reversible outer flap to even further disguise the firearm. This pocket holster will absolutely not move out of position in your pocket. The inside is made of slick pack cloth for a low friction draw and is reinforced with added polymer in the right places.  Back or front pocket design.  Available in black.

It's brand new just sits in the safe .. ANoveske chrome lined barrels are cold hammer forged and made with the material callouts and manufacturing process for the M249 Machine Gun barrel. The cold hammer forging process work hardens the steel around a rifled mandrel, which creates the lands and grooves. These barrels are chambered in 5.56mm NATO. The barrel is then chrome lined to the spec for a M249 Machine Gun barrel, which is about twice as thick as that of an M4 barrel. The end result is a rifle that can be run hard day after day. Having been part of many excellent training opportunities, I have seen how a barrel may experience serious trauma from high rates of fire and sustained high temperatures. For any high round count, high temp, heavy shooting, Noveske recommends their chrome lined barrel. Any questions can call or text REDACTED. The switchblock is designed for suppressor capabilities, just the turn of a switch and it's ready to go."

205,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3320205,For Sale/Trade:  7.62x54R 7N1 Sniper Ammo,"Topeka, Topeka, Kansas",$ 50,"Listed On: Tuesday, December 9, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"With the development of the Dragunov sniper rifle, the Russians felt the need for something more accurate than mass-produced machine gun ammo. Their answer was the 7n1 round. This ammunition is match grade and produced in extremely limited quantities for military use only. It is the most accurate ammunition available for your SSG-97/Dragunov rifle. Not only was the round designed for hair-splitting accuracy, but it was also developed with a steel core and a hollow spot in the nose of the bullet with a lead knocker behind it. This means that upon impact into a person, that knocker moves forward into the hollow spot, destabilizing the bullet and causing it to tumble into the target creating massive injury. Very deadly stuff. It comes packaged in bundles of 20 marked with the Russian word for 'sniper'. The packaging is removed before going into combat so that if captured you cannot be identified as a sniper, who is the most hated person on a battlefield. Scarce even in the Russian army (according to the account of a sniper in the Afghan war), this ammunition is not exported by Russia, and is not normally sold to civilians. This stuff is a must have for someone collecting the Dragunov or SSG-97 rifles, as it was created just for them, or shoot it to get the most accuracy out of your Dragunov. 

Selling 20rd bundles in original paper.  Yes, these rounds are expensive, if you can find them anywhere else for cheaper, go buy them.  I say this, because I know that there is no one out there selling these by the bundle."

These rifles, also known as a Romak-3, SSG-97, and PSL, are extremely accurate and reliable. The Dragunov design has been in use since the mid 60's, and is still the official design of Russia and other Com-bloc countries. This is the Romanian version, which improved on the Russian design as far as reliability goes. This is a great weapon for several reasons. First, it uses the same type of action that an AK-47 uses, which makes it drag-through-the-mud reliable. Second, it's semi-automatic, which means if you miss with the first shot, you have an immediate chance to make up for it. Third, it uses a very powerful 7.62x54R caliber bullet, which is a monster round. The large size of the round and the long barrel of the rifle combine to allow shooting out to 1000yds. A communist sniper issued a Dragunov rifle in the Afghan war stated that he felt confident hitting people out to 800 yds with one shot, and vehicles up to 1000 yds. These features make the perfect long-range weapon for any situation. Has had less than 50 rounds through it. Comes with six 10 round steel mags. You will not find another like this again.  Rifle comes with all documentation to verify it's non-import status.

 will do up to 5 people in a group, with minimum 2 shooters.
 also will consider kids from ages 10 up who have gone through gun safety....
 or for $50 per person I will do a about hr long safety class with them first before going out. to make sure they understand firearms and how Dangerous or Fun they can be if handled properly.
 it takes me over 2hrs to tear down the rifle and clean it, and hr to put it back together
 this doesn't include ware on rifle from shooting, this is over a $9k rifle set up
 so only will to see how this plays out if I keep doing it.......
 if you want, we can go to one of the only gun ranges that allows these rifles you will cover the range fee's, is located in Rochester. I live Southbend/Raymond Area
 but I live out in the country and we can legally shoot in the woods where we have a mountain as a back stop because of how far this rd will travel..
 we always take safety first!!!!
 not many people will offer you to come shoot a $9,000. rifle for kicks and bragging rights so this might not be up long will see how it plays out....
 *First and for most no one who can NOT own a firearm will be allowed to shot this rifle.
 THIS MEANS...
 NO Felony's OR PENDING....
 NO DV Cases OR PENDING....
 NO Restraining orders Against you! OR PENDING....
 and last if you have been declared with a Mental Illness...

 if you Carry a *CWP/CPL this is a plus and I won't have to have your name ran by the Sheriff's before going out to shoot.
 *Warning* if any of these apply to you understand it is against the law and 1 yr in jail for being around/shooting/owning firearms when you can't.....
 don't want anyone to get in trouble so warning you in advance not to write and try to shoot this rifle. because the Sheriffs will have your info and will deal with it, so best just not write...
 ok now that we got that out there...
 I will also do part trade part cash 1/2 & 1/2 for other firearms/rifles
 just ask most I can do is say no thank you...

 **minimum of 2 shooters to bring this big rifle out.**

 I also have AR/AK or a Siaga 12g 20rd barrel drum -we can talk about if that is one you want to try out...

 **also for anyone who comes to shoot the rifle I will give them a yellow tip .50BMG Russian Armor pricing rd to keep as a keepsake memory of shooting the rifle....***

The cliche of ""Ak's aren't accurate"" does not fit the bill with this one.  I have rang steel out to 400yds consistantly with natural open sights.  Rifle features a mil-spec Chrome lined barrel, Flat grey molly resin over parkerization. Upgraded Tapco G2 trigger, dehorned, tuned action, Fuller rear leaf site modification, as well as his accuracy and reliability mods.  This is not your average off the shelf Ak.  I will throw in 1 Magpul AKM mag, 2 Steel surplus mags, and 1000 rounds of hard to find brass cased Yugo M67.  Fuller builds rifles to fight with and this one is no different. I have yet to find a mag that will wobble or not run in this rifle.  Jim is the premier Ak builder in the country and current wait times for one of Rifle Dynamics (his company) production builds are 6 to 12 months and start at 2000$.  This was built by Jim in 2008, 2009 before he hired and trained employees.  He doesn't build them anymore, his employees do.  Price for all pictured is 2000$.  Rifle and mags only for 1500$."

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability
and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct
lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic
ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The best feature about this pistol is it's reliability.  I know every time I need it to go off and function, it does.  The 12 round mags are very much broke in and feed/function very well.  

The parts are all high quality aftermarket pieces.  The slide is a Springfield which is hard to find with Novak low mount sight cuts.  The barrel is made by Barsto and is the same make/model that the USMC used during the custom built MEU(SOC) years, accuracy is very good.  This pistol was built for function, reliability and accuracy in that order.  Cylinder and Slide provided the hammer, sear and disconnector.  The grip safety, ambi safety, magazines (2), trigger, frame are all made by Caspian for Foster Arms.

650,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3320650,For Sale/Trade:  45ACP VZ24 Mauser,"Corvallis, Corvallis / Albany, Oregon",$ 500,"Listed On: Monday, March 30, 2015",Rifles,no type,45 ACP                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"Here's one you won't see for sale very often: 

I am selling my project rifle for the past few months, a VZ24 converted to 45acp (using 1911 magazines) via a Rhineland Arms conversion kit. I've put a lot of time, effort, and money into this conversion. This rifle started life as a VZ24 with a scrubbed receiver and mismatching parts. I then bought a Rhineland Arms 45acp conversion kit with a military contour barrel intending to rebuild it as a ""Mini-Mauser"" of sorts. Most of the work was done professionally by Jeff at Rangemasters in Lebanon, but I have sunk a large amount of time into it as well. The rifle is accurate and has practically no kick, but there are some small issues:

-If you fully load your magazine, the very first round has a tendency to nosedive into the feed ramp, getting stuck. If you download your magazine by 1, you will not have any problems. The rifle used to only feed with 4 rounds in the magazine until Jeff basically built a new feed ramp into the rifle. Now it'll feed if you have 7 rounds loaded out of an 8 round magazine, which I count as a win. 

-To insert a new magazine, you have to press the magazine release. A different magazine button (1911, extended variety) might fix that issue, but it's not really a big enough deal that I felt the need to replace it. 

You also have to work the bolt quickly and smoothly for it to feed correctly, but that is something that the Rhineland Arms manual points as well. The bayonet lug is acraglassed into the stock, and is for decoration only - don't actually try to mount a bayonet on it. 

Most of the original metal parts have a worn blue finish on it. The new barrel was cold blued to try to match that pattern. It ended up being a bit darker than the other metal parts in areas, but should wear to be blend in a bit better.


It's a nice little rifle that shoots well. I just am not as interested in it as I used to be, so I am letting it go.  Comes with some assorted parts leftover from the Mauser. Asking for $500, which is less than what I have put into it for materials and gunsmithing fees. No lowballers, I am patient enough to wait for a fair deal."

Condition: The gun is in excellent condition (see the pics; you judge for yourself). Although it has some surface scratches overall good condition.

The FNH has given a old piece of technology more than just an interesting facelift. The FN TPS is a essentially a highly modified and updated Winchester 1300 pump shotgun. The modifications & updates have resulted in a very modern-looking 12 gauge pump-action shotgun that ""borrows"" various tactical features from the AR-15/M16. This FN Tactical Police Shotgun features a Back-Ported 18"" Barrel, the GLR16-S Super Recoil Reduction Multi-position Collapsible Buttstock, the M16 pistol grip, the M1913 picatinny rail, and iron sights (including the cut-down rear sight) that are utilized by all current ""A3"" type AR-15/M16's and M4's. Basically, FN has managed to design a pump shotgun with the same ergonomic and handling characteristics as the AR-15/M16. The TPS also features what FN calls an Internal Tactical Choke (ITC), which controls the spread of (lead or steel) buckshot loads. The TPS weighs 6.5 lbs empty, and has an ammunition capacity of 7 + 1. The FN Tactical Police Shotgun (TPS) is a well put together package. This weapon is extremely popular in both the law enforcement & civilian home defense market.  130 rds S&B, 2 Bandoliers, sling and scabbard included.

I ordered this a few weeks ago and in between ordering it and receiving it I decided I'd like to go a different direction.

It is truly brand new in box, has never been fired, carried, or even loaded. Comes with all the factory stuff, two magazines, backstraps, etc.   This is a new production M&P and has all of the recent productions updates, including the new style trigger bar and slide release, barrel, and performance center sear.

I'm wanting to trade it for a .45 caliber handgun of some sort, primarily interested in a Glock 30, XD45 compact, M&P45, or similar.  Unlike most I'm not really interested in 1911's.
Would also be interested in other .40 caliber handguns.  I prefer Springfield's when it comes to polymer guns, so I would be interested in an XDm in .40, or a Gen 4 glock 23 or 27.  
Would also be interested in an AK47 pattern rifle or VZ58/2008.
 May be willing to add some cash depending on what you have or what it comes with.

I have a browning bt-99 micro. Great for youth and women. The perfect choice due to weight of the gun to force smaller shooters to swing through shots and less kick!! The only difference in the micro and the standard bt-99 is the rear stock length. (Length of pull) info can be found on browning.com.  My son shot it for 1 year in 4h shooting sports and has upgraded.  It is like new with one mark on the rear stock. Uses invector plus chokes and has a recoil reducer in the stock.

Specifications[edit]
The Grizzly ""Big Boar"" is a breach loading, single shot bolt action rifle. It is chambered in .50 BMG (Browning Machine Gun) rounds. It has a barrel length of 36 inches. The Rifling twist is 1 turn in 15 inches. The weight of this weapon is 30.4 pounds without the tripod mount and scope. The overall length of this weapon is 45.5 inches. This weapon can be purchased from LAR chambered in either Match Grade or Field Grade Rounds.[4]

Films[edit]
The LAR Grizzly Big-Boar can be seen in the following movies:

Tremors 2: Aftershocks (1996): Used by Burt Gummer (played by Michael Gross) to take out a single shrieker, a concrete wall, wooden beams, several oil barrels, an outhouse, and their escape vehicle, in a single shot. He states in the movie that it uses a ""World War I Anti-Tank cartridge"".[5]
Tremors 3: Back to Perfection (2001): It is briefly seen several times until it meets its demise when Burt Gummer (played by Michael Gross) has to put an ammo can on his truck's gas pedal, propelling it off a cliff, so he and his friends can get away from a Graboid.
The Rock (1996): Seen briefly when Private McCoy's (played by Steve Harris) M60E3 runs out of ammo. He is knocked off the roof of the building he was on before he is able to use it. It has the muzzle break removed.
Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997): The LAR Grizzly Big-Boar is used as the tranqulizer guns.[6]
Legality[edit]
Owning a rifle that uses .50 BMG rounds is legal in some U.S. states, and some places allow the use of these weapons for hunting."

Specifications[edit]
The Grizzly ""Big Boar"" is a breach loading, single shot bolt action rifle. It is chambered in .50 BMG (Browning Machine Gun) rounds. It has a barrel length of 36 inches. The Rifling twist is 1 turn in 15 inches. The weight of this weapon is 30.4 pounds without the tripod mount and scope. The overall length of this weapon is 45.5 inches. This weapon can be purchased from LAR chambered in either Match Grade or Field Grade Rounds.[4]

Films[edit]
The LAR Grizzly Big-Boar can be seen in the following movies:

Tremors 2: Aftershocks (1996): Used by Burt Gummer (played by Michael Gross) to take out a single shrieker, a concrete wall, wooden beams, several oil barrels, an outhouse, and their escape vehicle, in a single shot. He states in the movie that it uses a ""World War I Anti-Tank cartridge"".[5]
Tremors 3: Back to Perfection (2001): It is briefly seen several times until it meets its demise when Burt Gummer (played by Michael Gross) has to put an ammo can on his truck's gas pedal, propelling it off a cliff, so he and his friends can get away from a Graboid.
The Rock (1996): Seen briefly when Private McCoy's (played by Steve Harris) M60E3 runs out of ammo. He is knocked off the roof of the building he was on before he is able to use it. It has the muzzle break removed.
Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997): The LAR Grizzly Big-Boar is used as the tranqulizer guns.[6]
Legality[edit]
Owning a rifle that uses .50 BMG rounds is legal in some U.S. states, and some places allow the use of these weapons for hunting."
