I bought them last spring thinking that I was going to have an issue finding rifle powder but never got around to using them. They are different than what I normally use.

Neither of them have ever been opened and they have both been stored in my house out of the sunlight in my reloading room.

$175 each. The 4320 still has the price tag of $169 on it but when you add the state tax, I am asking less than I paid for it.

I am about an hour s/w of Peoria or 45 minutes n/w of Springfield in central Illinois. Going to either city for a face-to-face is not an issue on the weekend or even perhaps on an evening.

I will NOT ship this."

The Lightning Rifle is an exact replica of the original Colt Lightning introduced in 1884. The Uberti model safely stands up to modern ammunition because it’s made with modern steel and today’s manufacturing techniques.

The Lightning Rifle is available in .45 Colt or .357 Magnum. It has luster-finished satin walnut stocks and color case-hardened receivers.

Known for its speed, the Lightning can still beat any Winchester. As Samuel Colt used to say, “Nothing is faster than Lightning.”

This gun has a couple hundred rounds through it and has been 100% perfect the entire time.  Think of this as the modern take on the AK-47, it just keeps going and going...

Has original Swiss style folding stock.

The following parts are on the gun:

Sig Diopter Sights (these Sig Iron Sights are a $225 add on and hard to find)

Aimpoint PRO red dot (zero set at 100 yards)

Magpul MS2 Sling

Magpul Rail Sling Mount

2 Bulgarian smooth side magazines



Additional Parts available with Purchase:

Original Swiss Bayonet, (this is a very nice stand alone blade if you haven't seen them before)

Original Swiss Bayonet Lug (not included from the factory but needed for mounting the bayonet)

JP McClurick Style Comp, (will reduce recoil and muzzle rise to almost nothing while vaporizing your shooting buddies standing next to you!  New in package, not installed yet)



Includes Factory butt plate spacers (new, not installed.  Only used to lengthen LOP)

Includes Factory rails (new, not installed)





The factory 2 stage trigger has been tuned to lighten both first and second stage and over travel has been reduced to almost nothing, very, very crisp now...  This trigger feels almost as good as some match triggers and is a HUGE improvement over the stock setup.  

The gun has been setup correctly and everything functions exactly as it should and it is in like new condition.  You won't find a sweeter package out there...



I'm downsizing to help fund my boys dirtbike needs...  



I will sell without the Aimpoint and Bayonet for $1050 (so this would be gun, 2 mags, Sig Diopter Sights, sling, sling mount)

I will sell as pictured including Aimpoint and the new JP Comp for $1275





I will include a Magpul Vertical Grip if purchased at the asking price (if you want it and like that sort of configuration on your gun)"

The Leatherman MUT is the first multi-tool that functions as both a tactical and practical tool for military, LE, or civilian shooters. The MUT features multiple areas on the tool threaded for cleaning rods and brushes and all the screwdriver bits are sized for standard military and civilian sighting adjustment work. Also built into the design of the tool is the flexibility to replace the most commonly used parts on the spot, using a simple Torx #8, keeping down-time to a minimum. With all this, a MOLLE sheath and scope adjustment wrench included, the Leatherman MUT may very well be the most efficient and useful piece in your kit.

Here is more information about this gun. The P232 is a small and lightweight pistol. Chambered in .380ACP and featuring a fixed barrel blowback action, the P232 Two-Tone is one of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 19oz in the Two-Tone version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today. The P232 Two-Tone features a natural finished stainless steel slide, black hard coat anodized alloy frame and SIGLITE Night Sights."

Yukon's exclusive PULSE IR illuminator extends viewing range 2 to 3 times farther than standard IR illuminators and increases viewing ability on nights when no ambient light is available. The unique pulsating frequency of the PULSE IR prolongs battery life an incredible 30-50 hours using only 2 - AA Batteries while the infrared light will reflect off the pupils of your target up to 75 yards away, making it easier to spot game at night. Perfect for low-light or no-light situations, when using the Tactical 2.5x50 by Yukon yours will not be a trivial pursuit.

The illuminated red-on-green reticle has an adjustable brightness control that can be dimmed for a clear view while scanning for your next opponent or lit for extra brightness when there is little or no ambient light available; be sure to put your game face on.

962,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3360962,For Sale:  Kimber Ultra Crimson Carry II -- Brand New,"South, Springfield, Missouri","$ 1,100","Listed On: Thursday, August 7, 2014",Handguns,Kimber                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is a very NICE firearm!  Gun Safe Princess so to speak.  Never Fired.

The Kimber Ultra Crimson Carry II is a 3"" barrel .45ACP 1911 paired with a full- size frame and includes Crimson Carry red dot laser Rosewood Grips. Kimber workmanship and construction quality are easy to see, even down to the smallest detail. The melded forged steel slide and lightweight alloy frame fit together with tight tolerances and function perfectly. Recoil on the Kimber Custom Ultra Carry II feels significantly less than that of competing designs. This is due in part to this pistol’s lower center of gravity, which is slightly below the slide, and very close to where the shooter's hand grips the gun. Although the single-stack magazine puts the Kimber's capacity at only eight rounds, the relatively small diameter of the 1911's frame still allow the shooter to create a secure two-handed grip. 

The Kimber Pro Crimson Carry II includes a lightweight aluminum alloy frame to reduce weight for concealed carry. Crimson Trace laser Rosewood Grips provide instant squeeze activation and deliver a decisive advantage in low light situations. A match grade barrel and bushing deliver tack driving accuracy. For added reliability, Kimber includes a full- length guide rod, as the shorter G.I. style guide rods have a tendency to bind or break over time. Snag-free, low profile front and rear iron sights sit on top of the slide and provide a consistent target presentation. The checkering on the mainspring housing, plus the texture of the laser grips feel secure.The knurled extended magazine release of the Kimber Pro Crimson Carry II is a huge improvement over releases seen on other pistols. Performing tactical reloads is quick, simple and efficient. 

The Kimber Pro Crimson Carry II single stage, match grade aluminum trigger is a joy to pull, especially over the mushy triggers seen on most double action pistols. The 4–5 lbs pull is steady and smooth, while the reset is short and crisp. This is a gun that fires naturally, even for beginner's that have “low and left” trigger slap tendencies. In fact, the Kimber Pro Crimson Carry II has one of the smoothest trigger pulls of any production 1911 on the market.. Other features includes an ambidextrous paddles. Finally, to further minimize felt recoil, the grip safety is a high-ride beavertail style designed to quickly establish a positive grip for maximum control under stress fire conditions.
