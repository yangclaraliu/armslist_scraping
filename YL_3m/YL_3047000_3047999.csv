I acquired this pistol in a trade here on Armslist.  The pistol has factory night sights, and includes the box with manual, lock, etc.  The Sig laser is included and attached with the caveat explained below.

The pistol includes two 6 round magazines and two 8 round extended magazines.  As you can see on the target photo, which was shot at 10 yards, the pistol is very accurate.  The trigger pull is long but smooth and I had no trouble keeping a steady point of aim through the trigger squeeze.  I was very pleased with the accuracy.

I am selling the pistol for one reason.  The grip of this pistol is a bit longer front to back than most other pistols.  For some reason the grip of this pistol is just not at all comfortable for me.  It's solidly constructed, accurate, the night sights glow brightly, and it has functioned flawlessly when I've shot it.  It just doesn't feel good in my hand and I fidget with my grip...it's not for me.

Now to the laser.  The laser works well, it's bright, and turns on and off easily.  During my range sessions I noticed that the laser turns off after each round is fired.  I later checked my grip and I found that the thumb of my off hand is on the switch on the left side of the pistol.  The recoil could be turning the laser off, knocking my thumb against the switch, but I haven't had a chance to go out and shoot it one handed since making the discovery of my grip.  The buyer should be aware that you may have to return the laser to Sig for service.

I've also installed rubber Traction Grips and a Galloway Precision stainless steel guide rod.

A copy of your concealed carry permit will be required, as well as both of us signing a sales receipt.  I will ship the firearm from my FFL to yours if you wish."

All right fellow reloaders and handloaders I've rebarreled a few of my rifles so I'm selling off some reloading components and equipment to make room on my ever growing bench. With all these I’ve listed the current going for price on Midway USA online to show you how much you could end up saving as opposed to buying new…also if you can find the stuff i.e. not backorder.

12. 19 fully loaded 243 WIN ammo – 90 GR Berger HPBT (these have been NECK-SIZED so you will need to pull the bullets)

13. Box of Remington 180 gr Core-Lokt PSP 300 WIN MAG factory ammunition

14. Load Books USA Complete Reloading Manual for 243 Winchester ($7.29)

I can break up this package if you want (say if you only want the components and have no need for the dies but I’d like to sell all of them together if I can.

EVERYTHING YOU SEE = Buy now for only $300!!!
DIES ONLY = Buy now for only $175!!!
BULLETS & BRASS ONLY = Buy now for only $200!!!

The highest offer gets it otherwise use the buy it now option. If you want it shipped the buyer will pay for half of the shipping costs (it will be heavy and I will probably use Fed-Ex because of the ammunition).  Sorry no Paypal here I only accept a good old fashioned cashier’s check, cash, money order, or personal check (which I’ll hold until it clears).

There are certain risks associated with reloading and reloading components, so please be responsible before and after loading ammunition. By purchasing these components you accept this risk and recuse the seller of all liability if any harm or injury occurs to the buyer or any other person.  Thanks for looking and happy shooting!!!"

It has VERY strong rifling and a bore like a mirror. The gas system looks factory new, which is rare for 72 year old rifle that shot corrosive ammo during the war. The stock is a Naval/marine stock as it has a sling loop integrated into the buttstock much like a Mosin. The fact that it is a naval rifle may account for how good a shape the internals are. Naval infantry and the marines did fight the Germans on land, however it was to a much lesser extent than the Red Army itself. The serial number stamped into the stock matches that of the rifle. The stock is a deep Russian red, as it was during the war. The wood does show signs of its age with various scratches attained over time, but such is to be expected of a surplus rifle. There are NO cracks what so ever. The metal pieces are in great shape with its finish still intact with hardly any wear. The bolt is a plum color due to the cleaning solvents the Russians used, but this is common and does not affect the function. The muzzle brake is that of the Early period, as it has several line ports rather than two big ports like that on the AVT40. 

You will never find an SVT in this shape that isn't in a museum. In fact, you won't see any new ones imported unless you're in Canada, as Clinton put an end to that in the 90s. The rifle does have some electric penciling of serial numbers in spots as the Russians tended to force match these after the war. If it was not, I would be asking much more. The one that isn't is the one I'm keeping! 


You can have a piece of history, and the honor to say you own a rifle that is extremely rare, and sought after.

As far as price goes, if I get what I ask, I will be willing to travel, any lower and I'm not leaving Columbus.  It is more than a fair price, Gunbroker and other SVTs on Armslist will show you that. 

One mag included, maybe some ammo if the deal is right.  Must be legally able to own this, will ask for ID.

The lower is all original factory LMT, with a brand new fire control group that I just put back in it (I'm keeping the aftermarket trigger that was in it). It has seen very little use, however the grey dry-film lubricating coating on the receiver extension is coming of (it happens to all LMTs eventually), so it might just look better to remove it entirely at this point...

I've only fired 18 rounds of .38 through the gun & it shoots great in both double & single action.  The lock up is tight, timing is right on, and the trigger is just what you'd expect from a vintage Colt.  The finish is in excellent condition with only a few very small spots on the frame.  I'd say it's over 95%, and you don't see fit & finish like this on most of today's revolvers.  The wood is in excellent shape as well with only one real noticeable mark on the bottom.  I'd say the grips are at 90% +. You won't find a revolver over 30 yrs old in this nice of shape very often.

If you're thinking about buying a new 357 you owe it to yourself to check out one of these vintage Colts. There's a reason people say, ""They don't make em like this any more""; and it's the same reason this generation of Colt wheel guns continue to go up in value year after year.

Size matters in a concealed carry pistol. Reduced dimensions and light weight are as important as magazine capacity and power. Kimber Ultra Carry pistols have it all, and put it together in a 1911 package that simply outperforms any other type of semi-automatic. A hallmark of Kimber quality, the Ultra Carry combines the tremendous advantages of the 1911 platform with the power of the .45 ACP cartridge.
Machined bevels at both front and rear of the Ultra Carry ejection port ensure ejecting brass reliably clears, avoiding the jams common to other brands.

This is a 3-screw (or ""Old Model,"" as they later came to be called) Ruger SA revolvers are based on the same simple design. They were, and still are, perhaps the best single action revolver ever designed. They are loaded with the hammer in the half-cock notch and properly carried with the hammer down on an empty chamber.

The typical 3-screw Blackhawk (so called because of the three screws in the side of the frame) was a blued steel revolver built on a flat top frame roughly the same size as a Colt SAA. The one piece Western-style grip frame is made of aluminum alloy, as is the ejector rod housing. It has two piece walnut grips. The hammer and trigger springs are coil springs, much easier to adjust and more durable than the flat springs used in the Colt SAA. The 3-screw Blackhawk is a simple action, and one that is easy on which to work.

Found this description on Brownells that best depicts the components.  “IDPA COMPETITION PAK Perfect For Practical Shooting Competition Or Daily Carry; IDPA Approved;   Convenient kit has the belt gear you need to get started in practical shooting competition, plus the versatility to serve for daily carry, too. The IDPA-approved, custom-fit belt holster is heat-molded to fit your gun model from strong, flexible Kydex® thermoplastic acrylic polyvinyl chloride sheet. With a tough outer surface highly resistant to abrasion, Kydex retains its shape in extreme environments, does not squeak, and is impervious to solvents and oils—perfect for a hard-working competition holster. Twin tension screws and rubber spacers let you set the right retention force to keep your gun securely holstered and still have smooth presentation. Adjustable Sting Ray belt attachment system pulls the gun closer to the body, aiding concealment and maintaining a consistent position for fast draw during competition. May be positioned in straight drop, grip forward (FBI cant), or muzzle forward positions. Install the injection-molded paddle attachment (screwdriver required) to convert to a compact, concealable configuration for daily carry. Wide, curved paddle conforms to body and has a lower profile for better concealment. Flared base adds stability and prevents unwanted rocking motion when worn with a belt. Allows the same three angles as belt mount configuration; fits belts between 1¼"" and 2¼"" wide. Tough, shock-resistant, injection molded polymer magazine pouch with adjustable belt loop holds two spare mags at the ready, in easy reach for fast reloads when fractions of a second count. Single screw adjusts friction fit to prevent magazines from rattling or falling out when running.”"

Shipping is $10.00, lower 48.

*Blizzard Survival Blanket.  Not the cheap Mylar thermal blankets; these retail at $30.00 new, and are great for a BoB or GHB.  They're similar in concept to a thermal blanket, but are multi-layered, and work very well.  Package shows wear from being carried in a backpack, but the bag is still in original packaging, and has never even been opened.
*Ballistic Goggles.  Identical to those issued to US forces in OIF/OEF.  Tan frames, and 2 sets of lenses (clear and dark).  They've been work extensively, and the lenses have some scratches, but you can still see through them fine, and they offer great protection.  You may have seen the ads for these awhile back; they stop a load of #8 shot from a 12-Gauge.  Not bad!
*2x 2-qt collapsible canteens.  Used, but in good shape.
*4x Chemical lights.  Orange and Red.
*Old-style goose-neck GI flashlight.  Works fine, has multi-colored lenses.  Handle is wrapped in duct tape, but not as a repair; just a good place to store some emergency tape!
*Padded kidney-pad from a Camelback Assault Pack.  ACU, with waist strap.  It's for your typical 3-day pack, but I've used my identical OD Green one on an Alice pack, and it'll work with a MOLLE ruck, as well; just use some paracord to lash it where you need it.
*Miscellaneous odds and ends; a couple sewing kits, some ""caution tape"" (very strong, and works great for lashing), GI Issue strap cutter, water purification packets, and other stuff)

Price is based on 1/4th the combined retail cost of a new pair of Ballistic goggles and the Blizzard Survival Blanket (goggles cost me $90 new, and the blanket is $30 new).  As mentioned several times, most items are used (or at least have been lugged around, so they show some wear).  Ask any questions you like BEFORE you buy.  Also, PLEASE DO NOT GO OFF OF THE PICTURE; the items in the picture are the same as those listed above, but I sold a couple items shown in the picture.  You will get ALL of the items listed in the description, as well as some extra stuff that I didn't list.

The receivers are Aero Precision, With a Daniel Defense Government Contour 14.5 with a Battle Comp 1.5 flash hider. It has a Midwest industries Gen 2 SS free float. The barrel and Bolt have been headspaced to match and has been rechambered to .223 wylde so it cycles 223 or 556 with precision. The upper receiver has been squared, blueprinted, and made concentric, as well as the bolt has been faced, and the barrel lug and barrel nut have been squared. I am a firearms manufacturer for Law enforcement and I own Decker Defense Company, You can check me out here on facebook to see some of my work. It has a custom trigger job, and the Breach of the upper receiver has been Microslicked, so drawing the action open feels like you're rubbing glass on glass. The barrel is a midlength gas system, with a Vltor gas system installed on that. It is a very very smooth cycling gas system. It also has the Midwest Iron backup sights that are around $190 value. The Aimpoint does not come with it because it belongs to the Police Department. It is a SWAT members gun that I specifically built for him, and now his position on swat will no longer involve entry, and involve a bolt gun. He needs to sell this to pay for the bolt gun I am going to build. Needless to say, he spent around $3100 to have this rifle built, and I put 36 hours of hand gunsmithing into it. It Fires 1/4 MOA, and that is a promise I will prove If needed. We are only asking $1700 OBO. It has cycled 398 rounds exactly. It is also cerakoted in ""Sniper Grey"" Call or text REDACTED"

Want to sell now to help fund some car projects.

It comes with the original box and trigger lock. I also got a belt holster for it, and an 8-round mag. I installed a rubbery grip overlay that really improves the feel.

I've put about 150-200 rounds through it. Cleaned and lubricated it well before shooting it at all, and again after every use. No problems with factory ammo. It doesn't like reloads, which I've heard is typical. Comes with a few dozen rounds, some are reloads and some are new.

I will sell in person to a Washington resident with ID, or have my local FFL dealer ship it to your FFL if you're out of state or live far away. The latter will cost $50 extra due to the transfer fee and shipping.

I have concealed pistol licenses for WA and OR, and would prefer that you have one for WA but a driver's license for ID is good enough. You can contact me by email, or text REDACTED. I'll consider trades for a lot of things, so let me know what you have if you want to trade. Mostly interested in other firearms, instruments, maybe car stuff."
