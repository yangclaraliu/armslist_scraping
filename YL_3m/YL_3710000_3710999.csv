See pics. The unit has been banged around, and the finish is worn. Functionality is fine though. I bought it and was going to refinish it but another project has came up, and I need to free up some cash. Therefore...would prefer to sell unless a REALLY good trade. I can't resist a good trade, what can I say. But I prefer to sell outright to get some needed cash. So asking $400. Gun is not easy to come by in this configuration at this price.

I have a 20rd box of Remington 7mm Express ammo 150gr. and also 130 rds. of loose bagged 280 Remington ammo that are all the same R-P Headstamp. 7MM Express and 280 are the ""same identical"" ammo. Remington changed the name of 280 to 7mm Express just for marketing. This is not cheap ammo but i have no use for it so i am letting it go for a fraction of what this ammo costs. I was thinking of getting a 280 at one time but no need for another caliber deer rifle. 40-cents per round. $60.00 takes all 150rds. No i cannot ship. Pick up in Commerce Township.

I have owned this perfect running bike now for 4 yrs. Purchased in Colorado. 3rd owner. 60k miles. Have all records and receipts.

Taken on Long Distance trips every year with never any failures or problems.

1985 BMW K100RT

Last Year Drove her across Canada. When I got home I decided to repaint her.
One thing led to another and I decided to do every upgrade possible plus some.
I rebuild the drive-shaft, adjusted the lifters, rebuilt all the brakes and added new stainless steel brake lines. Rebuilt the rear ""Worx"" Shock. Added heat reflective material everywhere needed.
Mailed out the injectors and had them cleaned. Painted the frame, started to work on body, then moved and lost interest. My kid takes up all my time now.

Brand new front tire with zero miles, rear tire has 400 miles, newly recovered and re-padded with gel inserts Corbin seat, new battery last year. Have two gas tanks, two sets of body panels, lights, everything. New kickstand and upgraded stater from K1100 bike.

Currently she is sitting as in first pic.

I have over $2000 in extra parts, replacement upgrades, and new upgrades.
- such as progressive shocks for the front, all new rubber for everything, new mounts and screws, new Bosch upgraded starter and wiring kit, larger windshield, etc, any possible upgrade and improvement that can ever be done is in two large containers in my garage. Have another large box or two of extra parts as well.

All parts taken off have been cleaned and labeled and put in bags so i could easily reinstall them.

I've personally got over $5500 in this bike.

My loss your gain for a little elbow grease putting her back together. If I had the time and the desire to ride again, I'd say maybe two weekends at best to get her to show condition.

Asking $2200 for everything. (price Lowered from $3500 11/9/14)
Price is Firm! Will not ever go lower, so please do not waste my time with any other cash offer.

 I also have a 2nd generation Glock 17 in 9mm. This pistol has some wear but it is a much older and harder to find pistol. It comes in the original ""tupperware"" case with two original magazines, cleaning brush and handle. It is in original configuration, no substitute parts and is a 2 pin Glock. The pistol has ALL matching serial #'s, on the barrel lug, slide and the grip. These generation 2 Glocks are getting harder and harder to find, especially with original equipment like this one. Asking $450 OBO.

 I would entertain a trade if you're interested in both pistols. I am mainly wanting to sell for another project. If interested in both I would discount the price on them. Interested in trading for Glocks in the RTF2 or compensated Glocks."

Finish is great, trigger feels good for a Mosin, comes with sling (leather; non original), an elastic cartridge caddy for the stock, and the original straight bolt.  This is everything I got when I got the rifle.  Other projects took over and it's taking up space.  However, it is a 91/59 so I am aware of it's rarity.  I want this gun to go to someone who is going to either restore it or shoot it.  If you're interested, I'll send you all the pictures you need."

*** update ***
I'm getting alot of questions about the aimpoint.  Yes, I have all the documentation and original box, but it is not included in the price nor the ad.  If you ask, I can give you a quote, but it will be high.  I always test my equipment before it becomes a defensive option, and this one has been mounted with 600+ rounds through 2 moderately demanding classes, so I'm confident i can depend my life on it.  If i sell this as a combo, I'll buy another and have to go through the same process before i trust it, and it'll be reflected in the price.  Aimpoint makes top quality products, however i don't trust anything without testing first.  You will probably be better off purchasing an aimpoint separately.  I suggest you buy an aimpoint, and take a demanding carbine class.  
1. you'll be trained and confident
2. you'll work out any issues with the rifle or optic"

The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil..call or text me REDACTED"

This is serious fire power. From the factory: The KSG is our first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1"" overall length and an 18.5"" cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3"" shells each, for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4"" shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil"

Designed specifically for the Law Enforcement officer, its lighter platform recognizes the need to minimize weight while not compromising durability as firearms are generally carried for long periods of time and weight becomes a significant factor.

The 16” standard weight barrel is magnetic particle tested after proofing by Colt to ensure every barrel is made of perfect steel with zero flaws. Because of this tight quality control, Colt barrels are durable enough to handle thousands of rounds of highly accurate semi-auto fire yet maintain a lightweight profile. Its 1:7 twist gives it the flexibility to use the widest range of ammunition from 40 grain varmint rounds to 77 grain long range match, while maintaining ballistic stability. The bolt head is also magnetic particle tested by Colt to ensure all steel surrounding the cartridge is perfect and without flaw. These extra steps of quality are what set Colt rifles apart from other AR-15 type clones.

For sale is a Romanian 75-round drum style magazine for an AK-47 (7.62x39mm).  I purchased it at Fleet Farm a few years ago when it looked like everything was going to be banned and panic was in the air.  I opened it, looked at it, and never so much as loaded it.  I prefer old fashioned magazines over drums and so this has sat on a shelf.  I’ve been clearing out stuff lately and this has made the list of things to go.  I’m sure I paid a stupid high price at the time, but I checked the internet and have my price lower than anywhere I could find it online.  It comes in the original box (as pictured) with the original packing paper around it and the original instructions.  I’m an old school Infantry guy and drum magazines are not my cup of tea.  

As I mentioned I've been in a selling mood and I encourage you to check out my other listings.  Multiple purchases at once don't cost extra.   :)  

Drop me a line if you have any questions about this magazine."

This doesn't seem to cover receivers or frames, so looks like private sales are still OK for stripped receivers, or frame + Parts kit (barrel, slide, recoil spring) or AR lower receiver + parts kit (upper, bolt carrier, charging handle), etc without a background check. 

Example
1. Sell a handgun barrel and lower separately.
2. Sell a rifle upper and lower receivers separately.


For reference, here is the federal definition of ""firearm"" according to 18 U.S. Code § 921 (see section B)
(3) The term “firearm” means
(A) any weapon (including a starter
gun) which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a
projectile by the action of an explosive;
[b]
(B) the frame or receiver of any such weapon;
(C) any firearm muffler or firearm silencer; or
(D) any destructive device. Such term does not include an antique firearm"

•DETAILS:
This a beautiful 1933 Tula made Mosin Nagant (M91/30) with a hex receiver. All matching numbers and in excellent condition. Comes with bayonet, sling, 2 ammo pouches, and about 300 Polish 86' surplus rounds of 7.62x54R.

•OWNERSHIP HISTORY:
I was in the market for a Mosin 2 years ago. At time, my cousin worked at Big 5 Sporting Goods so i had him give me a shout when he came a cross a nice one. Well, he did and that's how I ended up getting. The gun was covered up in cosmoline when I bought it so cleaned it properly continuously for 3 day. I ended up taking it out last year on a trip and shot roughly 120 rounds, it was cleaned and stored away ever since. 

There is no cosmoline or rust on this puppy. The white stuff you may  see on the  receiver and near the chamber is just gun grease.

It comes with original box, papers, keys, and 2 Taurus OEM magazines.  The condition is outstanding.  If you didn't get one of these when they were in production, here is your chance to get a nice one.  This is an 8+1 rd, decocking, commander size pistol with a 4.25"" barrel.  It will fire double action from the decocked position, and single action from cocked.  The magazines are single stack, making the grip of this gun less of a handful than double stack equipped pistols.  Shooters with smaller hands will appreciate this, and those with larger hands will not be disappointed.

This gun does not have any holster wear or abrasions from less than careful handling.  

This model has been discontinued, but Taurus will fix it, or replace it, under their lifetime warranty, should the need arise.  This gun has been back to the factory once under this plan, and has a clean bill of health.

The pistol is on display at Gilcrest Farm Supply (FFL) where it can be inspected and purchased.  This is John Taylor's shop in Gilcrest, CO.  Email me with questions, or go out and take a look at it.  The only transfer fee is the $10 state fee.  If I sold it to you out of my living room, we'd have to go to a shop and pay the $20-$50 a shop would charge for a UBC, PLUS the $10 state fee.  Sales tax in Gilcrest is lower than the metro area.

If this ad is up, the gun is available.  I recommend calling before going out there, but this ad will be taken down *immediately* if I have been advised it has been sold. 970 73729 one six

The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR10/SR25 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock especially designed for the longer charging handle throw of 7.62 NATO platforms. 

The TAC21 Chassis System is completely modular. It allows use of AR15 Components and improves accuracy with its V-block bedding and free floated barrel. It features a built in 20MOA Top Rail. Its Straightline design pushes the recoil straight back and therefore allows for quicker follow up shots.

Straight, non-tapered recoil lug. Engineered to be slightly thicker (.300 inches) than the factory part for added stiffness that prevents flexing for improved accuracy. Surface ground perfectly flat for superior centerline tracking during recoil for consistent accuracy. Standard size matches overall factory lug dimensions, except thickness. This is specially designed to work with the TAC21 Chassis System for short and long action. Made of 4140 steel for added strength.

The Bolt Lift for the Remington® 700™ is a unique new product designed to enhance the shooting experience.

The Accu-Shot Monopods are designed to add stability and provide easy elevation adjustment for bi-pod equipped rifles.

Up for trade is your standard Stab Model B 9MM.  The gun is in great condition and come with 3 mags.  The gun will also come with a cheap fabric case and an additional barrel link.

In full disclosure the guns original barrel link and link pin both broke and were recently repalced with upgraded parts.  This is a common occurance with these guns as they original parts were not propertly heat treated.  I did however keep the original broken barrel link and pin and you well get that as well (some people like to have all the original parts.)

The gun shoots well and is a spain copy of a 1911 in 9mm.  It's always been pretty accurate but i am looking into other interests.  The gun is C&R eligable (if you don't know what this means don't worry) and I will add it to my book for the right trade.
