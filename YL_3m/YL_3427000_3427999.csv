I bought the rifle brand new in 2012 and have put exactly one box of ammo through to sight the scope. It consistently hit MOA or better at 100 yards when I zeroed it. 
Sitting on top of that is the SWFA Super Sniper fixed 10 power x42 objective lens scope. It is a very rugged and reliable scope, there are numerous raving reviews out there for this seemingly unknown scope. It has Mil-radian adjustment turrets and the Mil-Quad reticle (see pics). This combination makes doping your range time very easy and very accurate. 
Also to be included with the sale is the factory 10 round magazine and 5 legitimate 20 round magazines (not Korean) and 60 or so rounds of PMC ammo. 
The rifle is truly amazing. It will come in a hard case. After the initial zeroing, the rifle was cleaned and gets oiled on a regular basis. 
Willing to meet as far north as Bellingham and south to Marysville/Everette. 

The glare on the magazines in the pictures are from oil, not bare metal. Only the ten round has been used. The twenty round mags have been tested for fitment, but not actually ran through the gun. 

Just dropped the price. Need it gone. At this point I can take a trade for a working, decent looking earlier model honda. Civic, prelude, Integra, crx."

Time it try again.

I have a WWI era, dated 1918, U.S. Rifle, cal .30 Model of 1917 to offer up in trade for a brace of Ruger Vaqueros in .357.  This US battle rifle has much of its original finish left and the patina that you would expect from an original piece of American History.  I will include a 1917 Bayonet with the rifle as well (no scabbard).  The stock is correct but at sometime in the last 96 years it was lightly refinished.  The bore if just fine with great rifling, it shoots perfectly, is accurate with a smooth action.  I am not a historian or collector but I do know original historical guns like this will only appreciate in value over the years.

I am looking for a pair of Ruger Vaqueros in .357, 5.5"" barrels, I prefer unmodified guns and it does not matter if blued or stainless and, it would be a plus if you had leather to go with them.  I will also add in some quality mil-surp ammo if you will provide ammo too.

I am in Ft. Collins and can meet in the Loveland to Ft. Collins area for transfer.  I will pay my transfer and BGC fees but since my rifle qualifies as C&R there are no fees for you to take possession.  I value this rifle with the bayonet at $1000 +/- 

I am already have second thoughts so act quick before I change my mind.  This will be the only bump and if no action in the next week I will keep it, enjoy shooting it and just look for the best price I can for what I want and pay cash."

The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly. 

The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today. 

The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available. 

All MUR receivers come with dust cover door installed.

From Dillon:

Makes short work out of trimming large quantities of rifle brass.
The RT 1200B is used just like a standard size die. The big difference is that while you are pushing the case into the die to size it, a 1/4 horsepower electric motor driving a carbide cutter is trimming the case to length. Chips are drawn off through a vacuum manifold that clamps to the outside of the special size/trim die. (Vacuum cleaner and hose not included.) Outside diameter of manifold as 1.250""
The RT1200B is equipped with a quick-disconnect power cord; and it can be used on any standard reloader, single stage or progressive.
The RT 1200B trimmer motor for .222 Remington and longer cartridges, order stock# 22080 . (available only in 110 volt /60 hz.)
Size/trim dies are sold separately.
Replacement Carbide Cutting Blades, stock#13141
.All the electrical/electronic components of Dillon equipment are covered by a one-year warranty from date of purchase.

Note: A separate trimmer motor/die assembly is necessary for the 7.62x39mm and 6.8 SPC cartridges. The 7.62x39/6.8 SPC trimmer motor is not compatible with any other size/trim dies. Order 22024 trimmer for use with these calibers only."
