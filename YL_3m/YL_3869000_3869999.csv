""...do not expect to walk into a gun/pawn shop or gun show and think that the proprietor/dealer/collector should pay you the retail price listed within this text for your gun(s). Resale offers on many models could be anywhere from near retail to 20%-50% less than the values listed, depending upon locality, desirability, dealer inventory, and profitability. In other words, if you want to receive 100% of the price (retail value), then you have to do 100% of the work (become the retailer, which also includes assuming 100% of the risk).""

This is a somewhat rare gun, production has been limited. I can only find a few other examples for sale on other gun boards. This gun is different from a standard 92 Beretta in that the grip is straight, not curved and has an angle similar to a 1911 .45, this reducing the trigger reach. If you like the Beretta 92, but it feels too big for your hand, this is the gun for you. This gun is blued, with box and papers, 98% shape, fired little. I just have too many 9mms.  Price is $500 obo, PREFER LOCAL SALE, local buyers must have permit or CCP to purchase. All laws will be followed.  Will try to post pics later.

This LT706 combo combines the excellent Harris LM-S 9""-13"" bipod with an integral, low-profile LaRue QD lever mount. They replaced the Harris OEM stud attachment base with a custom chassis... ruling-out the risk of the stud screw and grabber becoming loose. By doing so, they were able to lower the profile by roughly .25"". A large knob on the rear provides easy leverage when adjusting swivel tension, especially when in the prone position. The bipod has 9-13"" Legs (with leg notches). The notched legs provide a more positive lockup, keeping legs from collapsing unintentionally.

+ 4473 listed it as a rifle so it must be used for that...no pistol builds
+ I've built up a very lightweight .22 AR15 with this lower's brother...everything fit and functioned...the rifle ended up weighing just shy of 5.5 lbs even with an optic

There are other things I would take an interest in, but at this time I am less interested in shotguns and revolvers. I also do not desire any 1911s, save a Carry Scorpion, as I already have a couple of nicer ones that scratch that 1911 itch well enough for me. I can add AR accessories if needed and I also would be open to additional items in lieu of cash. Other than the afore mentioned limitations I could be somewhat flexible."

It was bought brand new and like I said my rifle has NEVER BEEN SHOT (other than factory testing I suppose). You can inspect it yourself, the innards are clean as a whistle and still factory oiled. As the pictures will show I added a sling mount on the buffer tube to hang it on a 1 point sling, as well as a UTG pistol grip with compartment slot under it, and I bought a steel USGI (not aluminum) magazine for it to replace the goofy looking Magpul mag it came with. It also has a rear flip up sight and the stock is a locking Rogers Super Stoc, not the loosy goosy kind that come standard with most AR-15's. Being that it's a Colt the hand guard has a dual heat shield under it. Seeing as how I wont have any use for the one point bungee sling in the pics, I guess I'll just throw that in. 

It's practically a brand new gun so I dont think I'm willing to barter with the price. If you'd like to buy an out of the box brand new Colt from a gun shop and pay the taxes and fees, be my guest, but why not save yourself a few hundred bucks? You'll basically be getting the same gun for face value plus the add ons I've already bought for it as bonuses. It's a good deal, first come first served."

Hunt like you mean it. Kimber Model 8400 WSM rifles are lightweight but heavy on performance. Specifically designed around the shorter dimensions of the WSM case, each of the five models offers value unmatched by any other brand. Hunt with the best. Hunt with a Kimber.

Model 8400 rifles chambered for WSM cartridges feature free-floated 24-inch match grade barrels, chambers and triggers. Barreled actions are bedded on twin aluminum pillars permanently bonded into the stock, and recoil lugs are glass bedded for both strength and accuracy. Classic, Classic Stainless, Classic Select Grade and SuperAmerica models feature properly shaped classic walnut stocks with hand-rubbed oil finish and hand-cut checkering. Montana models are hard-core mountain rifles with stainless steel barreled actions and Kevlar-carbon fiber stocks. Straight combs and Pachmayr Decelerator pads dramatically reduce felt recoil. Made entirely in the Kimber factory, the Model 8400 is the finest production sporting rifle available today"

A 1938 German Mauser with the “27” factory code for “Erma”.

This mauser is 80% numbers matching SN 69xx-K the stock and bolt do not numbers match the rifle. BUT, both the stock and bolt have the Weimar Eagle acceptance stamp and are correct for the year of 1938. The bolt matches itself.

All proof marks are intact and have not been peened out. I filled them in with Brownell’s Lacquer  stick to make them visible.

The bore is clean, bright, sharp and NO rust or frosting.
this is NOT a R/C But is an early 80’s import as there are import stampings on both sides of the barrel about  2 inch’s back from the muzzle, look close.

This is a very good pre-war mauser for the collector who is looking for a pre-war rifle that is correct but will not break the bank.

I bought this like new/used, included is the factory box and manual, one 10 round and two 15 round magazines. 

Meeting in Evansville only. If the ad is up, it is available.

When I took it to the range, I was pleasantly surprised. I fired 60 to 70 rounds, some mini-mag but mostly federal bulk. No failures of any kind. Accuracy was decent with 25 yd offhand groups of under 2"". The rifle has a bit of heft which all but eliminates muzzle climb and felt recoil. The barrel is threaded 1/2x28 so it would be an easy suppressor host.

I bought this for a deer hunt last year that never happened and it has been sitting in my safe ever since. It's a very nice shotgun, I just don't have any use for it. It's got a 23"" heavy, ported barrel. Takes up to 3"" slugs. The overall length is 38.5"" so its pretty nice and compact. It comes with a sling and a scope mount, which can easily be removed if you wanted to. There are holes drilled and tapped for iron sights, but the previous owner removed them and couldn't find them when he sold me the gun. I'm sure the thread pitch is standard so you can install a bead sight, fiber optic, etc. The wood of the stock and forearm is also very good and only has some minor scuffs and dings. Rifling looks perfect. Nice thick recoil pad too. Any other questions, feel free to ask. Looking to get $100. Email me if interested."

All stainless construction and this gun is in great condition with only a few minor scuff marks. It is a 5 & 1 capacity and functions well with every type of ammo I’ve used. The last year of production for this gun was 1998 and by the S/N this one was probably made in late ’95 or early ’96.

This is not something I have to sell so my price is firm, online there sell for that or more. 

I would consider trading for a Glock 42, must have box and everything from the factory.

This is a copy of the Walther TT Olympia (M1936) used by the Germans to win the Gold Metal at the 1936 Olympics. This gun comes in a velvet lined presentation case, very rare most came in a Styrofoam tray, with two magazines and barrel weight. The gun does have two small rubbed spots on the left side of the barrel, one near the muzzle and one near the chamber.

The second gun is for parts or dummy for intruders. (I have it dis-assembled right now, but can assemble) it was ounce an operating Mossberg Model 88 Maverick, but fell off of my four-wheeler going about 50 MPH and needless to say, it was broken.

I have a bunch of nylon gear that I've finally agreed to part with. This gear has been used in Iraq and/or Afghanistan for differing periods of time (hence my previous sentimental attachment).

The chest rig is a Rhodesian style carrier that is made to carry a ballistic plate in the front. This is a very comfortable rig and has plenty of space to mount a grip of storage/magazine pouches.
