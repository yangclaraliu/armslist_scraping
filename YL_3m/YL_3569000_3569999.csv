Although the listing says Cobra, it is actually an earlier model under the name ""Davis Industries"". I am the second owner, less than 100 rounds through it. It is in excellent condition, still like new. Since in my possession I've polished the feed ramp and replaced the pot-metal firing pin for a stainless steel one. This gun is still being made under Cobra Arms, thus parts are available if need be. Due to the nature of this firearm, I do not recommend the use of hollow points or any +P rated ammunition. 

Package Includes: 
- Davis Industries P380  
- 1 Original 5-round magazine
- 1 Later generation 5-round magazine
- FREE cheap soft pistol case free (has 4 inch rip on fabric exterior).
- 100+ rounds of ammo of ball Remington UMC ammo
- 19 rounds of Speer ball ammo (not range ammo/preferred alternative for self defense)
- 4 later generation 5-round magazines that require some filing fitment

It is simply a magnificent and handsome handgun with clean lines which lend a no-nonsense, strictly business look.

Ruger honored it with the reintroduction on its 50th birthday in 2006. This is one of the few of that first year production as evidenced by the ""50 Years of .44 Magnum"" inscription on the barrel . This is a very scarce Ruger as the Anniversary model was only made for one year in 2006.

This one is Unfired and includes the 50th Anniversary case and all paperwork and accessories that are part of the Anniversary package. It is a great collectable or an even better shooter for the modern Nevada cowpoke or outdoorsman.

Also available is a set of oil finished custom walnut grips and a Hunter holster.

This is from taking the gun off every day when I get home. Also the front sight is removed. I dont have it. You can get one cheap enough online, but honestly for what this gun is intended for and the distances that you would use it make the front sight a little unnecessary.

This rifle was purchased in December and I just haven't been able to use it as much as I would like. It has been to the range just a couple of times, it runs great and is accurate. Easily hits steel at 300-400 yards. I haven't shot it farther than that. Included with the rifle are 5 FDE windowed PMAGS. I've cleaned it every time it has been used and it has been stored in a humidity controlled safe.

The Fortis REV rail system is extremely lightweight at only 11 ozs and allows for an extended grip and plenty of room to mount accessories. The noveske handguards are textured for increased grip. This rail retails for $279.95 without install.

I'll also include the original magpul handguard that was shipped with the rifle and the vertical grip."

Daniel Defense is the Sole Source Provider of the RIS II to the United States Special Operations Command!

The Daniel Defense Rail Interface System (RIS II) was designed at the request of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for the SOPMOD II program. SOCOM had a specific requirement for a free float M203 solution and Daniel Defense responded, designing a revolutionary product to meet the government’s need. The Daniel Defense RIS II allows the individual operator to free float the M203 grenade launcher without additional parts. As importantly, special tools are not required to mount the M203 grenade launcher. This was accomplished by integrating all of the needed parts to free float the M203 into the rail itself.

It is powerful enough to stop about anyone in a hurry and yet only weighs 10.2 oz's. This gun fits perfect in a pocket holster or your back pocket and women can loose it in their purse. Taurus did it right when they made this one and it works well with about any brand of ammo that you want to feed it. Work the slide one time and you are ready to fire 7 shots by just pulling the trigger 7 times. How simple can it get. Perfect protection for men and women. Oh! did I mention that it only weighs 10.2 ozs and is just over 5 inches long.

The 738 TCP offers 6+1 shots of .380 ACP, a durable polymer frame and low-profile fixed sights. You have to feel it to believe it!

Made in Italy. When I called Beretta, they advised the gun's serial number predates their record keeping, and that based upon its features it had to have been manufactured sometime between 1950 and 1959. Bore is in excellent shape. I don't think it was shot much. Has a tip up barrel. Perfect gun for someone that is disabled, or has difficulty racking a slide. You never rack the slide to shot this gun. You just drop a round in the tip up barrel, and once fired, it automatically cycles the next round. For a “mouse” gun, it has a large 8+1 capacity. The Beretta is only single action, (where the hammer resets due to the blowback from the fired cartridge, and not from pulling the trigger – The trigger only releases the hammer, which equals a light and smooth trigger). Very nice aged look. Nice, and small for concealed carry. Carry it with Hornady “magic” bullets, and it will be just as effective as a 40 caliber. I already have two (2) good shooting .25 acp caliber guns, and can't really justify keeping this one. Own a classic Beretta for only $155 (reduced). Private sale. Must be over 21, have a Florida D/L and be legally able to own a firearm. Sale will must take place at my office in Palm Harbor. Don't waste my time if you are not willing to sign a bill of sale, or won't allow me to make a copy of your Florida d/license. If you want to spend a little less, I am willing to keep the Beretta, and would sell one of my Ravens that is in like new condition (with box), with only about 150 rds through it for $130.00.

Hate to see her go, but tuition fees and book costs are starting to stack up... have to prioritize, and unfortunately, I can no longer afford shooting/hunting/collecting weapons any longer.  

What you get:
Rifle: Remington 700
Caliber: .30-06 Springfield
Stock: Synthetic All-Weather
Optics: Burris Fullfield II 3x9-40
Reticle: Ballistic Plex
Ammo: 10 Rounds Remington Core Lokt & 10 Rounds Nosler Accubond
Extras: Neoprene Sling & Buttstock Ammo Sleeve

The ammo is worth about $30, the optic is worth about $215 (with rings and base), the sling is worth $20 and the sleeve is worth $10.  So you are basically getting the rifle for $155.  Not a bad deal in my book.

Just as a side note, when I purchased this rifle, I had been considering a few other rifles.  Primarily the 7mm Rem Mag, 300 Win Mag & the .308.  I ended up going with the .30-06 for a few reasons.  First is history.  My grandfather shot a .30-06, my daddy still shoots a .30-06 so it seemed fitting that I shoot one, too.  The cost of the magnums (both the rifle, and the ammo) pretty much ruled those out.  I purchased the rifle primarily for bear and the occasional deer.  My buddies thought I was crazy to bring a non-magnum into the field to kill a bear.  Turns out that bears don't know the difference.  I shot this 300 pound boar at just over 150 yards with 180 grain Corelokts and he dropped like a rock.

With practice, you can effectively harvest any animal within the United States with ease.
