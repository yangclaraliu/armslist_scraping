The Walther PPS, short for Police Pistol Slim, is a semi-automatic pistol developed by Walther of Germany for concealed carry for civilians and plainclothes law enforcement personnel. A self-defense handgun does no good if it is miles away when you need it. The PPS is a concealed carry firearm that is slim, light and comfortable to wear all day long. Yet it is fast to bring into action, pleasant to fire, and easy to shoot accurately. The Walther PPS is short recoil-operated locked breech and uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the venerable Hi-Power pistol. The PPS has a lightweight glass fiber-reinforced polymer frame with integrated steel slide rails. The frame also has an integrated Picatinny rail for attachment of tactical lights or lasers.The slide is steel with a resilient Tenifer nitride treatment, offering extreme resistance to wear, impact, and corrosion. Low profile three dot combat sights make rapid target acquisition easy and the rear sight is windage-adjustable. Two magazines are included, and this pistol ships in a Walther branded padded hard case.

I bought this little piece on an impulse, but don’t really need it.
It’s in great shape and works fine. The bayonet is nice and sharp and the laser works great.

3. (BRAND NEW) GENUINE US MILITARY ISSUE CFP-90 LARGE FIELD PACK WITH INTERNAL FRAME INCLUDES COMBAT PATROL PACK.

Color: Woodland Camo

Manufactured in the US by Specialty Defense Systems

The field pack offers 4250 cubic inches of storage and is constructed of an 8.0 ounce backcoated nylon fabric printed in the woodland camouflage pattern, which has excellent abrasion resistance and water repellency. The weight of the empty field pack is 8 pounds. The field pack has two major sections; the sleeping bag compartment, and the main compartment. The main compartment has a false bottom that may be opened for full use of the field pack when a sleeping bag is not carried. The outside of the field pack has one long tunneled pocket and two smaller cargo pockets, all using compression straps for securing contents. Equipment attachment points in the form of 2 1/4 inch [5.71 cm] webbing and 1 inch [2.54 cm] webbing loops are located throughout the field pack.

The internal frame comprises two aluminum staves running the full height of the field pack. The staves are removable. The suspension system is adjustable allowing the user to position the field pack where it is most comfortable. The field pack has lower back padding as well as an extended lumbar support pad and the shoulder pads are made of bi-laminate foam. A softer, open cell foam is against the body for comfort, followed by a stiffer closed cell foam for stability and good recovery after compression.

Two strap assemblies with quick release buckles allow for the attachment of the combat patrol pack atop the field pack when both packs are used together. When used in combination with either the ammunition carrying or tactical load-carrying vests, the field pack shoulder pads are worn over those of the vest, where they are retained by two one inch [2.54 cm] pieces of webbing.

Combat Patrol Pack - The combat patrol pack is designed for short missions and offers 1200 cubic inches of cargo space in two compartments. The main compartment incorporates two tiedown straps that can be used to stabilize equipment such as a field radio. The combat patrol pack has a separate shoulder harness. When used in combination with either the ammunition carrying or tactical load-carrying vests, the combat patrol pack shoulder pads are worn over the vest shoulder pads, and retained for stability by two one inch [2.54 cm] pieces of webbing.

246,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3062246,"For Sale:  Blaser R8 Professional, Left Hand, 6.5 X 55","Chicago, Chicago, Illinois","$ 2,100","Listed On: Wednesday, May 14, 2014",Rifles,no type,6.5x50 Japanese                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"The bolt handle is mounted in an ergonomically perfect position just above the trigger guard. Rifle and eye remain focused on the target, the hunter gains time to aim exactly and ensure a perfect shot. ""Blind"" magazine exchange The magazine buttons are positioned above the trigger guard and can be operated „blindly“. When pushing both buttons at the same time, the magazine releases directly into the shooter‘s hand. If required, a second loaded magazine can be inserted within a split second. The magazine is loaded by pushing in cartridges from above, so that pushing the cartridges under the magazine lips is not necessary. Thus, the magazine can be loaded easily, even when it is inserted into the rifle which is a huge advantage for active hunters. Magazine capacity: caliber group Mini: 5?+?1 Standard: 4?+?1 Magnum: 3+1 Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot. The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs. Superior barrel bedding Cold hammer forged barrels and chambers provide superior quality and utmost accuracy. The barrel is embedded in the massive R8 action. Distortion of the wooden stock caused by dry or wet conditions does not affect the point of impact. Even when exchanging the barrel, the R8 barrel bedding provides optimum repeating accuracy Blaser Radial Locking System Extremely strong consentric locking directly to the barrel without rotary motion. Besides barrel bedding and quality, the Blaser radial locking system contributes decisively to unsurpassed accuracy. Success Factor: The stock Different from some traditional stock shapes the straight comb of the R8 diverts recoil forces horizontally on the shoulder. Due to the increased muzzle stability the felt recoil is substantially reduced. Thanks to a steeper angle, the palm support and a distinct cast, the R8 pistol grip provides a relaxed hand position allowing for controlled shooting and better shooting results. Manual Cocking System The R8 offers the capability of safely stalking with a round in the chamber without any chance of discharge due to the innovative manual cocking system. Without the need to move your hand from the pistol grip you can silently push the cocking lever forward allowing the firing pin and spring to be cocked, ensuring a shot at a moments notice. To de-cock the system simply push the cocking lever forward with slight downward pressure and the lever will return to the neutral position removing all tension to the firing pin spring. For the past half century the Blaser manual cocking system has been recognized as one of the safest systems in hunting rifles.No conventional safety system can surpass the uncocked firing pin spring. To safely open the bolt, simply move the cocking lever forward until you meet the first resistance (about 3 mm?/?1/8“) to unlock the bolt handle. This slight movement will not cock the rifle and you can load and unload the rifle safely. Protected against unauthorized access The unique design of the intergrated trigger/magazine assembly allows the trigger/magazine unit to be removed and stored separately. This important safety feature protects against misuse by unauthorized persons. Automatic Decocking By removing the trigger/magazine unit the R8 can no longer be cocked. Additionally removing the system from a cocked rifle, the cocking lever will return to the de-cocked position. Short and huntable The unique design of the R8 magazine above the trigger allows the overall lenght of the rifle to be 9 cm (3?½“) shorter than conventional bolt action rifles. This innovative feature proves to be a distinct advantage in all terrain. Perfectly balanced The combination of overall length, total weight and balance sets a new standard for bolt action rifles. The balanced weight distribution allows for fast handling and quick target acquisition. Safely stored, ready in a split second In situations when hunters have to walk long distances, it is more comfortable to carry the rifle stripped down in a backpack. If required, the rifle can be reassembled in a split second, without influencing the point of impact."

This rifle is equipped with the Magnum Lite® revolutionary patented graphite bull barrel, exclusive to Magnum Research. The patented uni-directional graphite fibers, parallel to the bore axis, results in a barrel with 6x the stiffness of the equivalent weight of steel. The lighter barrel weights (from 13-16 oz, depending on barrel length) are easier to wield and dissipate heat up to 43% faster than steel. The result is rim fire performance of extreme accuracy.

Other features include a .22LR Bentz target chamber designed specifically for semi-automatics and a full floating barrel with an 11 degree muzzle crown for maximum accuracy. Magnum Lite® receivers are CNC machined from a 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum forging and include an integral Weaver type rail for optics. The MLR22AT has an approximate weight of 4.25 lbs, barrel length of 17 inches, and over all length of 35.5 inches. MRI bolts are manufactured and machined from heat treated and through hardened 4140 steel with minimum headspace for better accuracy.

If you don't want the scope and rings I can drop the price by $150 and if you want the original Ruger trigger group I can deduct an additional $150. Other than that this price is firm.

There are also a few blemishes on the URX4 from installing and removing the rail covers. I did not see any blems on the lower when I bought it, however, the upper and lower match up EXTREMELY snug. There is absolutely no wiggle or play between the upper and lower, which I see as a major plus, but I guess that might be the flaw in the lower. The gun has seen approximately 90-120 rounds through it, both suppressed and non. It shoots extremely smooth as expected out of an SR15 with the SSA trigger and muzzle brake and the URX4 feels great. This rifle is ready for any abuse you would want to through at it.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.
With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.
Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line a polished Nitron two-tone slide is paired with a black hard coat anodized frame. Tru-Glo® front and SIGLITE rear sights and Hogue black Diamondwood grips complete this package.

All items are OBO and most have ammo to go with them. All pistols come with original box and paperwork except for the Rossi .357.  From top and clockwise.

1. Custom AR15- PSA lower, Yankee Hill upper, Tactical Ambush 5.56 barrel 1:7 twist, PSA LPK, PSA full auto BCG, Bravo Company mod 4 Charging Handle, MOE collapsable stock and forward grip, standard Blackhawk pistol grip, I also have a few mags for it if interested. About 150 rounds through her. Price does not include scope...$950.00.

2.HK 416 .22lr- This is a really cool and fun gun to shoot. Comes with original box and paperwork, removable front and rear sights and 1 mag...$375.00.

3.Kimber Ultra CDPII- This was was my everyday carry gun when I lived down south so it has some signs of wear but does not affect functionality at all.  This is a fantastic gun if you have ever shot one you know the quality of Kimber. Comes with original box and paperwork. I have a couple holsters for her too. Only about 250-300 rounds downrange so she's still being broken in...$950.00.

4.HK P30 9mm- Probably one of my favorite guns in the collection. This is the standard model not LEM. One of the smoothest guns I have ever owned and is dead on accurate. Comes with original box and paperwork and a Fobus OWB holster. Only about 100 rounds shot...$750.00

5.Taurus 1911 .45acp- Pretty standard pistol nothing fancy but it is a beast and spot on accurate. Comes with box and paperwork...$400.00

6.Sig Sauer SP2022 .40cal- This one was kept in a gunvault bio safe on the nightstand. In great shape about 150 rounds through her. Comes with box and papers...$350.00

7.Walther P22- Really nice little 22 has the factory red laser attached. Great for a carry piece or tucked in the car. 100 rounds shot. Comes with box and paperwork...$300.00

8.Rossi .357 Magnum- This was used as my backup gun only put about 175 rounds through her. Out of all of the revolvers I have owned this is one of my favorites, super accurate super smooth light pull. No box or paperwork with this one bc the guy I bought it off of didn't have them...$325.00

Like I said all items are OBO. I am open to trades as long as they are good pistols or AR/AK type rifles, no shotties. Don't waste my time with lowball offers as I will not respond. Multiple gun trades/sales are good for me also. EMAIL OR TEXT I will not answer if I don't know the number(texting is best and fastest) 484-947-9155

TRADITION AND INNOVATION The Beretta UGB25 Xcel semiautomatic gun features an innovative locking system with break-open barrel that allows operation in complete safety during competitions. Unlike conventional fixed-barrel semiautomatic shotguns, this new type of locking system enables the shooter to move from one firing station to another without having to extract the chambered cartridge, simply by levering the barrel downwards*. The single barrel offers the advantage of maintaining the point of impact of the second shot exactly in line with that of the first shot, thus ensuring excellent performance. SHORT BARREL RECOIL The operating principle of the Beretta UGB25 Xcel semiautomatic gun with break-open barrel is based on short recoil, which keeps the internal parts of the gun clean even after prolonged use. The short recoil (and low barrel axis position) almost completely compensates for muzzle jump during firing, with quicker and easier re-alignment of the barrel on the target for the next shot.The low barrel axis position transmits the recoil forces in line with the shooter’s shoulder thus minimizing felt recoil. The perfect adjustment of the rearwards and forwards breech bolt travel allows use of all 12 ga. 2 3/4 ” (70mm) shotshells, from subsonic ones up to 1 1/2 oz (42g) cartridges without any modification. RECEIVER The Beretta UGB25 Xcel features the unmistakable touch of Giugiaro Design.The ergonomically rounded back of the light alloy receiver fits smoothly into the stock, allowing quick and instinctive target acquisition.The polished sides contrast pleasingly with the other matte anti-glare surfaces. The streamlined receiver and the newly-designed fore-end with its extended checkered configuration combine to give the Beretta UGB25 Xcel an extremely attractive look. The cross locking bolt of the break-open barrel is located at the top, near the back. On the left is the opening lever and on the right the cartridge carrier and the second cartridge feeding port. The ejection port is located underneath. DOUBLE RECOIL DAMPER FOR BREECH BOLT The two technopolymer recoil dampers of the breech bolt cushion its impact on the bottom of the receiver, reducing vibration and increasing the life of the gun. SIDE FEED, BOTTOM EJECTION The cartridge carrier receives the second cartridge on the right-hand side of the receiver, making it immediately ready for use. It is chambered automatically through the feeding port after the first round in the cartridge chamber has been fired. The design of the cartridge carrier button and its position on the receiver ensure quick and easy removal of the cartridge on the carrier. The ejection port is in the bottom of the receiver. The ejector expells the spent hull downwards, away from the shooter and nearby competitors, and is user-friendly for both right and left shooters. OPTIMA-BORE® BARREL, OPTIMACHOKE® TUBES All versions of the UGB25 Xcel come with an Optima-Bore® barrel with a lengthened forcing cone for enhanced pattern distribution sensitivity, reduced felt recoil and shot velocity optimisation. The internal shape of the Beretta’s Optimachoke® and Extended Optimachoke® tubes is designed to reduce shot deformation and to enhance shot pattern distribution and concentration.They may be used with steel shot cartridges.The aluminum alloy top rib is easy to remove and is interchangeable with others of different types and sizes."

Spreewerke was the third and final company in Germany to make this gun during the war, they were made from 1943 to 1945.  The way to tell the difference between the gun by manufacturer is a three letter code stamped into the gun, ""cyq"" is the stamp that indicates that it is a Spreewerke and not a Walther or a Mauser.  This gun looks almost brand new, especially considering it's history, along with the ""cyq"" stamp, there are also stamps of the German Army, the eagle over the swastika.  I have seen this gun go for a wide range of prices, so my number is a shot in the dark at $600, because I have seen it go for more.  I don't want to sell it, but times are tough, and needs outweigh the wants.  If you are interested in a piece of history, please feel free to e-mail (REDACTED) or text REDACTED) me.

The comfortable design of the all new XD-S™ feels so natural, it’s like an extension of your own body. The unique combination of an ultra-slim profile paired with enhanced performance point-and-shoot features allows you to shoot accurately without having to adjust your wrist giving you greater control. Prepare to be impressed with the single-position Picatinny rail that puts lights and lasers within easy reach. With an eye toward detail, the low-profile rear and fiber-optic front sights are specifically designed to allow you to quickly zero in on your target. A game-changer in the marketplace, the XD-S™ offers all of the quality and safety features you expect from the XD® line. This powerful pistol includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, loaded chamber indicator and grip safety. In addition, the XD-S™ offers a top-of-the-line, enhanced secure grip texture for greater control and usability. At only 1” wide, the XD-S™ features a low profile rear and fiber optic front sight, enabling easier and faster target acquisition. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice. Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a 9mm in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best."

The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.
