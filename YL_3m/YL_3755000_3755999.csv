This is a brand new, never been used Level IIIA Bullet Proof Vest. Comes with multiple attachments for the vest (shown in picture). The size of the vest is XL.

Looking for $300 OBO or potentially trade for a revolver. 

In Wisconsin, any adult can purchase and use a bulletproof vest, unless that adult has been convicted of a felony. Bulletproof vests and all other body armor can be purchased online or face-to-face.

In Wisconsin, donning a bulletproof vest during a felony or attempted felony can lead to an additional felony conviction, or the adding of extra years to the final prison sentence. Again, this law affects certain individuals who might wear bulletproof vests, but does not affect retailers."

The ""A1"" class is a specialized tactical branch of the most tested and trusted military and personal defense weapon in history: the 92FS. We started with the super-reliable 92, keeping the engineering characteristics that make it so accurate, safe and dependable; then, we added some features prized by today’s most demanding tactical shooters as well as by those wanting the absolute best for home defense or personal protection. The result is the 92A1, a pistol that is as reliable for its intended use as it is safe and user-friendly even for the novice.
The base design of the 92A1 is the 92FS or M9, the pistol that has served the US military admirably throughout its campaigns in the world’s toughest environments. But even in this respect, Beretta never rests on its laurels. This pistol incorporates an innovative internal frame buffer that greatly reduces component stress under firing (yes, even with hot +P ammo), making it even more durable and smooth-shooting. The best of both worlds, the 92A1 offers discriminating shooters the classic overall look and feel of the 92 (including the more traditional rounded trigger-guard) with today’s most advanced tactical features.

One of the rifles he built was actually sold in an auction to Donald Trump.  (Impressive I know). He knows what's good and mid range priced, and he built this gun for me as a trade for my never been fired, Remington 700 that was built in 1995 (i say again, it had never been fired) with a leupold scope on it and a Caldwell bipod. Beautiful rifle that was quoted at 1700.

Anyway enough with the story. Here's the rifle.

New Frontier Polymer Lower receiver with all PSA milspec internals (the lightest, and most durable sear and trigger groups available for the price)
RRA buffer and tube (milspec)
Brass Aluminum Forging Upper
BCG is stamped ARD. I don't know what the stamp means, I think it's Armalite.
PSA 16"" barrel

Externals:
Truglo optic, 2.5 MOA
Magpul MOE hand guards
Magpul MOE buttstock
Magpul MOE grip
Magpul AFG2
Magpul MBIUS (rear)
UTG mounted flashlight with pressure switch
A2 front post with bayonet lug
Troy industries single point sling adapter

It's an awesome preppers gun. It's definitely a better quality rifle than what Bushmaster or DPMS could ever put out. Over all, it weighs 9 pounds loaded. It comes with one metal magazine, 3 Magpul gen3s. About 1500 rounds through it (Cold barrel to break it in), and after that haven't heated the barrel up much. Also comes with a Blackhawk case that doubles as a shooters mat. The rifle quoted at 1000 flat at a local gun shop, but he would have sold it for 1500. Hope I hit everything! Thanks for reading!"

Price is roughly what I have to spend on this purchase. I could go up a little for the right deal. I noticed someone trying to sell a Glock 34 for $950. I guess Austrian elves flew in and stayed at the Hilton to polish that one. Not what I am looking for.

I don't care much about cosmetics. I am looking for accuracy and dependability. Extra magazines would be a big plus.

If you have something else I didn't list, let me know, but don't expect me to pay the same for a 92S as for a 92FS (for example). I am pretty much up to speed on what a lot of guns sell for in stores and if I don't know, I know how to find out.

Colt series 80, or mk. iv series 80, are a line of firearms introduced in 1983 by Colt's Manufacturing Company. The main difference between this guns and the previous Colt series 70 is that the former incorporate a new firing pin block safety system, consisting of a series of internal levers and a plunger positively blocking the firing pin from moving until the trigger is pressed, hence eliminating the possibility of the gun going of if dropped onto a hard surface or struck hard

The Model 840 was derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

There is a matching OD green Hogue Handall grip on it now, but you can remove it if you like. This pistol has not been modified or tinkered with. It has about 700rds through it and I'd rate it 8/10 cosmetically. The night sights are Glock factory installed replacements and were installed in June of 2014 - good to go. This pistols comes with everything from the factory including two 15rd standard capacity factory magazines, papers, etc...

Straight from the pages of history comes the new Citadel M-1 carbine. Built to the exact speciﬁcations of the G.I. model used by U.S. infantrymen in both WWII theaters of battle and in Korea, this reproduction riﬂe comes to you chambered in the fun and economical .22 LR cartridge. Used by officers as well as tankers, drivers, artillery crews, mortar crews and other personnel in lieu of the larger, heavier M1 Garand riﬂe, the M-1 carbine weighed only 4.5 to 4.75 pounds. The Citadel M-1, made by Chiappa in Italy, weighs in at 4.8 lbs. – nearly the exact weight of the original. Barrel length and OAL are also the same as the “United States Carbine, Caliber .30, M1”, its official military designation.

I sent my Saiga 12 to ETAC around June 2008. Just got it back this week.... Needless to say, his work is highly sought after and is top of the line.

It is a Saiga 12 that has been coverted to a pistol grip with folding stock. The barrel and gas system have been shortened to function at 8"" barrel length. Currently the barrel is cut and threaded to 8"". An extension has been blind pinned to keep the overall barrel length legal over 18"". It also has HK sights installed and a picatinny forend. It has a Tromix folding stock on it. ETAC internals. I have a Tromix Shark brake that I'll include with it. I'll have to look around but I might have 2-3 10rd mags that I had laying around.

Basically all this needs to become an awesome SBS is to file a form 1, get it engraved, and remove the pin and extension.

It is in basically new shape. Unfired by me. Only slight blemish in the finish is near the ETAC logo on the rear of the receiver. There are a few small bubbles in the Lava Shield they use. I included it in the pics. Only reason I am selling, it that I've gotten out of class 3 stuff and mainly into 3 gun competition.

This scope has exceeded my every expectation. Sightron and the SIII series in particular have an outstanding reputation in the long range shooting community, and are considered the top tier sub $1000 scope, outperforming the Vortex scopes. The SIII series is known for its optical quality (clear glass) and accurate tracking. It has received 4.5 to 5 stars on every retailer site. Do your research, read some forums and reviews, and you’ll be a believer. I take exceptional care of all my hunting gear, especially my optics. The scope is about six months old and has less than 50 rounds on it, I have the casings to prove it. I’ve just ran into hard times and need to liquidate some of my luxury assets.

It's an old gun, but still shoots very well. I just ran another box of shells through it a couple of weeks ago. It's fairly light weight and quite accurate. It's chambered only for 2 3/4"" shells, no magnum loads. The wood and metal are in good condition - a minor crack in the stock that looks like it's been there for quite a while, I don't think it's going anywhere. I cleaned up the metal after I got it and it looks pretty darn good for its age. I just decided I'll stick with 12 gauge, and this is my last 20 to sell. So if you need an inexpensive gun for the truck, for bird hunting or even home defense, this could be your gun.

Included with the shotgun is (1) box of 20 gauge bird shot to get you started.

Price is $95

Sale will be cash, FTF in Milwaukie, Oak Grove, Gladstone or O.C. Current Oregon DL is required, current Oregon CHL is preferred and will be given preferential status if more than one person wants this. Just FYI, I won't be able to meet this weekend, but can meet starting Monday.

This pistol shoots any kind of ammo problem free and has a great trigger- that being said, I am just more interested in the 1911 platform.
As such, I would like to make a trade for a mid-range 1911. The main one I would be interested in would be a Springfield Armory Mil-Spec. Otherwise would be interested in anything comparable, like models from Para-Ordanance, Ruger, Remington, etc. Mainly interested in a commander size, but will consider full and officer size models as well. Might consider basic models like Rock Islands but will expect some cash on top. Conversely, can add a little cash for something more higher end.
Otherwise I will sell for $600 OBO.

This is the new model WITHOUT the useless laser.  It has exactly 43 rounds through it to verify proper functioning and it performs flawlessly.  

I bought this gun new about two weeks ago (on 11/14/14 and I can show you the receipt) but my hand just doesn’t fit the gun.  That’s a shame because it’s ultra-slim for concealed carry and small enough to easily disappear in any pocket or purse so you can always have it with you.

The full package comes with everything that came from the factory (as shown in photo) and includes the two 6-round mags supplied by Smith & Wesson (one with flush plate and one with pinkie extension), lock, soft carry case, box and all paperwork including the un-used registration card. The still-sealed test fire casing envelope is dated 09/17/14 to prove this gun is newly manufactured.

I’ll also throw in a DeSantis Nemesis pocket holster for it (not shown in the photos) and 50 rounds of ammo to get you started.

Prefer face-to-face transfer in east Tennessee without shipping.  Must be a legal buyer, 21 or over with valid TN driver’s license or permit. 

If I don’t respond to your email immediately, it only means I’m at work and I’ll respond soon after I get home.  If the ad is still up, the gun is still available.

My only trade interest is toward a Glock 42, a Glock 26 (Gen 4 only), or an M&P Shield 9mm.  I’ll add boot for any of these.  

I'll gladly take cash for the Bodyguard but I’m not looking for low-ball offers.  Thanks!"
