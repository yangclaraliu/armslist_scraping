The .223 Wylde hybrid chamber was designed by Bill Wylde of Greenup, IL to exploit the 
accuracy advantages of the .223 Remington commercial chambering without pressure problems 
or compromising the functional reliability when using the high velocity 5.56x45mm NATO military
ammunition. It is used by many rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15
rifles, barrels, and upper receivers. The .223 Wylde achieves better accuracy by having a chamber 
throat that is tighter than 5.56x45mm but will still function reliably with military 5.56 ammunition 
as the case dimensions are the same. In short, it will give you the accuracy of a real SAAMI when 
using the good ammo, but also allow you to use cheap surplus ball ammo safely. Please Google .223 
Wylde if you are unfamiliar with this chamber. It is truly the best of both .223 and 5.56 chambers.

Buffalo Bore Ammo - 9X18 Makarov +P Ammo - 115 gr. Hard Cast - FN (1,000 fps/ME 255 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box










Our introduction of a ""heavy bullet for cartridge"" 9X18 Makarov +P loading is the sole result of numerous customer requests.  With millions of these pistols now on American soil and no +P heavy loadings available, this cartridge and the many pistol owners are suffering from the lack of serious fight stopping ammunition.  This load is 20grs. heavier and 100 fps faster than standard 9X18 ammo.

This loading features a flash suppressed powder, so if you need to shoot in low light, you won't be blinded by your own gun fire and this is a useful tactical advantage since around 95% of all civilian shootings in the US happen in low light while the criminal element is out and about.  Our use of a hard cast bullet, with a flat nose, can best be understood if you'll read our technical article on ""The Use of Expanding Bullets in Small Defensive Cartridges,"" posted under the ""Technical Articles"" category on our home page.

Further, please note that the use of hard cast bullets (not lead but, Hard Cast) does NOT cause lead fouling in the polygonal rifling's used in all 9X18 Makarov pistols.  For more information, please see our technical articles entitled ""Hard Cast Bullets in Polygonal Barrels"" and ""Dangers of Pure Lead Cowboy Bullets"". We found no appreciable leading in any of our Makarov test guns. It should also be noted that all of our test guns functioned and fed flawlessly with this load. We also experienced very good to excellent accuracy in all test guns.

Please note the real world velocities listed below from real world 9X18 Makarov pistols. At Buffalo Bore we always use real, ‘over-the-counter’ firearms for our published velocities, as we feel the use of laboratory test barrels that give false, high velocities does the customer a disservice as each customer needs to know what their carry ammo will really do on-the-street in a real world situation.

Barrel:  A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system.   The Special ultra lightweight profile barrel  has a conventional .750"" gas block diameter, is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.  The weight of the barrel splits the difference between our light profile and our pencil barrel.    Barrel is finished off with a PSA 15"" SQR Free float rail, low profile gas block, and A2 flash hider. Barrel is made for PSA by FN right here in South Carolina.
Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer."

Best ""Bang for the Buck"" choice in barrels on the market today! Adams Arms has expanded its product line to now include a line of barrels. The barrel has been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them more corrosive resistant and harder than hard chrome.  This newer technology results in a longer lasting, more resistant, and more accurate barrel that produces higher ballistic velocities than a similar chrome lined barrel. These barrels have proven to OUTPERFORM any mil-spec barrel on the market and come with a LIFETIME WARRANTY.

Current Barrels Disadvantages:

Standard chrome lined barrels are rifled with a slightly larger diameter than what is needed. This is done so the hard chrome can be added on top of the surface area which will add to the tolerances. It leaves high and low spots along with microscopic divots and deficits. These imperfections add resistance to the round as it travels down the barrel, slowing down the velocity. Accuracy and range of efficiency drops when the velocities on the round drop. This is evident even more so with the shorter barrels. The trade off is hard chrome resists corrosion better than the bare material the barrel is cut from and it does not have a high cost associated with it. While eventually over time it will wear off, hard chrome will outlast bare metal. You sacrifice accuracy for longevity.

Stainless steel barrels are well known for higher velocities and better accuracy because the bore has been cut true into the steel. This cut does not leave any added imperfections so the round has less resistance as it travels down the barrel. This quality does come at a high price. Most stainless steel barrels cost almost twice what a chrome lined barrel cost, which prices them out of the market for most shooters. Also, while they have corrosive resistant properties by nature, they are not completely corrosive resistant and can corrode over time. They are the choice for most high end manufacturers and shooters but they are not a viable option for every shooter.

Adams Arms Advantage:

Our barrels are finished with our proprietary QPQ Melonite process inside and out. Unlike hard chrome and magnesium phosphate, Melonite is a molecular bonding process with the metal. It allows the chemicals to seep down below the surface area of the metal, instead of just adding a top layer. This means that the barrel can be cut to a true rifle bore while maintaining complete corrosion resistance and virtually no wear. It also means that the protection offered is not just a thin layer on top of the material but actually penetrates layers deep ensuring that it does not wear off. Now you have the velocities of a stainless steel true rifle bore with complete protection! You can out last a chrome lined barrel and shoot with the accuracy and efficiency of a stainless steel barrel, all without breaking the bank"

The Millennium Pro pistols offer many improvements over the standard models, but were introduced as enhancements to the originals, not to supplant them. Pro counterparts have now been released for nearly all of the original models. Some features of the Pro line include optional increased magazine capacities, larger and easier to operate controls, a single-action/double-action trigger mechanism on some models with reduced trigger travel and an improved smoother and lighter trigger pull, an enhanced frame, and an improved more ergonometric grip design. Other Pro improvements include the contrast enhanced Heinie ‘Straight-8’ sighting system, as well as optional night sights, a loaded chamber indicator which can be felt as well as seen, and a feature labeled 'posi-traction' which consists of an alteration to the number and layout of the slide serrations resulting in an improved gripping surface.

Features a lightweight polymer frame, the Millennium Pro weighs in at only 22 ounces. The thin profile makes it easy to carry every day, and the ramped 3.2"" barrel is capable of great accuracy. The newly designed Millennium Pro may be the ideal concealed carry handgun. The Millennium Pro also showcases an accessory rail, high-profile sights, and an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges provide added comfort and easy concealment.

The Millennium Pro also features many intuitive saftey devices. Complete with a loaded chamber indicator, manual safety, Taurus Internal Security System, and an automatic trigger safety.

366,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3935366,For Sale/Trade:  WW2 Vet Bring Back Guyot Pistol Revolver,"Philadelphia, Southeastern, PA, Pennsylvania",$ 650,"Listed On: Sunday, February 22, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a rare revolver brought back in WW2 from Paris France. It was sold under the Guyot name which was the equivalent of buying something from 5th Avenue in NYC today. This piece has fantastic scroll work over the entire frame, trigger, hammer, etc. These pieces were purchased by the super wealthy of the day when your pistol was not only a self defense piece, but also a status symbol as well. 

So what do we know?

Not much, really:
-A number of gun makers and gun retailers who traded under the Guyot name.
-They spanned a timeframe from the last 19th to the mid 20th century.
-They made some very nice guns.
-They may have had some guns made by Francotte or by other makers in the Belgian trade.
Here’s what I’ve found out about the gun makers going by the name Guyot:
This listing of Guyots from a guide to Europeans who were involved in the gun trade.

It is a CMP service grade rifle (with authenticity papers) and is one of the nicest I've seen. Nice olive grey parkerizing. The metal finish is approx 95%. Just some very minor wear on a few high spots from handling at armories over the years. Extreemly nice matching walnut stock.  No cracks or major gouging. You don't see many stocks like this around. It has a somewhat rare barrel. It is a 1945 SA and is in new condition (MW of 0+ and TE of 0+). Bore is perfect. All SA parts so far as I can tell. I can't tell who made the pins and such. This would make a perfect shooting gun with such a good barrel. Its just as nice inside as it is on ths outside. I have not cleaned the metal since I recieved the rifle. It still has a layer of protective cosmoline on the metal parts. It will wipe off easy. That is the discoloration you see on the metal. Also comes with pictured CMP hard case and papers.

THE SELLER WROTE
The MKII is preferred over the MKIII due to the changes in the internal safeties. Currently a new Ruger 22 with stainless 7 inch barrel is going for 100 to 150 dollars more than I am asking. Due to the popularity of the MKII over the MKIII, I believe that my price is very reasonable if not a bargain basement price :) You can't get this design new anymore. 

THIS IS FALSE!  A new stainless in 7"" IS NOT GOING FOR 150-200 more than he is asking.  The MKII is not highly wanted.  It is a good handgun but the MKIII AND 22/45 are better because of parts availability.

The only ones that are going for what he is asking is the true highly coveted, the ones with a 10"" barrel.  Look them up on gunbroker, not ones with 0 bids, but ones that people are actually bidding on.

Scope: 

The most demanding situations -and the most demanding shooters- call for the Leupold Mark AR MOD 1. This new tactical optic squeezes every millimeter of accuracy potential from your MSR/AR or bolt-action rifle, lighting the way to success with optional daylight-visible green FireDot illumination.



Mount:

Leupold mounts are every bit as rugged and dependable as the Leupold optics they're intended to secure. With a huge variety of mounting systems, for nearly every type of firearm under the sun, you're sure to find the perfect match for you firearm, and your style of shooting. The Leupold Integral Mounting Systems (IMS) family quickly and easily eliminates the two most common issues faced when mounting standard rifle scopes to AR-style rifles; scope height and eye relief. Each aluminum IMS cantilever design mounts directly to the firearm's Mil-Spec 1913/Picatinny to raise the scope and push it forward, eliminating the need for risers or specialized optics with shortened eye relief. All Leupold IMS products are tested to endure the rigors of the field and are covered by the Leupold Full Lifetime Guarantee."

We are a dealer located in Westfield, IN known as Marksman Shooting Sports. We are located on SR 32 and Carey Rd. right next to the Kroger. (17423 Carey Rd. Suite A Westfield, IN 46074).

For sale we have an EXCELLENT and very rare, army contract Papa Nambu made by Tokyo Artillery Arsenal between 1908 and 1914. These Papa Nambus (the predecessor to the very common T14 Nambu) are very scarce and are typically in terrible condition. This one is in nice matching condition with very little pitting and excellent original blue. The only notable finish loss is on the front and rear straps (where you would grip the pistol). The original matching grips are free of cracks and in wonderful shape. The bore is excellent and clean. 

Please stop by and see this wonderful rare piece. Less than 10,000 of these were ever made, and less than half of those were made by TAA.

Thanks!"

This has been mounted on a pistol with a few hundred rounds fired through it, but you wouldn't be able to tell it isn't brand new by looking at it. No flaws, I just switched to the smaller dot LED version as I have good eyes and wanted to build a pistol to shoot very long distances with. For any defensive application though, this model with 6.5 MOA dot would be the way to go. Comes with original case and all paperwork. These are sold out at many places.

Stats below:

Developed to improve precision and accuracy with any style or caliber of weapon, the Trijicon RMR (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) is designed to be as durable as the legendary ACOG. The RM07 is an LED sight powered by a standard CR2032 battery. Housed in rugged forged aluminum, the RMR is extremely tough yet lightweight. New easy-to-use adjusters with audible clicks allow for quick windage and elevation adjustments. 

With eight available brightness settings, the reticle can be manually adjusted by pressing the plus or minus buttons on either side of the unit. To switch to auto adjust mode simply press both buttons simultaneously and release. To save battery life turn the optic off by pressing both buttons simultaneously and holding for 3 seconds.  

The Trijicon RMR is tougher than any alternative and suitable for military, law enforcement and hunting applications.

Power, Pure, Simple, Rugged, Reliable, and Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again. Smooth functionality with dead-on accuracy, shot after shot, the Model 99 in .50 BMG is competition ready. At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match grade barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. The action's strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt's few moving parts (extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly) make it reliable and easy to maintain. The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is virtually maintenance-free and the bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting.  Known as much for its dependability as its versatility, the Model 99 has unfailing accuracy you can rely on."

The Barska Scope is also Brand New in the Box. It has all paperwork and original packaging. I purchased it for my father and he bought another scope before I could give it to him. Barska is not top of the quality but I did a lot of research before I bought it to get the best for the money. It is 4-14x50mm…it will reach WAY out there, super clear and crisp. Has factory flip-up protectors and additional focus adjustments on the for-end. If want to bring the target right up to you at 500 yrds, this one will do it, and you can still adjust out for close shooting as well…very versatile. $50 OBO.

The Swift Premier Scope is used and has light scratches. It was mounted on my 45-70 and I kept it when I sold the rifle because it was so good. It is very good quality 3x9-40mm and held perfectly on my lever gun, easy to dial in and never had to move it again…super solid. It has the original box and all paperwork. I never registered it for the lifetime warranty, so you might be able to take advantage of that (break it and send it to them for a new one lol). It is extremely clear and bright for low light applications, it focuses very easily on a target, that is why I kept it. Have since got out of hunting so selling it.  $50 OBO. 

Would let it all go for $100 if you want it.

This is a 16 inch heavy 1/8 twist barrel capped with a PWS muzzle break, has a carbine length gas system and the gas block has two settings, one for suppressed and one for unsuppressed operation, Magpul AFG (OD green) Bolt and BCG are a hand polished hard chrome, upgraded to a Bravo company gunfighter charging handle with large latch, geissele SSA two stage trigger, Magpul BAD lever, Magpul ASAP single point sling accachment, Magpul CTR stock (OD Green) with the LaRue RISR. Ergo medium grip (OD green). This is topped with Troy back-up iron sights, and an EOTech 512 weapon sight. Included are all the LaRue rail covers, a Larue quick detatch sling adaptor for the rail as well as three of the 3 inch detachable rails, all screws and the tool. 

This is a top of the line setup, the gun is used and shows some wear in the normal friction areas, I have owned this gun for three years and it has been incredibly accurate and never had a single malfunction in the 1,500 rounds I've put through it. I have cleaned and cared for this rifle meticulously after every time I've shot it. I Just had a buddy recieve his from LaRue and last month, it was ordered in Jan 2012, so you're looking at around a 2 year wait from the manufacturer right now. If you have shot a LaRue rifle before then you will understand why folks wait that long for a rifle. Asking $2,700 OBO, it's a lot of money for an AR but if you add up the rifle and accessories and you'll see that this is a fair asking price."

The gun comes with 3 x 30 round magazines, a FAB Defense VFR-AK quad rail, an Ergo grip, 120 rounds of ammo, and a Bulldog coffin soft case.

The gun features a billet receiver, over sized and extended mag release, and a muzzle break.

The quad rail is the best rail system currently on the market.  Instead of clamping to the barrel or gas tube, it attaches too and clamps to the receiver itself.  The rail provides a rock solid, stable platform for mounting optics.  Unlike other extended rails and optics platforms, the rail does not need to be removed to take down the gun or remove the dust cover.

$1000 invested, gun is for sale for $800 OBO.  Please let me know if you have any questions."

Less than 100 rounds fired. It does have the integrated laser and it is sighted in at 15 yards. It has a newly installed Trijicon XS night sight and Hogue Grip that make this gun very easy and much more of a pleasure to shoot. I went from being very inaccurate with it to having a nice lightweight carry gun I can trust to hit my target. I am just more of a 1911 style guy and though I have become accurate with this smooth double action trigger, I just prefer to keep all of my carry guns single action. 

It also comes with a Desantis pocket holster, all factory goodies (including a S&W soft carry case, box, lock, and papers), and a box of Speer Gold Dot +p self defense ammo (probably the best personal protection ammo available for this gun). The original sight and grip is also included.

7.63mm (.30 cal), serial #487778 all parts matching, all original. Very early postwar Bolo, probably 1920-1, prior to the addition of the Mauser banner mark on the left side of the frame which started about serial number 500,000. (Mauser gives a serial range of 444476 to 793350 for Postwar Bolos.) Also has the early full serial # on diagonal flat, not on side as started later. 

All correct markings & features:
-Right hand side rear frame is stamped WAFFENFABRIK MAUSER OBERNDORF A NECKER.
-Original small walnut grips with 22 grooves.
-'New Safety' proof mark, showing the inter-twined N and S, along with the last three digits of the serial number, which also appears in full just below the hammer on the rear of the frame (Hammers with NS but no number are not original).
-3.9"" barrel with the front sight on a barrel band.
-Lanyard ring pivots side to side.
-50 to 1000 adjustable meter sight. 
-Full serial number in two places on back.
-Small ring hammer, early style.
-No hole through safety knob. 

Note: After WWII the surviving C96 Mauser pistols were stored for several decades, before finally being sold as surplus and imported into the U.S. in the 1980's and early 1990's. Many of these imports were assembled from random parts and have mis-matched serial numbers. This C96 was imported in the 1980s (faint import mark under the barrel) but is all original with matching serial numbers.

The Weatherby Vanguard Series 2 Sporter represents a clear improvement over its predecessor and, given its affordable price, should prove to be just as successful. While the Vanguard Series 2 Sporter varies from its predecessor in small and important ways, the basic features remain unchanged. Take the bolt, for example. Like the original’s, the Weatherby Vanguard S2 one-piece bolt has dual-opposed locking lugs with an M16-style extractor and a plunger-type ejector. Fluting on the bolt body reduces surface area and provides debris a place to migrate, preventing the bolt from binding, while three ports enable gas to escape in the event of a ruptured case or pierced primer. Knurling on the rearward-sweeping bolt handle enhances purchase. Additionally, the Weatherby Vanguard S2 bolt has a fully enclosed shroud and a cocking indicator. Staying true to the original Sporter concept, the S2 Vanguard still retains its 24"" #2 contour hammer forged barrel.



The Weatherby Vanguard S2 Sporter's A- Grade Monte Carlo walnut stock has a raised comb, rosewood forend and fineline diamond point checkering. The Series 2 Sporter is equipped with a three-position action-mounted safety; the rearmost position is “safe”; the middle position enables the bolt to be cycled for unloading while still in the “safe” mode; and fully forward allows the rifle to be fired. Perhaps the most noteworthy change is the Weatherby's newly designed 2-stage match trigger, which is factory preset at slightly more than 3 pounds, yet can be adjusted down to 2 pounds, 8 ounces."

This gun is pretty sweet.  I've put about 300 rounds through it and installed the Apex Competition AEK and Apex Reset Assist Mechanism (RAM). 

What this means to you is everything about the action of this gun has been improved. Trigger pull is in the 3.5 lb range, over travel is reduced and reset is reduced. Also, the RAM enhancement gives it a more audible/tactile reset. Not as much as a glock but much better than a stock M&P.

However, not interested in muzzle loaders, shotguns nor archery equipment. Thanks for looking and please remember to pray for our troops both in the IDF and in the US Forces."
