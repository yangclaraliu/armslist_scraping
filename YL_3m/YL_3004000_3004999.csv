The Walther PPS, short for Police Pistol Slim, is a semi-automatic pistol developed by Walther of Germany for concealed carry for civilians and plainclothes law enforcement personnel. A self-defense handgun does no good if it is miles away when you need it. The PPS is a concealed carry firearm that is slim, light and comfortable to wear all day long. Yet it is fast to bring into action, pleasant to fire, and easy to shoot accurately.

The Walther PPS is short recoil-operated locked breech and uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the venerable Hi-Power pistol. The PPS has a lightweight glass fiber-reinforced polymer frame with integrated steel slide rails. The frame also has an integrated Picatinny rail for attachment of tactical lights or lasers.The slide is steel with a resilient Tenifer nitride treatment, offering extreme resistance to wear, impact, and corrosion. Low profile three dot combat sights make rapid target acquisition easy and the rear sight is windage-adjustable.

Two magazines are included, and this pistol ships in a Walther branded padded hard case.

Description 

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

The Walther PPS, short for Police Pistol Slim, is a semi-automatic pistol developed by Walther of Germany for concealed carry for civilians and plainclothes law enforcement personnel. A self-defense handgun does no good if it is miles away when you need it. The PPS is a concealed carry firearm that is slim, light and comfortable to wear all day long. Yet it is fast to bring into action, pleasant to fire, and easy to shoot accurately.

The Walther PPS is short recoil-operated locked breech and uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the venerable Hi-Power pistol. The PPS has a lightweight glass fiber-reinforced polymer frame with integrated steel slide rails. The frame also has an integrated Picatinny rail for attachment of tactical lights or lasers.The slide is steel with a resilient Tenifer nitride treatment, offering extreme resistance to wear, impact, and corrosion. Low profile three dot combat sights make rapid target acquisition easy and the rear sight is windage-adjustable.

Two magazines are included, and this pistol ships in a Walther branded padded hard case.

Has also been upgraded with a carbine length single piece DPMS free float all metal quad rail. Free floating rails reduce pressure points on the barrel and increase the accuracy of the firearm ($149) RED DOT PICTURED IS NOT INCLUDED. Included also is all original paper work with warning cards. The firearm comes with a generic run-of-the-mill hardshell case and the factory provided action lock. Firearm is near new- less than 300 rounds through it. Buffer tube is spotless and the trigger group is starting to show use. Rifle was very well taken care of. There was one issue at the range where the retaining pin came loose, snapped and cause the firing pin to dislodge during operation. Competent and trusted gunsmiths examined and replaced the necessary parts of the rifle with new DPMS factory parts- it is in compete working order (I have shot it since with no issues). The only remaining damage is marring on the firing pin which is shown in the images. Price is $700 FIRM. No trades, no negotiating. I don't need to sell it, so I have time to wait. It was purchased during the 2013 scare and I am no where recouping what I paid for/put into it. I will only sell through an FFL dealer in person. After cash is handed to me, I will transfer firearm to the FFL to run the background check- if you fail the check, your money will NOT be returned until firearm is back in my possession. It is YOUR responsibility to find an FFL willing to do the exchange- and cost of fee's and background check is at YOUR expense in addition to the $700. FFL must be located a reasonable distance from where I live (if interested we can hammer out the details- reasonable distance equates to 45 minute drive time). It is your responsibility to know if this firearm is legal to possess in your jurisdiction."

In the Remington, I have 8 pellet and 9pellet available, the Winchester ranger comes in 9 pellet.  Both are EXCELLENT for home defense applications with quick follow up shot capabilities due to the low recoil.

Here is what Winchester has to say about the ranger ammo.-
For superior Buckshot performance, you can't beat the stopping power of Winchester Buckshot loads. 
For all the performance of traditional Ranger loads without the high power kick, look to Ranger Low Recoil Buckshot Loads. These products deliver less shooting fatigue and quick, on-target follow-up shots with clean-burning, low flash powder for reduced night vision loss. Low recoil buckshot loads deliver 30% less recoil than standard loads.

Shell Length: 2-3/4
Velocity: 1145
Shot Size: 00
Dram: N/A
Oz. Shot: 9
Rounds Per Box: 25
I have 5 boxes of 25 rounds available for sale- $25 for a box of 25 shells.  Price is firm at $25 a box on the Winchester Ranger.

And here is what Remington has to say-
For training and practice, there's no substitute for the real thing - for duty applications Reduced Recoil products encourage shotgun usage. Our new 9 pellet Reduced Recoil Buckshot loads lower felt recoil by 40% for better second shot recovery, and with the addition of their Power Piston® shot cup, polymer buffering and hardened 3% antimony pellets, produce outstanding pellet patterns. 

The Remington RR1200BK Buckshot load was developed to provide a reduced recoil round for use by law enforcement agencies. This shell contains 9 00 Buckshot weighing 1 ounce and is loaded to a muzzle velocity of 1200 fps. This velocity and payload combine to produce a load with 40% less recoil than standard 12ga. 9 pellet buckshot offerings. This load may not operate all types of semi-automatic shotguns. 25 rounds per box..

First is a colt 1991, .45 acp, ceracoated black, threaded barrel, includes 1 wilson 47D magazine. Has been worked over very well, and has a trigger you have to feel to belive. Has been converted to series 70 from the series 80 firing system. Much nicer trigger. Includes houge rubber finger groove grips, a pair of grim reaper grips, and a pair of wood grips I used to see if I liked the look of different color grips, right now its gloss black. Also has a TICK brand light rail. Also has a kydex owb holster, and a leather iwb.
Next is a pietta .44 magnum single action, 4 3/4 barrel, case colored and blue. Has ruger style transfer bar, so safe with all six, but still retains colt style half cock loading. Has frame that was ceracoated gloss black to match rest of gun. Used as a trail gun, so finish on frame has some wear on parts exposed when holstered. Shoots great, and packs well on your hip. Includes belt, and two holsters.
Last is a kel tec p11. Bought it used, no issues at all. Worn, but not abused. Two 10 round mags, both with extentions. Also still have the original flat baseplates.

375 for the .44

- Sightmark Red Dot sight plus standard open iron sights in top rail.  The rear sight folds down if you just want to use the red dot.  However, with the rear sight folded up, the red dot can be set up to co-witness with the standard iron sights.  That means the dot sits on the front sight post so both sets of sights can work together to give you an amazing sight picture.  Makes it much easier to get the shot you want especially at low light levels. You can see an example of how this looks in the picture.

614,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3004614,For Sale:  LARUE PREDATOBR 7.62 16' inch AR-10 *NEW* *NEVER FIRED*,"Old Town, Northern Virginia, Virginia","$ 3,500","Listed On: Monday, May 5, 2014",Rifles,Larue Tactical                                                                                ,308/7.62 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"LaRue Tactical PredatOBR™ 7.62 w/ OD Green Furniture. Cash only, no trades.
The PredatOBR 7.62 (AR-10) was designed for those who are searching for a hybrid cross between the standard OBR and PredatAR 7.62x51 Rifles. The PredatOBR takes the highly accurate OBR 7.62 design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least-possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. 

The most remarkable feature of the PredatOBR is its ability to be completely “broken down” and stored into the optional Rollup Bag and Toolbox. The PredatOBR handguard has a locking stainless steel QD Lever system on each side. Once the levers are released, the handguard slides off of the upper assembly in seconds. The PredatOBR's barrel can easily be removed with the supplied PredatOBR Barrel Wrench, unscrew the Barrel Nut from Receiver and pull the Barrel Assembly free from Receiver. No need to remove the gas tube, gas block or muzzle device. Reverse the process to reinstall. Hand-tighten Barrel Nut and torque approximately 1/8-turn past hand-tight (Approximately 40-50 foot pounds). Once reassembled correctly, the point of impact (POI) shift will be 0.0 to 0.5 MOA of the original.

PredatOBR barrels are chambered in 7.62x51mm, and feature rifling in a 1/10 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24. Like the OBR and PredatAR riles, LaRue has eliminated the conventional AR barrel nut and bolt the handguard directly to the proprietary upper receiver, creating a true “free-float” barrel. The handguard does not touch the barrel or barrel nut at any place. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though it has been lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. 

The PredatOBR has threaded stainless-steel hard-points over the entire length of the handguard at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions. These hard-points have an integral spine built-in for structural support. Provided with the system are three 3-inch MIL-STD-1913 rail sections that can be positioned anywhere along the handguard, per operator preference. These rail sections are attachable/detachable using a supplied tool (Torx® T-15 wrench). The rail sections are CNC-machined from billet aluminum. This robust solution provides a perfect precision mounting space for aiming lasers, illumination and bipods.

The PredatOBR's Port Selector Technology™ (PST) gas block is adjustable, to aid in the optimum function when using a sound suppressor. This special gas block contains a dual port mechanism that is operated by rotating a lever from one side to another. When the lever is rotated to the right-side of the rifle, the gasses are reduced, to compensate for the extra blowback created by the suppressor. When rotated to the left side, the gasses are increased for use without a suppressor.

The LaRue Tactical 6-position Retract Action Trigger (R.A.T.) Stock comes standard with every PredatOBR. It is ergonomic, has protected control surfaces and contains a set of cleaning rods in an internal compartment. Since the height of the 12 o’clock rail is at the optimum position, there is no need for a cheek riser as part of this system.

Suppressor Compatibility:
LaRue 7.62 rifles with Port Selector Technology (PST) have been optimized for best-performance with SureFire suppressors. We understand that there are dozens of 7.62 suppressors to choose from on the market at this time. We feel that SureFire suppressors fall somewhere in the middle-range in regards to effect of performance with gas-operated rifles. Many users have met with success operating different models of their choice. Combined with variables in ammunition, 7.62 suppressor owners have experienced a large spectrum of conditions (much greater than seen with 5.56 suppressors). This range of variables is easy to manage with a bolt-action 7.62, but with a gas-operated system it is not. While we made a concerted effort to design a gas system that will work with a wide range of suppressors, we can not guarantee proper-function with suppressor hardware other than SureFire.

About the “Black Gold” Trigger:
We are very proud to announce that we’ve selected the American Trigger Corporation AR Gold trigger to be installed in LaRue PredatOBRs going forward. These are a single stage trigger with take-up and a super short reset, similar in feel to a best-grade 1911 trigger, providing the optimum trigger action for a wide variety of shooting styles and disciplines. AR Gold Triggers have been used by some of the best competition shooters in the world for the last few years and dominate the top of the 3 Gun competition world. 

We have been testing and evaluating these triggers for well over a year, to ensure that they're up to our standard of quality. Our evaluation has shown the AR Gold to be magnificent and we're proud to include them as part of our new product line. One thing that is unusual about these triggers installed in our LaRue PredatOBRs, is they are treated with an IonBond black instead of American Trigger’s normal IonBond Gold. This is a custom color that is only available on LaRue Tactical rifles."

I bought this, put about 50 rounds through it and the spring failed. I took it back to the factory in Cocoa and they replaced the entire slide firing mechanism and all springs. The feed ramp was also polished. All internals were replaced with a redesigned version.

Has only about 150-200 rds thru it total. Some minor scratches or marks from being worn and holstered daily.

These are made right in Cocoa FL and they will take care of any issues you may encounter right on the spot with no questions asked. Great customer service!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

First I have an excellent condition Taurus pt-100 AFS. This model is all stainless steel, and an absolute beauty to shoot. With an extremely smooth trigger, dead on sights and absolutely reliable construction, This is the only full sized .40 cal you will ever need, and you can trust it with your life. No matter what ammo I put in it, it fired flawlessly every time, without exception. This will come with cardboard box, 1 11 round magazine, and one 15 round extended magazine. 400 rounds of winchester FMJ.

For the mid sized selection, I have a Taurus 24 7 9mm with stainless slide, and 2 17 round magazines. This gun comes with the hard case, cleaning rod, and keys for the taurus security system that will work on all 3 of these guns. The trigger on this gun is beautifully light in double and single action, and is another gun I would absolutely trust with my life and that of my family. I am also including 400 rounds of winchester fmj for this gun.

Finally, for the compact / carry option, I have probably my favorite compact I have ever fired (which I have 3 of) The pt 709 slim 9mm. This gun is in mint condition, and comes with 2 10 round magazines. The first two things I noticed about this pistol when I got the first one was how very light the recoil seemed for such a small polymer, and how ACCURATE it is, especially for such a small pistol and short sight radius. The trigger pull is very good and more than suitable for a carry gun. Its small size and single stack magazine make it an extremely easy to conceal and comfortable to wear firearm for any season. This gun is single action only, and features an ambidextrous safety. This gun will also include a hard case, and 400 rounds of winchester FMJ

All together the 3 guns will include 1,200 rounds of ammunition ( 800 9mm and 400 .40 cal), a set of keys, and the respective boxes. I would be willing to allow you to fire the guns before purchase, but only if you come to saddle creek gun range in lakeland on saturday, pay $10 for us to get in and bring your own ammo / targets. I'll let you fire 2 mags through each gun ( Im not trying to wear them out for test firing). most sellers would not allow this but I am willing to in interest of making the sale.
