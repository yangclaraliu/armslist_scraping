Since this is also made using an 1897 Sestroryetsk receiver, it adds a level of extreme rarity on top!  The ""Salerno Method"" barrel has good rifling and this is a functioning rifle, so it will shoot.  I single loaded about 20 rds through her when I first got the rifle, cleaned it and put her away.  The stock shows all the character that an old war horse should, while still remaining very nice.  It has an interesting 'splice' in it (see pics).  I have many additional pictures if you are interested.  Rifle is import marked, and it has all the correct Finn markings and is a forced matched rifle.  This is as good as it gets for Mosins!

It has the box and everything that came with it...2 mags, cleaning brush, manual, and lock out key.  Must be a KY resident and CCDW preferred!!

These Bulgarian Arsenal rifles have the distinction of being assembled overseas at the Bulgarian factory in Arsenal by their own technicians. The rifles are then imported here and have the furniture and trigger assemblies swapped out along with muzzle attachments to become 922r compliant. But the finish and assembly of the rifle is all factory done in Bulgaria. 

I do not know if this is still the practice today as I have been out of the AK scene for a while, but was still the practice when this rifle was made.

Less than 500 rounds through the rifle.
Some finish wear visible on the receiver, but nothing has gone through to the metal. 
Stock is firm and locks solid, (not that I have ever seen one come loose)
Missing the muzzle attachment, but is threaded to accept one. 
Acquired it a while back, but never used or fired it.

ONLY TRADES I WILL CONSIDER: 1911 WWII or WWI era, excellent condition Bulgarian or Russian military Makarov, quality AK variants, Excellent condition Remington Model 14 and model 8 in 35 Remington."

Upper and lower receivers: The rifles were produced by the Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) at Fort Benning, Georgia using either new semi-automatic ArmaLite lower receivers or existing Army M16A2 or A4 lower receivers previously supplied by either Colt or Fabrique Nationale de Herstal. All rifles were equipped with a fixed A2 stock and a Knight's Armament Company 2-stage match grade trigger capable of only semi-automatic fire. The upper receivers were flat-top style, but unlike the SAM-R and SPR, they did not have extended feed ramps.
Barrel: The 1:7 twist, 20-inch (510 mm) barrel from the M16A2 and A4 were replaced with a stainless steel Douglas Barrels 1:8 twist, 20-inch barrel, with 12 flutes cut into the barrel to reduce weight. The front sight block was installed with 4 set screws instead of two taper pins. The SDM-R retained the A2-style flash hider.
Sights and optics: The issued optic was a 4x32 Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) (models TA31F, TA31RCO, TA01, TA01B, or TA01NSN). A Matech Industries 600-meter backup iron sight was also used.
Handguard: Daniel Defense M4 Rail 12.0 handguard, with an octagonal aluminum collar locking it to the upper receiver. The handguard provides a free-floating Picatinny rail forend.
Bipod: A Harris S-L bipod attached to an ARMS #17 throw-lever rail mount was mounted to the underside of the handguard. Since the handguard was free-floating, it did not come into contact with the barrel, and any pressure from the bipod on the handguard did not deflect the barrel.

Only 50 rounds through for function and accuracy test. You will not be disappointed.

Everyone is selling load out bags and backpacks but this is a vest with drop leg attachments that will hold all your gear and supplies. Let's face it, when SHTF and in the worse case scenario you will only be able to take what you can carry. My rig offers the ability to carry all you gear and supplies in a one piece rig consisting of a tactical vest and drop leg attachments. You can still add a backpack to this configuration for even more cargo capability, but this configuration offers a load distribution that can be used as a stand alone option. Just grab and throw on and you are ready for whatever is thrown your way as long as you are properly prepared (I.E. survival skills, proper prep & supplies). In my experience it has always been a mobility issue in most survival situations. You can't take a department store or hospital with you when it is time to depart to safer or more secure area and you may not always be able to use transportation other than your own two feet. I will be posting detailed photos of this rig soon and am only posting this now to give people a heads up. I will offer the vest rig empty for $300. I will stock a vest per order depending on what a customer needs. This way if you have existing gear you would like to use, you can and just supplement what you don't. What I will offer will be a comprehensive First Aid Kit, Survival kit, Hydration  / Purification System and Shelter System that will be incorporated into the vest rig. I can include emergency food and water supplies if requested. I can also supply edged weapons such as knives, swords, axes and spears if a customer is interested. The vest is a cross draw holster type vest (right handed) so a pistol can be carried and a several pouches will be available for rifle mags also. I am looking into a left handed version.

This ammo is loaded in clean brass cases and has a FMJ bullet. The bullet jacket is a two part deal with a thicker steel inner jacket covered by a thin copper outer jacket. The bullet does attract a magnet because of the heavy steel inner jacket. Ammo is 100% surefire. It is corrosive primed so simply clean your gun after shooting and you will never have any issues.

I have not opened the 8 boxes that are for sale here, but similar ammo from open boxes had more recent production dates that were in the late 70's and early 80's while most of the other surplus 7.62 TOK ammo on the market today is from the 50's and 60's. 

This listing is for the 8 sealed 72 round boxes pictured. The loose rounds are from an open box and are not included in this listing.

Price is $200 which works out to just less than $.35 a round. SPORTSMAN GUIDE has this same exact ammo for sale as we speak for $569.00 a 1224 round can which works out to just over $.46 a round. So grab this quick as it's all I have left.

Local sale with pickup in the Brandon area, or I can ship for the actual UPS ground charges which will vary with the ""ship to"" address. I will pass on whatever the real cost is.

Unfortunately I won't ship to: AK, CA, CT, Chicago, DC, HI, MA, NJ, or NY. IL must provide copy of FOID card. You must be at least 21 to purchase this ammo and ID is required.

This is not a repair warranty, if you have problems then you get a new gun, not a repaired gun. You no longer have to wait 6 weeks for your gun to come back from the manufacturer and it may or may not be fixed. A great gun with a great warranty. The slide is stainless steal. This is the perfect conceal carry weapon for men or women. It is very lite and packs a slug the same diameter as a 38 special, 9mm or 357 magnum. It is powerful enough to stop about anyone in a hurry and yet only weighs 10.2 oz's. This gun fits perfect in a pocket holster or your back pocket. Women can loose it in their purse and that is why we have a beautiful raspberry one. Taurus did it right when they made this one and it works well with about any brand of ammo that you want to feed it. Work the slide one time and you are ready to fire 7 shots by just pulling the trigger 7 times. How simple can it get. Perfect protection for men and women. Oh! did I mention that it only weighs 10.2 ozs and is just over 5 inches long. Make way for the lightest Taurus ever created! The 10.2-ounce 738 TCP is not only the lightest semi-auto in the Taurus line; it's lighter than any of our small frame revolvers too!

Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em. 
The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken! 

Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver."

The SD variant of the Beretta PX4 Storm is the result of the U.S. military’s Joint Combat Pistol program of 2005. The premise behind this program was to replace the aging stock of M9 pistols currently in use with U.S. armed forces with a superior weapon. It stipulated that the weapon be chambered in .45 ACP, more resistant to salt spray be capable of mounting a sound suppressor and be capable of firing 5,000 rounds without failure. Furthermore, the replacement pistol should have a grip no larger than the standard M9, feature a low-glare finish and ideally be in FDE.

specs. The optically engineered apertures center your eyes instantly and effortlessly providing 

a clearer target picture than with round apertures.

The sights feature two settings, one for up to 300 meters and a second for up to 550 meters. 

This versatility makes the DOA ideal for military, law enforcement and home defense 

applications. These advanced sights have been extensively field-tested and, like all Troy 

Industries products, are BattleReady. Count on it.

NOTE:Sight is designed to work on same plane rail systems only. It will not work with a railed 

gas block that is higher or lower than the receiver but will work with our Gas block Front sights."

This is a beautiful AR15 built with top notch parts.  It functions perfectly and has only had 30 rounds put through it .  Specs/parts as follows:
Barrel: .223/5.56 spiral fluted 416 stainless steel H Bar 16” match barrel with 1:9 twist rate and .223 Wylde chamber and M4 feed ramps.
Flash suppressor/compensator:  Titan JP Michlek style stainless steel muzzle break and carbine length gas system. It stays right on target for your next shot.
Syrac Arms Gen II adjustable gas block.  This is a self locking “notched” adjuster type gas block and the newest one on the market.  No separate detent to hold down, no thread locking sealant required to keep it in position and only one hand needed to adjust it from the front.  The AR15 platform is known for being overgassed and this allows you to reduce the amount of pressure going to your bolt carrier if you choose to turn it down . 
CTS carbon fiber free float fore end/quad rail 9 ½” long
Anderson 7075 lower with colored pictograms and manufacturer highlights as well as an Anderson lower parts kit.
Nickel Teflon treated upper with dust cover door and forward assist.  This is some of the newest technology out for these black rifles.  Per the manufacturer this needs no lube and is good for 40,000 – 50,000 rounds without lubrication.  I lube it anyway…it can’t hurt.  It makes it real easy to clean too compared to anodized uppers.  
Nickel boron bolt carrier assembly.  Again…the newest technology parts.  Combined with the nickel Teflon treated upper it is a no lubrication needed assembly if you do not like to deal with lubricants.  Carbon cleans off it easily compared to anodized bolts. 
6 position adjustable stock. 
One Magpul 30 round windowed magazine included. 
Optics available at extra cost.
Located in Macomb Township near M59 and I94."
