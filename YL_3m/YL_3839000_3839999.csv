I bought this shotgun for home defense from Gander Mountain. It has had ~25 rounds through it, so is basically new - a safe queen. It functions flawlessley. I need to sell to pay down some debts.

This shotgun comes stock with a OEM black pistol grip stock - that is too long by a mile. I upgraded the stock with a Mesa Tactical pistol grip stock with a Limbsaver recoil pad (in OD green) and matching forend. This stock lets you put in spacers to adjust length of pull and is an essential upgrade. I also had installed an extended mag tube (to increase capacity to 7 shells). The mag tube is titanium and made by Carrier Comp and is considered the best of all of the available upgrade mag extensions and wait times for these are 3-6 months. It had a Wolff upgraded spring and follower installed with the extension. Stock on the gun was a small button bolt release that is not suitable for home defense/stress situations. I had a GG&G tactical bolt release pad installed, which makes the shotgun combat/HD-ready. Last is an Esstac Shotgun Card/Side saddle. This is way more versitile than the plastic sidesaddle shell carriers since they are easily removed and replaced to switch out ammo type (slugs, buck, etc). All in all, it is one of the best HD/Combat shotguns you can have in the present confuguration.

Upgraded bolt charging handle.The retracting bolt handle issued with the popular Benelli M1 Super 90, M2, M3 and Model 121 fighting shotguns is difficult to grasp during high stress shooting situations. Failure to retract the bolt handle completely could lead to a catastrophic malfunction. To prevent this, GG&G's engineering staff has designed one of the most practical Benelli shotgun accessories on the market. It is an oversized, knurled, rotating Benelli Tactical Charging Handle for the Benelli law enforcement series shotguns. Just remove the small factory retracting handle and replace it with GG&G's superior Benelli charging handle.

These Benelli tactical accessories are made from 4140 ordnance steel, heat-treated to Rockwell 45 C hardness and feature a matte black, mil-spec manganese phosphate finish."

That is what I intended to do with it when I bought it because I already owned another M&P .40 and loved the ergonomics of the gun.  If you have any questions at all, please text me at REDACTED.

Model 15 6"" barrel. Using the serial #s on the Dan Wesson website against other serial #s it looks like a 1979 or a 1980. I am not the original owner, I inherited this gun. The gun was kept in a hard case with foam interior. Judging by the condition it was probably fired once every few years with minimal wear and tear and put back in it's case. Selling the gun itself.

262,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3839262,For Sale:  348 Winchester Ammo and Brass,"Maple Valley, Seattle, Washington",$ 225,"Listed On: Thursday, January 8, 2015",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I am looking to sell some of my components for 348 Winchester. I have the following:

•	33 rounds of handloaded 348 Winchester (both Winchester and Remington headstamps). Powder charge is Hybrid 100V, 62.2-62.5 grains. Hodgdon’s book lists such a load as above maximum and compressed. These are not compressed charges. Loaded with Hornady 200 grain Interlock Flat Points. Price: $100

•	28 rounds of handloaded 348 Winchester (both Winchester and Remington headstamps). Powder charge is Hybrid 100V, 63.2-63.4 grains. These charges are not compressed, but are quite hot. I fired them in my Browning model 71 safely, but some extracted with some stickiness. This is indicative of a hot load. Loaded with Hornady 200 grain Interlock Flat Points. Price: $80

•	49 fired brass (both Winchester and Remington headstamps) that have been resized, deprimed, and cleaned in my sonic cleaner. 8 additional fired brass that have not been sized/deprimed/cleaned yet. 6 rounds of handloads. I have personally fired these loads, and they are quite light (about 2200 fps with 200 grain bullets). Price: $55

The above prices do not include shipping. I would be happy to ship, at the buyer’s expense. The ammo is packaged in old cardboard ammo boxes. These boxes are not in nice condition; they are worn and torn, but serve the purpose only of containing the fun part of shooting (ammo). The brass will be packaged in gallon ziplock bags. Additionally, the brass is not overly shiny. As they are not all of matching headstamps, some cases are more tarnished while some are more shiny.

I have shot these various loads in my gun without issue, but I make no guarantee that the same is true in your gun. As every gun is different, it is impossible for me to make any guarantees with regard to safety of this ammo in your gun. However, I will tell you that they all shot fine in my gun (with any notable trends described above). I recommend safe practices while shooting this ammo, because what is safe in my gun is not necessarily safe in yours. I have described exactly the loads used in these handloads, so it is up to you to decide if they are safe in your gun. I take no responsibility for the use of this ammo. I am selling all of this as is, with no warranty or returns expressed or implied.

If the buyer would like to purchase the entire lot, I will sell it all for $225.

Fires, cycles, shoots perfectly. Very clean chamber, inside the barrel and rifling look great. Has a one-piece pistol-grip synthetic stock. Rubber hand grip added as well as the textured padding on the fore-grip.

Has a really nice feeling trigger.  I've had a couple mini's before and their triggers felt grainy and seemed heavy.  This is really nice and crisp.  The mag snaps into place really well also, unlike some that I've had to fight with on Mini's.

I took off the heavy and clunky rail system that it had and cleaned it all up and the gun looks quite nice as seen in the pictures. Rail system is CTG made for a mini and comes with the gun. Buyer can keep it or sell it. Sorry, only have the one magazine for it, but it is new.

This rifle is light and well-balanced. Ready for whatever the new owner wants to do with it (rail and regular scope), put back on the rail system and use a red dot, or just keep it as is and use the peep/iron sights.

It cleaned up so nice and looks so much better without that rail on there, I'm wishing I hadn't lowered the price to $490. But that is where it is.

Item Description:
The XD® 5” Full Size is designed to put the most into your hand when you need it. Built on a full-size frame with a 5” barrel, this is the XD® that delivers the most in performance, capacity and controllability. Whether you’re looking for a pistol for the nightstand or the shooting range, the XD® 5” Full Size will do the job.

The XD® 5” Full Size has all the same features found in the standard XD® line in a tactically-sized package. This XD® is as easy to shoot as you would expect it to be. The 5” barrel brings you a longer sight radius and decreased shot-to-shot recovery time. The advantages don’t stop with easy shooting, though – the XD® 5” Full Size includes everything that makes Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block give you the safety and usability that you expect in a Springfield Armory® XD®.

The Benelli M2 Field is the workhorse of the semi-auto Benelli shotguns, giving you Benelli performance with the speed of a thoroughbred. Light, nimble, but ruggedly built, the M2 shotgun is built around the ultra-reliable Inertia Driven® mechanism. This proven system allows the M2 to digest nearly any cartridge, from 2-3/4'' target loads to the heaviest 3'' magnums. Benelli engineers have also adapted the ComforTech® recoil system for the M2 to reduce felt recoil by up to 48% and cut muzzle climb by 15%. This combination puts the shooter back on target up to 69% faster than comparable semi-automatic shotguns. The M2 is not only faster, but with the ComforTech system, it may be the most comfortable shotgun you will ever shoot."

I bought this new and love it. I have shot 410 slugs and buckshot as well as many different kinds of 22LR from it with never one misfire. 
Both the 22LR and 410 shoots straight.
I took the trigger guard off but still have it if who ever buys this wants to put it back on. 
I preferred it folding tighter when packing it.
I put some leather on the lower barrel so my hand would not get hot when shooting it. Only really needed this when I was shooting skeet.

This is a super cool gun that is no longer made.

The Saiga-12 self-loading smooth bored shotgun is intended for professional and sport hunting of small-and medium-size game under any climatic conditions.

This shotgun is built on the famous AK-47 action that has been proven by years of very reliable combat action!

The shotgun comes with 12-ga. smooth bored barrel and the chamber which accepts the ammo equipped with shot or slugs including ""Magnum"" cartridges with
70mm (2-3/4"") and 76 mm (3"") cartridge case.

The shotgun is used to deliver single shots. It is reloaded automatically due to the energy of powder combustion gases bled from the barrel bore through the barrel port. The shotgun may be equipped with a sight leaf adjustable for windage and elevation, which makes zeroing and firing at moving targets more convenient. The gas motive unit is adjustable to match the parameters of internal ballistics inherent to the standard cartridges and ""Magnum"" cartridges, as well. For the purpose of diversifying operational capabilities the shotgun may be equipped with muzzle adapters of different chokes, including the muzzle adapter ""Paradox"". (IZHMASH)

Rear sight removed and dovetail filled with proper filler block (from Midway). Also includes a set of Lee .45 Colt dies, 100 .45 Colt unfired cases, 100 unfired .454 Casull cases, about 150 .45 colt cases that have been fired several times. The rifle has a Gunslinger Trigger installed (1.5 pounds) and the action is butter smooth. This rifle won the Texas State Lever Action Silhouette Class “A” Match in September. The stock has been refinished with TruOil and a Concho has been added to the right side of the stock – for decoration only, and is not removable. Comes in factory box with factory sights and trigger in a bag – in case you want to return it to factory original. The rifle has never been used for hunting – range and silhouette matches only. In case you were wondering .45 Colt and .454 Casull are like .38 Special and .357 mag – you can shoot the Colt in the Casull, but not the other way around - .454 is similar to .45-70 energy levels.
Not for sale – for trade only. I would like to trade this rifle for a Marlin 39A. I value the Rossi around $750 – the Marlin needs to be the same quality. AND, the Marlin needs to be a ""JM"".  Questions welcome."

This particular Grizzly was made in 1995 (SN CGZ761) and it has been fired but still in great shape at 95% condition. Sadly, the box was not kept for this estate gun as the owner had no idea in 1996 when he purchased it that it would be worth so much money.

What I am offering is to do any work you need done on your ar15 or build one for you from the parts of your choice. If you are completely new to this platform I can help guide you through the whole process. I can help you decide on the quality components that fit your budget and your needs. This is a great time to discover America's most popular rifle. Prices have finally come down, and you can save a lot of money by building your AR over buying one already assembled.

Need to swap out the plastic handguards for a nice free floating railed handguard? Need to replace a barrel? Want to convert to a gas piston system? Or perhaps you just need to install a new trigger. Contact me with your needs and I will see if I can help you out.

Labor costs:
1) Lower receiver complete build: $49
2) Upper receiver complete build (direct impingement or gas piston) : $49
3) Complete AR build (lower + upper): $85
4) Miscellaneous (trigger replacement, handguard replacement etc.): contact for details

Any build includes test firing at the range. Included with an AR build is an optional introductory session to familiarize you with all the controls and basic handling skills.

It is mounted in a Burris PEPR.  The mount and zoom lever would cost ~$160 combined.  

I bought this new in the fall and have only shot 40 rounds through it. All ammo shot through it was Federal Gold Medal Match 168grain SMK's.

Accuracy was very good. At the time I was shooting with the stock trigger, which was standard mil-spec. I have since put a Rock River 2 stage National Match trigger in it, but have not taken it to the range since. It is a great trigger, and should tighten up groups nicely. The pic of the two groups was 100 yards, BEFORE the new trigger. This is a very nice rifle.

All stock great bullpup that shoots well and is short and handy takes all ar15 magazines.
Its a neat gun and my overall plan was to have a short rifle that didn't fall into the sbr category. You can cut the barrel down to 16in pin on a flash hider and have a rifle that is 26.1 inches. The pic taken next to my ar is to show how short it can go where the flash hider is sitting would be at 26.1 in. My rifle is a pinned 14.5in barrel with the stock one notch out. The rifle has is with a 21.5in barrel and flash hider mounted is the same length as my pinned 14.5 rifle. You can flattop it add rails and do pretty much whatever you like good resource is  http://www.kmaerospace.com/M17s.shtml .

700,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3839700,For Sale/Trade:  2001 Ford F250 Super Duty 7.3 Turbo Diesel Trade for guns and ammo,"Central, Las Vegas, Nevada","$ 7,000","Listed On: Monday, January 5, 2015",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale or trade is my 2001 Ford F250 Super Duty with the unstoppable 7.3 Turbo Diesel in it.

The truck is in great condition and has less than 200k miles, which for a Diesel is just fantastic, it was a fleet vehicle for most of its life and its job was to carry those construction lights you see set up, deliver tools and as well as diesel to other trucks, it was never ran for hours on end and had a pretty easy going life for a work truck. Has manual everything, windows, doors, seat, so nothing is electric to mess up or be over complicated.

The good;

Truck has low miles and has been well taken care of, all fluid changes on time since it was driven off the lot, recently changed the fuel filter

Had an alternator put in that is less than 6 months old at this point

Air gets ice cold fast, and heat gets as hot as you want just as quickly.

This is my daily driver at this point (about 40 miles a week, 90% are highway)

Has a big metal bumper and towing package so you can hook whatever you want to it and it will pull it, boats, cars, toys, houses.

Large chest in the back for putting stuff in

Spare fuel tank with electric pump, all in working order, at one point I filled it up when I was able to snag some very cheap diesel but don't really use it since then.


The bad

Still has its ugly shortbus yellow paint job from working for the city, a bit of decal is still on the truck and it could use some cleaning up.

Key to the chest is lost, its unlocked so it can still be opened and closed, just not locked. I think it would be 10$ or so for new locking cylinders

Both rear tires will need to be replaced in the next year, the tires are in good shape but the tread has been worn down quite a bit.

The truck chugs at times, I am not sure if this is the fuel pump or possibly the cps since those failed on these every so often, either way I have been too lazy to replace either since my big jack stands and jack are under a whole bunch of crap in the garage, and I am too fat to fit under the truck while its just stting. I do happen to have a spare CPS sensor, it will come with the truck and for anyone who isn't lazy and fat will be a 10 min job to replace

Ding in the front of the hood and the grill, could be fixed up but isn't really a big deal at all

The rest of the body is straight and good to go aside from normal dinks and such over it's life, but nothing really bad as it never did a huge amount of work.

My plan for it was actually to take all the guts out of the truck completely leaving it a shell, and stuffing them into an old ford bronco body and building everything up from there, unfortunately I don't know if I am getting too old and fat too fast but I really just have lost the care to do that, I am going to sell this truck along with my other truck and probably pick up a ""luxury"" suv or crossover, something for me to simply cruise in. Though I suspect at some point I will cave and buy another diesel, after driving them for so many years you can't really take the quiet of gasser motors.

Anyway thats most of the info I can think of offhand, if you have any other questions or want to see the truck just let me know

And unfortunately the 7000 is not negotiable that is what I will accept in cash for this truck at any given time, if I decide to accept less then I will alter the ad to show it, but if I don't get the truck sold before its registration runs out, I will probably just park it in the backyard and wonder what to do with it for a few years.

Merry Christmas."

It fit an AR 15.
Got this Magazine with my Mini 14 when I bought it several months ago,
just found out it won't my mini 14, someone told me it might fit a Ruger SR556, or even an AR15.
Would love to trade it for a 10 round or 20 round mini 14 magazine.
It will not fit in my mini 14, I even pulled the receiver apart, without the stock on it, it still won't even try to fit, it is just a little bit bigger than my other mini 14 mags, the guy I bought the mini 14 from says it may fit a SR556, but he don't have his SR556 anymore, so we can not try it. 
I am trying to trade it to someone that can use it, for one that I can use in my Mini 14.
