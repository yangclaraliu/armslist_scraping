Top Rifle: This rifle was put together by Surplus Ammo & Arms in Tacoma, and is an excellent shooter. The upper is SAA with 16"" free-floated stainless steel barrel with lightweight profile, and a MI 11"" freefloating handguard with rail on top that mates up perfectly with the receiver. The handguard has tapped holes that allow accessories or rail sections to be added easily and securely. The lower receiver is also made by SAA, and I swapped out a ALG QMS nickle plated trigger for the absolute best mil-spec trigger I've ever shot. Other accessories include an extended tactical latch charging handle, MFT Battlelink Minimalist buttstock with QD Sling points,  Hogue pistol grip, and receiver endplate with quick attach loop for sling.
Optics - on top is a Vortex Viper HS 2.5-10x44 with the Dead Hold BDC reticle & 30mm tube. This scope has an unconditional lifetime warranty that is transferable, and not limited to the original owner. It is sighted in dead on at 200yds. It comes with a screw on sunshade (not shown in picture), and I still have the original box it came in. The scope is mounted in Warne all steel 30mm rings. Warne makes all of their rings in the USA.

Bottom Rifle: This rifle is a great optics ready carbine. The upper is a Bushmaster factory upper with 16"" chrome lined barrel and lightweight profile. It has a fixed mil-spec front sight on it, and I swapped the furniture out for some Magpul furniture and vertical pistol grip. I have a Diamond rear sight that is on at 100yds.

Both of which seemed real interested in this Colt but had nothing worth trading. I did learn that after WWII Argentina was producing these model 1911 handguns using Colt machinery and under Colts name for they're Army and Navy. This one is pre WWII. Supposedly Colt made these in the US issuing them to foreign countries usually for the police or armed forces. It has no issue firing and one of the gun shop owners who took it apart stated its in good condition for its age. Original bluing. I'm looking for two things. A more modern pistol as this gun belongs in more firearm educated hands. Specifically looking for long barrel revolvers. No 22s. I'm also looking for another motorcycle. Preferably in working order and title under your name.

I purchased a Daniel Defense M4A1 Complete Rifle and I took off this rail to put a different one on it. This rail has never had anything mounted on it and is 100% Mint Condition Factory New! It comes with the items pictured(Rail in FDE, Hardened Steel Barrel Nut, 3 Rail Ladders, Grade 8 Military Specification Fastener Screws, Bolt Up Back Plate in FDE). This Daniel Defense Rail Interface System (RIS II) was designed at the request of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) and is currently being supplied to these Special Operations Units. 

No Trades Please.

FROM THE MANUFACTURER:

Daniel Defense is the Sole Source Provider of the RIS II to the United States Special Operations Command!

 The Daniel Defense Rail Interface System (RIS II) was designed at the request of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for the SOPMOD II program. SOCOM had a specific requirement for a free float M203 solution and Daniel Defense responded, designing a revolutionary product to meet the government’s need. The Daniel Defense RIS II allows the individual operator to free float the M203 grenade launcher without additional parts. As importantly, special tools are not required to mount the M203 grenade launcher. This was accomplished by integrating all of the needed parts to free float the M203 into the rail itself. The Daniel Defense RIS II is to be used in conjunction with the MK12 Low Profile Gas Block.

 The Daniel Defense RIS II free-floating Picatinny rail systems are designed to allow individual operator to quickly, and without special tools, mount M203 Grenade Launcher and precisely mount SOPMOD accessories to host weapon without effecting point of impact. The Daniel Defense RIS II is an innovative upgrade to the M4 platform and is available for commercial purchase directly from Daniel Defense or any authorized distributor.

The raging bull is not your average taurus. Supposedly there was some extra care taken in manufacturing this revolver. I would honestly put the finish up there with any smith. It's not a colt ""Snake gun"" but damn fine finish.  The front barrel ""vents"" completely prevent muzzle flip. The best way I can describe the recoil is a FIRM push.  The grip (although ugly) makes it extremely comfortable to shoot.

I acquired it in the Fall of 2013, primarily for home defense purposes.  It is accurate and has become easier to shoot accurately since replacement of the sear spring.  It was thoroughly cleaned before first use and after each range session.  My spouse and I have fired 290 rounds of LAX 180 gr FMJ and 50 rounds of Fiocchi 170 gr FMJ through it with no malfunctions.  My spouse finds the recoil too much for her, so we are looking to replace it with a smaller caliber, steel or alloy frame, hammer-fired semi-automatic pistol or a semi-automatic carbine which will be easier for her to manage.

Also to be included are 210 of rounds LAX 180 gr FMJ RNFT ammunition and 50 rounds of Fiocchi 170 gr FMJ truncated cone ammunition."

Features a 5 ½” barrel with brass blade front sight, blackened back strap and unfinished brass trigger guard, and an uncut-for-shoulder stock steel frame. Frame is stamped CD, indicating 2009 year of manufacture. This gun was only shot a few times and was well cared for – not a mark on the barrel wedge, good action and timing, good barrel/cylinder gap, and the nipples remove easily from the cylinder. A real nice gun for the woods given its short barrel length, or for making smoke at the local range. I’ve got more pieces now than I can shoot during the year and this one doesn’t fit into the collection so it’s up for grabs. Price is $200 shipped Priority Mail to your location; Money Order, Bank Check, or personal check (personal check must clear before shipping). No trades, and please don’t ask me if I’ll take one hundred dollars for it. Serious inquiries must include your name and address. While this type of arm can be sent to almost anywhere in the U.S., there are a few urban locations that are prohibited so if Cabela’s or any other major chain can’t ship you a black powder arm, neither can I. Inquires submitted during the work week may take a half a day or so to get answered – the weekend I’m a bit faster - so please be patient."

Starts with Colt AR 15 223/5.56 Nato with all papers and boxes.          

If you want just the rifle the way it looks in pic, I'm asking $1100 obo.  The price for the whole package is below after what it includes.

You can email me for add'l pics and I can email you back or I can text them.....You can also text me, my number is at bottom of listing.



This set up has just about everything you could want for a very basic bug out kit.  It has a waterproof Pelican hard case with wheels ($250-400 value), quadrail ($150 value), FDE sling and Adapter ($70-80), cleaning kit, vertical grip ($39), low profile rail covers ($50) Camillus survival kit (fire starters and such),  Camillus Multi-tool, large fixed blade Camillus Les Stroud survival knife, led flashlight ($60), military compass, first aid kit, emergency drinking water, emergency food rations, and a waterproof map pouch. All are brand new and never used. I think I listed everything.  (All in total with rifle and extras the value is around $2000)  

Mags not included unless full price offer, pink stuffed dog definitely not included, kids would be upset :)



Retails for $1699 plus tax at best price I've seen, average retail is $1850 plus tax.




Must be Fl Resident, Non Felon.  Cash only or Cash plus trade.....no shipping unless you want to pay extra but this set up is heavy and probably expensive to ship.



I'm asking $1550 for all that you see in pkg and no taxes too. You must be able to meet me in Clermont, West Orlando, Groveland or Four Corners......I cant travel any further unless Im heading in to Orlando for an appt which is not to often.



Trades I might consider are new or like new High quality AR in .308 ,  possibly ar 5.56 if piston, AR 15 name brand with high end optics. Mulitiple GLocks, Glocks plus cash, Sig P238 in FDE or Desert or Scorpion and other handguns I might consider plus cash but must be new or like new and not junk brands.  I really only would consider other hand guns in 1911 only if it was a great deal for me as I would likely sell it later, but would still need cash on top, I cant do even trade, sorry.  I might be interested in New in Box nice optics like eotech, aimpoint, trijicon or similar plus weapons or cash.  Also could consider a little ammo on trade too. .308,5.56, 223, 9mm, 45 or 22lr



Please don't waste our time with full retail on your gun as I'm not asking full retail, I can just keep this and sell it whenever someone is willing to pay a reasonable amount.  I value NEW unfired Glocks at $450-525 depending on model and features, I dont need 6 holsters with it and 20 mags, I'll take them but I cant give them much value since I dont need them.  No  offense, but I have plenty of all of that.   



407-701-41 zero zero text only, dont call, I can't speak to everyone that wants to chat........we can come to an agreement on email or text and then we will definitely speak before meeting. I apologize for all the lengthy details, but I've dealt with lots of unique people on here and just trying to cover everything up front. 

 Last, again, no offense.....but if you can get this cheaper elsewhere, I don't need to know about it, thank you for your time and consideration."

Springfield Armory® XD-S™ Centerfire Pistols

Perfect for compact, concealed carry
Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System
Loaded-chamber indicator
Single-position Picatinny rail
Available in 3.3"" and 4""
To create the XD-S Centerfire Pistols, Springfield Armory took the best innovations of the award-winning XD Series and trimmed down the frame to a perfect size for compact, concealed carry. Metal parts on each gun are forged and machined from billet with utmost precision. Fully hammer-forged barrels enhance accuracy. Corrosion-resistant finishes are either super-hard black Melonite® or classic bead-blasted stainless steel. The Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied. Loaded-chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. Grip safety allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. A more pronounced texture on the XD-S ensures your grip is always secure. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size with this feature. The XD-S trigger has a short travel along with a short reset, which keeps you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots. The low-profile rear sight is holster friendly. Fiber-optic front sight promotes easier and faster target acquisition. Customize your grip with two interchangeable backstraps. Includes rugged carry case, paddle holster, double magazine pouch, two interchangeable backstraps, two magazines, cable lock, bore brush and safety manual

These go for $1100, I'm asking $950 OBO

Here are the spec's from Adams Arm's site

The 5.56 Midlength Tactical Evo 16"" Upper is a standard mil-spec upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured for us by Samson Manufacturing and is a 12"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.
