Ruger, etc. Not exactly looking for a 1911 but I will consider one.

I would really like to get a Sig P220 or a P227, but I don't have a lot of money
to spend. I can't spend $600 though, it's just not in my budget. I can get a used
P220 or P227 for around $500 so if you're going to offer me one it should be as
close to that price as you can get, otherwise I just can't buy it. Either one of these
is really at the top of my list.

I'm looking to spend around $400 but will consider going up on the price depending
on the gun. If you can include an IWB holster made for that gun or some amom that
would be very helpful as well. 

I would need to be able to make payments or make a deal that the seller will not sell

WHAT IS THE PDA?

The patent pending PDA-Personal Defense Accessory holster addresses the inherent disadvantages of other concealed carry strategies.

Anything that reveals the shape or any part of the weapon must be covered from view, usually with a coat or shirttail. Cases or bags provide access with a zipper or other closure, causing the user to have to “make ready” by getting the case open. The trigger may be exposed inside the bag increasing the possibility of an accidental discharge when making the draw. Other carry choices must be worn inside or underneath clothing that has to be removed or disengaged to get into action. Any of these concealed carry methods can be uncomfortable, slow, or unsafe. Some are all three. The PDA is quick, safe, and comfortable. Our users tell us the time to first shot is as fast as from a thumb break holster, typically under 1.5 seconds. Tuck your shirttail in, take your jacket off or wear shorts when it’s hot. Carry heat and still be cool. PDA-Personal Defense Accessory."

 I am willing to sell the scope and the rifle separately, in this case the price will be firm, rifle will be 500 and the scope will be 200.  that's 150 off the rifle and 60 off the scope.
 I also have the spent brass from the 60 rounds that I bought for it when I bought the rifle, I will those in to if you reload. nine07 9five3 zero9 seven9"

Looked at a Hi Power found its safety to not work allowing the hammer to fall and hit the firing pin while on safe I brought it  to the owners attention who dismissed it as normal operation and took it out back for ""work"" found it out in the case the next day still with a broken safety at the same price with no cautionary note guess they don't mind a serious safety issue so again I made then aware and its out back again wouldnt trust a repair by them having to admitted to using YouTube for repair info a couple years ago. So looked at a reasonably priced Glock found a hairline fracture on the slide rail owner again quick to dismiss it put it back in the case wile saying ""its a Glock its fine"" although another employee confirmed the crack. Also the same day overheard ""its got a broken ----- "" (wish I heard what) followed by ""I'll still make money"" from the owner. As you can see these people could care less about your personal safety and would rather make a huge profit. So take the time bring a bore light, magnifying glasses and familiarize yourself with what your looking for so you too can spot the accident waiting to happen. Hope this helped because I'm probably goin to be banned from @#$%&%$#@#$% cause if they read this they know who wrote it. Oh and if you think thats all I have I could write for days and this is just one dealer!  Wish I took pictures to email to the BBB. Didn't want to mention the name but if any concerned buyers especially in the south shore/coast area have any questions please ask. Again look close some (most) will always put profit before people. Did however find a nice firearm with no obvious flaws but after their lack of concern could not bring myself to buy it not knowing what could be beneath its cosmetically good exterior and on top certain employes attitudes made me decide I would rather pay more elsewhere.

Would recommend Hunters Trading Post that do look at firearms before sale and have been told what was replaced on certain firearms before sale a little more pricey but never brought something home that needed parts or work."

As you can see in the pics, the 27 is FDE and the other two are black. They are all in excellent shape and have everything that came from the factory with them.  They all have the 3 mags, papers, case, etc.  I do have a Pearce Extension on one of the Glock 27 magazines.  I also have between 600 and 700 rounds of .40 ammo.  Mostly Federal FMJ but I also have some PPU FMJ as well as some assorted Critical Duty and Speer Gold Dot Hollow Points.  
In terms of price, I am not going to be one of those guys on armslist that jacks up the price for a used Glock for more than the retail.  With that said, I am also not going to just give these away.  I would like to stay in the 480-500 range for each gun.  I am willing to split up and sell the guns individually but I will be open to reasonable offers for the whole package as well.  If you do buy everything, or most of the package ill even throw in my .40 Hoppe’s boresnake along with everything else.  I am also willing to work some deals with the ammo thrown in.  Remember these are Gen  4’s here all in excellent shape. If you do not have a valid Carry License I will ask you sign a bill of sale.  I will update this posting as I need to if I sell the guns individually.  TEXT or EMAIL I can’t take phone calls at work so please don’t try.  Nine 1 eight 6 zero 6 one five 6 2

Not interested in parting out the rifle , mag's , or Drum at this time. All or none.

Rifle with everything and the 250 rounds of TULammo...... 890.00

Tulammo (250 Rounds Mixed FMJ/ and HP) . $60.00

Wolf ammo will be calculated at .21 cent a round... 500=105.00 1000=210.00 and will only break into half or whole .. no individual boxes or 250 packs.

Not sure how I did it with 10,000 rounds, I haven't even put many hp through it . But I don't shoot it anymore so I've factored a new barrel and new recoil
Spring into the asking price .Also , the rifling looks perfect . Typically you'll see a dark spot where the bulge is located but the rifling looks brand new which leads me to think there was some sort of defect in the barrel to cause it to  start to fail
Prematurely . I had a gunsmith friend of mine look it over and even felt confident enough in the barrels integrity to shoot it . He said it was fine and had plenty of life but I'm not interested in screwing anyone over so I'm listing everything that could possibly be a problem .
( the rifling is perfect so I'm not sure what's going on with the barrel but I don't shoot it anymore and I'm not interested in putting anything else into it )
It's in good condition other than than the mentioned problems . Some small scratches in the finish as well

I'm looking to trade my AR15 for something else. I bought it this summer so my GF had an AR and she isn't a fan of anything besides my .22 rifle. Shot the rifle about 60-100 times and functioned fine with the Remington UMC .223, PMC, Federal, and Black Hills match ammo I shot. It grouped fairly nice at 50 yards and was content with the accuracy. The specs for the rifle are as follows:

-MPI BCG Semi Auto Profile
- Thor Industries Barrel, Carbine length gas system that is Government profile
- CMMG Lower with A2 style stock, Troy Ambi Bolt release, Magpul MOE+ grip and KAC winter trigger guard.
-Free float tube that looks to be DPMS
- PWS FSC 556 muzzle brake (I can replace this with an A2 if you want)
- USA flag enlarged rear takedown pin
-Nickel Boron Extended Charging handle


The rifle has is hydrodipped in Snake skin and it is professionally done and is even throughout the rifle. This can be removed from what I understand fairly easy with the right tools but from my use of the rifle it seems hard to scratch off.

This Python has been fired approximately 30 times with both 357 and 38cal. ammunition. The Bore is bright and shiny, Rifling is crisp and clear. This Gorgeous Python is a perfect example of the skilled craftsmanship at Colt when they produced one of the finest revolvers ever manufactured. The Colt Python was first introduced in 1955 as Colt's top-of-the-line model. As a result, it features precision adjustable sights, a smooth trigger, solid construction, and extra strong frame. Pythons have a distinct appearance due to a full barrel under lug, ventilated rib and adjustable sights. If you have any questions, feel free to ask, I will try to be as accommodating as possible"

 BCM KMR-10


Bravo Company’s KeyMod™ Rail, 10”


Manufactured from an exclusive blended aluminum and magnesium alloy, it weighs 30-40% less than aluminum with the same strength properties. Also featuring a proprietary patent pending mounting, indexing and lock up system that mitigates 12:00 rail movement under heat generated from the barrel nut.


Handguard alone weighs 4.1oz!

1.3” Inner Diameter

1.5” OUTSIDE flat to flat.
Handguard flares forward (towards muzzle end) at the 3 and 9 O'clock positions approximately 1/4""

The KMR’s propriety finish was originally developed for the Aerospace industry. It is a plasma deposition process which creates a stabilized ceramic-like surface coating with superior wear resistance when compared to anodize or even hard chrome. The stabilized nature of the coating means it has a higher corrosion resistance as well, due to the lack of ‘pores’ in the surface.


The KeyMod™ interface system was developed by Eric Kincel (now the Director of BCMs' product development team) to work in parallel with the current picatinny system. In many applications it will advance modularity past the current 1913 rail system.


The BCM KMR also allows for a larger range of modularity offering 4 different offset mounting positions between traditional 3,6,9, and 12:00 positions.


In the most basic of applications the KeyMod™ system allows for universal modularity between various manufacturers of accessories, and accessory rails. A big win for the trigger puller. As the industry advances the modular accessories will mount directly to the KeyMod™ instead of picatinny, allowing for a lighter, cleaner, and less bulky weapon system."

The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular).  KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled.  The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense.  The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets.  This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire.  An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights.  The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

962,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3773962,For Sale:  BCM KMR13 (KeyMod™ Free Float Handguard) (NEW),"Howell, Michigan, United States",$ 300,"Listed On: Friday, January 2, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"YOU CAN BUY THIS HERE>BCM KMR13 (KeyMod™ Free Float Handguard) 

BCM KMR-13


Bravo Company’s KeyMod™ Rail, 13”


Manufactured from an exclusive blended aluminum and magnesium alloy, it weighs 30-40% less than aluminum with the same strength properties. Also featuring a proprietary patent pending mounting, indexing and lock up system that mitigates 12:00 rail movement under heat generated from the barrel nut.


Handguard alone weighs 5.5oz!

1.3” Inner Diameter

1.5” OUTSIDE flat to flat.
Handguard flares forward (towards muzzle end) at the 3 and 9 O'clock positions approximately 1/4""

The KMR’s propriety finish was originally developed for the Aerospace industry. It is a plasma deposition process which creates a stabilized ceramic-like surface coating with superior wear resistance when compared to anodize or even hard chrome. The stabilized nature of the coating means it has a higher corrosion resistance as well, due to the lack of ‘pores’ in the surface.


The KeyMod™ interface system was developed by Eric Kincel (now the Director of BCMs' product development team) to work in parallel with the current picatinny system. In many applications it will advance modularity past the current 1913 rail system.


The BCM KMR also allows for a larger range of modularity offering 4 different offset mounting positions between traditional 3,6,9, and 12:00 positions.


In the most basic of applications the KeyMod™ system allows for universal modularity between various manufacturers of accessories, and accessory rails. A big win for the trigger puller. As the industry advances the modular accessories will mount directly to the KeyMod™ instead of picatinny, allowing for a lighter, cleaner, and less bulky weapon system."
