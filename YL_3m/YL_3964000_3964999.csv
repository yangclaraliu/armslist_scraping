Everything is brand new and has only seen about 50 rounds before being replaced with a scope for hunting:

Primary Arms Gen. III 6x Magnifier - $75 (was $99)
Flip-to-Side Mount - $35 (was $49)
Magpul Gen.II MBUS Flip-Up Iron-Sights (Front & Rear) in Foliage Green - $60 (was $90)
Bushnell TRS25 Red-Dot - $80 (was $149)
UTG .83"" Picatinny Riser - $10 (was $15)
______________________________________________________________________
This setup is a great short-to-mid-range tactical setup, and with the red dot on a .83"" riser, it gives absolute co-witness. If the need arose, you can quickly switch to a short-range setup by simply cocking the magnifier to the side and using either the red dot alone, or with flip up iron sights as co-witness.
______________________________________________________________________
The Primary Arms Flip-to-Side mount is tough as nails and very smooth. It mounts to any picatinny/weaver rail and tightly grips the magnifier all in one solid piece.
______________________________________________________________________
If you run this, I would recommend using flip up iron sights to keep them out of the way. I have Foliage Green Magpul Gen.II MBUS Flip-Up BUIS's.

It's all numbers matching except for the bayonet but that's pretty normal. The stamping on the receiver is fairly light, but you can still make everything out and all the other numbers are very deep. Very good shooter, the bore is dark but still has sharp rifling and is as accurate as I can be. I do still have the box for this rifle I believe. Also has the sling, 3 ammo pouches, and tool kit.

Next up is a 1946 Izzy M44. This rifle is beautiful. All numbers match and are easily visible. Bore is nice and shiny with sharp rifling. This thing shoots true though I will say the bolt is just a touch sticky.

I also have 872 rounds of 7.62x54r ammo to go with the guns. 440 in a sealed spam can, 340 in 20 rd paper packages (from a previously open spam can), 34 rds of wolf, and 58 rds of loose surplus. I also am including 20 stripper clips to the first person who wants them. I WILL NOT SEPARATE THE AMMO OUT, unless the guns go first and the buyers don't want the ammo.

If you love Kimber (Who doesn't?) Then you know what a series one is and how cool they are. For the uneducated, the Series one differs in from many of the series 2 guns because it does not have the schwarz safety. You covet a Colt Series 70s? The Kimber series 1 are like that.. 

This is the most boring 1911 of all time. Works first time. Works every time, and it puts small holes in the target. The picture of the target I have included is 54 rounds, it could have been wayy better, I am sure, but, like I said, I got bored, which lends to creative aiming techniques. I thought it was cool that it kinda looked like a skull, however

This particular gun is from 1999 and has the Yonkers Roll mark. (not Clakamas, sorry, and if did say that, it would never leave my safe)

Round count is low, based on the wear. The slide to frame fit is tight as is the bbl/bushing.  I do not have the original clamshell. I will include a Plano Protector case, however. 

I don't really want to see this, but I have another project that needs funding. 

Gun does have some holster wear, it was in (and out) of a holster for 16 years) If the finish bugs you, you can have it bead blasted here in Houston for $179.00, and at my price, it will STILL be a steal. 

Comes with 1 Kimpro mag and 1 Chip McCormick mag.  Both work flawlessly. 

The grip, since some ask, is original to the gun. 

The current ambi safety was added ages ago.

H-S Precision sets the standard in performance and quality when it comes to stocks. Each stock features a 3-piece design. At the heart of every H-S Precision Stock is a CAD/CAM designed CNC machined aluminum bedding block chassis. The shell of each stock is comprised of woven Kevlar™ cloth, woven fiberglass cloth, uni-directional carbon fiber, an epoxy-based gel coat and a laminating resin. The core of the stock is reaction-injection-molded polyurethane foam and reinforced with fiberglass. The aluminum bedding block requires a simple tightening of the bedding screws to secure the action to the bedding block. No messy bedding compounds or time consuming work involved.

325,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3964325,"For Sale:  Rare Steyr model M 30-06, Double Set Triggers","Maple Valley, Seattle, Washington",$ 848,"Listed On: Saturday, February 28, 2015",Rifles,Steyr                                                                                ,30-06 Springfield                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a rare Steyr Model M chambered in 30-06. The rifle has had some use. There is a small chip on the tang, just behind the action, as well as one just underneath of the bolt handle. These are cosmetic only, and are not very sizeable. When I purchased this rifle, it had a crack along the side (from below the safety to the trigger guard). I took it upon myself to do a good job repairing it. As the stock is made of ABS, I made a bonding agent from the same type of material and repaired the crack.

Because the material I used to repair the crack is the same type as the stock is made of, it is essentially like the stock has been welded back together. When the same material is used to repair a crack as is around it, the resulting bond is extremely strong. The crack was located in a region of the stock that is not highly stressed, and combine this with the high strength of this repair, it is essentially as strong as it was when new. To assure that the repair matches the stock’s color as closely as possible, I used a stain. With the stain and bonding agent being of similar color to the original stock, the repair is not all that noticeable. To minimize the visibility of the repair, I attempted to replicate the existing checkering on the bond. I can attest to the strength of the repair, as I put 15 rounds through it shortly after bonding it together. The bond held perfectly.

Besides the now-repaired crack, this rifle is in good condition. The bolt is remarkably smooth; it feels like it is running on ball bearings. When I shot this rifle, it was very accurate. This rifle has a very similar bolt design to the SSG-69, so it is capable of outstanding accuracy when in good hands. If you have any questions about this Steyr, please contact me.

The rifle weighs about 7.25 pounds without the scope and balances very well. It points intuitively and will make a great hunting rifle in a time-proven, effective cartridge.

It has a 23.622 inch cold hammer forged barrel (600 mm).
The barrel is free-floating.
This rifle is set in the Cycolac synthetic stock.
Has the standard parkerized finish.
The stock and finish are really nice features for hunting.

Cycolac synthetic stock; The stock has nice checkering on it to ensure a good grip even when wet, while maintaining a more traditional appearance than the typical synthetic stock. Also, being a synthetic stock, it is resistant to warping and is more stable in wet and high temperature conditions than wood.
The Steyr model M never sold all that well in this country, and it seems that virtually all of the ones available here come with a standard single trigger. This one has double set triggers. You have two modes in which to shoot. If you are at the range and desire an extremely light pull, you pull the rear trigger first. Pulling the rear trigger sets the front trigger to a very light weight, allowing you to be more accurate at the range. However, a very light pull weight can be hazardous when hunting. With double set triggers, you don't have to worry about a hair trigger. When hunting, you can simply pull the front trigger and have a normal trigger pull. The double set triggers allows you to have the best of both worlds; a hair trigger for target shooting at the range and a normal (good) trigger pull when hunting.

Some additional features of this rifle include

Has a rare set of quick-detachable scope mounts and rings. These mounts allow convenient and nearly instantaneous removal of the scope for ease of cleaning the rifle from the breech. Please note, the scope is not included with the rifle for this price. It has a Nikon Prostaff 3-9x40mm BDC that can be included for an additional $199 above the rifle’s auction price.
To return the rifle to a ready-to-fire state, the mounts come off as quickly as they came off. Once back on the rifle, the scope is typically very close (if not exactly) at your previous zero point. These mounts and rings are worth about $200 and are very difficult to find.
Most Steyr Model M’s that I have seen for sale have prices in the $1100-$1200 range. In light of the repaired crack, I have reduced the price of this rifle to be competitive. This repair is as strong as possible, and does not affect the safe functioning of the rifle. But, it seemed fair to decrease the price to make it competitive.

Please contact me for a shipping quote. I will charge you the exact amount that it costs me to ship (with insurance). I am an individual, without an FFL. So, if your FFL will not receive from a non-FFL holder, add $45 to the purchase price of this rifle so that I can go through my FFL.

I have many more pictures, just let me know if you would like more.

Seems to be a heavy barrel. Has flash hider, bayonet lug, fixed carry handle, BSA red dot, and willing to throw in the bcg if it's a decent deal. Came off of a BFI Bushmaster lower, from the old Bushmaster back in 2000, when it was passed down to me. I inherited this upper and really have little use for it.  Not at all pressed to get rid of it as I have another pistol I can use this upper with.  But looking to see what is out there.  If I find something interesting, I will consider it.  If I still have the ad up, then I still have it.  I have a conservative estimate of around $400-450 value, give or take some.  Please see the pics.  Also have a Hogue overmolded free float forend grip tube(like new) and a set of Magpul back up sights (MBUS) 1st gen. that were on the rifle for one trip to the range. Both of the latter 2 items I think is fair for $100 value combined."

Here is the write up from the company:

Zeiss Conquest 3-12x56 8 Riflescope REDACTED

Conquest Scopes 3-12x56 ManualConquest Scopes 3-12x56 Manual
Key Features

* Zeiss Conquest Riflescope
Zeiss Conquest riflescopes are designed to meet the needs of North American hunters with an excellent price to performance ratio. They feature fully multicoated optics, waterproof construction, and 1/4 MOA precision adjustments.

* Hunting Turrets
Low profile hunting turrets with 1/4 MOA clicks, and turret caps

* 3-12x Magnification
A bump up in power from the 2.5-10x, the 3-12x magnification range brings you in closer to more distant targets easily. Smaller targets become more magnified, and responsible target acquisition can be executed with authority. At the low end of the zoom range a brighter sight picture is visible and sight acquisition on moving targets becomes possible.

* Parallax Correction
Parallax correction is factory preset at 100 yards (91.4m)

* Fully Multicoated Optics
Proprietary MC coatings ensure the best possible view under all lighting conditions

* Recoil Proof
Engineered and proven to withstand & readily manage the most punishing recoil of big bore African safari rifles.

* Waterproof and Fog Proof
30mm Center tube is machined from a single piece of rugged aluminum alloy that is o-ring sealed and nitrogen purged

* #8 Reticle in First Focal Plane
The #8 reticle features four heavy posts and fine cross hairs. This configuration stands out well against dense brush and heavy cover. The four posts lead your eye to the center of the sight picture while the cross hairs establish your exact point of aim without obscuring the field of view.
First focal plane positioning of the reticle maintains its subtension across the magnification range. This enables accurate distance ranging and hold-over calculation."

---------------------------------------------------
Info:

- I'm the original owner, and I just bought it locally, around September 2014

-Comes with the factory 10 round mag.

-Also comes with upgraded Kel-Tec branded hand-guard/rail and Muzzle Brake (takes standard muzzle brakes, but the one I put on it was specifically made for the PLR-16 by Kel-tec)

- Also comes with original box, and manual

- Chambered in 556/223

- Takes standard AR-15 style Mags

-DOES NOT come with the reflex site in the picture. I'm an honest seller and I wouldn't sell you that junk. The one in the picture is a offbrand Chinese junk site - I only put it on for this picture because it looks cool. trust me, you don't want it haha. 

These are one of my favorite ironsites for ANY fire arm, and I usually hate iron sites. Very easy to use. does have the rail there of course if you wish to install one later.

---------------------------------------------
The Sale:

Not really looking for trades, but I will list a few things I'm always interested in at the bottom of the page. If two offers come in at once, Cash of course, is always favored.

-Will be writing bill of sale, some form of ID required. I'm not a FFL, so no unnecessary background check. However, if the deal seems shady for whatever reason - I won't sell it

-I will leave you my email/phone number on the bill of sale, so if you have ANY issues with the gun, I will help you get it fixed for free via factory warranty, if you need. I highly doubt you will have any issues however.

All the extras aren't high end accessories but they are absolutely functional.  And the backstraps let you tailor the gun to fit your hand.  You're gonna love it!"

Or I can include a Nickel Boron treated BCG and Nickel Boron treated charging handle by WMD instead for $150.

From the manufacturer:
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block lets you to fine tune your rifle's gas system for smoother cycling and operation. Regulating the amount of gas used to cycle the action allows tuning the rifle’s operation to a specific load and the use of low mass bolt carriers, buffers and springs to reduce felt recoil. This is critical to allow faster follow up shots, target acquisition and reliability.
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block is field adjustable. Operation is easy, simply turn the gas regulating screw in to lessen the amount of gas and out to add more gas, then use the brass set screw to lock the setting in place. The overall height of the gas block is 1.37” with left to right dimensions at .94” to fit under most hand guards and still have the customization of an adjustable gas block.
Melonite Coated to reduce wear and corrosion for extended periods of fire, it also makes cleaning easier, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard Parkerized finishes.

The MCSR V2 rail is comfortable, extremely light weight modular rail system that will work in any situation as well as comfortably fit a suppressor inside the rail. The MCSR V2 was designed to make using a quick mounted suppressor easy to install or remove while inside the rail.
The MCSR V2 rail is designed so that the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions will accept all keymod accessories and have two anti-rotation QD positions per side (6total). The internal dimension has increased to 1.8"" to accommodate most suppressors on the market."

I've got my Mossberg 500 up for sale today.  This shotgun is approximately 5 years old and was the second fire arm I ever purchased.  It has been in the field several times and was used for hunting, trap, skeet, and plinking.  This set up is an all around great kit to have whether you like to shoot for fun, home defense or hunt.  I have taken great care of this gun but its ready for a new home.  The price is very cheap for a made in the USA shotgun that rivals the Remington 870.  You pay the FFL! I am willing to drive a small portion to make this deal happen to a legit FFL near the SC area.  Please don't ask me if ill do cash and carry, im the wrong person to ask a wack question like that to.  The pictures you see are the most current one, I took them right before I posted this ad.  The reason I am looking to sell this rifle is that I am now wanting a shotgun that takes chokes.

As of now the rifle is set up with tan Krylon coated stock and fore end, 
1 the field barrel has camo Rem-wraps on it (super easy to remove with no mess)
2 the security barrel has a Krylon coated heat shield on it (forgot the brand, its all polymer)
3 the rifle does have a sling stud on the field barrel and on the stock
4 I do have some buckshot I can include when you buy the rifle 
5 I can throw in a pack and a half of the Rem-wraps
6 one Allen 5 shot ammo sleeve
7 all original parts (plug, manual etc.)"

I also had the tritium night sight version of the Diamond Speed sights installed in the gun.  These are by far the best sights I have ever used.  The are two white diamonds in the rear with a big green diamond in the front.  You line up the three diamonds with the tips of the diamonds touching and there is less room for error versus the traditional 3 dot sights.  Very fast acquisition and very accurate.  I also have the power river precision xtreme grip textured tape installed on the grip but can be removed easily if buyer does not want it.

I am selling my CZ-USA P-09 9mm handgun (New Generation).  This is an amazing gun and shoots extremely well.  It has the Omega trigger system in it which provides an extremely crisp pull and superior trigger pull both in DA and SA.  I bought this gun brand new from the factory approximately 4 months ago.  It has tritium night sights installed and comes with 3 magazines (19 rounds hard to get due to mag capacity ban).  I only shot about 50-100 rounds total through the gun.  I bought it to carry at work but due to a policy change I was unable to use it so it has been sitting in its case.  Currently installed is the safety switch but can be converted back to a decocker in a matter of minutes with only 2 pieces.

Serial number 18385 was made in 1941 and is a DELUXE Pre-War short tang rifle. The change over from long tang to short tang took place gradually around the 17000 serial range. As not very many Model 71's were made after 1942, it is quite difficult to find a Pre-War short tang Deluxe Model 71. The ORIGINAL condition of this rifle is outstanding. Excellent stock and fore end with the Pre-War checkering at 20 lines per inch. Nearly ALL of the original varnish and blue remain with some very light high edge wear and handling marks. Original butt plate, original sights and front sight hood. There are NO extra holes or other non-factory alterations. This 71 was produced just before Winchester started drilling all Model 71's for the side receiver sight. The bore and all mechanics are excellent. It would be a challenge to find another all original Pre-War short tang Deluxe that is better than this one. Includes its original Winchester Deluxe swivels and period leather sling. This is a great Winchester collector and investment rifle. Offered at NO RESERVE. Please look at all the pictures and email any questions or for more pictures."

Serial number 18385 was made in 1941 and is a DELUXE Pre-War short tang rifle. The change over from long tang to short tang took place gradually around the 17000 serial range. As not very many Model 71's were made after 1942, it is quite difficult to find a Pre-War short tang Deluxe Model 71. The ORIGINAL condition of this rifle is outstanding. Excellent stock and fore end with the Pre-War checkering at 20 lines per inch. Nearly ALL of the original varnish and blue remain with some very light high edge wear and handling marks. Original butt plate, original sights and front sight hood. There are NO extra holes or other non-factory alterations. This 71 was produced just before Winchester started drilling all Model 71's for the side receiver sight. The bore and all mechanics are excellent. It would be a challenge to find another all original Pre-War short tang Deluxe that is better than this one. Includes its original Winchester Deluxe swivels and period leather sling. This is a great Winchester collector and investment rifle. Offered at NO RESERVE. Please look at all the pictures and email any questions or for more pictures."

There are a few parameters, your rifle must have an excellent bore (no rust, pitting, worn out rifling etc) I will check this an if the bore isn't crisp an clean then there will be no trade. It needs to be un modified (I don't mind an after market stock but it must have the original as well).  And lastly if it's a standard 91/30 it must come with some ammo.  If it's an m44, m38 or type 53 I will add some ammo based on condition of your rifle.

This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1943 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped to Springfield Armory in February of 1943. It was Issued to an enlisted serviceman at the time. (Trying to find out who it was issued to now through different channels.) There are specific clues on the gun that tell you who it MIGHT have gone to.. There is AA inscribed (Not stamped) on the ivory grips and on the frame Next to GHD. GHD is significant because Col. Guy H. Drewry inspected ordnance from June 17, 1942 to July 15, 1945 For COLT.

After having multiple collectors and Colt dealers at the gun show look at it. ""AA"" is believed to stand for ""All American"" 82nd Airborne. Which would match the dates the gun was issued, and the eagle carved on the Ivory grips. 82 Airborne was the first Airborne division in US Army history and had three major drops, made their first drop in July of 1943 to invade Sicily. Second was Salerno on 13 September 1943. The third was the invasion of Normandy Jun 1944.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. But not all pistols back then were stamped with ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted national match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by a gunsmith. At some point it was re-blued, and fixtures were 24k gold plated and Ivory grips added. It has been determined the gold was added many many years ago as some has worn off in spots. Bluing and finish is still very nice... Bore is excellent and looks shinning.

This pistol is a shooter. I have put 100 rounds through it and drives tacks. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection.

I have many pictures if you want more. FTF in tulsa area only.. 4,500$ cash obo.. All reasonable offers considered. Email if interested. Will trade multiple guns.. Please list your offer and values of guns. email or text 918-four02-zero854."

This bullpup pump-action shotgun has dual tube magazines that can hold a total of 14+1 rounds of ammunition. The KSG can only set to feed from the right or the left. Once the magazine is empty, the operator must use a manual switch to select the other magazine. This may appear at first glance to be disadvantage but for many people who live in areas where shotgun magazine capacity is limited by law, this feature, or lack of feature as the case may be, could allow them to legally possess the KSG.

The right barrel shot fine, the left barrel would not fire.  The firing pin would strike the 410 shell, but it wasn't enough to fire the round.  These appear to be kit guns so I'm guessing someone with time and knowledge could repair the left side firing pin.  These sell for $130 range and I will sell this one for $60 cash, firm.  I will require a NC ccl or pistol permit for the purchase along with a bill of sale.  I will not travel outside of Wilmington or Hampstead area, gas would cost more than the gun."

This bullpup pump-action shotgun has dual tube magazines that can hold a total of 14+1 rounds of ammunition. The KSG can only set to feed from the right or the left. Once the magazine is empty, the operator must use a manual switch to select the other magazine. This may appear at first glance to be disadvantage but for many people who live in areas where shotgun magazine capacity is limited by law, this feature, or lack of feature as the case may be, could allow them to legally possess the KSG.

It was ordered with the following upgrades.
Grade 3 wood instead of the standard grade 2.
Winchester Island Express Safari Sights.
KICKEEZ recoil pad.
The rifle has fantastic wood with lots of figure and color and only very minor handling marks. The bluing is mint with only one small rub on the floor plate. I know for a fact the rifle has been fired less than fifty times. The bore is perfect and looks like it was rifled yesterday. The rifle comes with original dealer hanging tag and owners manual. Also comes with a hand fitted Browning Safari case that was purchased in the early 70s from the same place. The case is a model 1915 and is in mint condition with both keys Browning instruction manual and care card. I have seen these sell on the web before but not one this complete in like new condition. Also comes with a hand tooled Torel Cape Buffalo sling that was purchased along with the case. Also comes with one box of Winchester Western vintage 458 ammo and one box of empty cases. This is the nicest most complete Super Grade made in 64 that you will ever see. Thanks so much for looking and will be glad to answer any questions you may have."
