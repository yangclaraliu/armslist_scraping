China called it the Type 53 Carbine and it has been widely exported. 

This specific example was produced in January 1954 at Plant 296.  It is in really nice shape for its age and the metal finish is worn to a nice even 10-15% patina.  The stock is nicely grained and exhibits only a few scuffs and bruises from military service and the surplus importation process.  The bolt is kind of sticky in the receiver, but a good cleaning and lubrication would help immensely.  This is an older import that predates the really hammered ones that are coming into the country now.  Comes with the original sling as shown in the photos.  Import marked on receiver, this is all matching except for the magazine base and is missing the cleaning rod.

I've had lots of great conversations with fellow gun enthusiasts over the past week or so...thank you to all who have contacted me and shared your insights and knowledge with me!  I've had a few offers get really close to where I want to be on the gun, but alas, nothing that has made me decide to ""pull the trigger"" on a deal.  Just as an FYI....I will be taking the gun off the listing this coming Sunday the 18th, one way or the other, and not re-listing it.  As a couple of you have pointed mentioned to me, right now may not be the best time to sell and/or Armslist may not be the best venue to part with this high dollar item.  Either way, I've greatly enjoyed the conversations I've had with you!
*Thank You's to the fellow Armslisters who are giving me some great insights and feedback!  I appreciate you!*  I added a couple of pictures to the bottom.  Unfortunately this high quality firearm is suffering from my low quality camera!  I hope the 2 additional pictures help.  Also, as I had stated in my first listing of this item, this gun HAS been snap-cap fired! 
This gun is going back on the listing after someone flagged it for being too expensive.  I had numerous trade/cash offers on this gun at the price I had it listed at the first time around, some offers were very close to what I wanted....which tells me I wasn't far off.  This time around I'm going to list it with the option of only accepting offers.  So, if you are interested in this gun, feel free to make any cash and/or trade offers for it.  Because I don't want to offend any sensitive people or people who are afraid to negotiate, I will not put on the auction what I perceive the value of this gun to be.  I would encourage you to do your research.  I will meet only in Fort Wayne, during the day,  and will request to see your carry permit and/or drivers license.  This gun was manufactured in 2003, and is rare, complete, and never been fired....other than factory testing, which is standard procedure.  The night sites are still bright.  Please ask questions if you have them.  Serious/legitimate interests will get a prompt response, ridiculous inquiries/offers will be politely ignored."

Great gun and fun to shoot. Only reason its for sale is downsizing has become necessary. Best ergonomics of any handgun I've fired. Has to magazines and will throw in a box of ammo. The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and performance Design concepts from Walther's centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns … and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

This gun was manufactured in Germany and is becoming somewhat rare because HK no longer produces the stainless slide two tone version of the USP. It is a V1 model with manual safety and de-cocker function as well as  Meprolight Tru-Dot green tritium night sights that work great. I am the second owner and the gun has 500 rounds threw it at the very most. Have only put 75 rounds of +p loads threw it and all other rounds were standard pressure target loads . This gun was manufactured and is rated to shoot +p and +p+ ammunition for a steady diet and is one of the few guns produced that can safely fire .45 SUPER ammunition without any modifications. (For anyone who is not yet familiar with .45 super it is a new type of .45 acp ammo with slightly thicker inner walls in brass shells, allowing shells to be loaded to higher pressures thus higher velocity and energy transfer are produced - For example buffalo bore produces a 185 grn JHP traveling at 1300 fps with 694 ft. lbs. energy at muzzle)      I am asking $825 OBO cash and give it around $850 in trade value.

Super Bad ASS! Armscorp M14 US Rifle 308 22"" bbl in a composite stock w/ Versa Pod BiPod. Also comes with original Walnut stock. 

This Rifle is in excellent mechanical condition with a very nice smooth crisp action and trigger. The receiver, action, barrel and handguard have been painted in a woodland camo pattern as the original owner used this rifle for hunting. I think its pretty cool, tastefully done and looks pretty hardcore as its stood up to the abuses of the field. 

If you are looking to get into a nice Springfield pattern M14/M1A type rifle for hunting or target shooting but down want to break the bank this is your ticket!"

The RCBS AR Series die set is a must for any progressive reloader. Each set comes packaged with a full length small base sizing die and a taper crimp seating die. With this combination reloading for an AR-style, semi-automatic, pump action or lever action rifle just became a lot easier. Small base sizing dies size brass to minimum specifications and help to ensure that cartridges will chamber every time. The taper crimp seating die is helpful as it is a bit more forgiving die for crimping cases that have variable case lengths; helping to reduce the number of bulges and buckled shoulders when crimping in bullets with a cannelure. Due to the fact that this product sizes more than regular dies, it is crucial to have a sufficient amount of high quality lubricant to prevent stuck cases. These dies will also work with any single stage or turret press that will accept 7/8""-14 threaded dies, Shellholder sold separately.

This started out as a great shooting Mossberg 715T AR style .22 rifle and I decided to do a custom fab job on the outer furniture. The body kit is an Archangel Ruger 10/22 setup and I modified it to fit the 715T and it looks much better than having one of those goofy banana .22 magazines curling out the bottom like the others.

The internal barrel, firing mechanism, trigger, etc are all Mossberg 715T and are a single unit, so the only thing that's different is the outer body kit, making this just as legal as a 10/22 with this outer kit installed. The best part is you can take the kit apart and clean the inner Mossberg internals and I've cut out a window on the side to reveal the Mossberg 715T serial number.

I've added other upgrades including the red dot scope, harris style bipod with spring assisted drop outs and metal side picatinny rails. I painted this setup and the stock folds and locks into place.

The longer 715T barrel makes this a very accurate plinkster."

At 1inch in thickness, it is thin enough to conceal very well. It is an internal hammer, double-action only trigger with no external safety. Very nice white 3 dot sights for a gun this size and price point. It is a very reliable gun as featured on the gun torture test youtube channel. 

The gun is a right-handed gun, but I have 2 left-handed holsters that I will throw in for a total of $25 extra. One of the holsters is a custom fit 3-speed holster that is amazingly comfortable.

First is the Enfield, as described above.  It does have a ""sporter"" stock on it that was on when I purchased it.  I also installed a non-permanent rail for optics.  It was never drilled or tapped, and the rail mount is held on with tension and nothing else.  Overall, you could revert this rifle back to original configuration in less than an hour (with the proper stock). 
The stamps tell the rifle was made in 1918, has two George Rex Proof marks, and another two ""broad arrow"" proof marks showing it was an approved and issued military rifle.  I could not find any ""sold out of service marks"" on it, but I don't know enough about markings to know if that is rare.

Asking price is $200 (Comes with 3 boxes SPBT (60rds)+ ~15rds loose Remington hunting ammo - $50 value) 

The second rifle is one that is a bit rare these days.  While regular Mosins, and m-44 (the carbines with the spike bayo) are common, these tanker Mosins are dwindling.  This one is a Izhevsk made M38; produced in 1943 (based on markings).  
It's hard to judge the value on these, since no one is selling them.  From what I've seen (ask for sources) these are ranging from $400-$800.  That range seems a bit high, but it is an uncommon rifle.  It is a compact and unique combat rifle from WWII, designed for tankers before SMG's were common.  A blast to shoot, basically a short barreled Mosin sighted in without a bayonet in the equation (M44's were sighted in with bayo's extended).

In .22 LR , this pistol feature a blowback action and tip-up barrel for safety and convenience during loading and chambering the first round. Each model utilizes low profile fixed sights and is made in the USA.

Taurus Security System (TSS)b
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

It's in excellent condition and is a tack driver. I've just ended up with 3 mkiii's and decided to let one go. This one has the removable grip panels and will accept 1911 grips as I understand. This one has also had the magazine disconnect removed and replaced with the Tandemkross hammer bushing and had the loaded chamber indicator removed and replaced with the Tandemkross plate. The mags drop free now and it will fire with no magazine in it. Take down is a lot simpler now without having to put the mag in and out 50 times. I just recently installed a Hi Viz front sight as well and it has the extra tubes with it. Manufacture date on the gun is 10/10/2013.. Comes in the original hardcase with all the goodies minus the manual ( I seem to have misplaced it).. Has 2 10 round mags. Has all the factory parts and front sight included. Can meet in Dickson or West Nashville daily. Price is $350 cash.. May consider certain trades. Thanks"

 THE GOOD:
 Immaculate interior
 Mechanically is ultra reliable- I just drove the car from St Louis to here non stop- averaged 26 mpg- great for a V6.
 Fresh transmission fluid and filter- shifts great
 New rotors, pads, and calipers all the way around
 New wheel hubs on front
 New AC compressor and drive belt
 Fresh Tune up
 Drive anywhere with confidence
 Fresh air filter and wiper blades
 Not a local car so no rust

 THE BAD
 It is a 12 year old car
 Paint is faded on top- see photos
 passenger side door handles broken- $25 each on ebay.
 Some minor scrapes, ect, but overall a decent looking car

 I have a company car and no longer need. It is not fair for it to just sit un-used.
 I bought in July for $3500 and have spent $1500 on parts/repairs to make the car as mechanically sound as possible. $3200 puts me at a big loss

I have this new Trijicon SRS that I've been using for a few months and have decided to go in a different direction. It's in perfect condition, and has had minimal use. The pictures has a little shiny spot on one of the sides, but isn't something I am seeing when looking directly at it, so I'm not sure if it's a glare or something like that. Either way, I think I'd rather have the Aimpoint Micro T2. Depending on the mount u might have, I may consider a straight up trade for this without any additional valuation in order to equalize the margin. Either way, just let me know if u might be interested, and we can work it out. Drop me a txt if u want. Nine, eight, nine/four-hundred/three, one, six, nine.

Just as a side note... For all the scammers, don't bother even trying. I can sniff u pigs out from a mile away, and won't even entertain any of the silly deals u might try pulling. Save yourself the embarassment."

 My name is Ryan, my wife and i run a youtube channel centered around firearms and outdoors. We are in search of land to shoot on.
The shooting range can be loud and restricting, and the current property that we use isn't as available as we would like it to be.
We dont do any crazy videos that you might have come across, ours are pretty mellow and to the point.
What we are looking for is permission to shoot on land that is safe to shoot. We are looking for more freedom and flexibility than what the range allows. And of course, we would need to record too.
I can sign any liability waivers that you may need, and if need be, we can set up a payment plan within a reasonable amount.

SPEED BREECH XT®

The Speed Breech XT is as simple as it gets. No tools necessary—just turn 90 degrees and it’s out.
FLUTED WEATHER SHIELD BARREL

The fluted barrel increases the firearm’s accuracy by increasing the stiffness of the barrel and increasing the barrel’s cooling rate. The Weather Shield coating is 50 times more corrosion resistant than stainless steel alone.
REALTREE®* AP

The Triumph Bone Collector comes in Realtree AP camo for optimal concealment, and a really sharp look.
IN THE FIELD: THE SCIENCE BEHIND FLEXTECH

What’s behind the Bone Collector’s FlexTech recoil reduction system that absorbs harmful vibration, weakening shooter performance and potentially damaging scopes? Four synthetic recoil arches create a crush zone that allows the stock to compress during the recoil process.
The LimbSaver® recoil pad has dual compression chambers that displace the shock over a broad spectrum. All of this is built into the stock of the Triumph Bone Collector, to give shooters better performance and comfort every time out on a hunt.

The Bone Collector’s Reversible Hammer Extension makes for easy cocking, for both left- and right-handed hunters.

The FlexTech Stock with SIMS LimbSaver* Recoil Pad absorbs shock and vibration and reduces felt recoil by 43%.

The American-made Triumph Bone Collector* is backed by the famous T/C Lifetime Warranty, protecting your investment for a lifetime of hunts."

i am asking 1800 with ammo. trade value of 2000 i paid 1800 for just the basic rifle new a few years ago. and that was the basic rifle. since then i have added well over 400 bux worth of upgrades and the ammo alone is worth 150 bux.
if you want just the rifle without upgrades i will revert it back to the basic rifle and offer it for 1300 firm. it has less than 40 rounds down the tube. and if your looking for a dust cover these did not come with one because the ejection port is larger than a regular ar15 there is a feller out of missouri that does make and sell them if you want to add one yourself.

face to face preferred i will meet up to 100 miles. if you want to meet at a range to function check the ammo used will be that in the picture. i wil throw in the plastic case it came in years ago as well."

Please Read Description:

This is a PROJECT gun

Up for sale or trade is a Ruger M77 chambered in 7mm Rem Mag. and tang safety (original and current chambering) 
At some point in its life the barrel was replaced with a Remington barrel chambered for the original round. Sadly this was not done correctly, causing the bolt not to close when chambering a round. This could be easily fixed by re-barreling or getting fitting the current barrel (rifling/condition practically brand new) 
The stock has also been repaired for a rather large crack, unlike the barrel though the repair was done somewhat better - pictured below. 
All other aspect of this gun work flawlessly.

944,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3889944,For Sale:  Adams Arms Carbine Length Retrofit Piston Kit for AR15,"Middletown, Dayton, Ohio",$ 250,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 6, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Note: This does not work with all forends. Please check adams arms website to make sure this system will work with your gun. This is the standard carbine kit, it is not the xlp kit and will not fit under any rails. The rail will need to be a carbine length rail (7"") and be one of the rails listed on their website. Also, it comes with a standard hand guard that is modified to work with the kit if you just want a standard AR15 hand guard. This kit has been opened, but is brand new and has never been installed on a gun. I do have another gun that is built with this kit, it makes for a really smooth shooting gun. Very worth it.

Here is what Adams Arms says about the kit:

This system will work with .223/5.56 x 45 mm NATO.

Kit includes:

Patented One-Piece Bolt Carrier
.750"" Gas Block with 3 settings (full gas for standard fire, half gas for suppressed, no gas for single shot)
Gas Plug
Upper Receiver Bushing
Bushing Installation Rod
Bolt Spring
Drive Rod with Bushing and Spring
M4 Style Modified Handguards
Modified Handguard Cap
Installation DVD
The Adams Arms Piston System:

A short stroke free floating piston system.
Is Self-Cleaning.
Carbon and gases are expelled forward, away from operator.
Corrosive resistant coating processes.
Harmonics are not transferred into the barrel.
Adjustable gas settings for various applications.
Doesn't vent directly to atmospheric pressure; this eliminates flash signature and super sonic crack which is optimal for night vision and suppresses fire.
This system requires a carbine gas length (7.866"" from barrel extension to shoulder) and a .750"" gas seat.

We recommend using a standard barrel nut or barrel nut with similar measurements for proper fit and function of the kit. Many aftermarket proprietary barrel nuts do not offer the clearance for the drive rod or proper seating of the spring and bushing."

There are a couple different variations of this gun so you need to really know what your looking at if you are seriously interested.

The difference is this pistol can be 2111 armorer maintained where has the old MARSOC pistols had to be hand fitted by 2112 Marines at PWS. If you took this gun apart and tried to replace it with parts of the civilian gun they would not fit or function correctly. The military guns 10 guns can disassembled mixed up and put back together and work perfectly. 

The gun is brand new, it has never been fired but has had a Limited Edition Surefire X300 Ultra in Tan Slide on the rail once. 

I am not looking for ANY TRADES. No Trades! Cash price is $2500, if the purchaser would like the X300 Ultra in FDE Tan they can purchase that for an additional $250. I will not sell the light separate.
