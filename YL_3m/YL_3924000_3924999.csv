Unfired except from the factory. I bought this gun brand new several months ago. Summer 2014 production gun. Comes with the usual stuff from the factory as pictured (box, 2-mags, spent casing, security lock, owner's manual). Also comes with an extra brand new 8rd mag (cost me $40). Has rubber Talon grips installed. I like the gun a lot, and would rather keep it, but I want an AK-47. Must be at least 21 years old+, and a Kentucky resident with proper ID to buy this gun. CCDWL preferred, but not required. No shipping or no out of state sale. Must meet around Lexington. Thanks for looking.

Reduced price to $400 cash (for the gun and 3 mags). Price is firm. No low ball please. I got more than $400 invested on the gun and the extra mag. My loss is your gain. 

* No trade, unless you have a Yugo Zastava M92 AK-47 pistol or an NPAP/OPAP AK-47. I can add some boot, a brand new leather holster, and 9mm ammo to the right trade. I got over 500 rounds of assorted FMJ and hollow points (mostly FMJs) *"

We offer this lovely replica, hand made from Track’s best parts by well known gunmaker, Mr. Scott Coy. Shown in the book, The Southern Arsenal - Harper's Ferry, by Dr. James B. Whisker, sold separately, this rifle matches the first variation of the U. S. Model 1803 rifle.
Stocked in American black walnut, the wood has the natural color, not stained, but simply finished with Linseed Oil, exactly like the originals made at Harper's Ferry. The rifle is properly fit with brass furniture and has a 33” octagon-to-round .54 caliber Colerain barrel.
Weighing in at 8.50 pounds the gun has a trigger reach of 13-3/4” making it perfectly suited for today’s average size shooter."

Purchased new on March 5, 2013

Parts
• 3 OEM 15-round magazines
• I.C.E Claw Base Plates installed on all 3 mags (Rob Pincus design) ($15 each) - I have the plastic OEM base plates
• I.C.E CLAW rear sight (Rob Pincus design - made by AmeriGlo) ($24) - I have the OEM rear sight
• Pearce Grips Gen4 backstrap channel plug ($8) - OEM backstaps still fit
• Vickers Tactical slide stop ($23) - I have the OEM slide stop
• Raven Concealment Phantom Modular holster (black) with standard OWB belt loops (1.5” belt) ($80) and OWB pancake wings ($20)
• 2 GLOCK black plastic magazine holders ($10 each)
• Generic Molon Labe in old Greek cover plate (gift - not installed)

I still have the original black plastic box with the owner’s manual, the two factory fired rounds, magazine loader, cleaning brush/rod, and the additional back straps and longer pin. This model did not come with the newer beavertail backstraps.

Condition: Excellent, like new condition. The gun itself (the frame, slide, barrel, and all internal components) is in factory condition. Nothing has been altered or molested in any way. No Dremel has ever touched the frame and no polishing compound has touched the trigger components. I have only fired 100 rounds through it after my initial purchase, which worked flawlessly. It was then cleaned/lubed and occasionally maintained with Frog Lube. Since then, it has mostly been the “night stand” gun (always in the Raven holster) and the occasional backpack gun (always secured in a Velco-backed soft holster) on my small hikes around my rural neighborhood.

Reason for selling: I have large hands and I want to send the frame in to Cold Bore Customs to get the finger bumps removed and the trigger guard inletted. And then I want to add a Grip Force adapter (beavertail), and then replace the trigger with an OEM smooth trigger. And... Or, maybe, I should just buy a different handgun (no trades).

Price: I have $220 listed above in additional parts and most of those prices do not include S&H. Add $220 to the price of a brand new gen4 G19 @ $550 (again, not including tax, S&H, insurance, etc.) and it would be at least $770, closer to $800.

$550 firm.  No trades, and buyer pays the $10 transfer fee at my local FFL."

Brand New in Box 
One 30 round magazine 
Also comes with flip up sights. 

Here are all the specs.  

Detailed Description: Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUTâ„¢ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knightâ€™s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier groupâ€™s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158Â® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with PermatexÂ® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by MagPul Industries. One magazine is included.

I shot several different bullet, sabot, powder combinations and settled on the combination as follows: Barnes Original 300gr bullet, Harvester black crush rib sabot, and 70grs of Alliant Reloder 10X smokeless powder ignited by a CCI 209 shotgun primer. This combination shot very consistently and showed a velocity of 2505fps average over the chronograph. I was shooting at 100 yards and sighted in both your scope and your open sights. This load shoots about 1 1/2""-2"" high at 100 yards and should be dead on at around 200-225 yards. If I got a shot out around 300 yards, I would probably hold about 4"" high and expect a clean kill! I've enclosed a photo of the last target that I shot. Also with the target you will see the Barnes bullets and Harvester sabots that I settled on as the best combination for this rifle. This Barnes original 300gr bullet  at 2500fps will cleanly kill any North American big game animal including the big bears. I removed and re-installed the scope and then shot it once again to check point of impact. This scope returns to zero as well as any if have ever shot and I really couldn't tell that it had been off of the rifle at all.    Just wipe down the outside of the rifle and keep it in a cool, dry climate till the next time you want to shoot it. It is practically maintenance free if you keep it dry. When shooting this rifle, you will notice that this particular bullet/sabot combination takes a great deal of force (40-50lbs or so) to get it loaded down the bore, and then an extra effort to seat it tightly on the powder. That is a good thing with these rifles and improves accuracy and reliability.  It really is a super safe rifle though and you can learn a lot just by reading the manual. The only variation that you will be applying different than the manual is our choice of powder, bullet and sabot. Other than that, all of the book recommendations apply.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

It is semi-automatic, has 10 round detachable magazine and original canvas sling.Condition is very typical for this rifles, best described as 'rack' grade- multiple dings,dents in the wood, scratches throughout, but nothing broken. Metal has worn blueing, some dings but no missing pieces; muzzle is ok, not rusted.I couldn't take good picture of the bore, it is dark and grooves are visible and strong, unlike most I've seen in the past that were worn out. I shot exactly 3 rounds through it, 2 years ago when bought it, mil-surp ammo (can't reload) then cleaned it and stored it.

I bought it about 5 years ago at a local gun show; this was a MA state police buyback sidearm, and as such, its is worn on the outside, particularly the butt, and apparently the state police decided to scratch ID numbers into the finish under the trigger guard and at the bottom of the 2 mags I got with it. 

On the other hand, as a police sidearm, this was almost never fired; its internals are in fantastic condition, and I have fired less than 400 rounds through it without one single failure even with cheap ammo. I've kept this away from any humidity and kept it well-oiled, and despite the wear there's not a single spot of rust anywhere on this piece; if you can find a visible spot of rust bigger than the head of a pin I'll knock $50 off the price.

They halted production on Centurions back in the 90's, so these are becoming harder to find every day. I love mine, but unfortunately, I have too many expenses and need to sell it.

Selling it with 2 90's LEO 15-rd PB factory mags and a brand new PB 17-rd factory mag (which feeds 100% fine but won't do 17+1). I'll also throw in a new box of Gold Dot +P. Comes with generic carrying case.

PS - This comes with Hogue rubber grips which are supremely comfortable in my fairly large hands. Standard white dot non-adjustable sights.

I can take cash, check (with ID), or Paypal/credit with an additional 3/2.5% fee, although I prefer cash."

Introduction year for the Model 30s was 1921 with a discontinuation year of 1940. The model 30 is a sporting rifle of the inter-war period based on the military P14/M1917 Enfield rifle action, which was manufactured for the British and US governments during WWI. In 1918, after the end of WWI and termination of contracts for both the British P14 and US M1917, Remington was left with two factories (the main factory at llion and the subsidiary at Eddystone) tooled up to make the M1917, and was also left with a large inventory of stored spare parts. It was decided to make a sporting version of the P14/M1917. These were the first high-powered bolt action sporting rifles produced by Remington. If you are a Remington buff, this should grab your attention. Not only is this a great piece of Remington history, these rifles are not easy to come by and very collectable. As always, the gun enthusiasts of the Wiregrass get first shot at this firearm at a most modest price. If no interests shows here, then off to Gun Broker she goes. I am asking $460 for this one.  If you think my price is high, do your research and see what the asking price is on these at the big national sites and compare it to what I am selling this one at (you will only find a handful between Gun Broker and Guns International).

1) S&W 44 American made in 1872 Top Break 6 shot. This gun was only made 3 years and is extremely rare as it is a double action and was made years before the first gen double actions were made. This gun was made for the US Army and they got the work as Colt did not have a patent for one. The gun locks up good, finish 75-80% riflings are good and has a 4 digit serial # (Blued finish) 4 7/8 barrel $3500-

6) This is a very nice and unique Slocum Civil War era revolver. This front loading .32 rimfire, five shot pistol is gold plated over the brass frame. There is enough gold left to clearly see it was plated. Original blue finish remains on the 3"" barrel. Manufactured in Brooklyn, N.Y., by the Brooklyn Arms Company, the Slocum revolver was a unique design with individual chambers in the form of sliding tubes within cutouts on the cylinder. Chambers slide forward one at a time over a fixed rod on the right side to expose, load and eject. This pistol was built this way to evade the Smith & Wesson-held Rollin White patent on bored-through cylinders. The .32-caliber Slocum was a popular Civil War-era choice for personal protection. These were only made from 1863 to 1864. This Slocum revolver is much better than many you will see. The revolver is also known as the Slocum Separate chambers revolver.  $1,000.00

6) This is a very nice and unique Slocum Civil War era revolver. This front loading .32 rimfire, five shot pistol is gold plated over the brass frame. There is enough gold left to clearly see it was plated. Original blue finish remains on the 3"" barrel. Manufactured in Brooklyn, N.Y., by the Brooklyn Arms Company, the Slocum revolver was a unique design with individual chambers in the form of sliding tubes within cutouts on the cylinder. Chambers slide forward one at a time over a fixed rod on the right side to expose, load and eject. This pistol was built this way to evade the Smith & Wesson-held Rollin White patent on bored-through cylinders. The .32-caliber Slocum was a popular Civil War-era choice for personal protection. These were only made from 1863 to 1864. This Slocum revolver is much better than many you will see. The revolver is also known as the Slocum Separate chambers revolver.  $1,000.00

This was an impulse buy 7 months ago and it's sat in my safe ever since. Total of 123 rounds fired by the previous owner (I have the brass).

It comes with the following:

- sling
- screwdriver set (previous owner says it's made by Marlin specifically for the 336)
- finger lever screw (no idea what this is)
- offset hammer spur

Will not sell this separately unless whoever purchases the gun doesn't want the ammo.

Would really prefer to sell.
