The following bills are scheduled to be heard in the House State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee at 1:30 P.M. in Room 271 in the State Capitol Building:

House Bill 1009, introduced by state Representative Steve Humphrey (R-48), would repeal the rights-infringing legislation passed into law during the 2013 legislative session that arbitrarily limits the number of rounds of ammunition you can use to protect yourself and your family to 15.

House Bill 1049, introduced by state Representative Justin Everett (R-22), would extend the protection and right to self-defense you currently have in your home, to your place of business.

House Bill 1050, introduced by state Representative Janik Joshi (R-16), would repeal the ineffective and onerous private transfer background check law that passed during the 2013 legislative session.

House Bill 1086, introduced by state Representative Patrick Neville (R-45), would mandate the timely transfers of certain lawful firearms by chief law enforcement officers to individuals once they have passed a background check.

House Bill 1127, introduced by state Representative Gordon Klingenschmitt (R-15), would admonish business owners who permit lawful concealed carry on their premise from any civil liability if an action were to take place.

The following bills are scheduled to be heard in the Senate Judiciary Committee at 1:30 P.M in Senate Committee Room 356:

Senate Bill 32, introduced by state Senator Vicki Marble (R-23), would allow all law-abiding Colorado residents to legally carry concealed without having to possess a concealed carry permit.  This bill would also keep in place the current permitting system so that people who obtain a permit would still enjoy reciprocity in states around the country when legally carrying concealed.

Senate Bill 86, introduced by state Senator Kent Lambert (R-9), would repeal the egregious legislation passed in 2013 that requires a background check for the private transfer of a firearm between law-abiding citizens.

It is critical that you call and email the members of these two key committees and respectfully voice your support for these bills TODAY.  Please ask these legislators to vote YES to these bills and send them to the floor of their respective chamber.

They are about 98% raw agates meaning picked up and washed off, no polishing or anything. There might be a handful of tumbled agates. 
Not sure but I'm guessing there is between 75-100 pounds. Exact weight will be figured if contacted with serious interest in them. 
I am not going to let you come pick through them, if you want them then tell me how many pounds you want and they will be randomly scooped out and weighed or you can take them all, that's the way it is. 
We'll say $4.50 per pound which from what I can tel is just under market value.

These are mainly for jewlery or decoration pieces there are none bigger than my fist, biggest one is probably half that size

This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1943 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped in February of 1943. It was Issued to an enlisted serviceman at the time. (Trying to find out who it was issued to now through different channels.) There are specific clues on the gun that tell you who it MIGHT have gone to.. There is AA inscribed (Not stamped) on the frame Next to GHD. GHD is significant because Col. Guy H. Drewry inspected ordnance from June 17, 1942 to July 15, 1945 For COLT.

After having multiple collectors and Colt dealers at the gun show look at it. ""AA"" is believed to stand for ""All American"" 82nd Airborne. Which would match the dates the gun was issued, and the eagle carved on the Ivory grips. 82 Airborne was the first Airborne division in US Army history and had three major drops, made their first drop in July of 1943 to invade Sicily. Second was Salerno on 13 September 1943. The third was the invasion of Normandy Jun 1944.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. But not all pistols back then were stamped with ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted national match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by a gunsmith. At some point it was re-blued, and fixtures were 24k gold plated. It has been determined the gold was added many many years ago as some has worn off in spots. Bluing and finish is still very nice... Bore is excellent and looks shinning.

This pistol is a shooter. I have put 100 rounds through it and drives tacks. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection.

I have about 150 rounds through it and it's a tack driver like all the Buckmarks I've owned.  It fits your hand like a glove!  I've had several Buckmarks in my day and this one is far the best one!  I really don't want to sell it but I don't shoot it that much.  It's more of a safe queen.  It comes w/ the Browning zipper case and a extra mag.  This pistol is for die hard Buckmark fans like myself.  Yes, the price is high, but that is what I paid for it new.  A little high for a .22 pistol, however, I've never seen one of these before.  It also has a Crimson Trace laser that came with it.

The longest trip it took in my care was when I drove It from Bellingham to snohomish. Since then it has well maintained and only been driven in town to and from the store etc. 

It has a brand new battery, like new tires that I put on right after I bought it. The ignition and main control computers have been replaced and the front and back brake pads were replaced and bled by a certified brake technician as a favor to me so I don't have a receipt. Spark plugs coil pack and spark cable are new. 

The brakes are a little squishy but they do work just as good as normal brakes and there is some minor cosmetic damage to one of the brake light. Other than those 2 things it runs and drives great. 

It also comes with an aftermarket sound system and a full size spare and a full package of interior, exterior cleaning products and wax. 

The car has been washed inside and out since the picture was taken. This makes a great first car it runs and drives great and it has served me well and I want to pass it on to you.

The serial number on this gun is 982 (of 24,916 manufactured between 1924-1932) placing it in the middle of the first year of production. This rifle is of the solid frame variation (not takedown) and features 22 inch round barrel, 1/2 tube magazine, blue finish, and plain straight grip stock. The bore on this rifle is in exceptionally good condition, and the low degree of wear is uncommon for a gun produced in 1924. This particular combination of model and caliber is hard to find in such great condition, and would certainly be an outstanding addition to any Winchester collection.

The gun is amazing and functions excellent and is believed to be complete and original.
On the side of the gun it show bright and clean where it says ""United States Property""
and the serial number bright and clean and has been confirmed through colt as manufactured for the military in 1916. 

Condition: The gun has lots of wear on both sides of the slide, some of the markings are hard to read. ALSO persumably the gun after the wars was Nickel plated as was common during the times. I was told Colt didn't make nickel guns until much later but I am not an expert on this so it is a bit of an unknown. The gun is in correct and working mechanical order. 

History: The gun was traded to me for a high-end trade with the story that it was handed down through out the family they were the original owners until now. 

Other than that, thats all I know. I will try to answer questions as best as I can and accurately describe the gun as to not misrepresent this special piece of american history. 
Trade value would be $1500-$1700

It also has keymod accessories on the rail such as a bravo company vertical grip and a flashlight mount with a flat dark earth Surefire tactical weapons light included. The rifle also comes with a new Aimpoint PRO red dot weapon sight and has a flat dark earth rubberized cover protecting the Aimpoint. The rifle has a single point sling attachment point behind the castle nut for use of single point slings. The stock that comes with this weapon is a brand new Bravo Company model that I believe is currently sold out. I have also installed an ambidextrous safety made by a top of the line company. The rifle has a Bravo Company grip installed as well as a Geissele super semi trigger installed.the difference between it and the stock trigger is like night and day. The entire weapon has been custom painted by me in a flat dark earth type color with different patterning techniques used to help break up the outline.

•2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances
•In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking and maintenance easy

Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic 12841Designed with input from a distinguished group of current and former professionals, the Patrol Rifle Optic incorporates many never before seen features to maximize this sight's performance within the challenging conditions faced by modern law enforcement. A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. The Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic's front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machine guns. The QRP2 mount for the PRO Optic also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the PRO Optic's front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches and fingerprints."
