As a hunter and gun enthusiast, someone who has bought and sold firearms on here. I wonder why are so many asking outrageous prices for their firearms? I get we all want the best price for our weapons but lets stay within reality. Used is used, it doesn't matter how much furniture you put on something an sks is still an sks or a knock off with MOE furniture. Not everyone but some if people wanted to pay new prices they would go somewhere else and definitely aren't trying to pay new prices for knockoffs because it has a scope or magpull furniture. Or bc you paid this much for it a couple years ago or whatever. Hope this helps some of you sell your firearms although it may not be what you believe it is worth the reality is most of your guns aren't worth near whats being asked."

The bluing & case coloring are excellent. I was told by the son that his father had the work done here in Western NY possibly Turnbull but cannot say for sure. The only thing left to do is the wood. I do not see anything other than normal minor handling marks. For 114 years old the wood & the bore have survived very good. Very little pitting in the bore which is shiny. The serial number is 124XXX which shows as a 1901. I have compared all of the markings on barrel & receiver to the Winchester book and all are correct for this rifle. I have the proper front sight that will be put onto it. I am going to put $2000 but if you want to make a legit offer no low ballers because I do not need to sell it but not using it either. I will ship it to a C&R or FFL for $35 plus insurance because it will not be cheap to insure.

The shotgun has NEVER been fired. Brand new, complete with original box, owners manual, two (2) factory 5-round magazines and three (3) choke tubes.

Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun is the new product from Turkish company Akdal Arms. This weapon is intended for civilian and security use, and mimics the famous M16 rifle in its layout and placement of most controls. It is remarkably light for its caliber and size, because of extensive use of modern, high strength plastics.

Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes conventional gas-operated action with annual (ring-type) gas piston, which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip. Standard sights include front post, installed on the M16-style removable base, and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight.

I bought this for my wife - who assured me it was just what she wanted - and after 1 trip to the range and 4 mags (56 rounds) she decided that my pistol was far more to her liking. This is a great gun. Accurate, easy to shoot and def. the firepower you need to get you through the night. I want to sell this so I can replace what my wife confiscated. :)

It is like new, it has no scratches or marks of any kind. If you ever wanted to get a double stack 45 at a decent price, this is your chance. 

Comes with The Pistol, two mags, the original clamshell, the lock, bushing wrench, and most everything it came with from the factory. (I am hedging my bets mostly because I dont know if there was more propaganda or not) 

$950.00 OBO. No trades at this time. Lowballers will be ignored.

Built to exceed your tactical demands, the ATI Ruger Mini 14/30 Stock is equipped with the Scorpion recoil system and a six-position collapsible and side-folding butt-stock. This advanced recoil system delivers optimal control and comfort with its nonslip, removable Scorpion Razorback recoil pad and its ergonomic, sure-grip-textured Scorpion recoil pistol grip. Combined, they absorb the impact of recoil, reduce muzzle lift for fast target acquisitions, and they keep you in full control at all times. Built of DuPont® extreme-temperature glass-reinforced polymer, the chemical-resistant body remains flexible in extreme temperatures, and its design removes limitations from spring and piston-type recoil suppression systems. This stock features one 4"" Picatinny rail and three 2"" Picatinny rails. Improved pivot assembly. Ventilation in fore end and top cover. Removable, adjustable cheek rest. Other features include a tactical sling attachment slot, drop-tube adapter and five swivel studs. Mounting hardware included. Made in USA."

The SIG SAUER® P220® defines accuracy – and reliability – in a .45ACP. But many SIG shooters have asked for a P220 with a longer slide, one that would compete head-to-head with other five inch barreled 45's. The result? The first P220 Match prototype went to our testing range where it shot an eight-round group measuring 0.64” at 20 yards. Our engineers after extensive review concluded that this was a good starting point.

The P220 Match Elite adds the most sought after features to the P220 Match - beavertail stainless frame, front strap checkering, adjustable target sights, SIG's innovative Short Reset Trigger (a DA/SA trigger system with a 60% reduction in trigger reset) and black anodize aluminum grips. (NOTE: Grips shown have been discontinued. We have replaced with a similar grip without the white SIG SAUER logo. They have just a stamped logo).

The P220 Match Elite defines the new standard in .45ACP performance.

Firm at $1000. No trades except a P220 Stainless Elite."

I know the rings are white gold bought from Fred Meyer Jewelers they have not been worn other than for sizing and I believe they are size 7 and cost 3000.00 and the engagement ring does not have a center stone because we were going to put her mother's wedding stone in it. I open to trades and I'm into the outdoor stuff like hunting. But I also need a covered trailer and would really like to use the money for a Honda or Suzuki supermoto or the right enduro bike"

Includes five (5) stellar clips.  It’s no longer produced and is kind of hard to find, especially in stainless steel.  I’m located near DFW; FTF deal; Cash; TDL or CHL required; Sign a bill-of-sale.

The Ruger P series is a line of centerfire semi-automatic pistols made by Sturm, Ruger & Company produced from 1985 to 2013. The P series pistols were designed for military, police, civilian and recreational use. The designs are largely based on the Browning action found in the M1911 pistol, but with minor variations, generally related to the safety mechanism and the barrel-camblock interface. Reviews have considered them rugged, reliable, and strong.

868,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3946868,For Trade:  Antique Handmade Signed Japanese Katana -- made by famous smith Nagamitsu -- WWII capture from killed Japanese officer,"Newberg/PDX, Portland, Oregon",Offer,"Listed On: Wednesday, October 21, 2015",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"So, many years ago I picked this up in a multi-item trade with a bunch of WWII relics and it has pretty much lived in my safe since then. It came with a story about a relative taking if from the body of a slain Japanese officer. After I got it I cleaned off the 50+ year old dried blood and took it to the regional expert in such things who informally appraised it as follows:

Smith: Nagamitsu
Style: Gunto Zukuri Katana
Temperline: Gunome Choji
Era: Gendaito -- made in 1942 or 1943.

Basically, this sword was a handmade piece made during the war and commissioned for an officer -- it is a true Nihontō i.e. a Japanese style sword made in Japan by traditional methods.

The maker Nagamitsu is a ""named smith"" known for making a solid and heavy-duty sword, and his swords have excelled at kabutowari (helmet cutting). This one is definitely of that type and is a sturdy specimen. More about Nagamitsu:

http://www.japaneseswordindex.com/naga.htm

Regarding condition, the old military furniture is battered, incomplete and completely un-restored. But, the blade is in excellent condition -- partial original polish, no rust, cracking, or serious pitting, and nice clear signature.

I have had the sword for years. My long term plans were to have a shirasaya made for it and just sit on it as an investment, but I never got around to it and my hobbies and interests have changed -- when I was younger I fought competitively with Japanese Swords, but I'm a bit too old and busted up for that nowadays, and so this remarkable relic has been stored for too long. 

As of now I will sell it $3000 OBRO, which is far less than the appraisal value (which was done informally some years back). I'm not desperate for money, and I'm not opposed to holding it for another 10 years. 

Let me know if you're seriously interested and want to have a look at it.  I'm a busy professional so please be respectful of my time, and I will likewise be respectful of yours. 

No shipping unless you wire me CASH first. No BS. 

p.s. My attempts to take pics of the blade which showed the hamon (temper line) have been filled with failure as it is very reflective -- most look lie the first couple which I'm attaching -- my digital camera is not really up to the task.  The best pics of the blade which I could get I had to turn off the flash and point an LED  flashlight at the blade in a dark room -- the last 3 pics are of that type, but they aren't very good. Really, this is the kind of thing you should see in person."

Here is a history of this caliber:
Just one of an entire series of cartridges designed by Elgin Gates, the 7mm IHMSA (International Handgun Metallic Silhouette Association) is among the more popular of the group that ranges from 25 through 35 caliber. All are similar and are designed specifically for chambering in single shot handguns. The intention was to offer competitors a choice of easy to make chamberings that could deliver the desired momentum to distant targets. In this endeavor Mr. Gates appears to have been eminently successful.

General Comments:

The 7mm IHMSA is based on the 300 Savage case. Cases are formed by simply necking the case down to accept 7mm bullets. The sizing die also drives the inside of the shoulder back to achieve a 38 degree shoulder angle, providing superior headspace control and a longer case neck. The same treatment is utilized for all cases in the IHMSA line, which seems to include every feasible bore size from 25 through 35 caliber."
