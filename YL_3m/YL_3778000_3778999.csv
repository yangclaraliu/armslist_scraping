First up is a Mossberg ATR. I bought it as a package gun called the night train. The scope on the one i got was screwed up so i sent the whole gun back to Mossberg. They sent it back with a Barska SWAT 6-24X60IR, IR stands for illuminated reticle. They go for around 300 on opticsplanet. Asking 500, realistic offers will be entertained..

The Mosin is a DIY bubba job but it shoots straight I can hit a 6 inch plate at 180 yards every time with the spam can ammo. Fun gun, has the folding spike bayonet and spits an awesome fireball.

This is the very Jerry Corbit's Crown Automatic Dagger Shown in David Darom's Book Custom Folding Knives. This was made by Jerry Corbit in 2002 before the book was published - Overall length 8"". Blade is 3"" Turkish Damascus. The double bolsters are Roger Eggerline Damascus inlaid with 24k gold wire by Chris Meyer, hot blued. Titanium liners are file worked in vine pattern and 416 stainless spacer file worked and inlaid with Mother of Pearl. Presentation grade Mother of Pearl scales are checked and inlaid with 14k gold pins and Burmese rubies. The rocker bar is inlaid with 14k gold and a Burmese ruby. The mechanism is leaf spring bar release and the knife is a liner lock. The scale screws are 14k gold. This knife has a certificate of origin and a statement that is it unique that it will not be duplicated by Mr. Corbit. Considering he only made a small handful of autos and is now retired from knife making it is unlikely you will see another like it. This is the identical knife on page 87 of David Darom's book. I purchased this knife for $3200 from Robert Blanton when he owned Elite Custom Knives. It has been appraised between $3000 and $5000 by several dealers."

The pins are gold as is the shield on one side of the handle which is also haloed by fluted etchings in the black tip mother of pearl scales. In the center of the shield is a small medallion engraved with the words '25 Years Knife Makers Guild'. It is also a stealth firing button.

Now, the one slight negative. The jack@$$ owner before me had sanded down the front sight and epoxied a fiber optic on. Obviously it didn't hold up. I had the gun professionally removed of all epoxy and called ATI to see how much I could get the front sight restaked for... A whopping $40. That's it. $40 and this gun needs no work. The gun has been taken apart fully and cleaned & lubed completely, upper and lower assemblies. If it doesn't sell I will get it fixed myself and repost for $100 more. I'm asking $550 for everything all because of a $40 sight.

Features a Geissele SSA-E 2 stage trigger that has a crisp 2.3lb first pull and a “candy cane” like break at 1.2lb. Also includes Nikon P-223 glass and Burris P.E.P.R. mount. I love this weapon and hate to see it go, but I need the cash for this holiday season. The .223/5.56 Wylde barrel allows it to handle a large variety of ammunition while maintaining optimal ballistic performance. Rifle shoots great, I have not had a single malfunction and it has been meticulously cleaned and maintained. Comes with one 30 round P-Mag. See below for full specs.

An American made gas piston was also added to get the foreign parts count down, in order to be legal with detachable magazines or ""922r compliant"" in other words. (You can learn how to do anything with these new fangled interweb google machines huh?)
 2-Tapco 20 round magazines, and a 75 round drum are included as well.

The ""YUGO”, or “Zastava built"" features of the rifle include a folding blade bayonet, Rifle grenade launcher with flip up grenade sights, and 2 options for the rifle sights as well, ( the standard issue adjustable tangent notch rear sight, and adjustable front hooded post sight,  and it’s also got  flip up ""3 dot"" sights for faster targeting at closer range(only on the Yugo models), the 2 position gas port, originally intended to keep the next round from feeding while firing grenades, serves to make selectable, semi-auto, or ""bolt action"" it eliminates the inertia created by the moving parts of the action/gas system, for better odds of hitting that really long shot. The Yugo is all around beefier than the other breeds of SKS. They sport a meatier gas block,(the only selectable gas port model), beefier front sight/bayonet lug, and slightly longer barrel, when compared to the other SKS variants
This semi-auto rifle looks and runs smooth, and can hit targets that an AK-47 can't touch. And all with the same exact same cheap ammo, (7.62X39). This gun has had less than 150 rounds through it, and I’m the original owner, so it’s essentially brand new or better than new if you ask me. I would keep it, but I bought a new gun, and my bride wasn’t really too thrilled about it, I have 2 SKS rifles, so I agreed to sell the newer one to help put the money back in the bank. “Happy wife, happy life.”

This is a high quality factory built upper actually assembled by Seekins Precision. If you don't know who that is, do your research - they manufacture very high end components (they make a lot of the parts for other companies such as Spikes Tactical and many others). The extremely lightweight 15"" MCSR V2 Keymod rail is well over $200 alone (has a 1.8"" inside diameter to accommodate suppressors), and the Seekins adjustable gas block is another $60 and offers you tremendous tuning capabilities (see below). Upper is complete with melonite treated full milspec M16 bolt carrier group and charging handle. This upper should shoot a 1 inch group if you can. Throw this on any lower with a decent trigger and have an amazing competition level rifle built by one of the top quality manufacturers in the industry. $650 cash takes it. 

The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block lets you to fine tune your rifle's gas system for smoother cycling and operation. Regulating the amount of gas used to cycle the action allows tuning the rifle’s operation to a specific load and the use of low mass bolt carriers, buffers and springs to reduce felt recoil. This is critical to allow faster follow up shots, target acquisition and reliability.
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block is field adjustable. Operation is easy, simply turn the gas regulating screw in to lessen the amount of gas and out to add more gas, then use the brass set screw to lock the setting in place. The overall height of the gas block is 1.37” with left to right dimensions at .94” to fit under most hand guards and still have the customization of an adjustable gas block.
Melonite Coated to reduce wear and corrosion for extended periods of fire, it also makes cleaning easier, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard Parkerized finishes.

The MCSR V2 rail is a comfortable, extremely light weight modular rail system that will work in any situation as well as comfortably fit a suppressor inside the rail. The MCSR V2 was designed to make using a quick mounted suppressor easy to install or remove while inside the rail.
The MCSR V2 rail is designed so that the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions will now accept all keymod accessories and have two anti-rotation QD positions per side (6total). the internal dimension of the MCSR V2 has increased to 1.8"" to accommodate most suppressors on the market."

I got this gun about a year ago and have put about 300 rounds through it myself. The previous owner purchased the gun new in 1993 and only put about 100 rounds through it and cleaned it and in sat in it's case for years. Everything inside looks brand new. I did not get the original case with it but I do have a generic hard plastic case for it. I have the two original magazines plus one extra Glock mag that I purchased separately. 

As you can see in the pictures the gun does have white lettering, I believe this to be not factory original but I didn't try to take it off as I did not want to harm the finish of the gun. 

I will also include a Bianchi 59 Special Agent Holster which i paid about 60 bucks for with this gun as well, very comfortable stylish paddle holster for the gun. I also have a Galco suede IWB holster that is made for a Springfield however the 19 fits perfectly. I will include all of this stuff in the sale because I will have no use for it.

I would like to see $400 for the gun and the three mags two holsters and case. I'm open to trading for either a blued Walther PPK or a Colt 1903 Pocket Hammerless. (Very specific I know, those are just the two guns I'm looking to get with the money from selling this one. 

If you're interested or want more pictures of the case and other holster or any of the inner workings of the gun, let me know. Don't miss out on owning one of the cleanest Gen 2's you'll come across. During the week I'm in Terre Haute and I'm usually in Indianapolis on weekends. Shoot me an email if you want to make an offer, I'll entertain any offer if it makes sense.

Circa 1946 Winchester Model 52B with Lyman model 524 iron sights.

This is a legit 9mm MP5 not that 22lr look alike. Made by Turner Fabrications who has been making MP5's for a long damn time, its the closest you will get to an Genuine HK MP5 without taking out a second Mortgage! Note, HK does not make MP5's anymore, they havent for awhile, finding one for sale is near impossible, and if you do it is going to cost a but load. This thing is in perfect condition and functions flawlessly.

$3000 cash or trades listed below. You will pay over $4,000 to buy all this new after its all said and done, Get mine and save $1,000.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So here it is:
-MP5, All parts German HK, minus the US made Receiver(LSC Manf.)!!!!! There is one NIB on Gunbroker right now being sold by Turner Fabrications for $3100(Gun and 1 Mag!), I'm asking $3000 for everything listed in this ad!!!

-Fluted Salt Nitrate barrel, Threaded 1/2x28 and 3-Lug for multiple suppressor mounting aoptions.

-NAVY SEF trigger group/housing (this MP5 shoots Semi-Auto ONLY tho)

-Has a ""Action 3"" bolt group with F style bolt carrier, this means it will fire F/A with a NFA Registered F/A Trigger pack. These bolt groups are banned from further importation and cost about $1,000, check hkparts.net(SOLD OUT) to confirm for yourself. Couple this with a registered F/A Sear installed in a F/A pack and your ready to blast rounds. Obviously NFA Rules apply if you take this route, and it costs $$$.

-MFI Low Profile claw mount($130)

-3 Mags ($50 ea)

-Bushnell TRS Red Dot($100)

-Brand New Folding stock($140) in separate box, I was going to make this MP5 an SBR but spent money on a suppressor instead and just haven't done it yet. I probably will if I keep it, so get it while its a Non-NFA Weapon and SBR it yourself!

-Included in this ad is 1,000rnds of factory 9mm, most are American Eagle, some Remington and Winchester too($300 @ $0.30/rnd). The ammunition container pictured is one of my 9mm containers and contains 2,000 rounds which you will be getting half of. I will sell an additional 500rnds($150) or 1000rnds($300) if you want more.

----Note, installing the Stock on this ""Pistol"" makes it a SBR(Short Barreled Rifle), which needs to be Registered with the NFA branch of the ATF. Do not install it without registering it first.

Are you looking for someone to build a fully customized AR-15 for you? Really want one, but don't have the time? Or maybe you just don't know how to do it? Fret not, you've found your man right here! So you might ask yourself why you might want to have one built for you instead of just buying one, right? Well, here's your answer, it's a lot cheaper, and YOU get to choose exactly what's in and on it, instead of paying $1,000 for one and then dumping more money into making it how you want it. 

Economy isn't doing too great and my job has really cut down on hours, so I thought I might as well throw up this as a service to get a little extra money in. I've been doing this for a number of years and I'm completely competent on my work. If I wasn't confident I wouldn't be actively using my own build as a means to protect me and my family. 


Prices all depend on what you want. It can cost anywhere from as low as $700 or $800 or as high as $1300. I always send pictures and updates about how the rifle is coming, or if you'd like to learn you can be right there while it's being built. I would like payments to be in advance so that it gives me the proper money to get the parts in, or if you already have the parts you'll just be paying for labor which will differ depending on the rifle, I'll try to be low on the costs for labor as it's not really work for me, as it is fun. 

So throw an email at me and we'll see what we can work out! 

Have fun, and more importantly stay safe!"

This is not a beat up police trade in and it is in great shape for its age, probably around 90% cosmetic condition with the only wear worth mentioning being a very small amount of finish wear at the muzzle. Excellent trigger and tight lockup and timing as these revolvers typically are. Has the original S&W wood grips and a T grip adaptor for a better hand fit.
