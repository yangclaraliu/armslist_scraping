Great condition, and comes with extras installed.  First, the original  recoil spring and guide rod were replaced with a dual action, recoil reducing frame saver spring.  This spring acts as a shock absorber, dampening the recoil and preventing the hard slide contact that occurs when the slide cycles during firing.   This is the same kind of dual spring that is in your h&k pistols

  The second piece is an extended, ported barrel.  This is a national match grade barrel with a 1:16 twist, made of the finest type 416 stainless steel, and vacuum furnace heat treated.  The rifling is laser cut, and areis FAR more accurate out of the box than any button or broach cut barrel.   The rifle is also full bore, and goes right through the ported section to the end of the barrel.

  Both of these add ons are virgin (the gun has never been fired with these installed) and brand new.  These usually require polishing and fitting to ensure proper fit and function, but these are ready to go for this gun.  Of course the original parts will be included

I also have 400 rounds of winchester FMJ available  if youre interested for $150 more.  The prices are all firm, not looking for trades unless they are higher value

Took this in trade with the intent on turning it around since I'm not a 1911 guy. This is the desirable all black 1991A1 Series 80 in great shape and comes in Colt blue case with 3 magazines. I will also throw in 50 rounds of JHP and almost 30 rounds of FMJ. I also have no use for the leather belt holster and the Uncle Mike's shoulder holster so I will throw those in too.

Now, someone else on SGN got jammed up selling a similar gun for too low, then too high or something like that. This gun brand new on Gunbroker (Buy it Now) runs $875 but factor in $35 for shipping, $30 for FFL and another $85 in sales tax. So yeah, about a $1000 gun delivered and about the same in local stores out the door.

You are getting 3 Colt brand mags with this pistol as well as nearly 80 rounds of ammo, plus a bonus two decent holsters. I would value this deal at over a grand but I need this gone quickly to fund another purchase:

FIRST PERSON TO MEET ME WITH $799 CASH WILL GET THIS PISTOL AND ALL THE GEAR. My trade value is higher of course so keep that in mind when I say that I will accept a partial trade. I mostly need cash but if you have a very clean SKS plus $600 cash or other partial trade, let me know.

Great condition, and comes with extras installed.  First, the original  recoil spring and guide rod were replaced with a dual action, recoil reducing frame saver spring.  This spring acts as a shock absorber, dampening the recoil and preventing the hard slide contact that occurs when the slide cycles during firing.  This is the same kind of dual spring that is in your h&k pistols

  The second piece is an extended, ported barrel.  This is a national match grade barrel with a 1:16 twist, made of the finest type 416 stainless steel, and vacuum furnace heat treated.  The rifling is laser cut, and areis FAR more accurate out of the box than any button or broach cut barrel.   The rifle is also full bore, and goes right through the ported section to the end of the barrel.

  Both of these add ons are virgin (the gun has never been fired with these installed) and brand new.  These usually require polishing and fitting to ensure proper fit and function, but these are ready to go for this gun.  Of course the original parts will be included

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

Engine, trans, interior, body, wheels, everything is original to the vehicle from 1967 except the tires.  Originally an Idaho farm car, it was used to drive literally around a farm.  Headgasket blew years ago, eventually it was shipped here to be restored.  Original owner passed away, grandson wanted nothing to do with the vehicle, now it's in my hands.  Half of the engine and front suspension is off of the car, however any truck driver that knows what he's doing will be able to tow it easily. This has been a project for a while to be handed down to my son,  but I'll be losing the storage space because of a long twisted story of BS that I am not happy about.

Do you want to shoot in a more dynamic setting? 

The Intermediate Pistol Course is all about getting comfortable with your firearm.  This course will drive the core marksmanship fundamentals required to master the manipulation of your firearm.  This course will take you out of the comfortable static shooting most people do at the local range.  Emphasis is taken on instilling safety and proficiency with your firearm.
This course will prepare you to properly, safely and effectively unholster your firearm and present it to a threat if such need should arise.  The dynamics of shooting at closer distances will be explained and the hands-on drills will drive home the importance of the core fundamentals.
This course is 25% classroom and 75% hands-on and will have you firing your handgun for approximately 6 hours.  Manipulating your firearm under new pressures and timed constraints will prepare you for the unexpected.  This course will not only teach you the skills, but will also give you the confidence you need to feel comfortable handling your firearm in worst case scenarios.  This course is 1 day of hands-on lecture and hands-on drills.

Winchester Model 1895's have become quite uncommon, so this would be a cool rifle to have if it were a standard 1895 and I wasn't worried about taking it out and getting it dirty. As it happens, US military versions of the 1895 chambered in 30-40 Krag are very scarce; a musket configuration makes this rifle an incredibly rare bird indeed. Serial number is sub-9000, which places the date of manufacture as 1898. KSM (Kelly S. Morse) government inspector stamp is visible. The pictures speak for themselves.

The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail. To complete the package, the Equinox features gray laminated wood grips with a perfect blend of checkering and stippling to enhance not only the form but the function.

I would like to trade my Beretta 90-Two for firearms below. It looks LNIB. It was fired approx. 100-150 Rds tops. These pistols selling right now up to $800area in this condition. Very collectible. Many people mistaking these with polymer frame guns. Frame of the pistol is metal with wrap around polymer grip. Also you can always buy 9mm barrel from regular Beretta 92 FS and shoot 9mm ammo without even buying 9mm magazines. Under plastic cover there is a picatinny rail for your acces. They were all made in Italy. Most beautyful Beretta ever made (my opinion) I never seen one on Armslist.

These are the Specs. and Features from the TAURUS web site:

	Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

 	Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.

 	Heinie Sights
Features the famous and genuine Richard Heinie ""Straight Eight"" Sight, using the rapid and accurate dot over the dot system

 	New Unique SA/DA Trigger System
The PT24/7 Pro Trigger system solves the double action/single action dilemma once and for all. Figure 1 shows the trigger at full rest. When a round is chambered, the trigger sets in single action mode with the trigger traveling freely to the crisp break point shown in figure 2. The trigger resets to DA mode until another round is chambered.

The Millennium PRO"" also features the same revolutionary Single Action/Double Action trigger and matching serial numbers on the frame, slide and barrel as the 24/7 PRO, Heinie ""Straight Eight"" sights, an ergonomic grip design, enhanced finger indexing Ambidextrous Index Memory Pads"" and posi-traction slide serrations. Light, powerful and technically advanced, the Millennium PRO is the choice for concealment and back-up carry.

Why Can’t I Find .22 LR Ammunition?!?!?

Posted on April 7, 2014	by Sierra Bullets 	


Written by Sierra Bullets Vice-President of Sales Matt Reams


Even though Sierra BulletQuestionMarks does not make .22 LR ammo or projectiles, we are constantly asked “Why can’t I find any .22 LR ammo anywhere?” Even the conspiracy theorists are at a loss on this one as they can’t even blame it on the government. They toss around thoughts of warehouses full of .22 LR rotting away just to keep it out of their hands, but that does not seem very realistic – even to them.

So what is going on here? Why is it that 1.5 years later, the shelves are still empty and bricks of .22 LR can still be seen selling for upwards of $75-$100 at gun shows? I do not believe there is one answer, but rather a few. Here are my opinions on the matter, for what they are worth.

Hoarders – Some people are piling it away in their basements, garages, bunkers, and under their beds due to fear of not being able to find it again. This is not a huge factor in it, but it is still a factor to some degree. When these hoarders can’t find it on shelves, it only panics them more and causes them to buy even more when they do find it.

Gougers – These are the guys who prey on the fear of the hoarders. These are the guys that wait in line at Wal-Mart at 3 a.m. to buy up the daily allotment that Wal-Mart puts out at normal retail prices and then double or triple their price on the weekend gun show circuit. Again, not a huge factor, but keeping the shelves looking empty which keeps the panic level higher for those that are looking.

Demand – Now we are getting to the real meat of the issue. You hear manufactures say they are running 24/7 on their Rimfire lines which is putting somewhere around 25-30 million rounds PER DAY (estimate on my part from numbers I have heard from the big rimfire guys) into the market – so how can there be a shortage? I have asked this myself – until we start doing even a little basic math. You hear all kind of numbers about how many firearms owners are in the USA, but you hear 70-80 million quite often. So for the sake of us not arguing that number – let’s cut it to 35 million. Do you know a gun owner that does not own at least one firearm chambered in .22 LR? Do you know any that are not looking for .22 LR ammo or would at least buy some if they saw it for normal prices? How many would they buy when they found it? A lot – right? But again, just to keep the argument on the low end, let’s say they would all be satisfied with just a single 500 pack. 35 million multiplied by 500 .22 LR rounds for them all – is 17.5 BILLION rounds. Let that sink in. Even at 25 million rounds being made PER DAY – that is 1.92 years’ worth of production.

Starts making some sense then doesn’t it? Hoarding and panic emptied the shelves. Gougers try and keep them empty and demand does keep them empty. Then factor in that I probably cut the real number of 22 LR shooters in ½ and probably underestimated the amount everyone would buy if they found it at normal prices by 300% and you can see how deep the problem really is and why it is not going to go away tomorrow. It also does not take into account the world market – just the USA.

How will it get better? Slowly. The hoarders will get to a point that they feel they have enough or will run out of money. The shelves will start getting enough on them that the gougers cannot buy it all. This will make people stop paying $50-$75 for a brick at gun shows. That will make it less profitable for the gougers to spend their money on and they will stop. The shelves will start to have product again which will ease people’s fears and get them back to buying what they need today instead of what they need for the decade. There is no fast answer.

Are the manufactures hiring people for extra shifts and adding capacity – sure they are. But it is easy to just expect them to ramp up production overnight to take care of our needs, but that is just not realistic. We get the same thing here. The market certainly has not grown 500% so what happens when companies add all that super expensive equipment when things get back to normal? They take a bath on it for sure and waste capital that they could have used to improve their company in a way that makes them stronger. Instead they just added equipment they may never need again and have to mothball while they lay off workers they no longer need. Not a great way to run a business and not a fair way to treat employees.

We all just have to trust that it will get better, do not buy more than we need and wait it out. It will not get better overnight. It will start out with a box here and there and then a few and then slowly the shelves will get back to having all the supply and selection we picky consumers are accustom to and will certainly appreciate much more than we ever did before……if only for a little while."

This is a single stack 9mm in Double Action Only. Comes with 2 mags, a 6 and an 8 round. The 8 round mag has an extended grip section on it that makes the grip more of a full size. 

The gun does come with night sights installed, but, the front sight does NOT glow. I assume since the gun is less than 1 year old that Sig will replace it at no charge since tridium is supposed to glow for multiple years. (Half-Life is over 10 years.) I don't shoot at night often, so I never took the time to get in touch with Sig. Either way, I've priced it accordingly. 

These particular Sigs did not come in the fancy plastic cases like the larger frame guns do. I do have the original cardboard box, small lube packet, flush fit baseplate for the 6 round mag, and the original paddle holster that comes with most Sigs.

Also included is an inside the waistband leather and kydex holster, much like a CrossBreed. 

The buyer of the firearm will also be given the option to buy up to 7 boxes (350 rounds) of PPU 9mm Luger ammo. This is brass cased ammo from Serbia. It's a little dirty, but it goes bang every time and the brass ""should be"" reloadable. The ammo is NOT for seperate sale. Price to be discussed with the buyer. 

You can contact me by TEXT MESSAGE ONLY at: REDACTED
I work odd hours, returning phone calls is difficult.

Now! Down to the dollars.

New these guns range from $475 to just under $600. That's before you add in shipping and transfer fees. 

Used I have seen them go from $400 all the way to $550 for the gun alone with $475 being the mid point. So, we'll go with that number. 

Aside from the front sight being out, the gun looks brand new. Round count is low. Less than 150. So condition is excellent.
