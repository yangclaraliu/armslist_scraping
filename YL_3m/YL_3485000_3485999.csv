This Rifle has a higher velocity of 1500 fps which is more than most .22 rimfires (1080 ~ 1430 fps), is much quieter, and much, much cheaper to shoot. There are a ton of videos on UTube about this rifle showing its accuracy but the most impressive is its raw power. Such as shooting nearly an inch into a 2X4 stud.

I purchased this for $329 about a year ago and I have upgraded to a higher class so I never really shoot this much more. So at $150 this is a bargain!"

**EOTech Sold Seperately**

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

We are a local company that works to get you the best prices on handguns, rifles, shotguns and AR-15’s in Vermont. If you’re looking for something specific or have any questions call/text at 1-REDACTED

From POSP:
The POSP series is world famous for its quality and is current military issue for the Red Army. It is built battlefield-tough from magnesium alloy and has fully multi-coated optics. A great assault weapon scope with 400m Simonov (AK47- 7.62x39) marked metering grids, these illuminated reticule scopes allow you to determine kill distance as well as to track and observe game in the field. 

The military reticles have an extremely effective and useful height-based rangefinder for dual use, with graduated scales for both standing and prone figure estimation. The 400 meter Simonov height based gradient (choke style) rangefinder has holdover aiming marks for quick reaction shooting at 100 & 200  meters, when used with 7.62x39mm. Once the primary inverted chevron aiming mark is adjusted for zero at 100 meters, the next chevron are bullet drop compensated for shots at 200 meters automatically.

All POSP's feature professionally ground, crystal clear optics, nitrogen filling to prevent lens fogging, and larger diameter tubes for improved light gathering under the most severe conditions. Probably the best scope, dollar for dollar, in the world, it is waterproof and can be used in any climate condition. It comes with a high quality mil-spec finish, and with everything shown in the picture: rubber lens cap, eye piece, and nylon carrying case. If you want the look and performance of a true POSP and place a premium on shooting comfort, this is your best choice. 

The AK V clamp can easily be mounted to any of these rifles with the standard side rail: AK-47, AKM, AK-74, Vepr, Saiga, K-var, KBI, Hesse, Century and Arsenal USA copies, Romak1/2, SLR-93, SLR-95, SLR-101, MK-11, SAR, WUM, SA85M, WASR (check for installed rail), Maddi, Norinco and Poly-Tech copies.

Specifications:

Aimpoint CompM4 sights are the finest sights that Aimpoint has ever produced. The improved energy efficiency provides up to 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery! Aimpoint CompM4 sights incorporate an integral mount that eliminates the need for a separate ring and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a variety of firearms. They can also be used by hunters and sport shooters that need night vision compatibility. CompM4 sights are available in two versions. The two versions are identical except that the CompM4 offers a high battery compartment, while the CompM4S offers a low battery compartment. The Aimpoint CompM4 is now the latest version of the US Army's M68 CCO (Close-Combat Optic), continuing a legacy that Aimpoint has maintained since 1997. The performance of the CompM4 sights is optimized for use with all generations of Night Vision Devices (NVDs), but is especially suited for 3rd generation night vision technology. Aimpoint's unique band-pass coating on the front lens reflects select frequencies of red light at near 100% efficiency in order to give the highest possible dot brightness with the smallest amount of energy while transmitting nearly 100% of light in the Infrared and near-infrared part of the spectrum to provide the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation NVD. With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 Daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4 and CompM4S are ready for use around the clock. 

Technical Information: Aimpoint CompM4 and CompM4S

I have pulled the bolt hold open but that can easily be re-installed. I have had approximately half of a spam can through this gun so it’s seen no more than 580 rounds.  You can look at the bore and rifling and see that this rifle is still basically new.  I drilled the factory handguard to both lighten and vent the front of the gun.  It has a two tone look with the FDE furniture. It includes 18 magazines total, most still brand new, 1 original 10 rounder, 2 unloaded tapco mags, and 15 loaded tapco mags downloaded 2.  Included in the full asking price is an unopened spam can of Russian 7n6 ammunition complete with the can opener. That’s 1,500 rounds of 7n6 total. I can split the ammo and sell with another saiga 5.45 we have which is also for sale. If you would like more details on that just ask. We can always come up with a price for a package deal. They both have original owner’s manuals and factory proof paperwork. It’s clean, frog lubed, and ready to go shooting! The asking price is $1,700 OBO.

I bought it new and it's only been fired 15 times (15 rounds) since I purchased it. I've got 3 magazines for it 1) Carolina shooters supply 7 or 10 round mag, and 2) factory 5 round mags. included with this sale is a removable picatanny mount with folding/ swiveling telescoping bipod. Also included is an AK style side mounting optics rail which detaches with one slide lever, ( scope not included)  I'm also including an ATI grip and stock package( not yet installed). This rifle has beautiful dark wood furniture and has the thumb hole stock. This is the heaviest duty 308 semi-automatic rifle ever made- it's based off the rpk Russian machine gun and built of an ak platform for ultimate reliability! And boy, is it fun to shoot-and again- extremely we'll made! I've got 4 boxes x 20 full metal jacketed ammo to go with the rifle. I prefer a face to face transaction, cash only, and the buyer be a Virginia resident but if not I've got no problem shipping it to an FFL in your state but you'll have to pay the shipping and packaging fees which are not included in the asking price. Just an FYI--due to the recent banning laws the USA has imposed against importing these rifles from Russia, you can't even order this rifle anymore and once they are all sold and in the hands of the truly deserving- these rifles will be harder to find then someone on this website who voted for Obama!! LOL!  If interested please call me at REDACTED, thanks.

( Also- it's made by the Merlot company in Russia but for some reason it won't let me select that in the manufacturer section and that's why it's listed as an American Tactical Imports, sorry for any confusion)"

This light weight over/under won’t break your back or the bank. Weighing in at just 6 lbs, it is a full 2 lbs lighter similar steel framed models. With all the gear we find ourselves carrying into the field today, (like remotes for training collars, gps, cell phone, extra ammo and a bottle of water just to name a few) I don’t mind taking advantage of the opportunity to shed a couple of pounds. In Kansas we have a daily bag limit of four pheasants. The recoil is a little more than my sporting clays gun, but it sure isn’t too much for my typical day in the pheasant fields. 12 ga 2 3/4 "", 28"" bbls, extractors only.

The first one is a Ferro Concepts Gen 2 FCPC. Its in multicam. The condition is like new and has seen little use besides trying it on a few times. Never had any field use. The package includes a Ferro airflow cummberbund, , Ferro gen 2 shoulder pads, a Ferro general purpose pouch, two Ferro m4 wingman pouches, one Ferro m4 kangaroo front pouch, one Ferro kangaroo front pouch with mag rentention straps/elastic bottom (currently on PC), two Ferro kangaroo pouch m4 inserts with 3 kydex inserts, brand new Tyr Tactical assaulters zip on panel 50oz, and the CAT tourniquet/med shears.  Everything retails for: $550.  Selling for $480 shipped.

The second plate carrier is a Mayflower APC.  Its in ranger green.  Size is medium. The condition is excellent that has seen a little more use than the Ferro PC.  Will include Blue Force Gear m4 ten speed in CB and a Mayflower triple m4 insert in CB.  The reason why I say that is because the cummberbund hook and loop is a little fuzzy, but the rest of the PC is in like new condition.  Also has ""Esson"" written with sharpie on the rear panel.  Another well known company that makes top of the line gear.  Retails for: $290 ($220 for PC, $30 for insert, and $40 for BFG ten speed)

Description from barrel and upper from PSA:

Barrel:  A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a carbine-length gas system.   The M4A1 profile barrel  is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.  Barrel is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring T-marks, these upper upper receivers are made for us right here in the USA.

The quality and performance of the Remington 870 Magnum is second to none. The receiver is milled from a solid billet of steel to increase the longevity of this weapon. Remington believes in their products. This is evident when their catalog stresses, “The Model 870 has been the standard for slide-action performance for 60 years.” As a member of the 870 model family, the Remington 870 Magnum line of shotguns shares many of the same high quality characteristics as the Remington 870 Express shotguns and the Remington 870 Wingmaster. Upgrading your Remington 870 Magnum can be done with ease. Many accessories are available and convenient due to interchangeable barrels, chokes, and stocks.

For Sale is a Remington 870 Magnum 12ga Pump Shotgun.  This gun was a Law Enforcement Dept Trade-in and features a 20” Smooth Bore Barrel with Rifled Sights. Chambered for 2 ¾” or 3” Shells (Capacity 5 + 1). This gun is used but in good condition.  The butt stock and forearm are stained walnut and the wood does show some minor wear from normal usage. The barrel and receiver are Parkerized and also show some minor wear from field usage.  Overall, would make a good Slug Gun and/or Home Defense Shotgun.

 General info from Browning

 In production for nearly a century, the SA-22 is unlike any other rimfire rifle on the market. Much more than ""just a 22,"" the history of this fine rifle can be traced back to the mind of the gunmaker himself, John M. Browning, and is a lasting tribute to his genius. 

 The SA-22 is sure to become your favorite plinker and varmint rifle. It is lightweight and easy to carry on a squirrel hunt, and easy to load for a day of plinking at the range. Construction quality and materials are top notch to ensure longevity and lasting beauty. The fine Walnut stock is sharply Checkered and polished to a sheen.

 The SA-22 ejects fired brass out the bottom of the receiver to make shooting a pleasure for right- and left-handed operators. Perhaps the most interesting feature is the ability to take the rifle down into two parts — the buttstock and receiver and the forearm and barrel — for storage or to simplify cleaning."

900,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3485900,For Sale:  1995 AM General Hummer,"Moore, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma","$ 27,560","Listed On: Thursday, September 11, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a 1995 AM General Hummer 4 hard door Open Top. It is not a H1. In order for it to be a H1 then the H2 would have had to have been in existence, which it was not. Let's face it, ISIS got some, the Russians stole some, the Chinese copied it, and this is cheaper than a fiberglass wannabe Gorilla kit. And it is the absolute most American piece of hardware short of an Apache helicopter.

This badassery is powered by a marine block 350 ci 5.7 gasoline engine/4L80-E trans with 153k miles. (Which AM General made for two years when gas was cheap).The exterior is painted with krylon flat tan, so scratches are a 30 second fix. This vehicle has power windows, power locks, power mirrors, Central Tire Inflation System, (not currently connected), and sits on modified H2 17"" wheels with 38x13.50 directional tires. Comes with owner's manual and PDF of parts list.

I had this vehicle for 5 years and have invested approximately $40k in restoration. I have receipts from work done. Ninety percent of the work was done by Benzin Motors in Tulsa or by myself. To include: New Hood, Hood Snubbers, CTIS repair, Air pump with female connection for power tools, Ugraded HVAC (entirely), Ball joints, lower control arms, Water pump, pitman arms, Entropy Machining Neoprene seat covers, Reupholstered interior, New top and bed cover, New battery, Complete coolant system flush, AM/FM with external connection, Rhino bumper mounted spare tire carrier, brush guard, windshield light bar, heavy duty rear bumper, military turn signals, new headlights, brakes, exhaust, 2"" body lift, main brake line, rebuilt transfer case, and receiver hitch for towing jeeps (kidding, former jeep owner here). Much more, much more. 

The vehicle comes with a lot of extra parts to include: another set of seats, 1 extra spare H2 wheel, set of 4 1-piece 16.5"" steel wheels, set of 4 16.5"" two-piece wheels, front skid plate, CTIS wheel connections, and other small pieces.

Issues, need to clean rust on passenger frame rail, and seepage on right rear brake caliper.

To alleviate any questions, I do not know the miles per gallon. I measure it in fun per mile. If you ask, this likely is not the vehicle for you. It is not bullet proof (see Open Top), it does not float, it does not have a turbo diesel, it is not a military surplus truck bought for $300 (I know, your uncle's cousin's friend bought 20 of them), it will not withstand an IED blast, and it is not a kit. Furthermore, it is not a Zombie apocalypse vehicle (See Open Top), because Zombies do not exist, and there is no warranty.

This vehicle is not for you if your tool kit is from sharper image, you mind people staring (H2 owners won't even look at you), or mind people asking you questions, (I am literally pumping gas into it and some dude asks me if it is a diesel), you cannot stand the taste of beer, you like to drive and accelerate fast, or you have yet to part with your My Little Pony collection.

This vehicle is for you if you can turn a wrench (righty tighty-lefty loosy), you dream of smashing a smart car, own a gun or two, you have money to buy it, enjoy prius driver sneers, you want to own an exceptional piece of Americana, you understand the love-hate relationship with vehicles, and you enjoy pulling up next to jacked up trucks and your tires are still bigger. 

The price $27,560. 85. I am negotiable with the $0.85. NADA prices it between $14k and $42k. No tire kickers please. Have money, have a plan, contact me to buy the vehicle I have wanted since I was a kid. No trades but would consider leasing for movies if it's starring Kiera Knightly."
