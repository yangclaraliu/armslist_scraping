The Daniel Defense adjustable buttstock is constructed of a proprietary blend of glass infused polymers and finished off with soft touch rubber overmolding in strategic points.  The new buttstock is precision formed for mil-spec receiver extensions to have very little forward or lateral play that is so common in many other buttstocks.  This eliminates the need for a tensioning device or friction lock.  All of this results in a durable buttstock that will give the shooter a comfortable and repeatable cheek weld and unprecedented control of the firearm.  The buttstock can be run with one of two included buttpads or without any buttpad at all to custom fit the rifle to whatever gear the operator must wear.  The buttpads come in two sizes: a thicker convex shape (0.8”), and a thinner concave shape (0.5”); designed to keep from snagging when shouldering the rifle.  Limited rotation QD swivel attachment points are integrated on both sides of the buttstock for ambidextrous sling connection.

From a few feet away it looks like stainless. The trigger is Illum's own design set at 8 ounces, and there's no creep that I can detect. The action has Remington barrel threads and will accept Remington type triggers. One neat thing is that the action was milled with an integral recoil lug (much like the current Surgeon Action). And the bolt is milled all in one piece-no soldered-on handles and is a 7mm whisper.You'll also note how slick and streamlined the scope rings are. Illum made those as well. His rings mount to the action via two screws from the inside of the ring, a very elegant set-up for sure. Has Bomar sights and Scope rings. Comes with dies and 100 rounds of brass."

Installed recurve trigger.
Added new, better pins on several things.
Added flat magazine stop so the mags drop right out instead of sticking.
Installed light firing pin spring and extended firing pin for reliable ignition.
Installed new (better) sights, old ones were dead.
Installed 13 pound hammer spring.
Installed full checker cocobolo wood grips from CZ custom.
Fitted safety pad to work with new hammer.
Polished internals and rails with microabrasive lapping film.

The bad:
I went a little overzealous on the safety pad fitting, and now the safety isn't reliable. It's enough to stop accidental discharge, but if you really pull on it, the hammer drops. 

Asking 650 OBO.

This may well be the finest variation on the foldable dump pouch- the 1"" webbing pull strap allows for instant deployment from the storage position with a firm pull. Also features velcro closure along the top lip for a hasty closure by slapping the pouch shut. When not in use, it folds up into a small and nearly unnoticeable square that is ready for instant deployment. 

Gen II upgrades introduced by PIG include: 500D construction for lighter weight and a more compact footprint, no box stitch on the flap for improved cosmetics, and grommet for drainage. The Gen II Loppy quite simply represents the best fold-up Dump Pouch available today!

Taurus Model 44 revolvers in 4"". I would consider 3"", but nothing bigger than 4"". Also, I would consider equal quality and prices revolvers in 44 mag. and possibly .357 mag.

M&P 9mm. of whatever size. 
M&P Shield 9mm.

Don't let the brand fool you. The 24/7 Tactical was developed to compete for a military contract against all the top names in gun making. This model was in the finals when the military canceled the contract. This model is no longer made and has been replaced with the G2 model with only a 4in barrel. This is a great weapon with several unique features. 5.25in barrel, DA/SA mode yet a Striker Fire system. Decocker/Safety and the ability to cycle the trigger repeatedly without racking the slide. Very unique for a striker fire system. Allows you to attempt firing again after a misfire. Easy take down, everything is similar to a Beretta and 1911 rolled into one with the plus of a striker fire system. 24/7 are becoming very sought after weapons. I have one in .45 and .40 that I will probably never sell. I got this one in a trade. I originally thought I would collect and hang on to this but decided not to keep the money tied up. Pick up a great weapon for just $425.00. See link below. May need to copy and paste.

The lower is Bushmaster.  I think the upper is another brand. It has C MB stamped on the carry handle just in front of the dials.  It has a collapsible stock and forward assist.  I purchased it used from a dealer in 2008/2009 and I have only put around 25 rounds through it.  It shoots very well and I was surprised with the accuracy at 100 and 200 yards using only the iron sights.  This rifle has a fixed carry handle.  If you want to change out to a flattop rifle, you can buy a stripped flattop upper receiver (around $70) and switch it out to a flattop.  Or keep it with the fixed carry handle.  You can mount optics on top of the carry handle.  Some people may like the optic sitting higher on the rifle so they do not have to lower their head as much to look through optics.

The barrel is 16 inches. It has ""C MP 5.56 NATO 1/9 HBAR stamped on it""  One source I found online said this means ""Colt Magnafluxed, in 5.56 NATO, 1 in 9 twist, with a HBAR profile"" In other words it is a Colt NATO 5.56 chambered barrel that's been MP (Magnetic Particle Tested).  The 1/9 is the twist rate.  The HBAR is a heavy barrel. 

Please email if interested.  I am absolutely firm at $525.  $525 is the price in Raleigh.  I will not drive much more than a few miles to meet at this price.  I am normally over the top accommodating, but at this price, I am not driving very far.  What is pictured is what is included - the rifle and 1 -30 round mag.  Remember, since this will be a private sale, you don't have to pay tax on this - that will save you some more money.

Thanks,

The original detective's sidearm!

'No dash' refers to the fact that this is the first generation of the model 10, as later generations were designated with a dash and a number. I.E model 10-3, model 10-7.
These early models are very desirable, since they often have features that later models do not. Such as the pinned barrel.

They're also quiet collectible, especially these old snubnose revolvers! Hard to find.

This came from a detective in Topeka, sadly the paperwork never showed up after I bought it.

.38 special, I wouldn't shoot modem +P loads in it too often, but it feeds target ammo like a champ.
Springs are all still nice and strong, locks up tight.
The bore looks good to me.

It has some holster wear, there's a spot on the S&W logo that looks like the finish was removed? and  the grips are a bit nicked up. It's certainly not perfect but not abused. I don't think it was shot much.

Overall, looks used but a very solid gun.

Comes with an old leather inside the waistband holster, I don't know if it's period or not, but it definitely has age. It's practically formed to the revolver now.

I looked on gunbroker and similar ones seem to go for around $450, those all have dashes. I haven't found a good comparable one.

Cash or trades, I can trade for just about anything.
Gold, silver, jewelry, bullion, coins, antiques, collectibles, old clocks and watches...

It has a hard to find 3 inch barrel, the original S&W wood grips, an extra set of custom wood grips, beautiful blued steel. I have the numbers traced back to about the mid 80's for the date of manufacture, sold in the Pittsburgh area. The gun has no internal locking mechanism like modern revolvers. The trigger and hammer are case-hardened, as was the standard, and they are as smooth as glass. Cylinder and yolk move smoothly and have proper timing, no slapping with my guns. All original, no kitchen table or gunsmith ""tuning"". This makes for a great shooter, a nice carry with the 3"" barrel, and a solid home defense revolver.

I am selling/trading because I find that I have too many revolvers in my safe. No real use for this one as it was an impulse buy years back.

Trades on a semi-auto. Preferably a Beretta or Sig. I have plenty of Glocks, thanks."

**MUST BE AN OREGON RESIDENT** 

Unsure of round count, but it's .308.. So I doubt much. 
Weight, unknown but this isnt a featherweight scout rifle. 

It's in GREAT condition. 

Comes with:
Blackhawk cheek riser
Springfield Gen 4 optics rail (plus orig box)
Unknown scope (inexpensive scope, unsure of magnification, I just had it laying around) 
OD green sling 
Spare upper forearm (brown, a $20 value) 
1 mag (maybe more for the right sale/trade) 

*****$1400 for everything (scope, sling, mount, cheek riser) 
Some flex room on that price. Email with yor offer. 
OR 
For $1200 with JUST a 20rnd mag. NO trades at that price! 
This is an M1A in great condition.. Seriously your offer of $700-900 is a joke. Find a Norinco for that. If you can't get an M1A(used) locally used for that low ball price, this ain't going to be you're ""great deal"" either. I'll match any (used) price (locally) for this exact set up. 

Serious, genuine interest emails only. Tire kickers and you low ball folks need not apply. Emails that contain more than a few questions are going to be ignored. I can't waste time on scammer emails and tire kicker emails anymore. If you want it great, if not stop wasting my time. 

I don't expect to get every penny back. 
This is just what my rifle totals with everything included.
Price breakdown: 
$1295 for the rifle
$150 for the optics mount
The rest is all the little stuff, scope cheek riser, sling.. 
Which brings it to $1465.

It is in great shape! The gun is a great shooter, and has been my CC gun for the last two years.  There are some very very slight holster wear marks on the edges of the slide near the muzzle and some very slight wearing on the bluing on the slide release.  

  I think it is an ideal CC gun.  You enter into the endless caliber debates but if you are going to carry a 380 APC, this is the gun.  Good & dependable, and not too expensive that dropping it, or scratching it will fill you with remorse.  It is a great size, large enough to get a good grip on, but light and small enough to conceal with a un-tucked T-shirt.  I have worn it all day with little discomfort.

This is a complete CC package.   Holster, ammo, case, spare mags.  This set up would cost at least $420.00 to duplicate new.  I am asking $325.00.

C. Higgins."" These products were well made and were popular with the company's historical core of rural and working-class consumers.
Like many other Sears products, the Sears firearms were originally made by major firearm manufacturers. The Model 20 was produced by High Standard Arms, as was the Model 88 revolver.
The J.C. Higgins brand for Sears sporting goods was replaced with the Ted Williams brand. Many of the more durable J.C. Higgins products are still available as second hand items.
The brand name, J. C. Higgins, was based on a real person, John Higgins who was a Sears employee. He moved from his birth country of Ireland to the United States in his late teens and began working for Sears in 1898. He spent his entire working career with Sears and was Vice President for the company for a period of time. He was actually born with no middle name but the Sears Co. presented the idea of labeling their sporting good line with his name and saw it more presentable labeling the brand as J.C. Higgins. He worked with the company until his retirement as head bookkeeper in 1930. Higgins died in 1950. His expertise in sporting goods or sports is unknown. Must be a Missouri resident and have a valid ID."

This Gen 4 26 has that ""teflon"" finish that alot of the gen 3's had. Very few of the 4's were lucky enough to get it. Do a search on google. Almost all gen 4's have a smooth, matte black finish. Problem is, that finish shows handling and holster marks the second you use it. Gen 4's come with a third magazine, stippling, larger ambidexterous mag ejector and interchangeable backstraps. The 26 Gen 4's have 3 total backstraps.

This finish looks shinier and even feels extremely indestructable. Just like the tefflon coating on really expensive pans. This gun is perfect. Not so much as a little mark on the barrel ramp (pic 2). I wish I could do a better job of explaining the look/feel of the finish other than it is much more attractive and after watching the youtube videos and reading everything people had to say about it on the Glock forums, compared to the flat matte finish which shows holster wear after each use, this one will take a beating and still look new. 

Some will say, ""a Glock is tool and I like it to look used..."" Well, my truck is too and I don't want it scratched up/faded after using it when it could look perfect for a long time. Just my opinion.

Has grip extenions for all 3 mags, slide release extension and glock tool along with all the stuff/papers/lock/backstraps, etc. that it came with.

Also has a very nice ankle holster for concealed carry. Can email pics of it.

It has a 3"" tapered barrel, bobbed hammer and does not contain a full underlug.  This revolver also contains a belt clip, which is an aftermarket accessory.  The quality on these older revolvers seems to be a little better than today's product from what I've read, but I do not have any experience with a modern Charter.  Hey, either you love them or hate them but I've had no problems with this pistol.  It does not have a box/paperwork but it does come with 20 rounds of Hornady ammunition.  I took it in on trade earlier this year as a big bore backup but my Glock 29 is filling that role.  Thus, I'm letting this go to a good home.  This will be a face to face sale in the Nashville area and a handgun carry permit owner is preferred."
