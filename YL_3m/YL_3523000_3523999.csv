Up for grabs is a Ruger, Mini-14 chambered in 5.56 (Can shoot either 5.56 or .223).

Good cosmetic condition, not perfect but still a beautiful piece.  


Reliability has been extraordinary with this rifle, no matter if the ammo was steel cased, brass, 5rd mag, 30rd mag, slow fire, or rapid fire, no hiccups experienced whatsoever with this rifle.

Accuracy seems to be slightly better than most comparable mini's, nothing to write home about but she gets the job done, and she gets it done EVERY time *Refer to reliability above*.

The glass on this rifle is a 4-12 Bushnell.

So here is the deal, I am willing to sell the rifle with or without magazines, see prices below.

Rifle (Rifle, scope mount, scope and sling ONLY, no magazines at all) $530

Each 5 round mag $20 (Have two)
Each 20 round mag $30 (Have one)
Each 30 round mag $35 (Have two)

Trades entertained but cash preferred as always.

Thanks"

With the proven stopping power of the .45 ACP and 7+1 capacity, you won’t be under-gunned. To make it disappear more easily while carrying concealed, we bobbed the back of the mainspring housing. To reduce overall weight, the frame and mainspring housing are made from anodized aluminum. We included an undercut trigger guard and our “chain-link” grip treatment on the front strap and mainspring housing to help control recoil and give it a distinctive look. The slide and small parts are treated in the same Duty Black finish that we use on all of our black guns. We fitted dual-colored tritium lamps for faster low-light target acquisition and a white target ring on the front to aid in front sight concentration. The CCO uses a medium-length trigger to facilitate faster draws and better fit in the hand. The gun is rounded out with our stippled shadow grips. Like all Dan Wesson models, this gun is both beautiful and functional."

No failures of any kind, feeds variety ammo no issues, known to be a very reliable gun. It is an excellent choice as a carry gun, and user friendly for a woman as well. I just purchased it and decided not to keep it, has no issues, perfect as-new condition.

Easy to use 3-dot sights for quick sight acquisition. Fun gun to shoot, doesn’t punish you like the micro-pistols or mouse guns do, nor blowback models like the PPK and many other 380's.

I have several that I'm interested in buying online but I thought I would check and see if anyone had one locally that they're willing to part with.  Not interested in SKS's, already have one.  Not looking for AK pistol's either.

I have up to $500 to spend on something depending on condition and what it comes with.  Cash in hand and I'm a serious buyer, so feel free to let me know what you have.

We developed some awesome rounds for this gun (150gr Hornady SST's) that hit bullet on bullet at 100 yards. Made with CCI Primers and varget powder these things hit really hard and stay together well. Only selling because I have 2 .270's. 

I will sell the gun by itself or with the Scope. The scope is a Burris Fullfield II 3x9x40 with bullet plex. Very nice for the price point. 

Anyway the gun is $600 and the scope is $150 with rings. The gun comes with 50 rounds of ammunition and a hard case."

405,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3523405,For Sale:  EUROARMS ROGERS & SPENCER .44 CAL REVOLVER,"tween reno and carson, Reno, Nevada",$ 350,"Listed On: Friday, September 26, 2014",Muzzle,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Rogers & Spencer cap and ball Percussion Revolver was originally manufactured in Willowvale, NY about 1863-65. In January 1865, the United States government contracted with Rogers & Spencer for 5,000 of the solid frame pistols. Delivery on the contract was made too late for war service, and the entire lot was sold as scrap to Francis Bannerman and Son in 1901. Bannerman then sold the pistols throughout the first quarter of the 20th Century. Many original Rogers & Spencer revolvers are seen today in excellent, near mint condition. The Rogers and Spencer Army Model Revolver was actually an improvement of earlier pistols produced by the firm - the Pettingill and Freeman revolvers. The Pettingills were produced in the late 1850's and early 1860's, and were double action revolvers. The Pettingills were ahead of their time, being designed as hammerless pistols, which were popular in the last decade of the 19th Century, but certainly too avant garde for Army purchasers. The Navy Model was a .34 caliber, of which less than 1,000 were produced. The Army Model was a .44 caliber, and only about 3,400 were produced in the early 1860's. The Freeman Army Model Revolver was a solid frame .44 caliber pistol with a round 7 1/2"" barrel, of which 2,000 are believed to have been produced in 1863-64, and in appearance the Freeman resembles a Starr Revolver. The Rogers & Spencer is an improved Freeman, with a less severe grip style, a heavier frame and a stronger octagon barrel of identical 7 1/2"" length. Interestingly, the Rogers & Spencer design is eligible for N-SSA competitions because the contract was consummated before the end of hostilities. The current reproduction of the Rogers & Spencer Army Model Revolver was produced in Italy by Euroarms.

The rifle has not been shot, it comes in the original box, paperwork, and I have an aftermarket soft carrying case also still sealed in the package that was ordered just for this rifle (cost $40)

The only think I have done is made sure the rifle functioned by chambering an empty case with just the primer. NO BULLETS HAVE BEEN SHOT THROUGH IT! I just wanted to make sure it functioned as it should, which it does.

The rifle has been taken out of the box an handled, I have seen one or two LIGHT marks in the wood were it rubbed up against something, but the finish is excellent, wood is excellent, solid 99% condition. It would get marks from sitting in a gun cabinet, it's as perfect as it can get without still being sealed inside the box.

It was bought it for $569.99 + tax new from Cabela's, plus the $40 soft case. Came to over $620

From the Wilson Combat website:

There are times when extreme accuracy and the ability for rapid follow-up shots are the most important criteria in selecting a rifle. Those were the primary objectives the engineers at Wilson Combat® were working toward when they designed the SS-15 Super Sniper – and the result far exceeded our expectations. It has a 20” long, 1-in-8 twist, heavy-weight, fluted, stainless steel premium match-grade barrel – optimized for accuracy with the longer, heavier bullets frequently used for longer range shooting. The crispness of the trigger is unequalled in AR style rifles; it is tuned for a 4 pound pull. This gun is engineered, designed, and built to deliver unmatched accuracy at 300, 400, or even 500 yards – and it does, in an almost unbelievable fashion."

From the Wilson Combat website:

Wilson Combat®’s Professional series of pistols are some of the most popular we build. The Elite Professional is the newest member of that series. It includes the best of several of our models, enhanced with a 4 1/16” version of the hand-fit, heavy flanged cone match grade barrel pioneered on our Tactical Elite. With this barrel, we have reduced the slide length by a full inch, giving you a speed advantage in target acquisition with the shorter sighting plane. The frame is the comfortable full size you’re accustomed to in your traditional 1911 pistol, but with the shorter slide the result is excellent concealability. An excellent choice for daily carry, The Elite Professional provides the rapid shot-to-shot recovery and reduced recoil one would expect from a compensated pistol. You can be sure of 100% functional reliability, fast handling, rapid shot-to-shot recovery and accuracy when you need it."

The HIPERTOUCH® 24C is the competition version of high precision fire-control drop-ins for installation in AR-15® and AR-10® type rifles. The HIPERTOUCH® name is short forHIgh PERformance TOUCH, 24 for user adjustable trigger weights and C for competition marksmen like 3-Gunners. It installs and functions just like the HIPERTOUCH® 24 but with half the pre-travel and a faster reset. For installation and operational features of the HIPERTOUCH® family of AR fire-controls, go to the HIPERTOUCH® 24 page and watch the videos. View this graphic, AR-15LowerCavity.PDF. HIPERTOUCH® FCGs may not work in lowers with pivot holes that are outside the MIL-Spec dimensions shown inRED.

The Genius of the HIPERTOUCH® Fire-Control

HIPERTOUCH® FCGs have uniquely solved two problems with stock AR triggers and AR trigger upgrades respectively: 1) High Trigger Weight, and 2) Low Hammer Fall Energy.

Trigger Weight: The real culprit behind high trigger pull weight is high sear impingement force that produces high friction. To get around that, the stock “AR” trigger and hammer mechanical advantage was changed and the toggle spring feature added to reduce the impingement force on the trigger sear. Designers of two-stage products changed the functional location of the primary sear; HIPERFIRE®'s design has not, retaining the stock design’s single-stage simplicity. This is important for when stock triggers are pulled, the hammer cam-action signals hammer fall is imminent. When 2-stage triggers are pulled, the final higher weight stage also signals hammer fall. This can lead to the flinching problem we all know about. Some like to say the better 2-stage triggers have glass rod or candy-cane like breaks to sell the idea that they don't signal hammer fall. In any case, the HIPERTOUCH® 24C does not signal hammer fall because the trigger weight is constant over the entire stroke.

Hammer Fall Energy: HIPERTOUCH® features the unique toggle spring functionality that reduces trigger weight, but while doing so, it also increases hammer fall energy by over 35% over the MIL-spec stock design and every trigger upgrade in the market. This permits the shooter to ignite hard MIL and foreign primers as well as hard to ignite 22 rimfire ammunition.

HIPERTOUCH® FCGs retain Eugene Stoner's design of simple elegance while remaining very robust, without the gritty feel. Shooting for high accuracy is no longer an almost impossible chore. It's no longer necessary to improve the stock performance by manually polishing the high-friction trigger and hammer sear surfaces, where the end result was only marginally better anyway.

Ambitious sportsmen and marksmen have been turning to trigger upgrades with varying degrees of satisfaction. The better replacements have been one and two-stage triggers with fixed final weights ranging from between 2½ and 4½ pounds with what some have called a glass rod or candy cane trigger break. Some of these devices require factory or user calibration, maintenance, and/or replacement for wear or doubling. Some of these devices also employ reduced power springs, which have compromised reliable ignition for a ""dream"" trigger weight.

The HIPERFIRE® ""AR"" accessory response to those shooter’s looking for a single-stage and very much improved, match quality, “AR” trigger upgrade that delivers high performance is the HIPERTOUCH® 24C. It nests in unmodified standard AR-15® and AR-10® type lower receivers in the same way as stock “AR” triggers and hammers without having to remove the safety selector. It is comprised of three subassemblies: the trigger, hammer, and toggle, spring groups. All the parts are made from carbon steel alloys that have been hardened for wear and strength. It features exceptionally low trigger weights with smooth pre-travel, a very clean hammer release with no report to break, match action response, and faster hammer lock-up. Only now with HIPERTOUCH® trigger and hammer actions does ""AR"" trigger ""squeeze"" have real meaning.

Additionally, the HIPERTOUCH® 24C also sports the HIPERSHOE™ adjustable finger pad, which can be positioned at five (5) different vertical detent locations along the 24C's straight trigger. By changing location, the shooter can further adjust pre-travel and weight within a broader range than without it as desired for even more trigger responsiveness. Also, the adjustable pad lengthens slightly the extension of the finger to the pad with respect to the pistol grip, which alters the feel and dexterity of the finger on the trigger for added comfort and/or control."

Comes in factory box with paperwork. Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun. It is just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached. The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever or a manual safety by a simple parts change.

Do you love freedom? 

If squirrels are your problem, this fine weapon system is your solution. 
Get your Ghillie suit on, and truly become the ultimate sniper as you pull the charging handle and load one of the ten tube-fed rounds into the chamber. While this rifle does include a scope, and fixed open sights, neither are necessary. The bullet pretty much goes where you want it to go, with little or no effort on the part of the shooter.  The bullets say ""caution: range up to 1 1/2 miles"" right on the box and this beast will mostlikely shoot sub-moa the entire distance, in even the most inexperienced hands. 

From first glance, you'll know you're looking at quality. Features like the beautifully engraved ""squirrel standing on the Pentagon"" appear on both sides of the walnut stock, and the trigger is polished metal to stand out from the rest of the black painted metal. Truly breathtaking.

We'll call this firearm the ""SDSRS"" or ""Marlin 60"", because the official name is still classified. 

Price? Kind of hard to put a price on something that's essentially priceless. So here's what I'll do: I'll trade this for your .22 pistol, which I fully expect to be equally magnificent. Need me to throw in a few bucks? Shoot me an email. Let's talk business. 

**update**
This is actually a Glenfield Model 60 (made 60's-80's by Marlin) and is in incredible condition.

From the Wilson Combat website:
The Ultralight Carry Compact has all the cutting-edge features of the Ultralight Carry in a lighter smaller package. A 1"" shorter slide and ½ inch smaller gripframe than a full-size 1911 ensure that you will always have your Ultralight Carry Compact when needed. The fluted heavy bull barrel is not only attractive, but also functional-it traps dirt and debris that can otherwise cause a malfunction. Try an Ultralight Carry Compact and see why it is quickly becoming a top concealed carry choice of seasoned tactical shooters."

The camo on the gun is pretty faded away from very hard use, it also has a rectangle spot that is all black from takin a sticker off the stock. The action is still good and it still shoots fine. The worst part of this gun is the barrel, i was teal huntin yesterday and got mud in the choke an went to shoot a duck and the tip exploded, so therefore it now has a 26 inch barrel and it wont accept a choke tube at all.

Most of these rifles go between $400-$500. This one is in much nicer shape than most, and for $500, would come with a $200 scope, a $100 sling, and a $40 box of ammo. You can offer me less, but I keep the sling and will swap the Bushnell with a Barksa.

This rifle is sighted in at 100 yards with 150 grain ammo.Cleaned, Lubed, and Ready for hunting season.

I do not need to get rid of it and wouldn't mind keeping it, but I wouldn't mind trading it for something I may use more either."

997,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3523997,"For Sale:  CZ52 Pistol Set - 7.62x25, Early Gray Phosphate w/Ammo NICE","Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 425,"Listed On: Friday, November 28, 2014",Handguns,CZ USA                                                                                ,no type,Single Shot                                                                                ,Pistol,"This CZ52 pistol is one of the early imports that still has it's original gray phosphate finish. Later imports that appear to be blued or flat black were refinished before being imported. Of course there is nothing wrong with the refurbed guns. However if you are a purist and/or a collector then the real deal in it's original ""as issued"" condition might be more desirable.

I took this particular pistol on trade recently and it is in absolutely excellent shape with only the slightest wear around the muzzle from being holstered. I rate it an easy 95%+ gun. The grips are the original brown Bakelite and they not chipped or cracked. Then the bore is bright and in great shape which is important since many of these pistols have dark or worse bores from the corrosive ammo they used.

This pistol fires the 7.62x25 round which is ONE HOT NUMBER! We really don't have any truly equivalent here in the USA, and the combination of the small diameter .30 caliber bullet along with the extra high velocity is the recipe for a round that penetrates like crazy. This is especially true when using some of the hotter surplus ammo like the Polish, Czech or Bulgarian stuff, and I think you'll be quite surprised when you shoot some of it if you haven't before. There's no problem though because the CZ52 uses a super strong roller lock up system so shooting the military surplus ammo out there is not a problem.

Pistol comes with 2 magazines one of which is original to the pistol with the same gray phosphate finish. The other is a brand new blued model that's never had a round loaded in it. There is also an original cleaning rod, and a real CZ52 green nylon rope lanyard plus an operators manual printed in English.

Additionally there is an early original holster that is somewhat unusual because it's made of pig skin. It's in very good condition without any tears or bad stitches. The majority of the CZ52 holsters you'll see are light colored leather. So the pig skin version is another feature that collectors favor. You probably can't see this well from the photos because my iPad lacks the resolution to capture such fine details but it's very obviously pig skin when you see it in person.

Finally there is an assortment of 252 rounds of 7.62x25 ammo - both military and commercial that will allow you to see what you like best. If you are like me I think you'll notice that the military ammo shoots hotter than the commercial stuff especially the Bulgarian. Ammo included is:

50 round box PPU commercial FMJ non-corrosive
50 round box S&B commercial FMJ non-corrosive
72 round box Romanian Military FMJ, steel inner jacket/magnetic, corrosive primed
(5) 16 round bundles Bulgarian Military, FMJ, steel inner jacket/magnetic, corrosive primed

Asking price for the package is $425 with pickup in the Brandon area only - no shipping. Buyer must be a Florida resident who is at least 21 years old. A bill of sale will be provided.

If you add up the cost/value of the holster set, lanyard, spare mag, manual and ammo I think you'll find this set to be priced very reasonably - especially for a pistol in this nice of a condition.
