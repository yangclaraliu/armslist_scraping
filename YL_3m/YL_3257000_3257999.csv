It has a pristine AV action and trigger and was built with a Douglas barrel according to my gunsmith.  It is bedded and floated well although not top notch in appearance but who looks in there. The stock is an amazing full tiger stripe on both sides throughout. Wood finish is OK but nothing special. My intent was to completely redo the wood with shaping, checkering and all to dress it up. This will make a nice, serious thumper as is, nothing at all wrong with her, or could be dressed up to be spectacular with a little woodwork. The 338-06 AI can be shot as straight 338-06 by just necking up 30-06 brass with regular dies. Also you can use the fire-formed brass  to bump it up another 100-200 fps with AI dies. I got .78"" at 50 yds with 1st pass 200 grain loads, looks like with load work-up it will be a shooter. Priced with dies, rings but no scope. $800

Some history of the military variant of this rifle:
The RPK is a 7.62x39mm light machine gun of Soviet design, developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov in the late 1950s, parallel with the AKM assault rifle. It was created as part of a program designed to standardize the small arms inventory of the Red Army, where it replaced the 7.62x39mm RPD light machine gun. The RPK continues to be used by the armed forces of countries of the former Soviet Union and certain African and Asian nations. The RPK was also manufactured in Bulgaria, Poland, and Romania."

Produced between 1950 and 1954. The right side of the barrel is marked with the two line address. Front blade and rear frame notch sights. 
BBL: 2 inch round 
Finish: Blue/Anodized 
Grips: Wood 
Serial Number: 21328*
Condition: Excellent. This is the first of two models of the Cobra and is recognizable by its un-shrouded ejector rod. The Cobra is the same overall size and configuration as the famous Colt Detective Special and uses the same ""D"" frame, except that the Cobra's frame is constructed of lightweight aluminum alloy as compared to the all-steel frame of the Detective Special. The revolver retains most of the original finish with a few light scratches, handling marks, and some minor discoloration from many years of service with a Detective of a Los Angeles County Police Department during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. This revolver weighs 15 ounces unloaded. The wood grips are in excellent condition. Mechanically, the revolver is in excellent condition.

Sources place the shipping date as c.1959 and I believe the manufacture date would be somewhere between 1957 and 1959, serial number 3654XX. I had the gun checked over by a local gunsmith/appraiser (Projx Inc. of Bluffton, SC) and he give it a 99-100% rating. The lockup and timing are perfect, the bluing is deep and beautiful, there is no holster wear whatsoever and only some very light handling marks. The gun wears the original wooden grips with matching serial numbers and includes the vintage box and tools. As you can see, the box shows some substantial wear but it is intact. Aside from the bore mop, the tools appear to be in unused condition. The original VCI paper is present, although wrinkled and torn. You will not find many available examples of this particular firearm in a better and more original condition than this one.

With the help of a friend I have tried to take the best pictures possible. You will notice that in some of the pics the bluing appears a little cloudy. This was a combination of South Carolina humidity and wiping down with a silicone cloth. I used a soft microfiber towel to wipe it clean and the bluing is in fact shiny and miles deep. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns but rest assured, the purchaser will be receiving an outstanding specimen of vintage Smith wheelguns. My asking price is $950 or best reasonable offer."

MK 262 Bullets,"St. Peters, St. Louis, Missouri",$ 100,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 8, 2014",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"One sealed box of 500 Sierra .22 caliber 77 grain MatchKing OTM bullets with cannelure. These are the very same bullets loaded in Black Hills MK 262 Mod 1 Ammo, which is some of the best 5.56x45mm NATO ammo ever to come in a battle pack. Black Hills Ammunition worked for years, first with the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit (AMU) and later the U.S. Navy, on a long-term project that resulted in MK 262 Mod 1. Civilian shooters can now hand load that exact same round for improved downrange performance, accuracy, and lethality. The MK 262 Mod 1 projectile is an open-tipped match (OTM) bullet, though it does not expand in the manner of a conventional hollowpoint. In fact, the hollow cavity is not there to induce expansion; it’s there to put the majority of weight towards the projectile’s rear so that it is more stable in flight and increase accuracy. When the bullet strikes soft tissue, the heavier base comes around and causes the bullet to yaw, or tumble. The hollow nose cone breaks off and often the bullet fragments at the cannelure. This happens across a wide range of the velocity spectrum, which is why MK 262 Mod 1 proved effective in SBRs in addition to the longer-barreled SPRs. I spoke with a friend who has had multiple combat tours in both Iraq and Afghanistan. His experiences as both a Special Forces sniper team leader and assaulter offered a unique perspective on ammo performance. As a sniper, MK 262 was his preferred round (when he was not using 7.62x51mm NATO), and he said simply, “It’s the best, most accurate round the Army has ever issued"".

This is not a issued 1903a4. If it was an actual 1903a4 the price would be 5,000$. What it is, a 1903a3 built with correct parts into a 1903a4 and meets CMP standards. It has the correct Redfield scope mount. It has the correct Redfield scope rings. Rings, 2 sets of 3/4, one high, one low. Mounted is a Weaver K4 scope that was commercially available during WWII with 1in rings. Comes with 2   Weaver 29S scopes. Exactly the same as military issue but are the commercial ones. One of the 29S scopes has a broken wire and needs a rebuild. It has the correct low profile safety to clear the scope. I do not have bore or barrel gauges so don't ask. The only part that isn't exactly like paw paw shot at the krauts is the Timmney trigger because it feels so good!  This is a 500yd gun all day long. shoots a 7in spread @ 500yds with surplus ammo. Shoots a 5in spread @500yds with match grade ammo. This is a package deal. What you see is what you get. The scope is currently set for 250yds zero with a 1.5 degree cant left for a right hand shooter. Ive only put 80rds down the barrel since ive owned it. It takes great skill to shoot this rifle with precision. The delay between shot and hit is something awesome!!!!!!!!"

I've been carrying it for awhile but its in good shape with no issues.

Its had a trigger job to lighten the trigger up a bit and aftermarket scalloped grips for easier use of speedloaders.  Comes with its case, keys, and paperwork and I'll include 2 HKS 36 speedloaders.  

I'm picking up a different revolver so I'd like to trade this for a subcompact or pocket sized handgun in 9mm or .40.  Primarily looking for a Glock 26 or 27, Ruger SR40c (not interested in the SR9c), newer model Beretta Nano, maybe a S&W M&P9c or 40c, or similar.

At the range I met this guy and his 13 year old daughter who had a pair of custom modified Ruger 10/22's. I was in awe to watch this young girl shoot dime sized groups at 80 yards. They let me shoot theirs and I was hooked. That was until they told me how much was in their guns price wise. For a good competitive Ruger (with all the fun stuff) you'll be over a grand. At the time I had just put the finishing touches on my AR15 and my $600 gun is now a $2800 gun. So when I told my wife about spending another grand or more on a .22, needless to say she had a fit. That's when I got the bright idea to see if I could modify my Marlin. It was always a great gun but had the crappy original trigger at 7 lbs. I found this guy up in Illinois who is an expert on model 60's and sent my gun to him to work on. He is the only one in the country that has a patented after market trigger for the model 60. It's two stage flat trigger  breaks around 12 ounces. I also had him go through the gun and polish the charger and ramp, replace springs and what not. Then I put the synthetic stock and and custom charging handle on it. Shoots like a dream.
All that being said I eventually got the Ruger I wanted but it cost me $1300. A lot run double that for the VERY serious competitors.
I believe that the Marlin is a great starter gun for someone who wants to learn the basics about .22 competition shooting.
If money is not an issue I would go with the Ruger but if you want to make sure you or a loved one is serious and will stick with it before you sink a grand into a gun, consider the Marlin.
Comes with custom Katz 2 stage trigger that breaks at 12oz to 1lb, ATI Marlin Fiberforce Stock and Custom stainless steel, gnarled charging handle. Also included is the original Walnut stock with the Squirrels on both sides, carrying case and a Tasco World Class 3x9x40 Scope."

The Magpul STR (Storage/Type Restricted) is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. A storage-capable version of the CTR®, the STR has improved cheek weld and two water resistant battery tubes on a compact, reinforced polymer A-frame design.
 A shielded operation lever and supplemental friction locking system prevent accidental operation and minimize excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability and accuracy.
The STR incorporates two integral sling loops, a reversible push-button QD sling mount, and a replaceable 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

The Mil-Spec Model includes a standard 0.30"" rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

The 6061 T-6 aircraft grade aluminum components are anodized in a non-glare matte black finishing for maximum durability and ease of maintenance. 
Additional components are built from 1018 cold rolled steel and plated with a mil-spec black oxide finish. The proprietary STZ push button cylindrical breech lock design is 3 times stronger than existing lever lock systems. The Havoc is designed to mount on any mil spec rail system. Installation simply requires sliding the launcher onto the bottom rail of the handguard and tightening two set screws which are included.
Slide-forward Breach Loading Design
Push-button Breach Lock
One-piece Tube & Grip
Supports 5 3/4"" USCG Munitions

The Kaos Stock System series allows you to take your existing rail mounted Havoc launcher and turn it into a stand-alone weapon system. The Side-Folding model features an AGP folding stock and is compatible with most aftermarket AR-15 pistol grips. 
Mil-spec A2 Pistol Grip
Mil-spec 1913 Picatinny Top Rail
AGP Side-Folding Stock
Compatible with 12"" Rail Mounted Havoc Launchers

Asking $650.00 shipped and $625.00 FTF. Will trade for 1-4 optics for an AR, Sig P220, 226, or 229 pistols, AR15, or anything else interesting. 
The launcher is the  one in the middle."

It is the articulating type rider mower - not quite a zero-turn mower but pretty darn close. The pics show the condition of the mower and a couple of them show how it articulate (or bends in the middle). This is a finishing type mower - however if you install the bio-clip attachement to the rear of the deck (see pics), it becomes a mulcher.

 If you are looking for a mower that will put an excellent finish on your large lawn, this is the one. The rear discharge keeps the visible clippings down and you don't have that ugly dead clumps of grass all over your landscape. This mower has the mowing deck in front of the wheels for easier access to those areas you need to get close to...and the BEST feature (in my opinion) is the deck flips up for easy cleaning or blade changes - a real nice feature!!

The patented Magpul ACS (Adaptable Carbine/Storage) – Mil-Spec Model is a drop-in replacement buttstock for AR15/M16 carbines using mil-spec sized receiver extension tubes. A streamlined, anti-snag profile shields the release latch to prevent accidental activation. Similar to the Magpul CTR®, the ACS also features a supplemental friction lock system that minimizes excessive stock movement for enhanced weapon stability and accuracy*. Dual, rear accessible, water-resistant battery storage tubes and an integral storage compartment in the butt of the stock provides multiple storage options. The ACS comes standard with a 0.30"" thick rubber butt-pad which provides positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage even with body armor or modular gear.

 I am not the original owner so I do not know the year of manufacture. I will provide you the serial #, on request, if you have an avenue to find out this information. I'm guessing early-mid 70s. The gun has seen use but locks up very tight. This is the Original Chiefs Special.

 * Serrated ramp front sight
 * Pinned Barrel
 * 2 screw
 * Square butt wooden grips
 * 2"" snubnose barrel
 * A set of aftermarket rubber grips are included. They fit snugly and give the revolver a smaller overall length which I find is better for front pocket carry.
 * A DeSantis mini-scabbard custom fit black holster is included. Fits like a glove. Top notch gear.
 * A bag of 158 grain FMJ Leadnose reloads for practice are included. (QTY 21)
 * A bag of 125 grain JHP Speer self defense rounds are included. (QTY 45)
 * A camo softcase will be included for storage.

 It could use some cosmetic touches if you are into that stuff. I clean & wipe down all my guns after use. This one functions at 100%

 Overall, I'd probably rate the cosmetic look at 85-90%. It's not a bad looking revolver but I know some people are picky. I can take closer pictures from different angles if you text or email me.

It will be necessary for you to pick it up for transport so please take that into account. Below are the manufacturer's notes on this safe. Also be advised that this safe has the electronic key pad only, not the electronic/combo dial hybrid EMP entry.

I’ve decided to part with a very unique and rare item, the ultimate home defense/tactical rifle accessory:  a Glare MOUT.

The Glare MOUT is compact and lightweight; it is a non-lethal visual disruption laser (dazzler) used for hail and warning.  It is ideally suited for small arms weapon integration (MIL-STD-1913 rail and LaRue mount), as well as handheld use.  The Glare MOUT is a shockingly bright, green dazzler beam and sends an irrefutable, multi-lingual, cross-cultural message that can be activated by push button or cable switch.  Used by the military in high threat areas throughout the world, it is very rugged and reliable.

The Glare MOUT comes in a padded case (MOLLE compatible), with batteries, lens flip cover, cable switch and more.  New in case.  If you can find them, they are very expensive (~$6,500 new), but I’m looking for something else to have fun with.  Not sure on trade value yet, but definitely over $1,000.  If not up to this amount, please be prepared to add cash or additional items, as necessary.  I will consider shipping for the right trade."

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system. It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator."

His only reply was some comments that were open to interpretation.  Here is a copy of his reply "" If you have a problem with the ammo I sold you, why is it hat you would not contact me? Instead, you choose to badmouth me on Armslist. I have never had anyone complain about this ammo. While it is possible that there was a bad batch given to me from my manufacturer, they stand behind their ammo and I stand behind it as well. If you would like me to replace the ammo with a brand new batch of hollow points, I will do that, but not till you take that posting down from armlist."" 

1 Not If I had a problem  I did have major  problems with this ammo  in front of expert shooter's at the range. That hurt my reputation and gave me more problems to deal with. 

2 Don't know what he means when he writes ""never had anyone complain by about this ammo"" because I am sure complaining about it. Maybe this is a new batch and no one else bought it.  

You see what I mean by open to interpretation? 

I bought 500 rounds previously from the guy in Fernely with no problems except I paid a little to much because I seen in his ad's that the price dropped for the next 500 rounds.  But when I called him he would not sell me 500 rounds it had to be 1000 rounds at 250 dollars.  Then he told me he added a extra hand full of round nose. When I examined the contents of the box there was no round nose bullets. 

I was glad to read that you did not have the same experience as I did.  Hope you enjoy the rest of your bullets.  That's what target practice is suppose to be a relaxing enjoyable experience.   

That guy in Fernely sure did mess up my shooting time and that is what I am on the war path about. 

Thank you for your reply and understanding.

Instead, you choose to badmouth me on Armslist. I have never had anyone complain about this ammo. While it is possible that there was a bad batch given to me from my manufacturer, they stand behind their ammo and I stand behind it as well. If you would like me to replace the ammo with a brand new batch of hollow points, I will do that, but not till you take that posting down from armlist."" 

1 Not If I had a problem  I did have major  problems with this ammo  in front of expert shooter's at the range. That hurt my reputation and gave me more problems to deal with. 

2 Don't know what he means when he writes ""never had anyone complain by about this ammo"" because I am sure complaining about it. Maybe this is a new batch and no one else bought it.  

You see what I mean by open to interpretation? 

I bought 500 rounds previously from the guy in Fernely with no problems except I paid a little to much because I seen in his ad's that the price dropped for the next 500 rounds.  But when I called him he would not sell me 500 rounds it had to be 1000 rounds at 250 dollars.  Then he told me he added a extra hand full of round nose. When I examined the contents of the box there was no round nose bullets. 

I was glad to read that you did not have the same experience as I did.  Hope you enjoy the rest of your bullets.  That's what target practice is suppose to be a relaxing enjoyable experience.   

That guy in Fernely sure did mess up my shooting time and that is what I am on the war path about.

980,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3257980,For Sale:  OSS Suppressor 5.56 BPR1 & SRM4,"East Valey, Phoenix, Arizona","$ 1,150","Listed On: Tuesday, July 8, 2014",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The next generation of suppressors. OSS Misson has changed the world of suppressors with the introduction of their modular suppressor system. This innovative design combines the best of sound reduction, back pressure elimination and consistent point of impact.

The BPR1 is an over the barrel suppressor with several revolutionary capabilities. Instead of just trapping the expanding gases inside a baffle, the OSS BPR1 controls their expansion. This function virtually eliminates excessive backpressure that ALL current generation cans produce. In short, this means you can attach the OSS can to your AR rifle and experience virtually 0 gas blow back. No more tuning your gas system for use with a can. The OSS can also eliminates the increased rate of fire on select fire weapons, prevents excessive fouling due to increased back pressure, and allows the gun to operate as if there was no can attached. This reduced back pressure prevents toxic gases and excessive lead particulates from being forced into your face.

The BPR1 also has a patented self-tightening function. Every time the weapon fire, the device tightens. It is impossible to loosen the OSS BPR system through shooting.

The over barrel design of the BPR1 means you are adding minimal weight to the front of your weapon. Instead of attaching a 7 inch can to the end, you are essentially only extending your overall length by 3.9 inches. But don't be fooled by other over barrel designs. The OSS an controls the expansion of gases with the entire length of the can thanks to their patented design. This over barrel design keeps the weapon balanced which helps the operator control the weapon and prevent fatigue.

The last piece to the puzzle is the OSS SRM4 (signature reduction module). As the name implies, this device is designed and engineered to reduce the visual and audio signature even further than a traditional can. The SRM is attached inline to the BPR. And like the BRP system, the outer housing can be removed for caliber conversion.

The over barrel design does require a 14.5"" or longer barrel.

Anyone who is a serious buyer and wants to meet for a Demo, I can arrange that. I am located in the east valley and will travel within Phoenix area.

Price is $1150 for the full 5.56 system."
