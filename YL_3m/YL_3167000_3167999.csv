This is a real nice 1944 Ithaca 1911 with all correct parts including the finish & magazine, this would be a nice addition to any gun collection. The ser. no range is : 1838xxx
I took this gun to several experts and the results were the same with all of them, this gun has all the correct parts with correct inspection marks and has the original parkerized finish with all the tell tale signs to verify.
This is the rarer 1911 Colt 45 made by Ithaca, not the easier to find Colts or Remington Rands.  This 1911 has the harder to find Flannery barrel which is also properly stampped and has a nice shinny bore with very little frosting.  All parts function correctly and are still fairly tight allowing the gun to shoot accurately and flawlessly. This exact 1911 sells for around $2,800  and yes you can find a nice refinished or copy for less but the value of an original like this go up every year.
Im only looking for $2,500 cash or a newer S&W or XDS carry gun plus $2,000 cash"

M9A1: The Evolution of a Classic Tactical Pistol

The Beretta M9A1 tactical pistol evolved from the base design of the battle-tested and proven M9, with input from military and law enforcement agencies around the world. Developed to meet the demanding requirements of the US Marine Corps, the M9A1 incorporates the established reliability and performance of the M9, with added features needed for the ever-changing missions of peacekeeping forces. Thanks to its accuracy, durability and versatility, it also makes a superb choice for personal or home-defense as well as concealed carry.


Extra-Durable Pistol and Magazines

Just as the US Marines are rightly famous for their reliability and endurance, the M9A1 is built to be ultra-tough and always dependable. Besides the superior steels of which it is constructed, it also features a unique sand-resistant magazine that was developed for the sandy environments of Iraq and Afghanistan and comes standard only on the M9A1. The special PVD coating reduces friction, while the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of grit accumulation within the round column, greatly increasing the reliability and functioning of the M9A1 even in the most extreme conditions.


Packed with Features

As you take the M9A1 out of the box, it won’t fail to impress you for the abundance of tactical features it offers. Firstly, there is an integral Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail situated under the barrel, for easy attachment of accessories such as tactical lights and laser aiming devices. The 3-dot sight system on this pistol is optimized for quick acquisition of the target, while the front and backstrap of the frame are checkered to ensure a positive purchase no matter the weather conditions. Also, the magazine well has an aggressive internal bevel to facilitate fast tactical reloads in combat as well as competition situations.



Soft-Shooting, Accurate and Easy to Maintain

At the range, the M9A1 will impress you for its low recoil, as well as its accuracy. As one of the ultimate evolutions of a best-in-class military and law-enforcement pistol, it will reliably feed commercial ammo, even with more open hollow-point designs. Maintenance is easy: this pistol requires no tools for disassembly, while the reverse is even faster and easier, with the disassembly lever returning into the locked position automatically. Thanks to all these features, the M9A1 is an ideal tactical pistol that will meet the requirements of the most demanding users.

DESCRIPTION:   
For sale is a pre-owned, excellent condition Springfield Armory 1911 TRP. As with all of our pre-owned firearms, this firearm was sent back to our gunsmith, where it was disassembled, inspected, cleaned, reassembled, function checked, and test fired. There is not a nick or scratch on the frame or slide. It appears to have been fired very little; please look at the pictures to see how close to new this firearm is. 

The TRP series of 1911s from Springfield Armory are serious tools for the most serious applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you'll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class. 

TRP level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 - 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put the shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP was designed for use in high stress places - where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote finish will protect your TRP so it's ready for the next mission. 

Sometimes performance isn't optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol.

This Mossberg 500 Mariner is made for self defense and home defense, gifving you 12 gauge stopping power, 6-shot capacity, the shorter 18 1/2 inch barrel, Mossberg's fabulous Mariner Marinecote� finish and Mossberg's great dependability and warranty. Mariner� Shotguns provide Corrosion-resistant Marinecote Finish for All-Weather, Year-Round Protection. This finish is ideal for humid environments. It was developed to prevent deterioration due to humidity and coastal environments, for boat patrol too, so it makes this shotgun last much better than other finishes. The Mariner is the ideal choice because your shotgun can be subjected to all-season climates, which can induce condensation. Rigorous testing proves the Marinecote resists corrosion better than stainless steel. This finish is harder than ordinary gunmetal and provides the added bonus of greater resistance to wear and distinctly smoother action. One reason so many military and police organizations purchase Mossberg shotguns is that the guns will withstand heavy wear and tear. But you don't have to be in the service or a police officer to buy this shotgun.In the event service is required, owners of Mossbergs always receive Mossberg's highest priority for inspection, repair and fast return of their firearms. Their expertly trained technicians complete every detail of service and repair at the Mossberg production site. Mossberg uses only factory original parts and install them to exacting specifications. Every firearm is returned in ready condition. Those who trust their lives to Mossberg products continue to rely on Mossberg's dependable, reliable and proven performance.  Manufacturer Mossberg

(I tried to get pic of the serial number on the receiver but lighting and flash were just a hassle.) 
It came with sport grip, but it wasn't a purpose built sporter, but rather a civvy job. I started to re-militarize it, but I am getting married and can't spend the time or money on these projects anymore. The rifle was professionally cleaned for your convenience.

If you want the fore-end, front and rear hand guard, just add $100. 

$200 for sport, or
$300 for everything.

This barrel boasts CMMG's W.A.S.P. salt bath nitrocarbuerization treatment, sometimes known as nitriding, which offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance as compared to chrome lining or phosphating. Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without build-up, so accuracy is not compromised. The barrel and upper receiver have M4 feed ramps for flawless cycling. A ""F"" marked front sight post/gas block is fitted, and a removable MBUS rear sight is included.

The upper receiver is forged aluminum with a flat top Picatinny rail for easy and secure mounting of optics. A M4-style handguard with a heat shield is equipped. The lower is forged as well, with a low shelf for RDIAS, and is compatible with standard mil-spec componentry. The magazine well is bevelled for quicker, more confident reloads. An adjustable butt stock and A2-style pistol grip are outfitted. Front and rear sling mounts are mounted for easy carrying.

The 22 hornet provides much greater effective range than .22 mag and with half the noise of a .223 round. It's a very nice gun, just looking for something different so im selling. Thx."

The A/C blows ice cold and the heater blows hot for those cold winter days. The car gets great MPG on the highway as it's got the highway gear. It's never let me down and I've done a lot of recent things to it. Cruise control works as well for those highway trips. Car has a CLEAN TITLE.

Looking for the ideal carry gun for yourself? Or perhaps you're having a hard time finding a suitable firearm for the lady in your life, due to the harsh recoil of most subcompact pistols. Well, you're in luck, because I'm letting go of my beloved Sig P238. This is the Copperhead, a very limited edition run by Sig. It features a ""copper"" colored (really more of a coyote brown) frame and black slide, with 24K gold inlaid in the word ""Copperhead"" along the right side of the slide and on a representation of the Gadsden ""Don't Tread on Me"" snake along the top. The black checkered grips round out the package, making for a very sharp looking carry piece. Sig night sights are installed from the factory and still glow nice and bright. The gun has the original factory case. 

Extras include a 7 round factory magazine (a $40 value!), 450 rounds of target ammo and 70 rounds of assorted hollow points. The ammunition breaks down as follows:

WWB: 100 rounds
Speer Lawman: 100 rounds
Magtech: 100 rounds
Geco (Swiss mfg): 100 rounds
Remington: 50 rounds

Hydra-shok: 16 rounds
Corbon DPX: 15 rounds
Hornady Critical Defense: 8 rounds
Glaser Pow'R Ball: 7 rounds 
Sig V Crown Performance ammo: 15 rounds
Remington: 6 rounds

Number of issues with any type of ammo: 0


Price for the gun, case and extra magazine is $600

Price for everything is $725. With .380 ammo so difficult to find you're getting a hell of a deal on the ammo. At that price, I'm practically giving it away.

Transactions will be FTF in the Indianapolis area. I will need to see your IN ID to confirm that you are of age and a resident. I would prefer you have a LTCH, but it is not required per Indiana law. 

Prices are firm, no trades will be entertained, cash only. Serious inquiries only please. 

***I can't believe I'm already having to edit the ad within 20 minutes of posting it but apparently people do not comprehend the meaning of the phrase ""prices are firm"". Please do not waste my time or yours by offering me a fraction of what the gun is worth. If you want to buy a standard one new from Gander Mountain for 679.99 go right ahead. If you want something unique that will serve you well and that you can pass on to future generations, that you can buy for a fair price, then by all means contact me. ***

I will not sell the ammo until after the gun has sold. 

Thanks for looking, have a great day!"
