Sig Sauer P938-22LR, a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. All metal, Night sights, hard case, Holster 1-10 RD Mag.
 With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs ten plus one rounds of 22 LR into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.
 Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. Some people think a 22LR is not enough firepower. Obviously they have not fired any CCI Subsonic Segmented Hollow Point. When matched against a 9mm, shooting 1 gallon water filled milk jugs there was not a chance for the 9mm. Go on UTUBE and search for CCI Subsonic Segmented Hollow Point video and you will see.

I am interested in selling or trading my fun

FROM THE MANUFACTURER: Remarkable for its accuracy and light recoil, the GLOCK 21 delivers the legendary stopping power of the .45 AUTO round with a 10/13 round magazine capacity. Countless law enforcement units swear by the G21 pistol, and that's why this powerful, lightweight, all climate workhorse is standard issue from the North to South Poles.

Rear sight includes “RPK” style windage adjustment
Features factory installed UTG Picatinny handguard rail

Ask $110 for it which includes shipping. Below is specs:

Caliber	5.56 mm (.223 caliber)
Length	2.67 inches
Description

SF3P-556-1/2-28
The advanced SureFire SF3P-556-1/2-28 three-prong flash hider, which fits M4/M16 weapons and variants with 1/2x28 muzzle threads, features a patent-pending design that greatly reduces muzzle flash—typically greater than 99%—when compared with a plain muzzle. Boasting robust tines built to withstand the rigors of combat, the SF3P-556-1/2-28 also serves as a rock-solid mounting adapter for SureFire SOCOM Series 5.56 mm Fast-Attach® suppressors, the SOCOM556-RC model having placed first in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor testing ever conducted by US Special Operations Command. 

Precision machined from US mill-certified heat-treated stainless steel bar stock—and including high-precision single-point cut threads for optimum thread interface—the SF3P-556-1/2-28 flash hider is given a black Ionbond DLC coating to provide maximum protection under harsh environmental conditions and to facilitate cleaning, even after extreme use. 

When used in conjunction with a SureFire SOCOM Series suppressor, the patent-pending design of the SF3P-556-1/2-28 provides multiple bearing surfaces to ensure superior suppressor alignment and to prevent the audible ringing of tines inside the suppressor. A rear labyrinth seal minimizes potential carbon buildup in the indexing system and facilitates suppressor removal after extended firing. 

SureFire flash hiders are individually inspected for concentricity and alignment and are covered by SureFire’s No-Hassle Guarantee. 

FITS: M4, M16 and variants 

MOUNTS: All SureFire SOCOM Series 5.56mm/.223 caliber sound suppressors"

Because of the growing adoption among military snipers there has been an increase in popularity among enthusiast as well as competitive shooters in the civilian ranks as well. The downside to the 338 Lapua is that it is based on the .416 Rigby case which has a larger case head diameter (.590 in ) than the standard magnum cases (.532 in ) and unfortunately, many of the commercial actions and bolts are not large enough to easily handle the larger case head diameter. Because of this, popular actions like the Remington 700 require special work to be done to them in order to fit the .338 Lapua, and anytime you mention special work, it means more money and also lower production numbers. As such, there are not a lot of lower priced precision 338 Lapua rifles on the market. That is where the Savage 110 BA comes in. Savage actions are built on a modular design, so instead of them having to make major modifications to a bolt design, they simply had to make a new bolt head and they were pretty much there. Of course some other details such as magazine design needed to be performed as well. The end result is that they were able to release a modern precision sniper rifle chambered in the .338 Lapua for a reasonable price."

Because of the growing adoption among military snipers there has been an increase in popularity among enthusiast as well as competitive shooters in the civilian ranks as well. The downside to the 338 Lapua is that it is based on the .416 Rigby case which has a larger case head diameter (.590 in ) than the standard magnum cases (.532 in ) and unfortunately, many of the commercial actions and bolts are not large enough to easily handle the larger case head diameter. Because of this, popular actions like the Remington 700 require special work to be done to them in order to fit the .338 Lapua, and anytime you mention special work, it means more money and also lower production numbers. As such, there are not a lot of lower priced precision 338 Lapua rifles on the market. That is where the Savage 110 BA comes in. Savage actions are built on a modular design, so instead of them having to make major modifications to a bolt design, they simply had to make a new bolt head and they were pretty much there. Of course some other details such as magazine design needed to be performed as well. The end result is that they were able to release a modern precision sniper rifle chambered in the .338 Lapua for a reasonable price."

BOX & 3 MAGS

Description from Independent Reviewer:
Para‘s 1911 LTC 9mm pistol incorporates many desirable features of the original Colt Commander, plus a few ideas of its own. An alloy frame keeps weight down to a very manageable 28 oz. A ramp match-grade barrel measures out at 4.25"" - long enough for the 9mm cartridge to reach its full potential.

Metal surfaces on the LTC are coated with Para’s non-reflective Covert Black finish. This finish not only casts a very business-like appearance, but also stands up well against the elements. For positive manipulation, the slide features six deep diagonal grooves. Other key features include a flat, checkered mainspring housing and a beavertail trip safety. A single-side, frame-mounted safety is standard. Instead of the usual plug guide, Para went with a full-length recoil spring guide rod on the LTC 9mm."

Willing to consider anything, except low-ball offers. Trying to make some space in my gun safe and interested in trading, not desperate for a deal

Took this in trade expecting I was going to be driving 2 hours round trip to work, that didn’t work out so I’m not so in need of this car.. This is NOT a show car, but if you’re looking for an A to B and back to A car, this is it.  Prior owner claims 35 M.P.G., I have not measured however, it does get great mileage.  148,xxx miles on a 2.4 liter 4 cyc engine, 5 speed transmission.  The car is free of mechanical problems, NO CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CODES, good breaks, recent tires, detachable face cd player w/remote, it looks as if it is wired for a speaker box or amp in the trunk, don’t know enough about audio electric to say,  A/C WORKS.

Seems as if the clear coat is chipping off the trunk, top of the cab, and the hood, interior is stained but clean, tried to show all faults in pics… Tag is good till Feb. 2015, the title is clear.

My name is Chad, and you can call or text me at REDACTED. Due to recent issues concerning exchanges done through the internet, I now must feel inclined to include the fact that I am a lawful, concealed firearm bearing citizen. Now, this bow is freakishly light, and very fast! The bow is a custom 70-80# draw, and has the custom red accents on the grip, string stop, and limb stops. I also have the standard grey accessories that I will give to you. This bow is a 28.5"" draw length, and I do believe you can get new cams if yours happens to be different. This bow has the RKT cams. It is black, with the red accessories. This is a bare bow, though I have broken, (fixable) sights for a dirt cheap price if you are looking for top of the line sights for next to nothing, and I will explain those later. This bow is in perfect condition, except, while I was practicing last fall, I had my release explode in my hand at full draw. The head of the release shot off the string and hit the cable on its way out. The string is in fine condition, however I would recommend having the string re-served where the release made contact, it frayed it. I flat do not have time to take care of any of these things right now, and thats why I am willing to let go of this stuff at a great price. I paid 1640$ for the bow, bare, last fall. I want 900$ firm, I'm taking off 200$ for the string to be re-served, otherwise I would be asking for 1100$. The only reason I am selling the bow is because I get a new one every year, and my new one is already bought and sighted in ready for the woods. 
 The sights are, Trijicon Accupin one pin, and the AXT carnivore. The Trijicon needs to be sent back to trijicon and they were willing to fix it and send it back to me. This is well over a 400$ sight. It has an issue with the yardage adjustment dial. The AXT, I was moving my 20 yard pin last week, and the pin snapped in half when I tightened down the set screw.

From LaRue:
The PredatAR® 5.56 is designed for those who are searching for a lightweight, ultra-reliable and accurate 5.56 mm NATO rifle for home-defense, competition-shooting or hunting. The PredatAR® takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 “Lite” design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for. By contouring the barrel, skeletonizing the handguard, lowering and simplifying the upper rail, and using a low-profile gas block, we were able to reduce roughly 2 pounds from the standard OBR 5.56 rifle. The barrels are lightweight-profiled with rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in ½ x 28, with an A2 flash hider attached* (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost). The handguards on the PredatAR® extend out 14.75”, to suit a larger range of shooting styles. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though we lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy. Each rifle ships with one, 3” long, MIL-STD-1913 detachable rail section. Both models come with a 6-position LaRue RAT Stock and LaRue medium A-PEG™ Grip. The Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with staked carrier keys, with Texas-Spec Bolt assemblies."

This optic features a 7mm raised base for better iron sight access, and an adjustable quick-detach lever for easy and repeatable attachment and removal. The more compact design only requires 2.75"" of rail space.

The compact design used by the EXPS model was created by separating the battery compartment from the base and mounting it transversely. This not only dramatically decreases the over-all size of the optic, but allows the battery compartment to easily clear the delta ring on M4/M16 platform carbines and rifles.

The A65/1 reticle features a 65MOA circle for fast target acquisition with a 1MOA aiming dot for precise shooting to mid ranges.

The EXPS 3 series is night vision compatible.

10 Night Vision compatible settings.
Transmission holography allows for a parallax free optic with unlimited eye relief
Highly versatile reticle allows for fast CQC work and precise fire out to medium ranges.
Rugged design with shatterproof glass and aluminum hood assembly.
7mm raised base for unobstructed co-witnessing.
Battery sits perpendicular to the optic giving a much more compact size, only requires 2.75"" of rail space.
Controls on the left side for use with a magnifier
Mounts easily to any 1"" Weaver or M1913 picatinny rail.
600 hour continuous use battery life on setting 12 with 1x CR123 lithium battery
Waterproof to 10ft.

The Devtron Scopecoat is constructed using high-quality Neoprene (2mm thick) core, and laminated with Nylon. Its simple yet effective design safeguards your scope against dings, scuffs, scratches, dust, dirt, and moisture. The absorptive qualities of the Neoprene draw moisture and condensation away from your scope and helps protect it from the elements.

I just recently acquired a different custom M&P40c on gunbroker and no longer have a need for this one. This gun was purchased new at a dealer in Pittsburgh this February. It was manufactured on October 3rd 2013 per the box label and test fire cartridge. Only 10 rounds were fired through this gun to test sight alignment.

No internal parts have been polished, sanded, modified etc. No backstraps or magazines have been modified. The frame has been stippled with the ""waffle texture"" and relief marks have been cut and polished in the trigger guard for both index fingers. The bottom of the mag well received the same relief cuts for easier removal of any stuck mags. The gun has Truglo TFO night sights installed which include a green fiber optic front sight that is backed by tritium for nighttime and an all black square notch rear. The gun will come with 2 magazines, small medium and large backstraps, the case, lock, test fired cartridge and all original paperwork. The gun has been cleaned and freshly lubricated with CLP. 

I can meet at the FFL holder of your choosing within a ~40 mile drive of Pittsburgh, I request cash payment with the buyer covering any transfer fees. If I can answer any questions or provide anymore pictures don't hesitate to ask!"

I will even give you a signed three month warranty money back no questions asked. That is how confident I am in these guns. None of these guns have jamed or misfired since I have owned them.

It is cosmetically like brand new, and is entirely built to military specifications. There are actuall two versions of this, a civilian version and military version and this is the latter. It has a flat top picatinny rail mount attached and co-witnesses absolutely perfect with the top of a regular F marked AR15 front sight post. It also comes with the threaded killflash attachment to keep from reflecting any light back off the lens.

It uses fiber optics to produce the 4.5 MOA dot during the day and tritium at night, so no batteries required and it's always on and ready to go.

It does have one small polarization flare in the lens which cannot be seen with the killflash attached and does NOT affect the functionality of the sight in any way, shape, or form. I have spoken to Trijicon and confirmed this is entirely normal for this model since it is polarized and have checked on two other of the same model which have the same flares.

To move it fast, and since I do not have the box, I am listing it for about half what they go for new, and the local gun shop has one that is in nowhere near this good of shape for 40.00 more. This is an absolute steal at this price and I will not go lower. You are getting a Trijicon for the price of a Vortex SPARC or a Bushnell.

I have 20 boxes  ( probably more than 20) of Hornady 50 grain V-Max, that comes to a total of 400 rounds of factory never reloaded Hornady ammo. You can't buy this stuff for 20 bucks a box anymore but that's what I would ask for it. If anyone is interested in the whole package I would knock off 50 dollars and sell the gun and all the ammo for 800. Will trade, don't have to sell the ammo. If I don't sell it I'll have it gunsmithed and have the barrel cut down. Please call or text REDACTED don't send me emails I won't respond"

I don't have a chronograph, but fired from a 6"" barrel desert eagle pistol the round shoots a 300gr bullet at 1475fps, but this AR barrel is 20"" and packs a much bigger punch (probably 1800 to 2000 fps), and even with the AK-74 style muzzle brake on this gun, you know you fired a rifle.  I have shot it less than 10 rounds, so it is basically new, but when I moved to the city, it is pointless for me to keep it. You can see in the picture, the 223 bullet vs the 50 AE bullet.  I chose a 50 AE instead of other big bore thumper AR rounds, as the 50 ae is uncommon, but it is not proprietary like other rounds, so you may be able to find it in gun stores. Comes with 1 10rd magazine, you can easily make more from standard AR mags.

I'm looking mainly for cash, but if you have something to trade, I'll consider offers, but don't waste our time by offering a $600 gun as a even trade. I have a fair amount of other guns too, so if there is something you are looking for, let me know.

I travel a bit between Downriver, Detroit area and Midland/Bay city/Saginaw and occasionally Lansing, so if you are in those areas I may be able to meet you .
