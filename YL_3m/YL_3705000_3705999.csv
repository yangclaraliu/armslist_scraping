You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.

The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.

Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™. ""

I can't say enough about this beautiful revolver.  I bought this last fall to see if handgun hunting would be my next venture, but it's not for me.  It was sent to Wilson Combat where it received it's perfect trigger, action, and ""Wilson Magnum Hunter"" inscription.  The Magna-Porting reduces recoil.  I sent about 100 rounds down the pipe and cleaned it religiously the 3 times I've taken it out.  I've kept it lightly oiled and always stored away from corrosive elements in a safe.  (Not in the foam lined case which, from what I've heard, can have a negative impact on a gun's finish over time.)

$1300 firm for the revolver with the wood grips, or $1450 for everything listed.
This package retails for over $1600 including tax and fees.

It has a safety AND decocker lever, so it can be carried cocked and locked or simply decock it to drop the hammer for carry.  It includes THREE different backstraps, so it can easily fit almost any shooters hand.  It comes with THREE 14 rd magazines!

In 1972, Sturm Ruger introduced their line of ""Double Action"" revolvers. This line consisted of the Security Six, Service Six, and the Speed Six, all of which were marketed with Law Enforcement, Military, and Civil Defense in mind. They became very well known for their dependability and durability. Essentially, they were built to take a beating and withstand much abuse.

This line of revolvers marked the way for Sturm Ruger's entry into the Double Action revolver market. As with all Ruger firearms, the Speed Six revolvers were robustly designed with large, heavy-duty parts. The First Stainless Steel version was shipped in 1975. Although I am a big fan of S&W Revolvers, I believe that this line of Ruger Revolvers, that were directly created to compete with Smith & Wesson, are more robust and have a slightly stronger barrel shank with larger and stronger internal parts. It was one of the first designed revolvers to use a hammer that was powered by a coil spring which directly created the ""Transfer-Bar firing system. One of the distinguishing features of this line of revolver from Ruger is, the simplicity of the design and the ability to break the weapon down with just the use of a small flathead screwdriver, coin, or cartridge casing.

This Speed Six revolver has not been abused and was shipped from the factory in 1976. It is ""Pre-Warning Roll Marks"" which were on all modern Ruger Barrels that followed. It is 100% original and comes complete with original ""Red"" Ruger box, and owner’s manual. I am not the original owner so I cannot speak of “Round Count” but I will say that it does not appear to have been fired much and looks as it may have spent the majority of its life in a safe.

 I have a new front night sight. Trijicon. Also a rear sight and a few parts that I see no ID marks on. Then a black synthetic stock as a beater (a few scratches) as I didn't wish to damage the wood on the other. 

 The sight mount is a Brookfield. Yes a Brookfield. As marked BKFLD TL U.S. Property. The best mount for these rifles hands down. 

 A Bushnell Elite 4200 sits on it. Great glass. 

 8 Checkmate mags
 2 Winchester Mags
 2 Borg Warner Mags
 2 Kileen Machine and tool Mags

 All mags is like new. A few have not been loaded at all. The rest once or twice. 

 No issues with the rifle. Switching to a AR 10. 
 For the whole package. $2300
 Just the gun and one mag $1500 
 The gun w/2 mags and optics $2050

 No trades at this time. I have an AR 10 already. Located in Canton and buyer to come here or if we can set up a meet at a range. Then that is acceptable. You must provide ammo that is store bought. Not reloaded."

OWN IT!
The Springfield Model 1873 was the first breech loaded rifle adopted by the U.S. Military.
This infantry model in .45-70-Gov't was owned by my great grandfather who served the Union Army in the Signal Corps during the Civil War.
The Springfield 1873 design was chosen for service from approximately 100 MFG's rifles submitted to the Army.
The single shot ""Trap Door"" design was chosen for its reliability even over faster repeating designs which tended to jam more readily. A recruit could load & shoot 8 rounds/minute while an expert infantryman about 16/minute.
The rifles were later used in the Spanish/American War and as buffalo rifles.
This rifle is in good shape with minor nicks & scratches on the stock & forend.
The U.S., U.S. Springfield, Eagle emblem, Serial Number (139949), & Model No. are clearly visible on the barrel, breech mechanisms, & butt plate.

The Beeman R7 air rifle is, without question, the finest intermediate sporting air rifle available anywhere. Includes a Bushnell 4-12x40 scope already mounted! 

This is like new! Only 500 rounds of lead free pellets put through it. 
Includes free pellets.

Once you have one in your hands you will agree and won't want to put the air rifle down. At just a shade over 6 pounds, the R7 is easy to pack around in the field with ease. The gun still packs plenty of punch with velocities reaching 700 fps in the .177 caliber version. The R7 is extremely accurate and has a very pleasant, smooth firing action. In fact, the R7 is a favored rifle among Straight Shooters.

The R7 Standard configuration comes with a 2 piece mount and muzzlebrake allowing you to add your choice of scope and mounts to the rifle. The R7 rifle features a unique double jointed cocking lever which eliminates the customary long slot under the forearm of break-barrel air rifles. This provides a more comfortable grip and a better sling mounting point on the forearm.

Pay attention to the details on this air rifle: Crisp, multi-lever trigger and finest non-drying breech and piston seals. Checkering on the pistol grip and a rubber buttplate. Scope grooves cut directly into the receiver for added stability. Beautiful precision cast trigger guard. And the satin finish on the hardwood stock resists minor scratches. Simply put, there are few guns made with all the features, style and grace of the R7.

Users have the ability to install or remove the silencer from the Blackout™ flash hider/muzzle brake, or the BRAKEOUT compensator, in seconds. The compact size and light weight have minimal affect on maneuverability. The M4-2000 Mod 08s extreme durability is maximized by CNC automated fusion welding of every high-temperature aerospace alloy component used in its construction- making 100% suppressed full-auto fire possible on barrels as short as 10 inches. The back-pressure lowering design of the silencer aids in shooter comfort, reduces weapon fouling, and minimizes cyclic rate increase. As a final step, tapered-bore EDM technology is utilized to ensure precise bore alignment resulting in enhanced accuracy and maximum performance. By eliminating approximately 97% of the muzzle report, the M4-2000 Mod 08 preserves the hearing of the shooter and nearby support personnel.

In the Saiga line of rifles, this timeless design utilizes a proven gas piston system, rotary bolt, and very few internal parts that provide the reliability that Izhmash has delivered for over 60 years. A hammer forged, chrome lined barrel and chamber provide the ultimate in long life."

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

I have had this rifle for a few years, put under 500 rounds through it. Mostly .38 Special and the occasional .357 for hunting. I am willing to negotiate on price within reason, but keep in mind these things retail for $510 new, and used I often see going 400."

If interested please text to REDACTED.  You can email as well but I may not get back with you ad quickly.  I had it priced at two shops one for $600 and one for $$550.  I'm asking $450 to move this sell.
