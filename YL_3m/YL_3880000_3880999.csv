This the only manufacturer that produces a true AR10 in 300 Win Mag. This rifle takes around 6 months to have built, and was specifically built to my specifications. The specifications include color, forearm length, trigger selection, and barrel selection. The rifle comes cerakoted in Flat dark earth with HK black accents. The trigger selection that comes with the rifle was Geissele Hi-Speed National Match Rifle Trigger, yet was switched for a Hipertouch 24C flat bar trigger system coming in at less that 2lb. Although Im a fan of Geissele, Hipertouch is a notch above in my opinion. The rifle has an extended forearm that surrounds the adjustable gas block, yet milled for adjustment and ease. The barrel selection is the best available in my opinion ( Krieger ) The rifle comes with -2 factory magazines ( Polymer - Steel enforced ) -NightForce UltraLight Unimount Rifle Scope Mount 30mm 20MOA - 2 triggers ( Mentioned above ) - Nightforce NXS 8x32x56 / .25 MOA ZERO STOP / MOAR - T C509 SCOPE The rifle is BRAND NEW ( FLAWLESS CONDITION ) , It has been test fired only from the factory, and then went into my safe. This is my dream rifle, yet bills come first sadly. I am not looking to separate the scope and rifle unless the price is right. I am also NOT interested in trades unless it is to offset a small amount of the cost. I own a business and can accept credit cards, yet a 3.5% fee has to be added. Please feel free to call me if you have any questions concerning the auction. Receipts are available upon request - Below is a list of cost of this set-up, As I am asking a considerable amount below this this even considering the wait time. Rifle cost - $5399.00 Upgraded Trigger - $ 235.00 Unimount - $ 252.00 Scope - $ 2092.00 Total - $ 7,978 Thank you for looking Nathan - REDACTED"

Focused repeating In-line repeating in the correct shooting position allows for a relaxed posture in situations that require a quick succession of shots. The bolt handle is mounted in an ergonomically perfect position just above the trigger guard. Rifle and eye remain focused on the target, the hunter gains time to aim exactly and ensure a perfect shot. Blaser precision trigger Thanks to the excellent, crisp characteristics of the R8 trigger and the extremely short release time, it turns the shooter‘s thought impulse into an accurate shot. The R8 trigger immediately breaks „crisp as glass“ at a trigger weight of 1.5 lbs. Superior barrel bedding Cold hammer forged barrels and chambers provide superior quality and utmost accuracy. The barrel is embedded in the massive R8 action. Distortion of the wooden stock caused by dry or wet conditions does not affect the point of impact. Even when exchanging the barrel, the R8 barrel bedding provides optimum repeating accuracy. Blaser Saddle Mount Only with a perfect scope mount, rifle and rifle scope become one accurate unit. Four inconspicuous notches which are aligend with the chamber hold the one-piece mounting base without causing tension. Thus, the barrel can float freely and keeps its point of impact even with the heat generated by a quick succession of shots"

This is high quality, new manufactured, Made in the USA ammunition by Georgia Arms. I bought this ammo for a hog hunt that I never went on a few years ago, right before ammo prices sky-rocketed. This ammo comes in its original sealed factory heavy duty poly bag of 50 rds each and is clearly marked, it is a very hot +P load of a 260 gr JHP bullet at 1200 fps, which puts it real close to .44 Mag energy level; this ammo is especially good for lever action 45 Colt rifles and carbines. Please read and understand the manufacturer's label advising its safe use; do not buy this ammo to shoot in your Colt SAA or replica. I am in Southern MD and I am willing to drive as far north as Upper Marlboro to meet buyer for a FTF cash and carry deal in a public setting during daylight hours; buyer must be a US/MD citizen or active duty military stationed in MD and least 21 years of age and not prohibited from possessing or purchasing ammo.

http://www.kimberamerica.com/1911/tactical-ii/tactical-pro-ii

This handgun is in excellent shape, although it has been fired some.  If I had to guess I have put fewer than 1,000 rounds through it.  I am the original owner.  There are some very minor chips in the finish, which is to be expected with a used gun.  It functions flawlessly as a quality 1911 should.  Factory night sights are bright as this gun is about two years old.  It comes with the original box and contents, and one magazine.  

New, this gun is going for roughly $1,150 if you buy it online after shipping, FFL transfer, etc.  I would take $850 cash, or similar in trade.  

Please see trade options and only offer these or very similar.  If your trade is worth more or less than $850, we can make the difference up in cash or additional trade, whatever we agree upon.  

If you are interested in this gun and do not live in the greater Toledo area, I am willing to ship it to your FFL for whatever the shipping cost will be.  Otherwise, I would like to sell locally in the Toledo area.  I am not able to drive hours away to meet so please keep that in mind before contacting me.

I had this with a Glock 23 but don't intend to use my suppressor on it and would like a flush non-threaded conversion barrel. If you have a Glock 23/32 you can not just drop a 9mm barrel in, it must be a conversion barrel that is fitted for that gun but chambered smaller.

All work done by me with my gunsmiths help. Im doing some apprenticeship work with him. The grip was shaved down, trigger guard rounded out, and finger grooves cut in, then a custom grip texture added. This is not stippling. This is done by adding material to the frame. Then the frame wass cerakoted. I milled into the slide to add the burris fastfire. The fit is perfect and solid as a rock. Then the slide was re-parkerized where it was milled.

Pistol comes as pictured, with the burris fastfire, one 13 rd mag, and two 15 rd mags. As well as the kit that comes with the pistol when bought new. 

Asking 600. More pictures can be sent via email or text if requested.

It is an ACOG designed for .308/7.62x51 with green illumination in 3.5x35.  This ACOG comes with the original Pelican case, lens pen (unused), manual and TA51 mount.  The reticle is illuminate in the center with a green crosshair, with the rest of the reticle in black.  The reticle also has a Bullet Drop Compensator (BDC) that ranges out beyond 1000 yards.  The BDC also doubles as a range finder (see manual for details and how to use).  Optic is also marked with M14 100-600 MREDACTED.  (If you have a M240, let me know because that would be worth meeting in person for.)

The ACOG is used*, and I say that with an asterisk. The ACOG has been pulled from the case, mounted onto my M1A and then never used.  Why?  Because I got PCSed to Bloomington and there is not a range within 60 minutes of here (don't get me started on how un-gun friendly this place is).  The optic is in pristine condition and I guarantee that you will be happy with the ACOG.

If the ad is still up, the optic is either still for sale or SPF.  I have more photos available upon request to include photos through the lens, once again just ask!

I am looking for $1000.  The price is fairly firm, but I am open to trades or trade with cash.  Looking for a good .308 optic as trade, but I am open to anything you might want to offer!  Cannot hurt to ask!

Price does not include shipping, if that is what you want to do.  Will meet face to face in/near Bloomington, IN.  Can travel to Indianapolis area if required, but that means the price will be very firm.

Barrel: Barrel is made for Palmetto State Armory by FN Manufacturing using their proprietary blend of hammer forged chrome molly vanadium that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension with extended feedramps, and a carbine gas system.   The barrel has an A2 style profile, is mil-spec phosphate coated, and MP/HP tested.  The upper is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, and an A2 flash hider.
Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer."

Made of billet 6061-T6 aluminum by Haley Strategic of Tinmath, Colorado and carry a lifetime warranty. These are left over from a build and are now just collecting dust, so they need to find a new home. I wish that I had another build that I could use them on.

I'm only interested in smaller calibers ( .223/.22-250/.25-06/.243) I'm not looking for a rimfire or a deer rifle. 

My M&P has TruGlo TFO Fiber Optic Night Sights and an Apex Trigger Kit installed. It runs extremely well and would be great for competition or home defense use. Comes with two 10 round mags and three backstraps. Box and paperwork included. 

Mostly looking for a Model 700 in the calibers mentioned above, but will consider other high end rifles. Your trade MUST include a nice optic, no deal if there's no scope.
