I'm just looking to see if I can get a reasonable price for it, I really don't shoot my pistol all that often anymore, as I do more long range target shooting and match ammo gets quite expensive. I've put maybe 1,000 of this stuff through my Glock 19 and never had any issues with it.

Prices:
100 round boxes - $50 for both (won't sell just one)
250 round boxes - $60 each
For all 700 of it that's $170 I would prefer to sell as much of it together as possible.

Prices are firm as that's 25 cents or less per round, most people are selling 9mm for $30/100 here, and retail it's even more. Please no lowball offers, look around this site, look around the web. It's really hard to find anything even close to 25 cents per round. I don't need to sell this stuff, but if I can get the prices I asked for I'll take it.

Local only, not worth it to ship."

The rearr stock is completely interchangeable with 500c 12ga stocks.   There are a couple scratches on the bluing on the receiver as shown in the photos.   I'm including a case of  bird shot,  a bunch of buckshot,  a couple boxes of turkey loads, and generally more than enough ammo ( all factory new) to sweeten the pot.  And the best part is this being a 20 ga and all,  ammo is cheap, plentiful, and you can  one hand this thing with buckshot all day long.  and it'll still put dinner on the table or drop a bad guy in his tracks.

General info: The M-44 was produced as a shorter, lighter, version of the standard M 91/30 rifle from 1944 through 1949. The Russians were searching for a weapon that was more fast handling and practical to carry and thus the M-44 was born. At only 40"" overall, this is a very practical carry / hunting rifle and still retains a high degree of accuracy. Each rifle also incorporates a side folding bayonet."

After checking the serial number and talking to multiple people who for sure know more than I do, this wepon turns out to be pretty rare. Being made between the dates of 1943 & 1947, These guns are rare because Winchester didn't make very many sporting arms during this period due to World War II going on. Their main focus during this period was to make military arms.  Its for sure not in mint condition but it's in great shape for it's year.

I originally purchased this rifle when it was put together on a different plastic stock. I purchased it for 400. I installed a bullpup stock that I bought just over 200 and added a buffer recoil pad (to reduce recoil). The barrel still has a lot of life left in it. Shoots very accurately and flawlessly.

The upgraded bullpup stock shortens the SKS about 5-6 inches from the previous length. I originally built this because I enjoy learning the different weapon platforms and I thought this would be a great shooter. Absolutely no surprises, this rifle shoots beautifully. The few times that I took it to the range, there is always a small audience behind me trying to figure out what I'm shooting. If you have friends or family that shoots, or you just want to show someone up that is different from what everyone else has, then this is the rifle for you. Or if you just like to have fun and blast away with inexpensive steel ammo, then this is also for you.

Replacement parts for the Norinco are cheap and are plentiful because of U.S. companies making compatible parts between all of the SKS platforms for all the different countries who manufacture it. The overall recoil is very manageable, if you wanted to take someone with a small frame to range they would have a blast without any concerns of injury.

I figured that whoever wants to buy it will have to pay for the transfer and background check fee. So I cut the price down from 800 to 700 help cover the cost of those transaction fees at whichever local gun shop we commit our transaction.

What is in this packaged deal?

1 Norinco SKS with a custom bullpup stock

800 rounds of ammunition (40 rounds of PDX1 Defender, 40 rounds of winchester white box brass, and the rest of the ammo is Tulammo steel cased)

5 20 round magazines
3 30 round magazines
2 40 round magazines
(all magazines are reliable)

20 stripper clips (for quick ammo loading)

1 steel ammo can with 7.62 markings.

NOTE: Magazines will be disassembled and provided to purchaser as parts kits, exactly how the gun shops in Colorado sell the magazines. This rifle is 922r compliant the entire stock kit is made in USA as well as the magazines and buffer pad that I installed.

(custom tactical case is $70 brand new)
I can hold MOA groupings with a 50 dollar red dot at 80-100 yards when i took it straight out of the box to sight it in. Trigger pull is a little heavy, but I am use to a geiselle so thats not a fair critique. I wasn't a snob about the low msrp of this gun and im glad i gave it a chance. It handles any milspec upgrade, shoots as well as any other factory new gun under 1200 dollars, looks great, and to my surprise is even built to Palmetto specs in the same factory COLT uses for their steel receiver parts. Does the gun shoot as flawlessly as my custom spikes//lwrc gas piston ar?? No, but its 1/3 the price and easily 75% the quality of a top tier weapon.

I attend numerous fundraisers throughout the course of the year and am lucky enough to win guns from time to time. Most of the time, I am winning guns I do not need and simply take up space. I'm not a collector, just a conservationist hunter. I have no interest in handguns and rarely open to trades. This really is a very nice gun, but am a little too old to become used to hunting with an action other than my reliable pump action with the safety ALWAYS in the same place.

Powered by three AAA batteries the MERK uses a second generation LED to generate a blinding 180 Lumens. It is rugged and resistant to impact and water.

I'm looking to sell my DW in .45ACP. It has 100 rounds through it and shoots flawlessly. I have the two magazines to go along with it that came from the factory. One is a low profile magazine and the other has a rubber bottom piece that protrudes from the bottom of the grip once engaged.

The gun is in mint condition, no scratches or dings. It's never been holstered. I disassembled, cleaned, lubed and reassembled after every outing. I recently moved to a new location and have misplaced the original carrying case it came in along with the barrel wrench, so those will not be included in the sale. I'm selling simply because I do not get to use the firearm enough and would like to downgrade to something along the lines of a Kimber.

I'm asking $1750 cash for the gun or will entertain trades @ $1800 value (trades + cash ok). No low balls.

Interests include but not limited to:

Kimber (CC barrel length 1911's < 5"") + Cash
.44 Magnum Revolver (not picky about make and model excluding Taurus) + Cash
Mossberg 500 w/ slug barrel + Cash

973,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3073973,"For Sale:  AMT AutoMag III, 30 Carbine, 98%+ with Box, Paperwork, 6 Factory Mags","Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 1,"Listed On: Saturday, October 25, 2014",Handguns,Arcadia Machine and Tool                                                                                ,no type,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"This is an exceptionally nice AMT AutoMag III semi-auto pistol that is chambered in the desirable and very collectible .30 Carbine rifle round.    

I'm the original owner and this pistol has had just less than three fifty round boxes of ammo fired through it since new. This will be the closet thing you'll find to NIB, and there are precious few AutoMag III's that are truly NIB.

It's the brainchild of the late Harry Sanford and is one of the more unusual and most sought after of all the pistols in the AutoMag line. The .30 Carbine chambering is quite unique and I'm not aware of any other semi-auto production pistol in this chambering.

Overall the pistol is 98%+ condition with the only wear coming from the 147 rounds that were fired through it. You'd have a tough time finding a nicer one for sure.

Pistol and magazines are made from high quality stainless steel and the grips are a black Lexan type material.    

Included is the original numbers matching box that's in great shape. Plus all of the factory literature that shipped with the pistol from the factory.    

Additionally 6 AMT factory original magazines are included and only one of them has ever had a round loaded in it. 

Finally there is 240 rounds of ammo included:  
(2) 50 round boxes Armscor FMJ 
(2) 50 round boxes of PPU SP  
(2) 20 round boxes Federal Classic 

If you look at GunBroker you'll see that an AutoMag III .30 Carbine in this condition with matching factory box and literature routinely bring $1200 and up with two mags. So my price with 6 mags (these are a bare minimum of $50 each) with the ammo is quite fair. Therefore lowball offers will not be entertained nor will they be responded to.

I'm asking $1500 for the package. However, if by chance you'd rather not have the ammo then I'm fine with keeping it as I have a M1 .30 Carbine rifle. So I'll subtract $125 for the ammo taking the price for the pistol, it's box and the 6 magazines to $1375.00

Pistol must be picked up in the Brandon area by a legal age Florida resident - No Shipping. A proper bill of sale will be provided.

The paper package and loose rounds shown in the pictures are the remnants from another can. I had several cans and shot them up over the years.  

This ammo is sure fire and it seems considerably hotter than similar but more recent commercially loaded ammo.  

I shot many rounds through a CZ52 pistol and a PPSH carbine with no issues. However this ammo may not be suitable for your old TT33. 

 As always you must consult a knowledgeable gunsmith to determine if this ammo is right for your particular firearm and failure to do so could result in injury or worse.
