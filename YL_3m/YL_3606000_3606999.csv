The same Classic pistols that have been used by civilian, law enforcement, and military personnel the world over, can now have these same models factory built in .22LR. The SIG SAUER® Classic .22’s are built on the same frame as their centerfire counterparts. All Classic .22’s feature the same SIG SAUER Four-Point safety system which employs a decocking lever, a patented automatic firing pin safety block, a safety intercept notch, and a trigger bar disconector. The new machined slides also feature a front sight adjustable for drift and a rear sight adjustable for both windage and elevation. With the purchase of a new SIG SAUER Classic .22 shooters can now enjoy hours of serious training at the range for a fraction of what they would pay practicing with full recoil centerfire rounds. Be sure to check out the new SIG SAUER X-CHANGE Kit™ is the perfect accessory for your SIG SAUER Classic .22 rimfire pistols. Now shooters can add SIG SAUER centerfire performance with just the change out of the slide assembly, barrel, recoil system, and magazine to any of the standard production pistol calibers; 9mm, .40 S&W, and .357SIG. Exchanging components does not alter the reliability or accuracy of either assembly. Owning a SIG SAUER Classic .22 and a centerfire X-CHANGE Kit provides the added benefit of owning two pistols in a single premium package. More shooting at a lower cost with the full size SIG SAUER pistol you’re accustomed to; the SIG SAUER Classic .22 caliber pistols that now include the option for centerfire performance with a SIG SAUER X-CHANGE Kit.

Now I've moved to Idaho and just can't see Dear or Elk hunting as a probable any time soon. Rifle has never had a round put through it. Scope was mounted at a local gun shop in South Boston Virginia with taller rings to compensate for bolt action. A softer custom butt pad was also installed too. Also included is a Plano Air Glide hard shell case and a box of  ammo. All together there is over $1400.00+ invested in this package. $1100.00 buys the Rifle with additional work, plus case and ammo, leaving me giving you the Scope. I will also consider trading for a AR-15 type rifle and extras of equal value to my package. I have more pictures if you're interested. Thank you for viewing. Looking forward to hearing from you.

307,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3606307,For Sale:  Geissele Automatics 2 Stage Trigger (G2S) 4.5lbs 5.56/.308 Rifle Trigger – NEW,"South Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina",$ 159,"Listed On: Wednesday, October 15, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"$159 shipped

G2S is made with the same tool steel as the SSA and the sears are also wired.  The main differences with the SSA are a different way of holding the hammer pin, different pins, no laser markings and only spot MP check.  Visually, from the outside of the gun there is no difference from the SSA and the feel and reliability is the same. 


1. Performance Advantages for the Shooter
The Geissele G2S has a pull weight of about 4.5lb. 2.5 lbs on the first stage and 2lb on the second stage. The pull weights and sear engagement are non adjustable.
Trigger and hammer are made from quality tool steel
Sear surfaces are cut by a wire edm machine. Sears cut this way are very accurate and the non-directional surface finish of the wire edm gives a smooth trigger pull without the associated grittiness of directional machining marks left by a milling cutter.
The initial force needed to start the disengagement of the sear surfaces is low and the force linearly increases at a low rate. This helps the shot to fall at the initial point of aim and aids in building shooter confidence in his weapons ability to put the rounds where his sight is pointing.
The Geissele G2S trigger allows the shooter to slap through the trigger pull on close in shots but also set up a long range shot with a crisp trigger break.
A full force hammer spring is used for quick locktime and positive ignition of all types of ammo. No lightened hammer spring is used.
The hammer is lighter than a standard hammer. The lightened hammer favorably decreases locktime and increases accuracy of the weapon, especially for snap shots.

2. Advantages for the Armorer
The Geissele G2S is a simple design that is very similar to the original trigger. The number of parts is identical.
There are no adjustment screws to come loose.
All springs are captive; they will not get lost during disassembly in the field
The entire trigger can be dissembled for cleaning (no rivets or staked parts)
The trigger can be installed without removing the safety
Sear engagement is pre-set from the factory.
Hammer and trigger pins are a close slip fit into nominal receiver holes so the trigger can be installed and removed with rudimentary tools.
Triggers come with a slave pin for the trigger/disconnector assembly for easy installation.

3. Safety Advantages
The Geissele G2S is a 2 stage trigger where there is generous overlap of the sear surfaces which contributes to safety and a low tendency of any inadvertent movement of the trigger to discharge the weapon.
The Geissele G2S has a patented pseudo sear that is almost identical to the standard single stage sear. However, this secondary sear has surfaces that never touch during normal operation. This sear prevents the hammer from falling unless the trigger is pulled.
The secondary safety sear contributes to shooter confidence in dynamic/vehicle situations where a fellow shooter’s muzzle may cover him. There is firm knowledge that even with the safety in the fire position the weapon can never discharge unless the trigger is pulled.
Trigger timing is robust and parts have been sized to operate with a certain amount of wear to the working surfaces. The trigger is designed to operate in dusty, abrasive environments that cause wear."

New in box, in new condition. Comes in box with 1 magazine. Pink body color with black slide & magazine bottom. Great for concealed carry, packs a punch while still being easy to conceal.

Thanks to its thin, snag-free profile, the Nano effortlessly glides in and out of your holster, while its smooth contour and low weight offer you maximum comfort even for all-day carry. Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing.

Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days."

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns … and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art."

New in box, in new condition. Revolver .357 caliber. Barrel is on the bottom of the gun instead of the top, this causes improved accuracy. 

Defense revolver, offers great concealability thanks to a very unusual profile. The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire. The versions of 2"" Rhino with Double Action only (item codes ending with ""D"" instead of ""DS"") do not have an external hammer. All 2"" barrel Rhino revolvers are supplied with a beautiful leather holster included.

RHINO revolvers are supplied with the following outfit: 
GRIPS: Small rubber grip (item 970.327) by all 2"" barrel versions; Wooden medium grip (item 970.319) by all 4"", 5"" and 6"" barrel versions. 
FRONT SIGHT: Blade fluo (item 770.515) by all versions 
REAR SIGHT: None by 2"" models; adjustable in windage and elevation (item 270.056) by all 4"" and 5"" models; FLUO adjustable in windage and elevation (item 270.059) by all 6"" models
MOONCLIPS: three monclips are included with each Rhino, together with a tool for easy removal of shells. Caliber .357 models can be used both with or without moonclips.
2"" barrel models include a brown leather holster."

I travel quite a bit for my job and on the days that I'm not working I just don't find myself wanting to play paintball. Family, friends, and other hobbies have taken precedence. As a result i'm hoping to sell this as a lot for someone who will enjoy it more.

Everything is in 100% working condition. Guns are without and scratches, etc. Mask lenses are in fantastic condition with no scratching, etc. Jersey and pants are both L. Pads are also L. Tanks are both in hydro and have plenty of time left on them. Gearbag is massive and in perfect condition. About 4k paintballs (high grade) in the gear bag along with 10 or so pods. I purchased all of this either new or lightly used about a year ago and have only played with it about 3 times. My loss is your gain. Take the opportunity to take it all for a good price!

Asking $1200 OBO for the lot. Please don't refrain from offering.

I AM NOT INTERESTED IN SEPARATING ANYTHING AT THIS TIME. Please don't ask. If I find that I cannot sell the lot I will separate at a later date. The only exception is as follows: I am willing to sell all of the gear, minus the gear bag, to an individual whom the items will need to be shipped. That will save the ridiculous cost of shipping the gear bag.

Thanks for looking! Feel free to ask any questions you might gave on the gear. I'll be happy to fill in the many blanks I have probably left with my vague description of the gear haha."

This was my favorite, until recently.  You can't go wrong with a Ruger MKIII (or MKII).  They are as reliable as anything you'll ever shoot, and they will eat ANY kind of ammo.  This one has had the trigger smoothed out a little, and I've installed a special bushing to disable the really annoying magazine disconnect they ""upgraded"" this version with. This makes stripping and assembling the weapon much much easier, and also makes the mags drop free instead of having to pull them out.  I left the loaded chamber indicator alone, but you can do away with that as well.  It is a GREAT pistol, but I've decided I favor one that is a little lighter and more compact.  As much as I'd like to, I can't keep them all.  This was a special limited Talo edition.  It has hogue grips, but they have the ruger logo.  It is finished in a very cool matte black.  It came with a mean looking (but completely unnecessary) flash suppressor on it.  Take that off and install your suppressor, and grin every time you shoot it, because it's funny when you mainly just hear the impact of the projectile.  I'm sure it could end up being somewhat collectible, but it is also reliable and accurate...a great shooter.

All totaled I have over $1000 into this package. Not in a hurry and don't neeed to sell. But will take reasonable cash offers. I know I'm not gonna get what I paid for it, but shoot me a decent cash offer and I'll probably take it.

Must have cpl or purchase permit as this is a legal pistol. Will only meet f2f and will not ship. Not willing to travel over 30 mins for a deal."

I had been going to an FFL for a few years now and it was great.  They charged $20 I got a NICS check and was out the door.

CZ 91153 CZ-75 SP-01 9mm 4.7"" 18+1 w/Decocker NS Rubber Grip Black Finish

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72  bbl) from CZ to
feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the
NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913
accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ s corrosion
resistant black polycoat finish.  The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail
to protect the shooter's strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and
more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front
and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail
noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows
for more rapid target acquisition and transition. Thanks to its exceptional
accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also
found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting.

The gun is in excellent condition. It has had about 2 boxes of shells through it. I purchased for my wife, because of the recoil reduction stock, but she does not like it. I am asking $375.00. The closest gun I could find to this is a the same gun with a standard M4 style stock. you can order it for as low as 479.01, but that does not include tax. Here there is not tax or transfer fee, and this is a $130 stock on its own. Please text me at REDACTED with questions."

It will allow you to train with your glock, while spending only a fraction of the cost on your ammo.  The threaded barrel option also allows you to use a suppressor or other standard 1/2x28 muzzle device.  They are well made, and come very close to providing the same weight as the stock glock top end.  I bought this thinking it would be great to have a glock trainer and a suppressor host, but I prefer my little Ruger SR22 pistol.  I've shot exactly 20 rounds through it, so it is still just about new.  They are over $400 new.  If you've been wanting one, here is a chance to save some bucks.  Extra mags are readily available and affordable."
