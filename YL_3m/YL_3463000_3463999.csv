A micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. 
Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence 
of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Have a RARE box 1945 .45 AP steel core!/ also steel cased.

these shoot fine and have a steel rod inside them, I'm sure at the time it was just harder hitting ammo and they never knew it would become AP against BP vests, when I see it for sale from someone who knows what they have sells for $100+ a box, seen it as low as $25 in a ad they even claimed they had no idea about it, I would take $50 for a 50rd box and have about 40 loose rds I would ad on for $30 more

be sure to leave your # and where your located, I will ship but shipping ammo is not cheap and would have to drive 60 miles to do it..."

These are made in Turkey and imported to the U.S.
Pistol is a clone/improvement over the Smith and wesson/Walther p99 9mm. 
Pistol has seen approximately 50 rounds. Bought for personal carry but am getting into cowboy action shooting...so some of my handguns need to go.
Pistol comes in factory with case with all factory accessories. 
Includes: 
 Pistol 9mm 
1) 2 17 round magazines
2) Magazine loader
3) Cleaning brush and patch pull-through rod (made of vinyl)
4) Holster with belt clip and paddle clip (paddle installed on holster)
5) second backstrap for bigger hands
6) 3 front sights these are different heights to adjust for aim, plus sight removal/install tools.
7) lock and key
8) Padded, form fit case.
Pistol has a decocker on top of slide that works well and has a 2 stage trigger that removes the creep and slack of most striker fired pistols. The striker has a red rear face that protrudes from the slide to show it is cocked. This is one of the only true double action striker pistols i have found. The first stage of the trigger removes the slack. Once pulled to that point it catches on the second stage, the second stage has the typical slight creep but is a clean and predictable let off. Pistol recoils nicely and Has had no malfunctions being fed winchester white box and self defense ammo. 
Ive started playing cowboy on the weekends and am in need of boosting my six gun collection. will trade for cowboy action six gun. either cap and ball, a cap and ball converted to cartridge or single action 6. would truly love to trade for a Ruger old army or vaquero in 45lc/38spcl or an 1860 army converted to cartridge
To even things out in trade i have a Pietta 1851 confederate navy in brass that i can also toss in for the right deal or balance out a trade.
No cash price as i Dont have alot of money to buy a new vaquero or converted pistol. looking for used..."

It comes with a very nice hopper, large CO2 tank, CO2 tank cable for tactical carry, and a nice mask, and an ammo box, and even a bottle of o-ring cleaner lube. Everything you need and more. A paintball guru did the barrel and work, I bought it all from him last year for $200 plus trade. I am asking $120 or best offer or trade for a used .22 rifle, 30-06 or .308 ammo, or just ask.
It is like new and has been well cared for. The scope needs batteries, but it can be removed and played with.

I am 23 and have a pistol permit. This is not a kids paintball gun, I just never had time to enjoy it and now I wear glasses so I really have no use for it..

This is a brand new in box Smith & Wesson M&P9 semi-automatic pistol chambered for 9mm.

No other polymer pistol offers this combination of versatility, durability and safety. The barrel and slide are Stainless Steel with a black finish, and the structural components are also Stainless Steel. The frame is lightweight black Zytel polymer with an integrated accessory rail suitable for tactical lights or laser sights, making this an ideal self and home defense handgun. Three interchangeable palmswell grip sizes are included to ensure a comfortable hold for any operator. Trigger pull weight is approximately 6.5 pounds. A dovetailed white dot front sight and steel low profile carry rear sight are installed.

This model has no magazine safety or thumb safety, minimizing complexity and points of failure, for maximum reliability when it's need most.

My gun has always been touchy even with new magazines but I figure that someone else could fix it or it may work just fine in their gun as is.

The P30 is one of the most advanced police pistols of all time. During it's development the most important requirements were flexibility, functionality and safety. Ergonomics of the grip have been improved by interchangeable backstraps and side panel inserts. In combination with the ambidextr ous operating controls, this pistol can be individually adapted to almost any user. The P30L (for Long), has a slide and barrel that measure approximately a half-inch longer in length. Otherwise the P30L is essentially identical to the P30. The P30L V1 features the ""Lite"" LEM (Law Enforcement Modification) trigger system. With the V1 LEM every trigger pull breaks at the same weight: 4.5-5 lbs. No compromises have been made regarding safety. Its advanced loaded chamber indicator, which is easily seen and felt, positively indicates a loaded chamber. Another feature is the SuperLuminova 3-dot sights with non-tritium luminous dots, allowing an exact target acquisition even under poor lighting conditions.

This is an “almost” ready to hunt package! All you will need is a release. This was the bow I started bowhunting with three years ago. It was old then, and it still is, but you couldn’t get a bow this hard-hitting, will all of these extras, for anywhere close to this price in a newer bow. The bow is currently set at 29” draw length and 65lbs draw weight, but I believe draw is adjustable between 29”-31” and weight is adjustable between 45-70lbs. I think it has about 65% let-off.  It comes with a single pin pendulum sight, string silencers, limbsavers, a draw loop, kisser button, peep sight, stabilizer, quiver, and soft case.
It also comes with 7 arrows; 5 easton excel carbon 400’s, 30 ½” long, 3 with mini broadheads, 1 with expanding broadhead, and 1 with practice point. The other two arrows are a devils wrath carbon express 50/60 and a wolverine carbon express 50/60, both 29 ¾” long, without tips.  
The string was new last year and I have kept it waxed, so it is still good. The only thing it needs; the peep sight needs the rubber tube hooked up at the other end again (you can see it laying loose in one of the pictures). $75 or best offer."
