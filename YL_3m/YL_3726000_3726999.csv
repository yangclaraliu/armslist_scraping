The HK factory rebate ends 12/31/2014 so get yours as soon as possible from DEGuns.net! The HK45 new Compact Tactical builds on the ruged, military lineage of the Heckler & Koch HK45 series of handguns to devise the ultimate operator’s pistol. The HK45 pistol series compact and full-size models were chosen as the first firearms made at HK’s American manufacturing facility so it is only fitting that a modified variant would be adopted as the new pistol of a major U.S. special operations unit. The HK45 Compact Tactical (CT) is the closest a civilian can get to that military pistol. The HK45 CT comes standard with a threaded barrel, 10-round magazine with extended floor plate, and replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the pistol to suit individual hand size and shooting preferences."

This is brand new!  Many claim this is so, but any good gun guy knows the difference when looking at a lower to know if it's actually new or not.  I built it with the intention of purchasing a really nice upper.  Wife vetoed plans, no upper in my near future.  So, I figured I'd sell or trade it.  I'm not gonna jack up the price like many would do to take advantage of an already bad situation.  This lower cost me around $425 to build, so that's what I'm asking.  

I am not a kitchen table gunsmith, I was a unit level armorer as well as a Paratrooper when I was on active duty.  I am also a Glock Armorer, and can build AR's in my sleep.  This kit comes with the original boxes as well as the ""Official Letter"" from Sig Sauer authorizing it's use by the BATF.

Buffer tube is a KAK SUPER SIG SB-15 Pistol Buffer Tube Kit and a Sig Sauer Arm Brace.  Also comes with the KAK SIG TUBE LENGTH ADJUSTMENT KIT (KAK SIG LAK).

This is brand new!  Many claim this is so, but any good gun guy knows the difference when looking at a lower to know if it's actually new or not.  I built it with the intention of purchasing a really nice upper.  Wife vetoed plans, no upper in my near future.  So, I figured I'd sell or trade it.  I'm not gonna jack up the price like many would do to take advantage of an already bad situation.  This lower cost me around $425 to build, so that's what I'm asking.  

I am not a kitchen table gunsmith, I was a unit level armorer as well as a Paratrooper when I was on active duty.  I am also a Glock Armorer, and can build AR's in my sleep.  This kit comes with the original boxes as well as the ""Official Letter"" from Sig Sauer authorizing it's use by the BATF.  

**Must have CPL**  I will be working at the WAC Gun Show this weekend in Puyallup and can bring it with me."

Our classic Pardner, ready to hunt and offered in all the most popular gauges. It has a walnut-finished, pistol-grip hardwood stock, blued metalwork and fixed choke.

28"" Single Barrel Break Open 12G New Pardner Shotgun with choke built into the barrel.
This barrel is long enough that you could cut the choke off and it still be within the legal limit, which is 18"" I believe. Only reason to do so though would be if you plan on shooting slugs out of it, otherwise you should be fine.

These firearms are easy to customize and you could very cheaply make a personalized firearm, I've shown an example in the pictures.
Good for an experience shooter, or for a young beginner, but has quite a kick to it.

I bought this about 4 months ago, but have fallen on hard times. I've never shot it and it was bought brand new from Impact Guns, I'm just looking to get what I paid for it, maybe a little less. Feel free to make a reasonable offer.

This must be the finest striker-fired pistol made today (beats the crap out of a Glock, in my view). The trigger is amazing in being both light, smooth and having a really short reset.  This is the five-inch barrel version in 9mm.  Fantastic target shooter.  Comes with two 15 round mags, case and papers.  No more than 350 rounds fired.  Very nice, very clean, really looks new and is essentially just that.  Selling as I want to thin the herd a bit; have had it for less than six months.  This is a for sale deal, so cash please, no trades.  I always price my guns fairly, so don't waste your time or mine with dumb offers.  Much appreciated.  I can ship out of state to an FFL for $35, insured.  Otherwise, I follow Illinois laws for all in-state transfers."

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

The barrel is Alexander Arms, 18"" long with a 1/7.5 twist. The kit includes the Argonauts 7.62/6.5 bolt that the barrel was headspaced to. In addition, I'll throw in two C Products 5 round Grendel mags. The barrel has somewhere on the order of 300 ~ 350 rounds through it. All told, the kit has cost me around $1000 to assemble. The price I'm asking is barely more that enough to cover the parts involved. The Bushmaster gas system alone is worth over $400.

Things to note:
- There is a small brass shim under the front of the gas block to level it, this insures that the op rod rides smoothly.
- The gas block has been modified to be adjustable via set screw.
- The gas port is too large, in order for proper functioning the regulator should be set to the ""S"" setting.
- The barrel was short chambered from the factory and had to be throated by my smith. Consequently, it is no longer a SAAMI spec Grendel chamber, instead more akin to the Saturn ""Grendel II"". On the plus side, it no longer jams factory ammo hard into the lands"

I purchased the bolt for my model 19 but the arm is too large to fit my particular 19 (they changed designs a few times back then). 

This particular bolt has the block protruding from the side on rear section which I assume is for stabilizing. I am making this clear so you can know if its right for you because it wasnt made clear to me before buying and it wont fit my rifle. This was utilized in later models 23a/sporter/19 and mine turns out to be an earlier model 19. Asking $100 flat shipped.

The Magazine is marked ""sporter"" and fits my early model 19 and is also compatible with both sporter and 23a that used straight magazines. These fetch a pretty penny on ebay (where it will end up if no one buys here) but Id ship for $100 flat as well.

Both in excellent condition just need to find a good home!

Shipping is no problem if you have paypal.

This rifle is in very good+ condition, the blued finish is almost flawless, there are a few marks here and there on the stock from use, and one scratch on the bottom metal. This rifle has been glass bedded and free floated, and has a muzzle break installed. It shoots very well, sub 1 MOA with hand loads. I would approximate the round at less than 100 but don't have an exact count, I have owned this gun since 1995 or 1996, it was my first big game rifle and I bought it new. Unfortunately I need to clear out some room in the safe.

$600 OBO

Sale price includes a set of hornady dies, 14 rounds of 180g nosler partition loads, 13 rounds of 165g speer softpoint loads, and 18 rounds of fired brass.

This will have to be transferred through an FFL per Colorado Law, transfer will be at buyers cost at FFL of their choice that I agree to. If buyer does not have an FFL they prefer I would prefer to do the transfer at Gander Mountain in Thornton, they charge $20 for private party transfers.

I live in Brighton and work in Denver near Bass Pro, I am willing to meet somewhere within reason if you would like to take a look at the rifle.

Thanks for Looking."

For those that aren't familiar with the RTF finish, it was a limited run done by Glock, prior to them developing the Gen4's finish.   The stipple dots are finer than those on the Gen 4 models, and it's extremely effective.   This one also has the fishgill slide cuts.  This model is becoming hard to find.  

I bought this used from a friend as a backup for the pistol I was running in competition.   I shot it very little.   It has the Ameriglo I-Dot night sights, which are a two-dot set with a bright orange ring around the front tritium insert.   The rear notch is wider than the factory glock sights, for faster target acquisition.  There is a ghost 3.5lb trigger connector and a 1 pound reduction spring installed already, with all trigger components having been polished to a mirror finish.  It'll transfer with one 10rd Glock mag, three 17rd aftermarket mags, and an aftermarket 30rd magazine.

Primarily looking for a trade for a G34,  I can sweeten the deal for the right trade.  Cash price, I'm asking $550, and am located in SW Jacksonville near the new WalMart.  I can meet most evenings to show this pistol.  Buyer must have NC permit to purchase, no exceptions."

1. Jennings/Bryco .380 nickel plated semi-auto. The pistol looks to function and seems complete including one mag. The only thing I can see that's wrong with it is that the safety seems to be stuck in the off position.

2. Intratec CAT9 9mm pistol. It seems to function fine, it is pretty dirty though and the finish could use some TLC. It is missing the magazine.

3. Tanfoglio Titan .25acp. Comes with 2 mags and seems to function well, except that it's missing a firing pin and possibly other small parts.

Thanks to its unique projectile design this load possesses a higher ballistic coefficient than standard M855 ball. The noticeably longer projectile ensures it better retains both its velocity and energy over distance. The end result is it shoots flatter, drifts less in the wind and hits harder compared to standard M855. It also possesses greater sectional density for deeper penetration.

I believe I paid over $600 for the upper alone; however the ammo would be useless to me without the upper.  I'm willing to cut my loses and throw in the spam can of ammo in addition to 5 magazines for $850 cash.  The 5 magazines are also loaded with non corrosive (some Wolf & Red Army) ammo.  I have yet to shoot corrosive ammo through this upper and I would guess I have shot approximately 300 rounds through the gun before I cleaned it and has been setting in the safe since.  This is a piston driven gun and supposedly safer to shoot corrosive ammo through because the system is cleaner.  Also, there are youtube videos out there that will show you how to correctly clean the gun after shooting corrosive ammo. The piston system is adjustable and is made by Adams Arms with the Huldra name on it. I believe the piston system alone retails for around $300.

Product Description

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."
