The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers.

We are a local company that works to get you the best prices on handguns, rifles, shotguns and AR-15’s in Vermont. If you’re looking for something specific or have any questions call/text at 1-REDACTED

Comes in factory box with paperwork. Don't let the ""Duty"" designation trick you. The P-07 model is a compact handgun. It is just as appropriate for concealed carry as it is for uniformed duty. Easily adaptable to low light use, the Duty features an accessory rail to which a light or laser can be attached. The most innovative feature of the P-07 duty is the Omega trigger system. It simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull, but the real story is in the versatility it provides for its owner. The Omega system allows users to choose between operating the handgun with a decocking lever or a manual safety by a simple parts change.

The obvious differences between the Albanian SKS and those from other countries are:
1) The extended length stock and the extended 3 vent upper handguard that extend all the way to the gas block.
2) The trapdoor butt plate has 2 doors rather than the normal one.
3) The Albanians use an AK style charging handle rather than the round style used by all other countries.
4) The Albanian rear sling swivel is located on the left side of the butt stock as compared to the bottom of the butt stock on other models.

If you field strip it you don't find the typical signs of cheap manufacturing like you usually do on lower end guns: tooling marks, etching and pitting, it is as smooth as it is on the outside. The feed ramp is like glass, highly polished. It is not snappy at all the recoil pad which I thought might be gimmicky really friggin' works. I spoke to SCCY about the warranty and they said it is a no excuse warranty, they will fix the gun no matter what including ""squib loads"" or if you drop it, etc. They are really serious about standing by their product."

This does have a 28 inch barrel and is in the max 4 camo finish. This shotgun comes with one choke which is a modified. This shoot either 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells. These shotguns are imported by Benelli and use an inertia driven bolt. This shotgun has seen very little use and has only a couple very minor marks in the camo finish which can be seen in the pictures below. This shotgun was test fired and does function perfectly. If you have any questions please ask.

These are the same as the Atlantic Signal MH180s. These are the same headsets used my Naval Special Warfare Development Group (SEAL Team Six). These were used before they were widely replaced with the more current Atlantic Signal Dominator Suite.

They feature Bone Conduction technology. You receive radio transmissions through vibrations that travel over the cheek bones and bypass the ear canal. This way you can have any ear pro of your choice in but still maintain full Comms. They are a standard Military Plug for those type PTTs as well. Also features a noise canceling microphone. 

The package includes the original carry case and manual. (No PTT included)
These are hard to get and dont pop up very often. They retail for over $700 if you can get one.

I will only do PayPal transactions as they are most secure. Unless you are meeting me in person. No TRADES!"

So it looks like everyone just wants parts of this and not the whole things so I am now parting this out. I know what all of this is worth so please don't insult me with a low ball offer. I will list below all of the parts I have and if you have any questions please let me know. It does not currently have a front axle on the truck so a winch on your trailer would be a great help to get it loaded. I would also be willing to do a partial trade for something interesting. Guy stuff, guns, Motorcycles, Hunting. . .. But cash is king!!!

Rail was recently cerakoted Accuracy International Dark Earth. The McCann Industries MIRS mount starts life as a 14.5 lbs. block of 7075T6511 aircraft grade aluminum bar. It measures 2x3x14.5 inches. When machining has been completed the weight drops to 14.5 ounces, removing nearly 94% of the original material. This is not the cheapest way to make a mount…but it is the only way. Your optics must never wander from zero due to movement or vibration in the mount. There are no moving parts in the MIRS, no cast parts, and no adjustable or detachable parts…this is a rock-solid mount for precision shooters. After all machining is completed, a careful debur and vibratory tumbling is done to ensure a smooth and snag-free surface. If interested please text me at REDACTED"

I am not willing to break the package up. The package comes with:

-HK USP .45 V1 (a HK armorer can easily switch versions - DAO, SAO, decock only, etc.)
-5 factory 10 round magazines (new these mags are $55 ea at Midway)
-UTL (marked HK and made by Insight specifically for the USP) - you can see it is working in the photos
-Safariland 6004 holster (only holds USP)
-factory cases for both USP and UTL and factory manual for UTL
-Original factory 3 dot sights (Installed MTM night sights are faded)
-1 set of surefire batteries (batteries were only used to take the photos)

For a while, this was my night stand gun. I bought the holster as an impulse purchase. I probably put the USP in the holster a handful of times to try it out, and that was about it. It has never been carry weapon and has only been shot at a range using factory ammo.

The UTL has been stored with the batteries removed so there is no corrosion in the battery compartment. CR123 batteries have a 10+ year shelf life, so the odds of a 123 battery corroding in the compartment is pretty slim anyways.

I am the first owner of the pistol. I never thought I would sell it so I never kept a round count. This USP is a safe queen, and I've never even come close to dishing out what it is capable of taking (although there really aren't many people in the world that are physically capable of doing that). In short, I don't have the $ to have safe queens anymore (wives will do that to you), so to get something new I've got to get rid of something. Since I haven't taken the USP out in a very long time, it is the one to go.

If there's anything else you want to know about the pistol (date code, etc.), let me know and I'll see what I can do. I could go on about how this pistol was ahead of its time when it came out (and in many respects still is).
