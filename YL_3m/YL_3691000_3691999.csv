The Springfield Model 1873 was the first breech loaded rifle adopted by the U.S. Military. This infantry model in .45-70-Gov't Caliber was owned by my great grandfather who served the Union Army in the Signal Corps during the Civil war. 
The Springfield 1873 design was chosen for service from approximately 100 MFG's rifles submitted to the army. The single shot ""Trap Door"" design was chosen for its reliability even over faster repeating designs which tended to jam more readily. A recruit could load & shoot 8 rounds/ minute while an expert infantryman about 16/minute. 
The rifles were later used in the Spanish/American war and as buffalo rifles. 
This rifle is in good shape with minor nicks & scratches on the stock & forend. The U.S., U.S. Springfield, Eagle emblem, Serial Number (139949), & Model No. are clearly visible on the barrel, breech mechanisms, & butt plate.

Henry H001TV Lever-Action .17 HMR Rifle with 20″ Octagon Barrel, Walnut Stock, 10+1 Capacity

Like stagecoaches, swinging saloon doors and Pony Express riders, there are many innovations of the Old West that have long faded from use and live on only in Western movies and history books.

But there are still a few frontier staples that were so effective and ahead of their time that they remain in use today. Take, for instance, the intimidating octagonal barrels commonly found on the repeating rifles of that period. These heavy-duty workhorses sported added mass and extra weight to aid in heat absorption, making them the forerunners to the bull barrels used on modern target and varmint rifles.

So as a tip of our Stetson in honor of this timeless barrel style, we replaced the standard round barrel normally used on our world-famous rifles with a classic 20″ octagonal model, like those favored by the cowpunchers, lawmen, homesteaders and outlaws who blazed the trail westward across America. We rounded out this traditional look with an easy-to-adjust Marbles semi-buckhorn rear sight with a diamond insert and a highly visible brass beaded front sight seated in standard 3/8″ dovetail slots. A metal barrel band secures both the barrel and the high-capacity tubular magazine to the highgrade American walnut stock.

The popular Henry Lever action is now available in a frontier version with a 20″ octagonal barrel, fully adjustable semi buckhorn rear sight, beaded front sight and metal band. Features the famous smooth Henry action and American walnut stock. The receiver is already grooved to accomodate a scope.

It is all matching numbers and was made in 1854. The cylinder and hammer are rusted and will not move now. It is also still holding 4 or 5 of the loads from the day it found its way in the wall. Overall the gun is in pretty good shape and could be made operable easily. I wanted to leave it like it is and let somebody else decide its future. I would consider trades on silver or other guns. I live in Carson City and can meet in Reno for purchase. This is an antique relic and can't be shipped because of the remaining loads in the cylinder. Would trade for silver or nice Colt or S&W revolvers.

This was purchased new on 7-28-2000, during the brief window when these were available.
This is a really neat, very light ( 21 oz loaded) revolver on the L-frame with the K-frame round-butt grip. The action is very light & smooth. This is Not a safe-queen...was EDC for the past 14 years by my wife who has arthritis and can no longer handle the recoil. Round-count is right around 500... rated for +P also.
I have installed Hogue grips to replace the (too) small ""Boot"" grips that came standard, and installed a Hi-Viz front sight. Gun has honest holster wear, but is functionally very reliable...this is a shooter or CCW piece.
If you install a set of CTC laser grips on this bad-boy, it is a real tack-driver. Comes with the original box, trigger-safety-lock, 2 owners manuals and the original receipt from the gun-store.
Original price, after a S&W sponsored rebate was 370.73 in 2000...I have seen these for as much as 899 on the auction sites and at gun-shows.

By far the smoothest 1911 I've owned or ran, it feels like the slide is on ball bearings. It's got less than 400rds down the pipe. This pistol is in phenomenal shape and it pains me to get rid of it, but I'm in need of a full size. It will transfer with the two Remington factory mags, the box, and all paperwork. 

MSRP on this pistol is $1499. A local shop had one in stock in November for $1350 plus tax. I'm asking $1100 FIRM . Buyer must have NC Purchase Permit or NC concealed carry permit, and be willing to sign a bill of sale. I'm in SW Jacksonville, near the new WalMart."

 I bought the Sig new . One owner, me . Maybe 50 rounds through it. The Pistol , 4 mags (2 are extended for the pinky), bianchi in the waistband holster AND mag holder. A nylon belt holster with the mag holder attached . I can throw in the knuckles and Leatherman I ""forgot"" to turn back in post deployment . The nightmare has night sights . I have a  pocket holster also . Minus the ammo . Great for concealed carry , that's a no brainer. Very nice easy recoil surprisingly .. Tried to trade for anything that takes a regular AK mag but no one is serious. I bought it for retail therapy but I don't carry it by habit. My muscle memory works against me for this tiny thing . Ha Ha.  $550 for it all. Try looking at Phoenix Backpage. Cant get a better price for what I'm offering. Id prefer a CCW and/or AZ DL. Face to face transaction please. Cant find the box ."

I bought this a couple years ago with high hopes I would have time to get into 3-gun, but it simply never happened and now my interests are in other areas of the shooting sports.  This shotgun has had approximately 300 rounds through it, everything from 7 1/2 to 4 shot, as well as buck and slugs. Runs reliably, great gun, just don't have a use for it as I already have a HD shotgun.

I reduced the stock length by about 1/3"" and add a Limbsaver Airtech recoil pad.

This will come with the original box and accessories, including the original recoil pad, and Mod, IC, and Full chokes.

If you want some extended chokes, I have those as well in a nice hard plastic box, which I will sell for $75 extra. (search for these on here and you will see pictures). They are made by Carlson.

For those who are not looking to compete, this is also an excellent self-defense shotgun with only a 22"" barrel and fiber optic front sight.

Condition is good.  No scratches or gouges. The little tiny screws on top of the receiver have some signs of use from my unscrewing them, but not thing ridiculous."

997,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3691997,For Sale/Trade:  BERETTA ITALIAN 92 FS A1 (New Model)  w/accessories,"Laurel, south of Meridian, Meridian, Mississippi",$ 525,"Listed On: Sunday, November 9, 2014",Handguns,Beretta USA                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"2014 Beretta 92 FS A1, all original and as new. This gun is made in the Beretta Italy factory and is stamped as such on the slide.

 I special ordered an Italian model (took 6 weeks to get).  Tests I read of this FSA1 and M9A1 indicated the Italian made gun had tighter tolerances since it was not meant for combat. Also because I wanted the gun to be in that beautiful lustrous Beretta bluing. 

It does not disappoint in the looks department. It is a very good looking and good shooting gun. It does not have the same finish as the new 2014 M9 (American made model and also a fine gun). 

Very little use, less than 1 box of ammo. I fired two magazines through it (37 rounds). Dependable and accurate. I disassembled it (which is easy) cleaned it good and stored it. No scratches or marks at all, looks as new.

Also different from the M9, it has the 3-dot sights. 

The 92 FS A1 has added features over a standard FS Model. It has a rounded trigger guard, as opposed to the previous squared off model, which gives it a sleeker look, in my opinion. This is how the original Italian 92 looked. The rail on front is obvious. Less obvious is the enhanced internal frame rails.

 Also has the new front sight that can be changed without gunsmithing tools. Slides out and locks back tightly into place Description of all this is on Beretta’s web site.  

Comes with a new military web holster and military web pistol belt light brown (sand) colored, both never used in the field, only took out of the bag and placed the gun in it.  

Guns also comes with 3 new Beretta factory high capacity mags and a Beretta factory mag loader. Includes Beretta hard padded case, original box, factory bore brushes, Beretta factory gun lock and all original paperwork.  

I also have two full boxes of Federal factory ammo that goes with it.
