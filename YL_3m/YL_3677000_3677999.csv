Look around, these things are selling for $1150+tax everywhere, without the extra mags that go for $45 a piece, so $850 is a fair price and it's firm.  I pay transfer fee at the Shootist in Englewood or you pay at your FFL.

Ultra-fast. Ultra-reliable. Ultra-lightweight. The Taurus 85 View is our lightest firearm yet, weighing just over 9 oz. It’s no wonder the 85s are our most popular family. We pack them with a combination of customer-requested features and pair them with the .38 Special - making them powerful, easy to carry and lightning-quick to use. To many of our friends in Law Enforcement, these are must-have revolvers. 

Taurus Security System
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

The barrel is marked with, “Remington Arms Union Metallic Cartridge Company, Remington Works, Ilion, N.Y. U.S. A.” over “Pederson’s patents Jan. 5, 1909, Oct 12, 1909, Mar 8 1910, Nov. 21, 1911, April 16, 1912” It is also stamped, “MODEL 12-A”.

Caliber is marked .22 short, long, or long rifle. On the underside of the receiver, it has RW then the serial number. The rear tang on the bottom is stamped with “Remington UMC” in a circle.

Serial number is 43697x.

It _may_ have been refinished because the sight bases look more worn than the barrel and receiver, and the serial number and tang stamp show some odd wear. It may have been from polishing, or it may have been an uneven factory stamping. That said, except for the wear on the mag tube and a scuff on the plastic buttplate, this gun looks new. If it was refinished, it was done professionally, and done well.

My local Wal-mart has new Remingtons with worse blue.

Everything works like new, so if you just want a great squirrel or rabbit gun with some history, this will make you happy.

Really, though, it would look better in your cabinet or hanging in a shadow box over the mantel? It really looks good.

The barrel is 22 inches, rifling good. I haven’t taken it apart, and I’m not going to. It is too tight right now, and I don’t want to scratch it or warp something. But everything looks good, and works as it should.

Please ask any questions _before_ you place a bid."

From Winchester:
With newly designed barrels that feature an improved, lighter contour for better balance and a more responsive swing, the Field is the workhorse of the Winchester Supreme® Select line-up. The engraved receiver and barrels are richly blued, and the finely crafted walnut stock and tapered forearm have been precisely calculated to put you on target the instant you snap the gun to your shoulder. The low profile receiver houses heavy-duty ejectors and dual, tapered locking lugs designed to independently adjust for wear. 3"" chrome plated chambers ensure durability and long life. The safety doubles as a barrel selector.

https://danieldefense.com/firearms/mid-length/daniel-defense-m4-carbine-v5.html

I purchased and added on to this rifle after doing many months of research on creating the ""perfect weapon system"" for any defensive/offensive situation in virtually any scenario that would come up. ONLY reason I am selling is because I am saving up for a full auto, so my baby has to go...

As part of building this weapon system, I chose the:

-Daniel Defense M4 Carbine because it kept popping up in list after list of the ""best of the best"" because of its durability, attention to detail/quality, and adherence to Military Specifications/tolerances. Watch this video on YouTube and you'll see why the DDM4 is the best M4/AR15 on the market from a durability standpoint http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kX0nCEh5E

-Burris MTAC Ballistic CQ/LR (Close Quarter/Long Range) tactical optic because it offers both Close Quarters and Medium/Long Range capabilities in the same platform and the same time. Using ""true 1x"" it allows for both eyes open use (just like a red dot...AimPoint for example), and up to 4x magnification with built in 5.56 BDC reticles for effective engagements up to 600 yards. Just zero for 100 yards (which it already is) and your ready to go out to 600 yards using the built in BDC dots. It is extremely clear, has illuminated reticle (which work even if the battery dies), weather and shock proof, with a lifetime warranty. It is just like having both a Red Dot and a Tactical magnified scope in one, giving you the best of both worlds in one small, lightweight package.

-5.11 LED Tactical Lightweight High Output Weapons light because of it's superior performance inside of an extremely light frame. It is weather/shock proof with high, low, and strobe capabilities. Mounts perfect along side the foregrip for easy of use in any conditions.

-45 degree backup sight for obvious reasons; just in case something were to happen the MTAC optic this rifle can still be effective at close and medium/long ranges.

-Viking VTAC battle sling after much research in the best sling for all situations. Check out how awesome this sling is here: 
http://www.vikingtactics.com/product-p/vtac-mk2.htm

-Quick detach Harris bipod. Small and compact, but adjustable and sturdy. Can be added/removed to the M4 very quickly if the situation requires it. Quickly turns this M4 from a close quarters machine into a medium/long tactical precision weapon. 

Comes with everything listed above, plus:

Hard Carrying case, (4) 30 round mags, 90 rounds of ammo, scope lenses covers, and original boxes for most accessories.

As you can see from the photograph, this has a very good bore, with sharp clean rifling (it more than likely never actually shot a grenade due to the bore condition). Needless to say, the action works perfectly and it is accurate out to 200 yards. Here is your chance to add a very interesting and collectible version of the Enfield rifle to your collection.

The Rock Island Armory 1911 series consists of a product line of single-action recoil operated semi-automatic pistols. They are designed and manufactured by Armscor in Marikina City, Philippines, and distributed in the United States by Armscor USA, located in Pahrump, Nevada.

RIA (Rock Island Armory) 1911s are clones of the US Military G.I. M1911-A1, the standard issue US Service pistol from 1911 to 1985. Most RIA models are targeted for the low-end price point of the 1911 pistol market and are basic entry level MIL-SPEC versions of the 1911, however, the RIA Tactical, Compact, and Match models offer additional semi-custom high end features. The Compact model features a skeletonized hammer and beavertail grip safety while the Tactical model also adds a target-grade hammer and trigger as well as an ambidextrous safety, and enhanced contrast combat sights. Armscor is an ISO 9001 certified-compliant company which manufactures Rock Island pistols using CNC (Computer Numerical Control) equipment. RIA 1911 series pistols are constructed of 4140 chromoly steel with a cast frame, and are available in .45 ACP, .38 Super, 9mm Luger, and .22 TCM chamberings.

The CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.
The P-07’s safety and de-cocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large back straps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.
The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 made to date.

IMPORTANT: I work on ak and ar15 rifles and I have made custom improvements to this gun. I smoothed the rails that the bolt slide on for increased reliability and I filed down the internal threads on the muzzle break to make it fit flush instead of wobble to increase accuracy and reduce recoil.   It runs like an arsenal Ak. Iron Sights are upgraded and rear adjusts for both wind and elevation. Has Quad rail and  Ported gas tube for less  recoil. Comes with red dot, bipod grip and sling.

Have I got some birds for you!

These birds were raised on pasture so in addition to high quality poultry feed they ate such turkey delicacies as clover, dandelions, mulberries , choke cherries, crickets and grass hoppers.

They spent days outside in the sun moving around and their nights roosting on an old swing set. They had a nice shed to sleep in which they refuse to use, stupid birds. Anyway what this means is you get a bird with more flavor than your basic store bought turkey. The dark meat will be darker and the bird will overall be less salty since its not injected with salt water.

This years birds are Broad Breasted Bronze so theyre going to run a little bigger than last years birds. They will have bigger breast more like a grocery store bird, but with more flavor. They'll come to you professionally butchered and frozen. Quite a bit like you get from the store. You'll get the neck and giblets for your gravy or for the dog.

I'm thinking $2.50 per lb. I can deliver to say 30 miles around Edelstein IL, maybe further if you want a couple.

I have the following sizes left

34.75
33.31

History of J frame: When the first all-steel small frame (J) revolver was introduced in 1950, it became an instant success. Originally named the Chiefs Special by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, it has become the first choice for those who insist on an all steel, small frame revolver with greater recoil control and proven performance.  The Smith & Wesson J-Frame has become the most popular small frame personal defense revolver on the market. With decades of reliable performance to its credit, the J-frame line offers models capable of firing .38 S&W Special and the more powerful .357 Magnum® loads."
