I have fired between 30-40 shots and properly broke in as listed on Savage website.

Scope is double ringed (I paid an extra $100 for a second set)  insuring no loss of accuracy under the toughest conditions.

The scope is 35mm tubed and Illuminated Mil Dot, sighted in on 208 Gr. Hornady A-max and HPBT handloaded ammo.

If you hand load, I have new components that I will sell as well. You'll pay what I paid.

I will let you shoot this before you buy it, we will go to a local gun range and you can shoot at 100 yds.  You will be sold on the first shot, but I will let you shoot more. (free)  I have 20 to 30 rds of factory ammo I will throw in the deal.

This gun is ready to go and you don't have another added expense of burning up ammo sighting and adjusting, just pick it up and shoot.

I will not separate the scope from the gun unless someone wants the gun only first.

I am buying another savage 300 win mag that can be used for hunting as well.

I just did all the research for you, you can put this together for $2855, not counting the shipping/tax/time gas/etc.  I paid more, I put this together when these guns were getting $2200 alone.
Double check and see if you can do better if you like, if you can, I will consider a lower offer.

This gun is only for certain individuals looking for this kind of set up, I have done all the work for you.  I am the original owner.

I have the original boxes for everything.

I've had a couple of questions about recoil, there really isn't much and I don't consider it a problem or unpleasant.

Listed now on Gunbroker will be removed from here after 1st bid.

I re-chambered it in 8mm so it could shoot cheaper mil surplus rounds in that caliber and it would be easier to find factory rounds for hunting.  I put a new Yugo 8mm Mauser barrel on it and an ATI tactical stock.  AIM Sports scout scope mounted.  It does have a bent bolt so you can put a normal rifle scope on it but I like the performance and fast target acquisition a scout scope provides so I went that route.  

This rifle is extremely sound, rugged, well built, and in mint condition.  the Czechs made their Mausers almost better than the Germans.  They don't make rifles like they used to, there's not one ounce of recycled steel on this gun.  The barrel has only about 70 rounds through it and I've always cleaned it after shooting. The lands and grooves aka rifling are in mint condition.  The barrel is unfinished for looks, I always keep a light coating of rem-oil on it.  8mm is a nice round, similar to 30-06, .270, .303 etc.  

 I have 50 mil surplus rounds and 34 Remington Core-Lokt rounds, for hunting, to go with it.  

Would possibly consider a trade or partial trade.   If you have any questions let me know.  Buyer pays for background check.  Thanks."

Up for sale is a beretta 92fs . I've put close to 10,000 rounds through it and noticed a slight bulge in the barrel . I've never had a squib and have personally put most of the rounds through the gun .so I contacted beretta and they said it was common with barrels towards the end of their life . Not sure how I did it with 10,000 rounds, i think theyre rated for over 30,000 rounds and I haven't even put many hp through it . But I don't shoot it anymore so I've factored a new barrel and new recoil
Spring into the asking price .Also , the rifling looks perfect . Typically you'll see a dark spot where the bulge is located but the rifling looks brand new which leads me to think there was some sort of defect in the barrel to cause it to start to fail
Prematurely . I had a gunsmith friend of mine look it over and shoot it . He said it wasn't an issue . The only reason I even mention the barrel is so you know exactly what your getting and so there's no surprises  once the deals been made .
It's in good condition other than than the mentioned problems . Some small scratches in the finish as well comes with 2 mags  ( us made
Model )


Up for sale / trade is a used glock 22 gen 3. It shoots great but I got a gen 4 the otherday for my birthday so it's time for it to find a new home . It has the following upgrades : extended slide release , extended take down tabs , extended magazine release , trijicon night sights and stainless steel recoil spring assembly . Comes with two 15 round magazines and one 22 round with metal ( si vis pacem para bellum ) base plate . All magazines fActory . Will also include glock hard case , original mag release and original polymer baseplate . Does have holster ware on the slide and some marks in the frame .

5.56mm chamber (shoot either 5.56mm or .223)

Manganese Phosphate finish barrel
F-Marked Front sight base

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports carbine length M4 cool tunnel handguards, and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of heavy-weight (.950 diameter under the handguards, .750 under the front sight base) dimension their full length which alleviates barrel whip and enhances accuracy in semi auto fire and helps dissipate heat. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9""; twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition.

There's also alot of chatter about mid-length uppers being better than M-4 style uppers. It is a matter of preference either way. I believe the part # is DD-07166. Brownells sells it for $459 plus shipping. You can get it now and not have to wait for shipping and save a little dough. It is brand new, unfired. It even has the original box, bag and label on it."

For sale is a Noveske 18"" stainless steel barrel (5.56mm Noveske Match Chamber), 7pt rifling. Lightweight profile, pinned Noveske-marked low-profile gas block, intermediate gas length system. Barrel includes factory pinned gas block, pins, and gas tube.

Manufacturer link here: Lightweight Contour Barrel, 556
http://www.shopnoveske.com/products/lightweight-5-56mm-stainless-barrel

This barrel has 150 rounds of Hornady 75gr BTHP, and 90 rounds of Federal 55gr M193 through it. Barrel and gas block have handling and installation marks/scratches, but very clean overall.

This would make a fantastic barrel for a 3-Gun rifle. I built it as a lightweight precision rifle that would double for 3-gun, but ultimately prefer a 14.5"" N4 barrel for 3-gun.

Additionally, for sale to whomever purchases the barrel is the Surefire MB556K muzzle brake that was installed on it. It is an older generation SF brake that the finish matches quite closely to the matte stainless on the barrel. (Trivial and cosmetic, but it's nice). The brake is not for sale separately. Add the brake to the barrel purchase for $70. This includes the washers to time it to *this* barrel."

This is an all Belgium made firearm with all matching serial numbers. Not many of these were made and even less made their way into the USA. This model of the Hi-Power was designated for law enforcement usage only, which further contributed to its scarcity.

Further information on the gun: It was made from 83-87 and production ceased. It was made as the ""BDA"" in the USA and in Europe as the ""DA"" as is pictured here. Not very many of the ""DA"" models, like I have, made it to the USA. Thus, the rarity. The DA models that were made in Europe were designated for Law Enforcement usage and were rare in Europe as a result. 

Gun comes with FN carry case and the original magazine. Also comes with original cleaning kit provided by FN.

Also included is 7 black bulgy 30 rounders, 1 East German 30 round bakelite, 3 Izzy 30 round bakelites, 3 RPK74 bakelite 45 rounders and 4320 rounds of 7N6 ammo sealed in their wooden crates.
