(Patrol Rifle Optics) for sale for 350 obo. I bought this sight with a rifle and the sight has only been mounted to one gun that wasnt even shot by the previous owner. I am located in Prairie du Chien WI and would be willing to travel within an hour of my location to sell this. I would be willing to ship this but you will pay for the shipping and the paypal fees as I will only accept paypal if not meeting face to face. Below you will find the description as seen on Aimpoints webpage. If you have any questions do not be afraid to email me or text me at six08-six4two-3six4nine. Sight will come with box, battery, sight, and mount.
A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.

The front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machineguns. The QRP2 mount also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in an emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.

Unique features for Patrol Rifle Optic
• Always ready - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery. 
No need to fumble with switches prior to use.
• 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances.
• In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking

conditions and waterproof to 150 feet.

The result is a fun, versatile .22 rifle that enthusiasts of all ages are sure to enjoy.

The 10/22® 50th Anniversary Design Contest Winning Rifle is the result of Ruger's most extensive Voice of the Customer Program ever: In late 2013, Ruger invited fans to submit ideas for their ideal 50th Anniversary 10/22®. Ten contest finalists were put to a vote on the Ruger website and, after almost 40,000 votes were tallied, the winner emerged!

""For 50 years, the Ruger 10/22® has been America's favorite .22 rifle and this Contest Winning rifle is a great representation of what Ruger is trying to do today - listen to its customers,"" said Chris Killoy, Ruger President and Chief Operating Officer. ""The idea for this gun was submitted by one of our customers, and voted on by many more.""

Based on the original 10/22® rifle, this model features the ergonomic, lightweight black composite stock and the Ruger® Modular Stock System from the Ruger American Rimfire™ rifle. It also includes a protected, non-glare post front sight, ghost ring adjustable rear aperture sight, and Picatinny rail from the popular Gunsite Scout Rifle. The special edition rifle is rounded out with a precision-rifled, cold hammer-forged, stainless steel barrel, which is capped with a blued alloy steel SR-556®/Mini-14®-style, 1/2''-28 thread flash suppressor."

if you're not familiar with this relaoder or think they're all the same please do a bit of research on this model. It's one of the top in it's class. 

Other cheap reloaders have you don't most of the work (placing the primer, rotating the cylinder, placing the wad, etc). This one is completely automatic. you just keep the supplies filled and you get a ready shell with the pull of a lever. 

Also before you offer a price please mentally include the supplies i am including (specifically the shot aka the BB's). look around online and see that each 25 pound bag goes for $50.00. 

THINK OF IT THIS WAY: with the amount of BBs that comes WITH THE RELOADER you can make 1600 rounds (if you use 1 ounce per load, which is normal). 100 lbs = 1600 ounces

 I am posting this ad for a friend. Only 350 rounds through the gun. This fine pistol was not used as a carry gun. Only a few visits to the gun range and it was cleaned each time. PM me to arrange to meet. He is only selling to pay some bills. I wish I could buy this off of him.

Comes with 1 30 round polymer magazine

It has a pin retaining plate, instead of a fishhook wire, makes taking the trigger group out MUCH easier.

It also has a tapco ak74 style muzzle brake, makes the gun much louder and much easier to handle with recoil.

Retaining plate is worth 5 dollars, the brake 30. both come with the rifle.

Rifle is in good condition, shoots great.

I'm a bad shot, and I can hit a cup with iron sights at 60 yards with it, and a 14x10 piece of steel consistently at 75 yards, that's as far as I can shoot in my back yard, or I would try to shoot longer distances with it. 

it's plenty accurate for an AK, a good shot could hit targets at 150-200 yards no problem, maybe 300 with proper glass on it.

Selling it so I can put together an AR.

I've put close to 250 rounds through it, so there is some carbon on the piston, but I clean it regularly and with a little elbow grease and some carbon remover, you can make it shine if that's what you feel like doing.

The micro ak features a 7"" barrel its the shortest production ak. shorter than the Mini Draco. It has a thick wood fore end grip. It handles like a Czek Scorpion. I have added customized grip tape tiger striping to add some grip to the forend and enhance the looks. I also upgraded the pisotl grip to the CAAA Isreali rubberized ak grip (not pictured)  other than that its stock and unfired. I bought it brand new and have the box. 

will come with 2 30 round magazines and one bulgarian 40 round mag (rare and expensive)

I have ammo if you need ammo to purchase separately."

The Saiga shotguns are banned from importation by Obama so the price will only go up, and most retailers say they don't know when or if they'll get more in.  Already the shotguns are priced around $800 (if you can find them online), plus shipping and transfer fees at your FFL. Plus add in the cost of the ammo and case and you're already getting a huge discount. 

The shotgun with the two factory magazines and ammo is $650 cash or $700 trade value.  If you want the other 10-round magazines, they're $25 each or $40 for both.

If you want, I will install a new Kushnapup bullpup stock and include it and a recoil pad for a total of $950, and of course provide the original stock and forearm and hardware.

Factory bobbed hammer, double-action-only. 

This revolver is intended as a special purpose self defense piece rather than a plinker, and has some interest to collectors of odd J-frame variants.  It is a great choice for anyone who is unduly sensitive to recoil, or for situations where overpenetration is a factor.  It is very well made for a Taurus, with tight lockup and perfect timing.  Very accurate within its effective range of 30 feet.  Zero recoil, low noise, no chance of a jam.

Revolver is in Excellent condition with minimal carry wear.  VERY nice shape.  Comes with over 200 rounds of V-MAX ammo, Snap-Caps for dry fire practice, a set of vintage Ajax synthetic pearl grips (in addition to the stock rubber grips pictured), a .17 caliber bore brush, and the original plastic carry case (with manual, paperwork, keys).  Does not come with a holster, but any S&W J-frame holster will fit it perfectly.

I have roughly 450 invested in this package (including grips, ammo, accessories).  I will take 340 cash.  Need money for bills so not particularly interested in trading, but might consider swapping for a small frame bobbed hammer .38 Special Taurus or Charter Arms, or a Baby Browning.  I will consider 38 Special or 45 ACP ammunition as a partial trade, but I am particular (no reloads, USA manufacture only, 45 needs to be standard pressure 230 gr only).  I reserve the right to withdraw this item from sale at any time, or to refuse to deal with anyone I don't like.  WILL NOT SHIP.  CASH ONLY.  Thanks."

A muzzle brake was then added, this should help keep the front down for quick target re-acquisition. Total length of rifle is 38.5"".  A Simmons Predator Quest 4.5-18X44 was then added to the rifle. I love Simmons scopes, for the money they are unbeatable. The optics are sharp and bright. The glass was installed with a custom picatinny rail and 30MM three bolt Vortex  rings, medium height. I then added a Barska 8""-11"" bi-pod ""very well made for an inexpensive bi-pod"". I have never fired this rifle but Ruger Americans have ridiculous reviews. Everyone from Nutnfancy to Rifleman magazine have had nothing but praise for these rifles. I would like to trade this rifle but would take cash of coarse.

Inc.  It was completely made in Poland so it features a Polish receiver and a Polish cold-hammer forged and chrome lined barrel.  I gave this gun to a professional gunsmith and added a Polish Tantal stock which is very similar to the stock that came with it but is much stronger and has a sling attachment on it. I will include the original side folding stock as well.  I then added a new muzzle brake by CNC Warrior since the I.O. brakes are very brittle and I do not really like the slant muzzle brakes.  The gun was refinished in a semi-gloss molyresin finish which is extremely durable and beautiful.  All this work was done by Meridian Ordnance which is an extremely competent and professional gunsmith company here in Kentucky. The owner does superb work on Ak and Ar-15 platforms as well as other gun platforms. I would recommend Meridian for any of your gunsmithing needs. I did not have any work done to the gun that changed the operation of the firearm. It is brand new and unfired. I bought the rifle at Centerfire Systems for $499.99 before taxes. The Tantal stock cost me $50.00. The work and refinishing of the gun cost $150 and the muzzle brake cost me $35.  I have five brand new Croatian metal magazines which have a bolt hold open feature like the Yugo mags and they cost me $18 a piece at Centerfire. I also have four Magpul mags that cost me $15 a piece and I have the original two American made polymer mags that come with it as well, so I have a total of 11 mags that come with the gun.  Six of the mags are fully loaded with Tula FMJ ammo and one of the mags has 20 rounds, so 200 rounds total come with the gun.  In the total package I have just over $1000.00.  I am asking $900 obo for the total AK package. I am not looking for trades and lowball offers will be ignored. I know how much the gun and the work I had done to it is worth as well.  If you are looking for a quality made, military grade AK package then send me your offer. Thanks and text me at REDACTED if interested."

I picked up 2 of these, and actually chose to keep the uglier of the 2.  This one has a nicer looking stock, and metal finish is good overall.  Bore has good rifling and is fair to good condition.  Underneath the handguard it has the usual Type 53 corrosion on barrel which is pretty common.  Solid shooter that you can either refinish and make pretty or just go to war as-is. Bolt is a mismatch but rest of rifle parts match each other.

The FN Model 1903 (M1903, FN Mle 1903), or Browning No.2 was a self-loading semi-automatic pistol engineered by John Browning and made by Belgian arms manufacturer Fabrique Nationale (FN). It was introduced in 1903 and fired the 9 x 20 mm SR Browning Long cartridge. It should not be confused with the US-made Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless (in .32 ACP), nor with the Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammer (in .38 ACP). The FN Model 1903 is based on the same mechanical design as the Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless, which Browning sold to both companies (and others as well), but enlarged to handle the more powerful 9mm Browning Long cartridge. Due to its reliability, accuracy, light weight, and quick reloading, the M1903 was an issued sidearm for many police forces and militaries. The pistol was initially introduced by FN as the Browning Modèle de Guerre (Browning War Model) or Browning Grand Modèle (Browning Large Model).[1]

Pre-war Production
FN requested John Browning to prepare a prototype in 1901. FN manufactured a few samples for Norway and Sweden to consider as military weapons. Norway opted for the Colt M1911 pistol in the form of the Kongsberg M/1912, but Sweden ordered 10,000 pistols (designated m/1907) as standard military sidearms in 1907. The Ottoman Empire ordered 8,000 pistols for police use between 1908 and 1914, and the Russian Empire ordered approximately 11,000 with detachable shoulder stock holsters for their police forces during the same time period. An additional 9,000 pistols were sold commercially before production was discontinued when the FN factory was overrun by troops from the German Empire in August 1914.
Swedish production
Sweden obtained a license to manufacture a variant of the design for domestic use as the Husqvarna m/1907 and began production in 1917 to meet both military needs and civilian demand. Husqvarna produced military pistols for Colombia when FN was unwilling to resume production in the 1930s. Sweden had manufactured 89,230 pistols when production ended in 1942.[2] Early Husqvarna-produced pistols included the slide marking of either ""Browning's Patent"" or ""System Browning"". This practice was discontinued after World War I at the insistence of FN, which had been granted the exclusive right to use John Browning's name firearms marketing.
The Swedish military designation was pistol m/07 and it was the standard sidearm until the adoption of the Lahti L-35 (pistol m/40) in 1940 when it was declared substitute standard. The pistol m/07 was taken out of storage and pressed into service in the 1980s as the bolts of the Lahti L-35 pistols started cracking due to the use of a more powerful 9 mm P cartridge (9 mm m/39B, adopted as standard in the 1960s). This was an interim solution until deliveries of the new Glock 17 (pistol m/88) were complete.
Post-war production
The Estonian pistols were sold to Spain in the 1930s where many saw use in the Spanish Civil War. Some of the Swedish pistols were used by Finland during World War II. Surplus pistols, primarily of Husqvarna production, eventually found their way to the United States where many were modified by the importers with a chamber bushing to fire the more common .380 ACP ammunition
