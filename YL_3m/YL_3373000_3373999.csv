If you don't know about this shotgun, here's a few basics.

Kel-Tec, located in Cocoa, FL, is big on innovation. the KSG is a prime example of this. 
http://www.keltecweapons.com/our-guns/ksg/shotgun/

each magazine tube holds 7 2-3/4"" shells. One in the chamber makes 15rds total. 

The magazine tubes can be loaded with different types of loads. you can select from each magazine by toggling a lever. I have added an extended lever, making tube-selection a one-handed process (you can move the lever from one side to the other, using your wrist. No need to release grip from the gun!).

This is a pump action shotgun. The primary issue with this gun from the factory, is the pumping action can easily pinch your hand, if you aren't gripping the foregrip/charging grip properly. I have remedied this with a rail-mounted flashlight/handle. 

I have also added a muzzle brake. I will also include the original retainer nut, as well as the special tool purchased to remove/install this nut.

Purchased from Kel-Tech, were ambidextrous single-point sling hooks. They slip into the receiver, with no tools required for install. there is one hook on each side of the gun.
http://www.keltecweapons.com/ksg/ksg-accessories/ksg-single-point-sling-attachment/

also included is a rail mounted riser, ideal for mounting a red-dot or similar optic. I found that without the riser, peeping through a red dot was difficult."

The CM4043 has the same external dimensions as the PM4043, which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel.

The CM4043 is chambered in a .40 S&W caliber, has a 3.1"" barrel and an overall length of 5.47"", with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 15.8 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models include: the CM4043 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; and finally, the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

The CM40 boasts real sights, which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally, the slide does lock back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of other value priced compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM40 slide is machined from solid 416 stainless steel with a matte finish and is only .94 inch wide. Each gun is shipped with one 5 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush floorplate. Magazines are made in the USA, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after many uses.

Just like the CM9, the new CM40 will include all of the great features that make Kahr pistols one of a kind. Kahr's seven patents result in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today:
- The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds.
- Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety), and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations. Many lower cost compact semi-autos on the market today do not have firing pin blocks in their design.
- Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame, and since there is no hammer, the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price, but did not compromise on the features, accuracy or reliability found in all Kahr pistols."

It is identical in size, shape and checkering design to the walnut stocks that came on the Featherweight rifles.

I've thought about keeping it - since I don't own any other rifle that is so beautiful and feels so much like a 'Cadillac' - but the reality is that I'll probably never shoot it. I'm not a hunter and the aesthetics of this rifle are wasted on me. The action just screams 'quality' when you open it and the wood is gorgeous. Definitely a big, big step up from a 30-30 deer rifle bought at Walmart! 

The rifle is in excellent condition with only minor cosmetic issues. Manufactured (according to the Ruger site) in 1978, just after the 'warning' text was added to the barrel (the aficionados know and care about this). 

There are a few minor dings here and there (clearly this was someone's hunting rifle), but very minor. The butt pad is getting dry and could probably stand to be replaced, but it is intact and functional - just original, 36-year-old rubber looking its age. Quick detach swivels installed and leather sling. 

The scope is a vintage Redfield 3-9 zoom with the 'wide field' view or whatever they called it. The optics are a little dirty - I received it without lens covers and I haven't cleaned it up yet. Nonetheless the view is clear through the scope and I see no problems with it. Just needs a gentle cleaning. 

The new ones aren't this nice and they're $1400. This is a classic and will be the envy of any deer hunter."

The CM9093 has the same external dimensions as the PM9093 which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. The CM9093 is chambered in a 9 x 19 caliber, has a 3.0"" barrel and an overall length of 5.42, with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 14 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the 6 rd stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models are the CM9093 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings and finally the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

Kahr's seven patents are incorporated into the CM9093 resulting in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today. The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety) and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations.

Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame and since there is no hammer the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The CM9 boasts real sights which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally the slide locks back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of lower cost compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM9 slide is only .90 inch wide and machined from solid 416 stainless slide with a matte finish, each gun is shipped with one 6 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush baseplate. Magazines are USA made, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings.

Save some money over getting a new one, and no tax either. If you have never fired a piston driven AR then you should immediately. Much easier to control in my opinion.

    It comes with a fully functional (recoil tube is milled to facilitate 3-position adjustment, unlike the civilian M1014's which also came with the C-stock but could not be used as such) factory-installed 3 position collapsible stock, luminous 3-dot sights (factory luminous paint, not tritium), and all paperwork, factory box, etc. It is unfired, factory new.

    The barrel is the 2 gas-port design (some older LE guns were sold with 4-port barrels and meant only for low-recoil ammunition) and takes interchangeable choke tubes (Benelli/Beretta ""Mobil"" chokes). All paperwork is included, and is what makes this gun unique versus an 11707 with an added C-stock.

    I am a purist, and I prefer the LE model designation. If that doesn't matter to you, you can piece one together by buying a standard 11707 and a factory collapsible stock. As for me, I like the LE designation and the fact that the factory installed the collapsible stock.If you would like to make an offer, hit me up but serious offers only."

Selling my Smith & Wesson 629 classic 44 magnum revolver with 5"" barrel. The gun is beautiful and I hate to see her go, but I am selling a hand full of my guns to get out of some debt. The gun has no issues. It is double/single action, the trigger is amazing, and the stainless steel finish is like new. A few small surface scratches, but nothing major. The cylinder to barrel fit is as good as new, and there is no hammer creep. Gun is in very good condition. No trades will be considered, except possible partial trade for 4x4 atv. Ive already lowered the price twice and this is the lowest i was going to go. I am firm on the price. call or text me (Josh) at 716 425 eight5six2   Transaction will take place at FFL at the cost of the buyer  Local Pickup ONLY"

This was traded in a week or so back. We have since test-fired it and it runs flawlessly. We've built a few of these in the past, so we know what to look for and this one was done right. It started life as a Yugo SKS then it was custom-fit to the SG Works bull pup kit, the barrel was cut to legal length and the muzzle break was added. The sling, tactical drag bag, red dot, and extra brand new mag are also included. The asking price as it sits with everything is $650, which is really a deal because you couldn't buy all the parts for that price. That doesn't even take into consideration the time to put this together. These are by no means drop-in kits, I had 6+ hours on the bench for the last one we put together for a customer. I've shot many bull pups and this is one of my favorites and by far the best bang for your buck. Tavors are great, but they're 3 times the price and ammo is higher as well. In my opinion the only thing this gun could use is the SG works front tri-rail setup and vertical forward grip such as a Magpul RVG. We could easily add that if you wanted. These aren't just tactical weapons either, one of our previous customers used his for deer hunting and killed a few last year using Hornady's SST 7.62x39.
