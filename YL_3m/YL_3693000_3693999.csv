About the gun:
This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder.

Features: 
** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. 
** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. 
** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact, but strong and durable enough to handle .38 Special +P loads. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger?s Target Grey® finish.
** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR''s cylinder stays locked in place during firing. 
** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. 
** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. 
** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged."

I purchased this in late 2013. I camped with this up north for 8 days. When I got home from my trip I shook it out, aired it out and put it away. It's in perfect shape. no issues at all. You really can not tell it's used besides being wrinkled from being in the bag.

If you are looking for a one man tent this is a great way to save money. It's a great lightweight tent for hiking or moto camping.

If it's warm out you can leave the fly off and it's mostly mesh and perfect for warm nights. Has amazing air flow. If it's a bit cooler out or raining with the fly on there are a ton of ways to vent it. You can leave the vesitbule open, open the rear vent and it flows that way great. You can then also pull the fly away from the sides of the tent with extra stakes that are included and it's now vented on both sides.

The tent, fly, all poles, and all stakes are included. Everything is perfect.

I take cash, silver, ammo, or firearms in trade.

I have a very hard to find 1911 Ballester-Rigaud. This was made in Argentina between 1938 and 1942 using Colt manufacturing technology.

Here is pictures of the gun on Armslist since I cannot post pictures here: http://www.armslist.com/posts/369331...llester-rigaud

It is chambered for .45 ACP 

Has the original grips which are in nice shape. Very tight action and solid.

Nice bore too.

It is marked ""Gendarmeria Nacional"" which would indicate use by the Argentinan Border Guards or Intelligence Service. 

Comes with plastic gun case, three magazines total, and a two magazine case. (no holster as displayed) None of the magazines are original with the gun, but all work nicely and well made quality.

The price is great! You cannot find a quality 1911 heavy duty .45 ACP for even close to $450, especially including extra 2 mags, mag holder, and plastic case which those add ons is $50-70 alone! (Note: The holster is not included) And parts will swap out with a Colt 1911, in case you need parts later on.

It has a 4 digit serial number starting with a 5. Again, 113,000 Ballester's were made and this one is one of the first 6,000 and less.

Here is some facts about this gun.

-------------------------------------------

As noted, production started in 1938. The earliest pistols were designated and marked ""Ballester-Rigaud."" Ballester Molina was HAFDASA's chief executive officer and Rorice Rigaud (French) was HAFDASA's chief design engineer.

Sometime around 1940 to 1941 the pistol's name was changed to Ballester-Molina after Rorice Rigaud left the company, and this was reflected in the slide markings. Production continued until 1953 with around 113,000 pistols produced. Ballester-Rigaud/Molinas' serial number ranges and dates of manufacture are as follows:
1 to 12,000: 1938 to 1942
12,000 to 23,000: 1942 to 1945
23,000 to 113,000: 1944 to 1953

-------------------------------------------

FTF in Allendale only at this time as I do not want to ship a handgun as I need to procure an FFL on this end.

MUST HAVE PISTOL PERMIT or CPL and be legal to purchase this pistol. Please bring a copy of all identification also for my records.

NO TRADES PLEASE.

Here is a great article about this particular gun.

I am just getting into hand loading and from the data I have found it would seem as if this powder will serve all my current needs. I can find it online for a decent price but then there are hazmat and shipping fees that cost nearly as much as the powder itself. I have driven around to all the stores in my area that sell it but they are all sold out of any pistol powder. So can anyone with a stash of this help a newbie out and sell me some of theirs.

I have a S&W 669 with 9 magazines for sale.

It is chambered for 9mm, a great round IMHO as ammo is easy to find and does not hurt the wrists as much as a bigger bore handgun. This gun shoots great and fun to shoot, and great for women and teens learning to shoot.  Ambidextrous safety so both and right hand shooters can use it.  I never had a fail to fire using it.

Most of the magazines are brand new Smith and Wesson and these magazines can cost anywhere from $25-$40 EACH.  Roughly $225-$250 in magazines alone.

The magazines are High Capacity 12 rounds each (magazines greater than 10 rounds are High Capacity magazines).  The 9 magazines is 108 rounds of ammo you can take pre-loaded to the range and not waste range time loading magazines.  Additionally, the 9 magazines are great for a range with combat shooting when multiple magazines are needed and convenient to have loaded ahead of time.

It has Pacmayer grips, comes with the 9 magazines, a right handed belt holster, and a plastic case.

FTF in Allendale only at this time as I do not want to ship a handgun as I need to procure an FFL on this end to do so.

MUST HAVE PISTOL PERMIT or CPL and be legal to purchase this pistol.  Please bring a copy of all identification also for my records.

NO TRADES PLEASE.

Excellent shape Thompson Center TCR 83 in 223 Remington.

Single shot with Double Triggers.  The front trigger can fire the gun.  However the rear trigger is a ""set trigger"".  When that trigger is squeezed to ""set"" the front trigger, then the front trigger is extremely light.  

Blue and wood is great shape.  A couple of small nicks in the wood here and there from normal use.  These TCR 83's are hard to come by since they are sought after due to Thompson Center made these in their custom shop.  The steel and wood used were top notch.

Tight action.

The scope base and rings are of high quality Redfield steel with rich bluing.

NO TRADES PLEASE and please do not ask.

FTF in Allendale at this time. May ship later, but shipping and insurance will run $40-50 CONUS as rates have gone up.

I've done quite a bit of modifying to it and the three pictures displayed doesn't do this rifle any justice. The scope is a Nikon Prostaff 5: 4.5-18 X40 BDC reticle. It's attached to the rifle with weaver scope rings and comes with the sunshade and butler creek lens covers. I replaced the factory hogue overmold stock with a Bell & Carlson tactical medalist a5 stock. The b&c stock includes adjustable cheek and shoulder rest. The factory trigger was recalled to which I personally replaced it with a Timney #517 straight trigger set at 1.5 pounds. The bipod is a standard $50 champian bipod and also installed a KRG bolt knob onto the bolt. I got about $2,000 invested into the rifle and realize I will be taking a financial hit. I'm looking for $1,400 for the rifle and the price is firm. I'm not in a hurry to get rid of it and will not budge. Thanks for looking and more photos of it are available upon request.

In my opinion, this bolt action rifle is a very afford way to get started in long range precision shooting. Overall this rifle is in excellent condition - absolutely no signs of abuse, neglect or corrosion. I clean it after every use.

This is the left hand version of the rifle, but it has the same stock and trigger as the right hand model. In other words, the fit and trigger pull is identical whether you shoot left handed or right handed. The only difference is the bolt opens to the left side.

I’m an avid shotgun sports fan and bought this rifle a few years ago thinking I would get into rifle competitions as well. I discovered that I’m not very good with a rifle and I’d rather spend my free time with a shotgun. Shooting at flying things is just more fun to me. However, the rifle is incredibly accurate. Using match ammo on a bench, this rifle will shoot sub MOA all day long.  I’ve shot about 250 rounds through the rifle.

For target or varmint shooting, I think the .223 caliber is one of the best choices. Out to 300 yards it’s faster and drops less than a .308. Also, there are lots of very affordable ammo choices, usually just over $0.20 / round.

20”, heavy target barrel (1” diameter) - free floating, recessed crown with a 1:9 twist. The bore is clean and shiny.

Savage Accu-Trigger. In my opinion, this is the finest production trigger available. There is no creep or backlash, just a crisp, two pound break.

Black synthetic stock with three swivel points. One in the rear and two in the front for both a sling and a bipod.

Bipod - 10 degrees of swivel, legs adjust from 8” to 12”

Four round internal magazine

Rails for scope mount, no sights

Camo sling

    Much to my dismay, I must part with some of my Colts. I am hoping to find another collector that is interested in all 3. But I will sell individually.

Colt M1991A1 series 80, 45acp, Stainless. This 1911 has been slicked up with upgraded hammer, grip safety, and trig. Bead blast finish with flats on slide polished. Shot very little with minor wear on exterior. Overall condition. 85-90% This gun sat under my seat for many of years, itching for a carjacker that never came. Comes with 2 mags and 1 box of quality ammo.  Original hard case. 1150$

Colt  SAA 3rd Gen, 45lc, has light scoring on cylinder, maybe a scratch or 2 but other wise 85-90% condition. Under my watch she's fired less than half a box of ammo. When I bought it, it was unfired.  Comes with 1 finished custom black leather right hip holster, and unfinished black leather belt, and left side holster. If finished, would make a very nice custom cowboy rig worth easily 200$. Also cheap uncle mikes holster, and 1 box of ammo. Original hard case. 1500$

Colt Huntsman 22lr, this one is a bit older than the other 2. It's overall about 75%, with light use for its age. Comes with 1 box of ammo and original mag. No case. 475$

Will sell as package for 3000$, no low balls and see below for trades.

Info / Specs
The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system (14.5"" barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

I am letting it go for a lower price than what I put into it, I am willing to take a hit because I don't have a dremel anymore to fit the stock. This is a custom 45-70 Mauser with full upgrades.

I started this off with a saimese Mauser for 500$ Bought a stainless shilen heavy barrel for almost 200$ Had a gunsmith remove the old barrel, install the new, check headspace, etc as well as test fire for 300$+ also had him drill , tap and install base mounts for 40$ I then had it duracoated snakeskin camo for 200$ with brush colors to match our landscape. This is an all weather finish and is ready for heavy duty use. I also have an upgraded and adjustable trigger for this gun for you to drop in and set it how you like it . A 2 stage trigger is currently installed. 

A ramline stock comes included and came with the gun. Someone tried removing material to fit the gun and got really close. I tried to fit it and it only needs a little material removed for the gun to be complete. This is 5-10 minutes of work. Fit it in this stock, or an aftermarket Mauser stock of your choice.

Specifications
Caliber 	5.56 mm (.223 caliber)
Length 	5.0 inches
Weight 	14.5 ounces
Diameter 	1.5 inches

Description
The SOCOM556-MINI Fast-Attach® suppressor is shorter, lighter version of SureFire’s SOCOM556-RC, which was selected by US Special Operations Command as first among all competitors in the most extensive and rigorous suppressor evaluation in history, covering all aspects of suppressor performance, and which also received the USSOCOM official safety verification in support of fielding.

With an overall length of just 5 inches, the SOCOM556-MINI is 1.2 inches shorter and 2.5 ounces lighter than the SOCOM556-RC. It features advanced internal venting to reduce back pressure, reducing the suppressed cyclic rate and gas blowback on the operator. The new design also includes an integrated blast shield in the back section that increases durability.

SureFire’s patent-pending front-plate design, along with proprietary improvements in gas-flow dynamics, nearly eliminates first-round flash, a true technological breakthrough in this area. It also attenuates noise and dust signatures to an unprecedented degree.

A new indexing system means it mounts to a SureFire muzzle brake or flash hider even more solidly than our previous models and is easier to remove after extended firing since the index tab is in a low carbon-buildup area.

Like all SureFire Fast-Attach models, the SOCOM556-MINI produces minimal, consistent shift in point of impact compared with the unsuppressed weapon regardless of the number of attach-detach cycles.

The SOCOM556-MINI is constructed from advanced US mill-certified high-temperature alloys and heat-treated stainless steel, and features a tough, corrosion-resistant Ionbond coating on the Fast-Attach® lock ring and Cerakote™ ceramic finish on the suppressor body, in either Black or Dark Earth color.

All SureFire SOCOM Series suppressors require a compatible, latest-model SureFire muzzle brake/adapter or flash hider/adapter for attachment to a firearm—see Parts and Accessories on this page.

SureFire sound suppressors for rifles and machine guns combine every important suppressor feature: excellent sound, flash, and dust signature reduction—key components of SureFire's Total Signature Reduction™ (TSR); minimal and consistent zero shift regardless of attach/detach cycles; rock-solid attachment in seconds; compact size; minimal weight; fail-safe baffles to prevent bullet side-exit; and extreme durability permitting full-time use. In fact, your SureFire suppressor should outlast your firearm barrel, depending on use.

All SureFire Fast-Attach® sound suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits—they reduce the weapon’s sound signature, concealing operator's position and protecting both the operator and team members against both permanent and temporary hearing loss, while enhancing situational awareness and communication; reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, concealing operator's position and preserving night vision and unobstructed view; reduce dust signature, concealing operator’s position and maintaining unobstructed view; and reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots.

NOTE: SureFire SOCOM Series Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brake/suppressor adapters, and flash hider/suppressor adapters are not compatible with previous generation SureFire Fast-Attach sound suppressors, muzzle brakes, or flash hiders.

Surefire SF Ryder 22-A Sound Suppressor. Surefire Accessories are built to the highest standards to support you in the field or at home. When you purchase Surefire, you own the best. This suppressor is direct thread and will fit any .22 LR rifle threaded with 1/2x28 threads

The SureFire Ryder 22-A is an ultra-lightweight suppressor optimized for .22 caliber rimfire pistols and rifles. Built to exacting standards like our Fast-Attach® suppressors for centerfire calibers, the Ryder 22-A features a patented aerospace aluminum body with rounded ends and flutes to reduce weight with no sacrifice in strength, and is coated with a tough Mil-Spec hard-anodized black finish that resists scratches, abrasion, and corrosion. At just over three ounces in weight and only 5.4 inches long, the compact Ryder 22-A minimizes effects on your weapon’s weight and maneuverability

The Ryder 22-A features patented pig-nose baffles that provide superior sound attenuation and reduce muzzle blast by precisely directing the gas emitted from each fired round. Built-in spacers between the baffles help to reduce carbon buildup and keep the suppressor clean longer. The indexed, individually numbered baffles are easy to remove, disassemble, clean, and reassemble, and are coated in tough Mil-Spec red hard anodizing that makes cleaning them easier and helps prevent gas and particle erosion

Ryder 22-A’s stainless steel back plate contributes to overall durability. Single-point cut ½ X 28 threads provide secure and easy attachment to an appropriately threaded .22 caliber barrel, with no tools required. Simply screw the suppressor on until hand tight; unscrew it to remove. The Ryder 22-A comes standard with an included assembly/disassembly tool for removing the baffle stack and reassembling it after cleaning and a spud-extension tool that aids in pushing the baffle stack out of the body tube

Just like SureFire Fast-Attach suppressors, Ryder Series suppressors provide crucial tactical benefits—they reduce the weapon’s sound signature, helping to conceal an operator’s position and protect both the operator and any team members from permanent and temporary hearing loss while enhancing situational awareness and communication; they reduce or virtually eliminate muzzle flash, helping to conceal an operator’s position and preserve night vision and unobstructed view; they reduce dust signature, again helping to conceal an operator’s position; and they reduce recoil, improving bullet impact observation and allowing for faster follow-up shots

Deploy the Bipod from the Grippod Vertical grip by simply pressing the release button. Stealth Depolyment of the Grippod GPS-02 is easy, just touch the legs of the bipod to a surface such as your thigh while deploying. This can be done while holding your firearm in the port arms manner. 
 The picture of the one mounted on the M4 is my own personal bipod. The one lying next to my gun on the table in the sealed package is yours. This is the only one I have and it'll go fast."

This is a 3rd gen Smith in the same family as the 622, 422, 2213, and 2214. This is the all-stainless-steel version and is very beefy and well-built, especially compared to 22's on the market today. Smith made this one back in the early 90's for only a few years and don't make it anymore. S&W reportedly lost money on each of these guns that they sold due to the high cost of manufacturing and them having no stamped or MIM parts. They also competed with their Model 41.

This gun has the 6 inch barrel and adjustable sights. These come from the factory with a threaded barrel, and for that reason, make great suppressor hosts with an adapter (try ewkarms.com). It is in great condition (very minor holster wear), and functions flawlessly with all ammo I have fed it. The only reason I am selling it is because I have two and decided to keep the shorter barreled one. It will come with your choice of the grips shown or a set of plain wooden grips. It will come with one 10 round magazine.

The new design features 5 significant changes/improvements. Diamondback introduced a new, and more robust, trigger return spring design with the DB9 9mm micro-pistol. The new DB380 leverages this improvement as noted by the three pins running through the frame directly over the trigger.(1) The grip frame has been treated to a more aggressive and stylish snake skin texturing that wraps around the front strap and back strap of the grip frame allowing for better grip and control of the pistol during firing.(2) All roll pins have been replaced with solid metal knurled pins to reduce the chance of the pins “walking” out of the frame under the stress of firing.(3) The slide now features larger and deeper cocking serrations that facilitate an improved grasp of the slide.(4) The last noted change is the redesigned extractor, which has been lengthened. In addition, it is now pinned through the top of the slide with an opposing spring at the rear of the extractor.(5)

The Smith & Wesson 59 was developed in response to the U.S. Navy's request for a double stacked magazine version of the Smith & Wesson 39 (which was used by Navy SEALs suppressed aka ""the Hush Puppy"" during the Vietnam conflict). Seeing the market demand for a high capacity version of the S&W 39, the Smith & Wesson 59 was released in 1970.

Building a house, need to cut back.  I bought this rifle new 4 years ago and only put about 350-450 rounds through it. It's a damn fun rifle to shoot.  It feels like a .22 when it recoils.  The Eotech is a name brand in Holographics.  The yankee hill quad rail is durable with light scratching.  Quad rail covers scratch quad rails, in my experience...No scratches apparent on the upper or lower."
