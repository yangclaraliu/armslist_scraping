This scope was purchased new in 2012 (the manufacture date can be checked by the serial number) and has sat on a .308 range rifle since with rubber lens covers. No hunting or competition wear and tear has occurred. The scope worked great out to 200 yds and held a zero as you would expect a Leupold to. All Leupolds are manufactured in the USA and come with a lifetime transferable warranty, so if any issue arises the manufacturer stands behind their product.

I'm willing to trade for rifles and shotguns (obviously I will add cash if necessary) but I am looking for things in good working condition. Also looking for reloading supplies, powder specifically.

This scope was purchased new in 2012 (the manufacture date can be checked by the serial number) and has sat on a .308 range rifle since with rubber lens covers. No hunting or competition wear and tear has occurred. The scope worked great out to 200 yds and held a zero as you would expect a Leupold to. All Leupolds are manufactured in the USA and come with a lifetime transferable warranty, so if any issue arises the manufacturer stands behind their product. I am located near Central Jersey and the five boroughs of NYC and would be willing to meet to complete the sale. I will also ship but you are responsible for the cost. After looking around the going rate seems to be about $200 for used so that's what I am asking but I am open to reasonable offers.

Previously Sig Sauer made some P226 Equinoxes in 9mm because 9mm Equinox slides were built by accident and they finished the guns instead of destroying the slides. Those guns were never available again after that run. We are not sure if the same mistake happened with P229 slides and the factory finished the guns or if this is a limited short-term run of this configuration

The Desert Digital Special Edition is a matched set featuring the SIG556® ER folding stock rifle and P226® pistol in 9mm. Both rifle and pistol share unique matching serial numbers and ship in a custom tactical hard carry case by Pelican. SIG556 features a 16” military grade cold hammer forged barrel, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7”. The flash suppressor uses a standard .5 x 28 TPI thread pattern, ensuring compatibility with after-market accessories. The forearm housing the gas operating system is a vented non-slip polymer featuring the SIG TriRail design with three integrated Picatinny rails for mounting accessories. The P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. The set includes (1) double 30 round magazine set for the rifle and (3) 15 round magazines for the pistol. A brass certificate of authenticity is included. This collectors edition is limited to 1500 units total.

Shoots great and accurate. Several parts broke in this gun, so it was stripped to the frame and rebuilt. It has a new cocking lever, ejector spring and trigger bar. The ejector was also broken, and here is where it got tricky. Ejectors are no longer available for this model, so after much searching I took an extractor from an SMC-22, ground it down to fit and used it to replace the original. The only downside is that the slide does not lock open after the last round is fired. It cycles and shoots just fine. I put around 400 rounds through it to insure all was functioning properly. There are a few minor nicks on the frame and the slide is clean. On one pic it looks like the slide has rust, but that is only a reflection. There is no rust or pitting.

This pistol comes with 3 mags. Over the course of time one mag fits a bit tight but still works. The other 2 have no issues. Comes with (not shown) brown leather holster a brown soft padded zippered carry case AND a Remora magazine pouch.

Because this pistol is not truly original I'm offering it with everything mentioned for a ridiculously low price of $199. There is no negotiation here. The price is firm and trades will not be considered, so don't ask.

I am not an FFL. I am a gun enthusiast that is thinning the herd and getting down to a minimum number of calibers. You, the buyer, will be a resident of TEXAS, able to legally purchase and posses a handgun and have a current TEXAS ID. CHL is preferred but not necessary. A bill of sale must be completed and signed. It's just that simple.

I do have several boxes (5) of Makarov ammo available to sell with this firearm. Let me know if interested. It is Brown Bear/Silver Bear and offered at $13 each box of 50.

I will also be listing an East German Makarov with 2 mags very soon. Contact me if interested.

No warranty is implied or included with this firearm and it is sold ""AS IS"".

Description: Buck Mark Pistols. Rimfire pistols, built the Browning way. Browning Buck Mark rimfire pistols lead the industry in quality, reliability, accuracy and variety. Every Buck Mark starts out as a solid piece of aircraft-grade 7075 aluminum alloy, and then is CNC machined to exacting tolerances. The crisp single-action trigger, hand reamed chamber, target crowned barrel and finely adjustable target sights mean the Buck Mark comes ready for fun straight from the box. The Ultragrip FX™ represent the latest in grip technology. The finger grooves, laser stippling and stylish wave patterns combine to form an Ergonomic Interactive Surface (EIS) that puts your hand in the same place on the grip for every shot, resulting in more instinctual shooting and improved accuracy. The textured surfaces are comfortable and secure in any condition, while the narrow profile makes them perfect for all hand sizes.

It's double action only and doesn't require or have a safety. Just grab it and squeeze the trigger. These pistols are noted for having horrible triggers and because of that people assume they are inaccurate. This one is different. It just came back a couple of months ago from the CZ-USA Custom Shop. They only have one gunsmith there who works on these, and I spoke to him. He was able to do a trigger job and a reliability fix on it. It now runs perfectly and has a great trigger and accuracy. I am easily able to shoot empty shotgun shells with it every time at 25-40 yards. Reliability is flawless as well. Just stage the trigger and squeeze for accuracy. Or just squeeze all the way through for fast shots or self defense. Really it's about as simple as that.

This is a lightweight poly framed pistol with CZ quality that is as good as Glock, Beretta, Springfield, etc. Frankly some people like me think they are better. It comes with two magazines and is in its original locking padded case. Condition is near perfect, and it is just a great pistol. 

So if this gun is so great then why am I selling it ? Simple. I am a rifleman and I collect vintage Finnish and Russian firearms. This will ""turn into"" another of those. I have a couple of self defense guns and usually don't carry concealed. So I just don't need this one. You can have it for what I paid for it - $300. But for you there is no tax, no CZ Custom bill, and no waiting for three weeks while CZ tunes it up. It is ready to go. I test fired 100 rounds through it to confirm reliability and the trigger job and the pistol runs perfectly. Zero malfunctions of any type and it is now more accurate than I am. Recoil is very light and manageable because of the famous CZ ergonomics, and the polymer frame.

If you want to check it out, contact me through Armslist with your number and I will call you. I used to put my number in these ads, but I got inundated with scam offers. So unfortunately I can't do that anymore. When you come see it, bring your cash because you are going to like it. It's small enough for a carry gun, and large enough for a home defense gun.

We will have to meet in Santa Fe because I work some crazy long hours. I can usually break free for a few minutes so we can meet at almost any time though.

Thanks for reading my very long winded ad. You will like this one.

I don't care if it's a military M1909 or a civilian, as long as it is mechanically sound and a good shooter.  Would prefer an attractive example with honest wear and patina, it's OK if the blue is completely worn off, but I do not want an abused/neglected gun with rust/pitting/excessive scratches or gouges. But well worn with character is fine.  Don't care if it was refinished or re-parkerized, if it was done well.  Barrel should be uncut, 5.5"" or 7.5"".  

Willing to pay a reasonable price for a nice piece, exact amount subject to negotiation based on *documentable* rarity, condition/grade, etc.  I recently passed up on one on Gunbroker that went for $305, because it was just not quite high enough grade for what I'm looking for, and watched another slightly nicer one because the reserve price was too high. If you think yours is worth a grand or more, it's probably too nice for me. Something around $500-700 ballpark.

I'm primarily looking to pay cash, but if you want to trade let me know what you're looking for and if I have it I may consider trading it with cash if necessary to balance out the value."

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

MSRP:$1090.91.
 The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 14 rounds of 12 gauge 2.75” rounds in total (7 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 2.75"".
 This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
 The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.
 The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

I’ll relay the story to the best of my knowledge. Benelli manufactured this gun in 1999, all of these guns stayed in Europe as was the norm for all of their limited guns of this era as they didn’t start sending these types of guns into the US until the mid 2000’s. This gun was featured at the 2001 Las Vegas shot show, I have the plastic ring depicting this for it but I did remove it so as not to scratch up the trigger guard. Conversations with Benelli USA have yielded the result of their statement this is the ONLY one ever bought into the States so unless someone purchased one in Europe and had it shipped back this is a one of a kind here. Completely unfired and absolutely flawless, this is an amazing gun. Based on the Raffaello frame and to the same standards as the Executive series, she rivals the Grade III in beauty."

The upper is PSA, and is stripped, but I also have a PSA Forward Assist and Ejection Port assembly. I can give to you, or I can install for you. Your call. I can let this go as a lot, piecemeal, or whatever. I would sell outright, but prefer trades. Make me an offer. I am also interested in most handguns, and even some long guns.

 Thanks for Looking.

FROM WILSON COMBAT SITE, RE: SEMI AUTO CARRIERS:
""NOTE-We offer both “semi-auto” and “full-auto” carriers.  The only difference between the two are the carrier weight and external profile.  The “full-auto” carrier is slightly heavier to provide more mass and lower cyclic rate that can benefit carbine length and shorter gas systems, short barreled/suppressed rifles and machineguns. The “semi-auto” carrier is slightly lighter to provide the least amount of recoil impulse for rifle length gas systems and it’s design makes reinstalling the firing pin easier after cleaning.

Both carrier types are considered completely interchangeable and there are no restrictions on the ownership of a “full auto” carrier group in a semi automatic rifle.

Less than 100 rounds down range.
Thanks to the design of the direct barrel-slide locking system and the low barrel axis the felt recoil is reduced and it minimizes muzzle rise.
The sides of the slide are smooth and offer snag-proof insertion and removal of the pistol from its holster. The front and rear serrations on the slide facilitate slide operation and safety control in moist conditions.
Features a white '3-dot' sight pattern for quick acquisition of the target. The rear sight is designed to provide a front projection so that, in an emergency, the user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc.
Pistol is designed for extremely quick and simple field stripping. Disassembly latch does not remove from the gun, preventing accidental dropping and loss. Reassembly is easy and accidental misassembly of parts is prevented by the distinctive design.
External Hammer design provides the most energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the possibility of misfires due to light primer strikes. Also provides an immediate visual and tactile indicator as to the cocked/uncocked status of the pistol.
The ambidextrous safety lever, easily accessible by the thumb or a right or left handed shooter, is spring loaded so it's either positively ""on"" or ""off"". The safety lever also functions as the pistol's decocking lever. When pushed down, the rear part of the firing pin (striker) is rotated out of alignment with the front part of the firing pin.  Additional hammer drop catch (half cock notch) prevents striking of the firing pin unit in the remote chance of unintentional hammer drop
The front part of the firing pin is blocked from any forward movement until the trigger is pulled completely back. The block is located rearward, far away from the fouling and debris of the breech face. Since the block is visible, the user may ascertain its proper operation at any time. Even if the pistol falls and strikes the ground muzzle down, the firing pin will not strike the primer
Beretta's exclusive BrunitonTM non-reflective black coating is a superior corrosion and wear resistant finish
The frame of the Px4 Storm has an integral Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail for rapic attachment of tacitcal lights and laser aiming devices"
