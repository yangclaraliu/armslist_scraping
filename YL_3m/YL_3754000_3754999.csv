Jerry Miculek knows a little about ultra-fast performance. His record 12 shots, two loads of six with a reload in between, in under three seconds set the standard for speed shooting.  Smith & Wesson and Jerry Miculek have collaborated to design a revolver to deliver ultra-fast performance - the Model 625 JM.  Since the 1850s, Smith & Wesson has supported sport shooting, a part of the American firearm heritage, with new products and activities to keep the challenge alive. Along with sponsoring a wide variety of shooting sports and events across the country, Smith & Wesson is especially proud to sponsor the successful careers of Doug Koenig, Jerry Miculek and Julie Goloski Golob - three of the world's most legendary shooters as they compete and win with Smith & Wesson firearms."

The gun is used but in great overall condition.  My sister and I put over 300 rounds through this gun.

I did not take the gun down but I did an extensive cleaning.  For $215.00 you get the package with a new gun lock (required), copies of the manual (not original), a copy of the Youth Handgun Safety Act Notice (Generally it is illegal for anyone under age 18 to own a hand gun or ammo).

I am looking to sell or trade my UTS15 double tube shotgun. This holds 14 + 1 rounds of 12 gauge and is bullpup design. This allows you to have a full length barrel with an SBR like profile. I got this shotgun in trade from another member and am looking at what else is out there. I would prefer cash but always open to trades. This shot gun is simply badass, you can either choose what tube to shoot from or set to center and blast all 15 rounds without stopping.

This comes with Original Box and manual. I am not the original owner so unsure of the round count. It looks to be in almost new condition and cycles rounds perfectly. I have seen some videos about this gun's lack of reliability and I can say that is untrue. The PO mentioned never to have any issues at all and I couldn't get it to jam. Gun is awesome. I will say, I have spoken to 2 other owners of the UTS15 and they said the same thing, gun works like a beast. I have also seen post online to talk about a gen 1 vs gen 2 version. This is mostly false too. I have never seen or heard of a Gen two version and this one works perfectly. Also, I do not have the irons for this gun, I just used a Aimpoint that is not included in sale.

Round count is unknown as I am not the original owner. If I were to guess I would say far less than 200 rounds. Gun looks mint. PS... no other guns in photo are listed for sale, if you are interested in them, send me an offer. I will not respond to questions about them only offers. If you don't know what they are, then don't ask as they are not formally for sale.

I am looking for around $950 cashOBO or trades below:
1911's like Sig, Springfield, kimber, les baer, dan wesson in 4.25 or 5"" only.
Glock in 9mm in 4th gen only
Sigs or hk walther PPQ 9mm
M4 or AK
plasma cutter, scooter, cherry picker, or anything else.

I am open to pretty much anything as I don't really need to sell or trade, so just offer and I'll consider. I am located in S. Seattle but willing to drive if we come to an agreement."

Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and lighter components. Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"". Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire. 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations. Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications. Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures. Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud. Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance. Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories. Front barrel lug allows for easy mounting of a variety of accessories."

This is not your normal camper! This, my friends, is a Tiny House on wheels! What is a tiny house you ask? A quick Google search will yield thousands of hits on the topic and some pretty amazing builds. Also refer to the Netflix documentary ""Tiny"" I loved the idea so much I thought I would build one for myself. This Tiny House is complete custom as I drew inspiration from my research on tiny houses and I designed this one myself. I purposely designed this to have an older appearance as if it came straight out of Lonesome Dove or some other 1900's era ghost town. However, this is a new build! It's a fully insulated little house but does not have plumbing, it is all electric and has a small space heater that more than enough to provide heat in the winter and a 5,000 BTU air conditioner that does a great job of keeping it nice a cool. I could go on and on about this thing but I imagine if you come take a look I can give you the complete total run down of the construction of this awesome tiny house/camper. This could also be awesome out on a deer lease! For now I will give a break down below of what is included. Please only contact me if you are serious about possibly purchasing or trading for the trailer.

HECKLER & KOCH PISTOL MODEL USP COMPACT CAL. 9MM

The USP (Universelle Selbstladepistole or ""universal self-loading pistol"") is a semi-automatic pistol developed in Germany by Heckler & Koch GmbH (H&K) of Oberndorf am Neckar as a replacement for the P7 series of handguns.
Design work on a new family of pistols commenced in September 1989 focused primarily on the U.S. commercial and law enforcement markets. In 1991, USP prototypes participated in rigorous testing alongside H&K's entry in the Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) program requested by the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) and which would later result in the Mk 23 Mod 0. The USP prototypes were then refined in 1992, based on input from the OHWS trials, and the design was finalized in December of the same year. The USP was formally introduced in January 1993

This rifle is brand new as shipped from the factory. It is packed in cosmoline and was sealed in plastic on arrival. It was opened to get serial number and for the purpose of pics and display. This is a Chinese made rifle with a forged receiver. They are very nicely made and appear to be to spec with original Springfield M14. Make for a collector piece for someone into the oddball stuff or just a good ol drag it to the range shooter. There is a lot of info out there on the web but not sure what is fact and what is fiction so do your research and decide for yourself if this is the rifle for your collection. Definitely for the guy or girl who knows what they are looking for. Hope you all can take those words as kind advice and not an insult. Thanks for having a look!"

Comes with 1 30rd magazine.

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs.

I purchased this gun recently from a gentleman selling a number of very nice, older Smiths and while I would love to keep it, I would want it as a shooter and the condition is better suited to someone who is a collector. There are one or two very faint marks on one side of the cylinder (I assume) from storage of the revolver. They hardly show up in photos, but I will send other pics if you want to take a look.
