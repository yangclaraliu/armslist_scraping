Brake-attach .30 caliber suppressor

The model 30BA is the brake-attached version of our flagship long-range precision rifle suppressor. It offers best-in-class sound suppression levels in a very light weight format, and is built with accuracy as its first priority. The 30BA is designed to mount over our muzzle brake. It is particularly suited to applications where the rifle will be shot suppressed and unsuppressed, and a brake is desired when shooting without the suppressor.

We developed the 30BA and 338BA to meet the requirement that some customers have for a suppressor that mounts over a muzzle device. We haven't found a ""quick mount"" on the market that meets our accuracy and repeatability requirements, so we developed the BA series to mount over our brake and provide the same repeatability as our direct thread attach suppressors, like the 30P-1. The 30BA features a conical shoulder for rock solid POI repeatability and to make sure it never comes loose.

The 30BA was designed around .308 for maximum flexibility and is rated up to .300 Winchester Magnum, but it's the ideal suppressor for the most competitive mid-sized cartridges for long-range shooting such as .243 Winchester .260 Remington, 6.5 Creedmoor, 6.5x47 Lapua, 6.5-284 Norma, and 7mm Remington Magnum & WSM.

The 30BA uses the baffle stack of the 30P-1, which has racked up impressive results at long-range field shooting events in the Rocky Mountain region, including the Blue Steel Ranch Steel Safari and the NRA Whittington Center Sporting Rifle Match. Many long-range shooters prefer shooting suppressed because the muzzle blast and concussion is eliminated, while the recoil impulse is reduced and smoothed out over time. The net result is that the rifle is easier to shoot and it's easier to make hits. Communication with your spotter is easier because the need for hearing protection is reduced.

The 30BA is constructed of titanium with a fully-welded baffle core. This material and construction provides a great strength to weight ratio. It can take whatever your precision rifle can dish out.

The 30BA brake will accept the 338BA suppressor, so with a .30 caliber brake on your .308 and a .338 brake on your .338 Lapua Magnum, you can use a single 338BA suppressor on both. The 30BA suppressor will not fit on a 338BA brake.

The 30BA is ideal for: long-range practical competition shooters; varminters; predator hunters; precision tactical shooters.

The 5 mm Remington Rimfire Magnum is a bottlenecked rimfire cartridge introduced by Remington Arms Company in 1969. Remington chambered it in a pair of bolt-action rifles, the Model 591 and Model 592, but the round never became very popular, and the rifles were discontinued in 1973. The ammo is currently being produced by Centurion/Aguila in two versions. About 52,000 rifles were sold during its brief production run. As of 2008, Aguila, a Mexican ammunition company, is producing 5mm Remington Rimfire Magnum ammunition, with two 30gr. bullet designs, at 2300fps and 2400fps, with plans for more bullet selections in the near future.

The 5 mm Mag offers higher velocity than the .22 WMR and more energy than either the .22 WMR or the later .17 HMR.[2] It offers improved performance on small-game and for varmint hunting, along with excellent accuracy."

For sale is a Sig P250 modular trigger group and 5 Sig Caliber X-Change kits, grip modules and magazines.

For those who are not familiar with the Sig P250 it is a modular system.  The trigger group is the serial numbered part, the ""gun"", and the rest is just parts.  This collection lets you put together 9 different pistol configurations!

You can put the trigger group in any of the grip modules and put a different slide on as well.  This lets you customize to your heart's delight.  The only limitation is that 45ACP components do not interchange with other calibers due to the size of the cartridge. 

What I am offering is a 45ACP full sized kit with grip module, 9mm compact with stainless slide, 40 S&W compact, 9mm subcompact with polished barrel, and 40 S&W subcompact.  Also included are 2 compact grip modules and 1 subcompact grip module and the following magazines.  2 45ACP full sized, 1 9mm compact, 1 40S&W compact, 2 9mm sub compact, and 1 40S&W subcompact.  All slides have Sig night sights which are still very bright.

This whole collection retails for over $1600 but I'm offering it for $1000

One of the newer 581 series with heavier barrel (2010 model)
This rifle has 1753 rounds through it.
Modified the following:
Trigger! Had a match job done to this trigger. It's amazing. A crisp 3.5lb pull with no creep and extremely short reset.
I had a place called Accuracy Systems work on the rifle. OUTSTANDING WORK!
http://www.accuracysystemsinc.com/index.php

The above completely eliminates ANY barrel whip that these guns were known for at sustained high rate of fire and increases accuracy.
This rifle will hang with my COLT M4 direct impingment any day of the week but runs cleaner and cooler...think of it as an inverted AK. I could only compare my piston impingment M4 to such a rifle.
The recoil has also been drastically reduced due to modification. 
I painted the stock in OD green and clear coated in a matte finish.
Gas system was also worked on when barrel was, so you will never need to even look at the gas piston again. Seriously. You will only need to clean barrel, the parts you can reach which are visibly dirty and drop in some lube. 
Has ATI 6 position M4 style folding stock with cheek riser and scorpion pistol grip.
Has an extended magazine release.
Has a Ruger ATI extended bottom aluminum rail.
Has a Magpul AFG1 angled foregrip.
Has a recoil buffer.
Has a bushnell 30x1 5x illumination 3MOA red/green dot site. (I use this on several of my rifles) 
15  Gen2 Tapco Intrafuse 30 RND Magazines w/lifetime warranty. 
I personally prefer these over factory mags. I have never had one failure using these mags. 
Will include a Ruger carrying case with magazine pouches.
This is a rifle you will be very happy with and requires very little service (cleaning etc)

I know that you can buy this rifle new for about $780 or so transferred. 
However, you will not get the work that his been done to make this rifle stand out from a freshly boxed mini 14 for less than $500 from the company above.
I don't desperately need money and I do not need trades.
So my price is $1000 for everything and I am doing you a favor.
If you want to make an offer of $800 I'll take it and you get 2 brand new magazines.

This really is a deal."

Its in good shape with a little bit of carry wear but nothing major worth mentioning. Comes with two 8 round magazines. Has an excellent trigger, light and breaks very cleanly with a short reset. If you aren't familiar with these they are very similar to a Kahr CW9, basically the single stack 9mm Glock has yet to make.

It carries nicely but I prefer to pocket carry so I'd like something with a shorter grip. I'd be interested in a Ruger SR9c or LC9 or an M&P Shield in trade. Might also consider J frame sized .38 special revolvers, or the same guns mentioned in .40.  Depending on what you have I may add a little cash.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

Here's this bonus, this barrel gauges less than 1 on the ME gauge! A very fine rifle with crisp clean stamp on receiver. No import marks. Has a pristine Remington stock and the historians at the CMP forums have verified that a Remington stock is correct for this rifle. This beauty has been through the Rock Island Armory and has a stunning Parkerized finish. Cross cannons and FJA cartouche's are present but worn as they were right where your thumb hits when handling the rifle. The stock has NOT been refinished and does NOT have on any poly or clear varnish. That is just gorgeous patina. Rifle comes with matching 1942 un cut un molested bayonet and original scabbard. I see a Remington safety selector, dis connector and a couple of the barrel bands. It would take you years to best this Smith Corona. I value it right at $1250.00 with bayonet, 950.00 without.

Basically, Winchester made the Model 54 under contract for Sears, so the action is a direct copy of the Winchester model 94. The difference being cheaper wood and quicker manufacturing process; also the markings on the rifle only say Sears.

Unlike the Winchester 94, this rifle is not a collector's item. These rifles were meant to be inexpensive so that they could be used and abused without fear of losing much value. 
Likewise, this rifle shows some pretty heave patina and cosmetic wear. Some of the bluing is chipped in places. 
The action is in good condition and the rifling is fine. 
This would make an excellent saddle or truck gun. Having the reliability and power of a 30-30 without the investment and intrinsic value of a real mod 94. 

Looking to get $200 for this rifle which is fair when compared to the 94's. I will also entertain offers.
I am an FFL, so you will have to pass a background check."

Arsenalâs Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7UF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenalâs hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenalâs meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision, and durability.

Features:
100% new-production parts and components

I don't really need to get rid of it but I just don't shoot .40 anymore due to wrist issues. I'll post some pics tonight when I get home.

Basically, Winchester made the Model 54 under contract for Sears, so the action is a direct copy of the Winchester model 94. The difference being cheaper wood and quicker manufacturing process; also the markings on the rifle only say Sears.

Unlike the Winchester 94, this rifle is not a collector's item. These rifles were meant to be inexpensive so that they could be used and abused without fear of losing much value.
Likewise, this rifle shows some pretty heave patina and cosmetic wear. Some of the bluing is chipped in places.
The action is in good condition and the rifling is fine.
This would make an excellent saddle or truck gun. Having the reliability and power of a 30-30 without the investment and intrinsic value of a real mod 94.

Looking to get $200 for this rifle which is fair when compared to the 94's. I will also entertain offers.
I am an FFL, so you will have to pass a background check (the price for which is included)."
