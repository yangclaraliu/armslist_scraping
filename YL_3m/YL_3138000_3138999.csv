I bought it new for the wife to try to get her to the range but she still wont go. It's a great little da/sa pistol that shoots very well. It has the locked breech system so it's very easy to pull the slide back as well as light recoil for the size. Comes with 2 8round mags(I bought an extra they are hard to find) as well as about a 100 rounds of range ammo and 25 hydra shok defense rounds factory case and paper work.
Selling all for just $375 CASH obo. no tax or background check. Private party sale. might trade for carry pistol in 9mm or larger, or shot gun (I can add cash if need be)
Thanks,

I am very interested in a Kriss Vector, Remington SPS Tac .223, IWI Tavor, M&P pro. I have no interest in any variant of an AK, any hunting rifle, or revolvers in huge calibers. I will consider nice trap/skeet shotguns. I am prepared to make an even deal so please be prepared for the same I will not trade even for a stand alone Remington ($600) for what was a 1k pistol."

HISTORY------
The Savage Model 110 is a repeating bolt-action rifle that was developed by Savage Arms of Westfield, Massachusetts. The Model 110 was designed by Nicholas L. Brewer in 1958 and was patented posthumously in 1963. It has been in continuous production since that time, and with the closing of Winchester's New Haven, Connecticut, plant in 2007, the Model 110 has passed the Winchester Model 70 as the oldest continuously manufactured bolt-action rifle in America. The Model 110 has competed directly with other popular designs such as the Remington Model 700, Ruger M77, and Winchester Model 70. The Model 110 is known for its accuracy, reliability, and inexpensive price.
The Model 110 was developed in order to provide the hunting market with a strong and powerful yet light and economical rifle. Its model number is derived from its initial retail price of $109.95.
When Savage Arms filed for bankruptcy protection in 1988, the company cut its entire product line down to only the most basic Model 110 rifles. The design has since succeeded in bringing the company back to life as one of the top-selling bolt-action rifle makers in the United States."

The rifle shoots great and never had any issues while I have owned it....from benchrest it actually outshot a Ruger 10/22 Target/bull barrel rifle.  So don't let the age fool you.  The iron sights are missing and the metal has the typical patina which would be expected on a rifle of this age.  The stock was refinished at one time but looks overall very good.  I will also throw in 150 rounds of match ammo which shot very well through the rifle.

A bolt on brake is the best option since some states like California have made some threaded brakes illegal without a stamp. You can simply unbolt and remove this from the bull barrel. This muzzle brake along with the heavy bull barrel makes this AR-10 recoil lighter than most AR-15′s.

Also added a tactical rubber coated grip with hand relief perch. Excellent comfort and trigger control.

This is a beast of a gun and in one of the pictures you can see the size difference between it and an AR-15 sized HK 415 I have chambered in .22. This AR-10 gets a lot attention anywhere I’ve taken it including a couple of trips to the range.

Includes 3 steel magazines and about 20 rounds. Serious inquiries only. Must be over 18 and legal to own and operate a firearm in Idaho. CFP a plus. I have mine.

The MR556A1 is a direct descendent of the HK416, developed by H&K as a premium commercial/civilian market rifle with match capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 offers many improvements over conventional AR-15 pattern rifles and carbines.
The MR556A1 uses H&K's proprietary gas piston operation system, employing a piston and a solid rod in place of the gas tube found on typical AR-15 firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since the hot carbon fouling and waste gasses do not enter the receiver. This keeps the receiver much cleaner and decreases heat wear to internal componentry. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers."

This is the brightest weapon light you will find. Yes it is even disorienting in daylight and at night its unbelievable. Check out this light and Elzetta on the web. Last but not least is the best part. This rifle is equipped with a AIMSHOT LS8300 green laser. Yes I said LS8300. Try to find one of these. They do come up from time to time but very seldom. They are only sold to SOCOM and other SF units. They are not even sold to LE agency's any longer. If you need verification on that please contact Jeff at Aimshot in Atlanta. Once you see this Laser at night or day you will know why. It has the pressure switch and tail cap switch. This is the brightest laser you have ever seen mounted to a rifle. You can follow the beam for miles at night and the dot is the brightest you will ever see. Yes it will light a stick match. I will not separate any part of the rifle. Yes I know the rifle is only 999$ and if you want one don't bother me go see Matt at the arms room and Im sure hill fix you right up with one of these sweet rifles. If you can build this rifle for 2100 with everything this one has including the new Trijicon and Elzetta light along with a LS8300 and LaRue mount you can have this one for free! Would rather trade than sell. Thanks so much for looking.

The Mid-Size or Compact Glock 19 is ideal for versatile use through reduced dimensions compared with the standard pistol size.

In addition to being used as a conventional service weapon, it is suitable for concealed carry or as a backup weapon. For instance, many of the elite pilots of the USAF trust the Glock 19 for their efficient defense in emergency situations. 

Standard models come with two, 15-round magazines.

these don't come up often and not in this shape when they do.
hunting season is around the corner and this rifle is dead on, have dropped Elk at 900yrd with no problem with a 185g rd.
truly not wanting to sell but need to pay some bills, will be sad to see her go....
I see them from $1700 to 2100 in this condition on GB so will take $1750 cash or $1000 cash and trade for a browning bar in 300 win mag.
if your looking for one of the most accurate rifles made by Ruger this is it, will drop a Grizzly bear or any big game, might be a single shoot but when it only takes 1 shot you don't need a second shot to clean up!
hunting season is right around the corner and if your a big game hunter this is the rifle for you, I did deer hunt with it 2 times but hits so hard it flips them over. so don't miss out, last chance and it goes on GunBroker. ty

Like stagecoaches, swinging saloon doors and Pony Express riders, there are many innovations of the Old West that have long faded from use and live on only in Western movies and history books. But there are still a few frontier staples that were so effective and ahead of their time that they remain in use today. Take, for instance, the intimidating octagonal barrels commonly found on the repeating rifles of that period. These heavy-duty workhorses sported added mass and extra weight to aid in heat absorption, making them the forerunners to the bull barrels used on modern target and varmint rifles. 

So as a tip of our Stetson in honor of this timeless barrel style, we replaced the standard round barrel normally used on our world-famous .22 LR and .22 Magnum rifles with a classic 20"" octagonal model, like those favored by the cowpunchers, lawmen, homesteaders, and outlaws who blazed the trail westward across America. We rounded out this traditional look with an easy-to-adjust Marbles semi-buckhorn rear sight with a diamond insert and a highly visible brass beaded front sight seated in standard 3/8"" dovetail slots. A metal barrel band secures both the barrel and the high-capacity tubular magazine to the high grade American walnut stock. 

If you prefer a more modern look, the receiver is grooved so you can top off any rifle in this line with your choice of scopes. Both the stock and forearm are crafted of the same richly grained hand-finished American walnut typically found on rifles costing up to three times as much.

The NAA .22 MAG is the most popular Mini-Revolver ever produced. Folding  Grip Holster with belt clip. With the many current accessories, it is versatile for many applications and is the standard by which other Mini-Revolvers are judged.
As with every NAA Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. Using the original half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge.

I need to sell the gun this weekend to help finance the purchase of an antique pistol before it is sold.  I plan to sell the gun this weekend to the person who makes the best offer. This is a high quality Serbian (former Yugoslavia) rifle made in the legendary Zastava factory. This gun is not a Romanian WASR, with its quality issues. This gun is not an N-Pap, which is a different Zastava AK47 from my O-Pap. What is the difference? If you don’t know, you may want to google it, because there is a big difference. First, the O-Pap is no longer available. Only the N-Pap is. Second, my O-Pap has a 1.5mm thick RPK-style receiver with a bulged (stronger) trunnion. The N-Pap has a much thinner 1.0mm stamped receiver, the same thickness as the Romanian WASR and other low-end AK rifles. The thicker receiver is stronger and many people feel is way more desirable. My gun also has a few really nice upgrades, like a new rear sight that has adjustable windage, a shock buffer, a notched safety lever and a trigger group pin retention plate. With the windage adjustable rear sight, you can adjust your bullet strike point to the right or left on a target without having to move the front sight left or right with a special tool (good luck getting it to move) or with a hammer. The upgraded sight allows micro-precise adjustment with the turn of a knob. The shock buffer is a small item, but it stops the bolt from slamming the receiver with each shot. The notched safety lever allows you to hold the bolt open as is required by many ranges when the gun is not being shot. I did not notch the original lever—I notched one I bought so the original is still intact and comes with the gun, as does the original rear sight, a slant muzzle brake, and the original muzzle nut. The original cleaning rod is also included. The gun also comes with a sling, 3 magazines and I will throw in 100 rounds of ammo. The sale will be FTF cash only, and the buyer will be asked to show a drivers license or CCW, and also to sign a Bill of Sale.  I plan to sell the gun to the person making me the best cash offer, but no ridiculous low-ball offers will be responded to.  O-Paps are getting more scarce and the prices are skyrocketing.  This is a chance to grab one for a great deal.  Please e-mail through Armslist or text me at REDACTED with any questions."

840,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3138840,Want To Buy:  Alexander Arms .17HMR,"Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama",Offer,"Listed On: Monday, September 29, 2014",Rifles,Alexander Arms                                                                                ,17 HMR                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"17 HMR

The .17 HMR was a caliber that captured the imagination of a whole sector of the shooting community when it was first introduced by Hornady. This diminutive rimfire provides economical shooting but with a performance level that belies its cost and size. It seemed only natural that this should be the rimfire caliber for the Alexander Arms® series of rifles when we looked yet again to extend the versatility of the AR-15 platform. Working from a blow-back mechanism, but eschewing the layout more traditionally seen in the 22RF conversions, we started with a blank design slate and evolved a simple but elegant design solution. From an oversized extractor, fully-chromed interior parts, and even a monolithic magazine block, the .17 HMR is a semi-automatic that is designed from the ground up to handle the performance of the HMR cartridge.

 Built with a simple, fluted 18"" barrel threaded 1/2-28tpi and with a number of options available for handguards and alternative fluting, the gun is elegant in the field and adapts well to casual target shooting or light varmint work. The basic unit sports an A1 flash hider, but the effective Comp-X from Black Weapons Armory is a well-suited option. Typically furnished as an upper receiver kit, it includes all the ancillary items needed to convert the lower for the caliber. Alternatively, it can be purchased as a complete rifle with a telescoping stock.

 Accurate and capable to 200 yards and even beyond, this conversion far exceeds the capability of the 22LR. Typical muzzle velocities run at 2600 fps and the semi-automatic action is quick and smooth for rapid follow up shots. Feed is from molded, plastic, 10-round magazines, which are economically-priced and readily available.

 The standard .17 HMR conversion kit or full rifles in .17 HMR caliber are designed to operate with the standard, semi-automatic, military-style trigger group. Substitution of target-type fire control groups with lightened hammers and/or hammer springs will unbalance the bolt speed and will cause significant function problems"
