Neat old gun and fun to shoot, but it doesn't fit in my collection anymore.

This gun is from before the Savage buyout of Stevens in 1920. No serial number or date, other than the patent date of 7/2/1907. 

The finish is lacking, but this is a 100 year old rifle. It's been used, obviously, but no damage. The stock is as good as I've seen one one. The buttplate appears original, not the flatter styles you see on some. I'm sure the bore has some wear, but plenty of rifling intact and it's in good shape.

I've shot this gun on several occasions without issue. As a disclaimer, if you are not familiar with these older falling blocks do NOT shoot high velocity ammunition out of it. I'd recommend care shooting even standard velocity. I've shot Federal AutoMatch out of it without any issues, but some others have resulted in bulging cases or backing out of the breach block.

I can send more pictures upon request.

Extended mag release.

Stippled grip.

I bought this about 3 months ago along with 1000 rounds of 9mm ammo to practice with. My intent was to start shooting competitions. But this grip is just too small for my hands and as a result I keep shooting low and to the left. A friend of mine that shoots IDPA with a G34 can shoot the bullseye out with this gun , so it's not the gun it's me.

I want to sell it and get the Glock 41 or a Ruger 22/45 Lite that I can add a Tac-lite or Volquartsen receiver to. I would be willing to work out a 
trade for either or both. 

I've put about 300 rounds through it. No scratches, dings, blemishes, failure to feed or failure to fire.

I also have 700 rounds of 9mm target ammo that I would like to sell with it.

$650 for the G34 and $150 for the ammo. That's 21 cents a round. Or $750 for both.

No phone calls please.

I am the original owner of this rifle and have put about 150 rounds of quality PMC XTac 5.56MM 62gr. ammo through it.  This rifle was broken in per manufacturers specifications and always cleaned after use.  This rifle is mounted to a Noveske lower receiver that has a Vltor EMOD A5 buttstock/buffer system for reduced recoil.  I can convert to a standard mil-spec buffer tube, buffer, and stock. This rifle will include iron sights including a USMC mil-spec Knights Armament micro buis (back up iron sight), Troy vertical fore grip, and Harris bipod.  I will also include 2X 20rd and 2X 30rd Magpul magazines and a Plano hardcase.

This total package would cost over $2000 new.  I'm asking $1400 OBO for rifle only with all original box and paperwork without the scope, mount, accessories, and hard case.

I'll sell this entire package of rifle, scope & mount, case, magazines (loaded up with M855 5.56 green tip PMC Xtac 62gr ammo), and mounted accessories (front and rear buis, fore vert grip, Harris bipod) for $1700.  

I'm moving out of the country so I'm not interested in any trades.  NO TRADES.  Thank you anyway.  Also, please do not contact me offering $1100 or $1200 for the complete rifle.  The complete Noveske upper alone would cost more than $1500 if it were still available.  I'm not selling this rifle because I need the money.  I'm moving out of the country and I'm simply trying to eliminate some redundant rifles and limit the number or firearms I have to store in a gunsafe while I'm away.  However, if I can't get a good and fair price for this rifle I will go ahead and store it.  So if you are still seriously interested and have hung with me this long then by all means read on below about the details of this particular rifle.

I have more detailed pictures but I'm limited to three so please contact me to see more photos.

Vltor A5 EMOD reduced recoil kit:
Retails for $225

The A5 Combo Kit features a longer receiver extension, longer housing, a specially weighted buffer and includes the M16A2 buffer spring. The smoother function and constant spring rate of the M16A2 buffer spring increases accuracy, reliability and performance. The A5 Combo Kit is an excellent choice for addition to any AR platform but is a notably superb upgrade for piston systems. Many piston systems suffer from over-gassed operation and excessive carrier velocities which, both of which can lead to an unreliable firearm and a decrease in accuracy. The A5 system has been proven to tame such problematic tendencies and often increases the reliability and accuracy of the weapon. 

 The A5 Modstock (EMOD) features a wider and longer butt with strike plate, removable and waterproof side compartments with storage for four CR123 or three AA batteries and another weatherproof compartment on the clubfoot that holds two AA batteries or other small items. The A5 kit includes the EMOD stock, battery compartments and butt/strike plate, an A5 seven-position receiver extension buffer tube, A5 mid-length 5.3oz buffer (standard weight), M16A2/A5 buffer spring, receiver extension buffer tube end plate and a receiver extension buffer tube lock ring.
Specially developed buffer and receiver extension, which works with the known M16A2 action spring. This combination of components helps increase the reliability and lowers rate of fire for all AR-15 type firearms.

Construction 
Impact and temperature resistant polymer, specially blended for Vltor. Metal components are either carbon steel or stainless steel (depending on the application)

Compatibility

Compatible with most AR15 platforms: Direct gas-impingement and Piston-driven. The current A5 system is NOT compatible with .308 caliber AR platforms.

Scope and mount:

Scope:
The Weaver Tactical Grand Slam Rifle Scope offers fully multi-coated Japanese lenses that reduce glare and give you edge to edge clarity and exceptional low light performance with 94% light transmission. All Grand Slams feature a fast focus eyepiece adjustment ring, and sure-grip power ring that helps you adjust the variable power scopes even with heavy gloves on. Finally, the Grand Slam's solid, 1-piece tube construction makes them waterproof, fogproof and shockproof. This scope features resettable 1/10 milliradian (MIL) windage and elevation turrets and a Mil-dot reticle, this is also known as MIL/MIL. The combination of these two features enables the shooter to make quick and precise corrections. By using the Mil-dot reticle to measure how far off the shot is in MILs, each dot is 1 MIL apart, the shooter does not need to convert milliradians to minutes of angle in order to correct the point of aim. With traditional 1/4 MOA turrets, if the point of impact is measured to be 1.5 mils low the shooter needs to convert the Mils to MOA and then adjust the turrets which can be confusing. With a Mil/Mil rifle scope if the shot is 1.5 mils low then the shooter simply turns the turret 1.5 mils or 15 clicks. The mil-dot reticle can also be used to determine how far away an object of known size is. These features are usually only found in very expensive scopes, but MidwayUSA has worked with Weaver to bring you this exclusive high quality scope at a very reasonable price. Covered by Weaver's Limited Lifetime Warranty.

The IC SPR variant utilizes the same Cold Hammer Forged, spiral fluted barrel as the IC Enhanced. The SPR employs a low profile fixed gas block for the piston system and a longer 12 inch user-configurable, modular rail system. Topped with our low profile Skirmish Sights, the IC line of rifles is the latest evolution in the LWRCI 5.56 rifle.

The IC-SPR is our flagship and most popular model. This is a great all-around 5.56 rifle that utilizes LWRC’s most popular features; fluted barrel, ambi controls, and SPR modular rail system.

The IC-SPR can be fired suppressed. If you plan to shoot suppressed often, the IC-E may be a better option as it has an adjustable gas block.

The only time this rifle has been out of the box was to take the pictures. 
On a another note--because of the ban previously placed on Russian importation of these, this puppy is only going to go up in value. 
Whether you're buying a reliable gun to put thousands of rounds downrange, or a collector's item, this is definitely a smart buy. 

It is equipped with a 20.5"" chrome-lined, heavy fluted, target BBL with a pinned on thread protector over the 14x1 threaded muzzle. 
The firearm is semi-automatic, and has beautiful finished wood buttstock and forearm. Everything on the rifle is in 100% perfect condition--it isnt like the unfinished models that are cracked and need replacing. I wouldnt change a thing on it, but for those who want to add an optic or mount for a scope, there is a side rail that came mounted on the gun.

This gun comes with one 5rd mag and one 10rd mag, which are both still sealed in their original plastic, as well as a cleaning rod/handle (in the brown paper in the pics) and a very detailed manual.

Neat old gun and fun to shoot, but it doesn't fit in my collection anymore.

This gun is from before the Savage buyout of Stevens in 1920. No serial number or date, other than the patent date of 7/2/1907. 

The finish is lacking, but this is a 100 year old rifle. It's been used, obviously, but no damage. The stock is as good as I've seen one one. The buttplate appears original, not the flatter styles you see on some. I'm sure the bore has some wear, but plenty of rifling intact and it's in good shape.

I've shot this gun on several occasions without issue. As a disclaimer, if you are not familiar with these older falling blocks do NOT shoot high velocity ammunition out of it. I'd recommend care shooting even standard velocity. I've shot Federal AutoMatch out of it without any issues, but some others have resulted in bulging cases or backing out of the breach block.

I can send more pictures upon request.

This is the hard to find Beretta 948 in 22 LR. This gun was Willed to me by my late father-in-law and has been a safe queen in my possession. I did fire a 9 round clip from it and it performed flawlessly. Made in Italy , it has the stamp 1951 in front of the safety. I have been told that this should be date of manufacture. The bluing over the aluminum frame does show some signs of use during it's 63 year life span.The gun ( Unloaded) with magazine weighs 16 ounces on my bathroom scales.Additional photos will be gladly e-mailed to interested parties. Great addition to your Beretta collection.  Frank  REDACTED"

EOTech HHS-I red dot sight:
EOTech is one of the most trusted manufacturer of military and civilian weapon sights and accessories, and the HHS I is the perfect example of why. The HHS I combines the popular EXPS3 with the innovative G33 3X magnifier and Switch-To-Side mount. Both of these units work seamlessly together and offer quick-detach, locking mounts. The EXPS3 is among the most compact units available requiring minimal rail mounting space. When combined with the G33 magnifier the entire HHS I units measure a mere 8.1"" and requires only 2.75"" of rail space for mounting. When faced with variable situations the HHS I is the ideal choice with the ability to quickly switch from 1x to 3x with the flip of a finger. The G33 is held in place with a strong detent that maintains its perfect alignment with the EXPS3, and hold the unit out of the operator's way in CQB situations. Perfect for any situation, the HHS I offers 20 illumination intensities, anti-glare coatings with high light gathering capability, true holographic transmission for a parallax free optic that features a true heads-up display for shooting with both eyes open. Additional features of the HH I are Night vision compatibility as well as a ballistic BDC reticle matched to .223 ammunition.

The IC SPR variant utilizes the same Cold Hammer Forged, spiral fluted barrel as the IC Enhanced. The SPR employs a low profile fixed gas block for the piston system and a longer 12 inch user-configurable, modular rail system. Topped with our low profile Skirmish Sights, the IC line of rifles is the latest evolution in the LWRCI 5.56 rifle.

The IC-SPR is our flagship and most popular model. This is a great all-around 5.56 rifle that utilizes LWRC’s most popular features; fluted barrel, ambi controls, and SPR modular rail system.

The IC-SPR can be fired suppressed. If you plan to shoot suppressed often, the IC-E may be a better option as it has an adjustable gas block.

The IC Enhanced rifle uses our Cold Hammer Forged barrels that are spiral fluted to reduce weight. They include a two position gas block, with a bayonet lug, that can be switched between suppressed and non-suppressed modes. This feature enables the user to restrict the gas flow to the piston system, allowing the rifle to run smoothly and compensate for the added back pressure resulting from running a suppressor. We complete the upper with our modular rail in a nine inch length. This handguard utilizes individual rail sections that allow the owner to place accessory rails where they are needed while retaining the slick, low profile nature of the rest of the handguard.

The IC-Enhanced is perfect for those who wish to have a fluted barrel along with an adjustable gas block, allowing you to shoot suppressed.
The IC-Enhanced is essentially identical to the IC-SPR mechanically; with a shorter rail and adjustable gas block.

The IC-SPR may be a better option if you prefer a longer rail and have no use for an adjustable gas block."

The shorter barrel in the .260 DPMS hunting version does sacrifice velocity, but it is not meant as a long-range rifle. For example, The .260 LR AR with a 24"" barrel has a velocity of 2750. The hunter version with an 18"" barrel slows the bullet to about 2550. For comparative purposes, all were shot and chronographed using the same load of 45.3 grains of H4831sc (a mild load) and 139 grain Lapua Scenar bullets. If one believes that only 1000 ft-lbs of energy is required for whitetail deer, the 260 Remington in the short barreled AR is good to 575 yards. And in the right hands, it performs admirably at long range. A friend took a similar rifle to a 11"" wide x 22"" tall steel LaRue targets at 900 yards on a deer hunt, hitting it time after time. Thanks for looking.

The forearm has a small crack but does not affect overall performance/function and the factory front sight is missing but I replaced it with a homemade sight I made from a piece of plastic and fluorescent green paint (works perfectly).  This gun works 100% perfectly and cycles/loads flawlessly.  It has not jammed on me and I have put maybe 100 shells through it.

The IC Enhanced rifle uses our Cold Hammer Forged barrels that are spiral fluted to reduce weight. They include a two position gas block, with a bayonet lug, that can be switched between suppressed and non-suppressed modes. This feature enables the user to restrict the gas flow to the piston system, allowing the rifle to run smoothly and compensate for the added back pressure resulting from running a suppressor. We complete the upper with our modular rail in a nine inch length. This handguard utilizes individual rail sections that allow the owner to place accessory rails where they are needed while retaining the slick, low profile nature of the rest of the handguard.

The IC-Enhanced is perfect for those who wish to have a fluted barrel along with an adjustable gas block, allowing you to shoot suppressed.
The IC-Enhanced is essentially identical to the IC-SPR mechanically; with a shorter rail and adjustable gas block.

The IC-SPR may be a better option if you prefer a longer rail and have no use for an adjustable gas block.

588,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3526588,For Sale:  LWRC M6IC Enhanced 5.56mm Flat Dark Earth,"Howell, Michigan, United States","$ 2,490","Listed On: Monday, September 22, 2014",Rifles,LWRC International                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"YOU CAN BUY THIS HERE>LWRC M6IC Enhanced 5.56mm Flat Dark Earth

The IC Enhanced rifle uses our Cold Hammer Forged barrels that are spiral fluted to reduce weight. They include a two position gas block, with a bayonet lug, that can be switched between suppressed and non-suppressed modes. This feature enables the user to restrict the gas flow to the piston system, allowing the rifle to run smoothly and compensate for the added back pressure resulting from running a suppressor. We complete the upper with our modular rail in a nine inch length. This handguard utilizes individual rail sections that allow the owner to place accessory rails where they are needed while retaining the slick, low profile nature of the rest of the handguard.

The IC-Enhanced is perfect for those who wish to have a fluted barrel along with an adjustable gas block, allowing you to shoot suppressed.
The IC-Enhanced is essentially identical to the IC-SPR mechanically; with a shorter rail and adjustable gas block.

The IC-SPR may be a better option if you prefer a longer rail and have no use for an adjustable gas block.

I used to have a bipod and high-power scope on this rifle and had it set up as a MBR for long-range out to 600-800 yards.  I got consistent .75-1.5MOA with this rifle.

No other trades will be considered unless it's a Ruger Gunsite Scout 18"" SS and you've got some cash/ammo/silver on top.  

I'm basing my price on what I can find them for online and subtracting a little for the fact it's used, if you can find a better price, send it to me and I'll work with you.

For those not familiar with this pistol it is a solid milled steel military handgun with a chrome barrel and SA/DA action.
1968 model with rounded hammer for snagless drawing. Comes with two mags, one that has a matching serial number and one that does not. I ground down the finger rest on the non-matching mag to better facilitate pocket carry. Will also include a box of Hornady XTP defense rounds.
The frame, barrel, slide, and all other applicable parts have been professionally media blasted and refinished in graphite black cerakote, which very closely matches the original finish and is much more hard wearing and corrosion resistant than the original blueing. This was done about a month ago by FTW Coatings here in town.
Would like to trade for a quality pocket .380 or snub .38 revolver. Would be interested in a S&W BODYGUARD .380 or .38, but will consider other pocket sized similar pistols.
Otherwise will sell for 300 FIRM. I have 450 in this pistol from the pistol purchase and cerakoting service, so I will not go any lower.
I can also include a set of custom walnut grips for additional cost or higher value trade (see last picture).

This PSA lower receiver includes a Vltor A5 reduce recoil buffer tube, spring and buffer, and Vltor Imod stock.  I'm also including (2) Magpul magazines.

These lower receivers retail for $190 and the Vltor A5 reduce recoil buffer tube, spring and buffer, and Vltor Imod stock retail for over $200 for a total of $390.  I'm asking $325 OBO.

Please see manufacturers specification below:

PSA lower receiver:
These lowers are made using the most advanced aerospace manufacturing technology to produce the industries finest, forged Mil-Spec lowers. Our receivers are machined on a multimillion dollar, automated, manufacturing system which enables us to produce a product of unequaled quality and value. 

These forged lowers are quality made using material is 7075-T6 and are marked ""CAL MULTI"" to accommodate most builds.  Finish is Black Hardcoat Anodize per MIL-8625 Type 3 class 2.


Vltor A5 reduced recoil buffer system:
The A5 Combo Kit features a longer receiver extension, longer housing, a specially weighted buffer and includes the M16A2 buffer spring. The smoother function and constant spring rate of the M16A2 buffer spring increases accuracy, reliability and performance. The A5 Combo Kit is an excellent choice for addition to any AR platform but is a notably superb upgrade for piston systems. Many piston systems suffer from over-gassed operation and excessive carrier velocities which, both of which can lead to an unreliable firearm and a decrease in accuracy. The A5 system has been proven to tame such problematic tendencies and often increases the reliability and accuracy of the weapon. 

The A5 Modstock (EMOD) features a wider and longer butt with strike plate, removable and waterproof side compartments with storage for four CR123 or three AA batteries and another weatherproof compartment on the clubfoot that holds two AA batteries or other small items. The A5 kit includes the EMOD stock, battery compartments and butt/strike plate, an A5 seven-position receiver extension buffer tube, A5 mid-length 5.3oz buffer (standard weight), M16A2/A5 buffer spring, receiver extension buffer tube end plate and a receiver extension buffer tube lock ring. 

Technical Information: 
Design
Specially developed buffer and receiver extension, which works with the known M16A2 action spring. This combination of components helps increase the reliability and lowers rate of fire for all AR-15 type firearms.

Construction 
Impact and temperature resistant polymer, specially blended for Vltor. Metal components are either carbon steel or stainless steel (depending on the application)

Compatibility
Compatible with most AR15 platforms: Direct gas-impingement and Piston-driven. The current A5 system is NOT compatible with .308 caliber AR platforms.

Weight (Exact)
1 lb 10.7 oz. (complete kit and all mounting hardware)

Dimensions
•Length (collapsed) : 8.50 inches 
•Length of pull (fully extended): 12.50 inches 
•Width: 2.50 inches (with storage compartments installed) 
•Height: 5.70 inches (with buttpad installed)"
