From Barrett: Rugged. Reliable. Uncomplicated. The Model 99 is designed for one thing only: to get the job done. With its brilliantly simple design, hard-core construction and surprisingly few moving parts, it offers match-winning accuracy time and time again.

At the heart of this robust and accurate bolt action rifle is a one-piece 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion. A heat-treated steel M1913 optics rail is attached to the top of the extrusion by closely spaced high-strength bolts. The match-toleranced barrel is pressed and locked into the receiver, creating a rock-solid unitized structure on which to mount a riflescope. The Model 99 barrel is made in a heavier contour to ensure repeatable accuracy. The chamber area is encased by the thick-walled aluminum extrusion of the receiver, resulting in unparalleled safety for the shooter.
The bolt is machined from a single piece of shock-resistant tool steel. The action’s strength is exemplified by the 15 bolt lugs that lock into the machined barrel extension. The bolt’s few moving parts, an extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly, make it reliable and easy to maintain.
The Model 99 is easily disassembled without tools by removing three quick-release assembly pins. These pins attach the trigger housing and bolt guide to the receiver assembly. The match-quality trigger design is exclusive to Barrett and virtually maintenance-free. The bipod can easily be detached for benchrest shooting. Shipping/handling is going to be $100 and insurance will be added at 1.75% of the item's value to cover potential damage or loss of the item in shipping."

Price = $20

Designed for high impact combat, this stinger dagger is equipped with a black-coated AUS-6 stainless steel blade and a black Santoprene handle. Includes an impact resistant sheath with quick release stud and pocket clip. 4 3/4"" blade , 9"" overall length.

The quick release design of the Special Agent Stinger is EXCELLENT for self defense situations! Using an extended Santoprene handle design, this boot knife sits high over the clip allowing quick access to the knife without the sheath getting in your way. It becomes possible for the person to fast draw this knife even quick than most can fast draw a handgun! With most robberies statistically happening within 3ft of an victim, the knife carrier has the ability to fast draw this knife in LESS THAN A SECOND to quickly yet efficiently turn the tables on an attacker!

The impact resistant sheath clip allows for multiple carry options. You can carry this blade on your side, your boots, your sock or even behind your back. This gives the individual multiple angles to draw their blade as well as easier concealment options.

The blade design is modeled after the old ""Fairbain Sykes"" method of knife fighting developed in WW2. It was this blade's design that created the infamous ""Time Table of Death"" that demonstrated the lethal efficiency of the knife.  The knife was designed exclusively for surprise attack and fighting, with a slender blade that can easily penetrate a ribcage. The vase handle grants precise grip, and the blade's design is especially suited to its use as a fighting knife.

Fairbairn's rationale is in his book Get Tough! (1942).

""In close-quarters fighting there is no more deadly weapon than the knife. In choosing a knife there are two important factors to bear in mind: balance and keenness. The hilt should fit easily in your hand, and the blade should not be so heavy that it tends to drag the hilt from your fingers in a loose grip. It is essential that the blade have a sharp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against a clean cut) tends to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main artery is cleanly severed, the wounded man will quickly lose consciousness and die."""

Combining the best of thumbhole and pistol grip designs, our new ShurShot stock affords right and left handed shooters equally astounding levels of shooting comfort and rock steady aim. It was developed to meet the demands of deer, turkey and predator hunts. Namely, increased maneuverability and extended-range precision.

The natural, ergonomic pistol grip optimizes pointability and works in conjunction with the revolutionary new SuperCell recoil pad to cancel felt recoil for more accurate first shots and faster follow ups. Its an ultra lightweight design and the comb is specially contoured for rapid eye alignment with your sights or scope.

Proving to be one of the most lethal developments in shotgun technology since the 3 1/2 12 gauge chambering, the new ShurShot stock is redefining lethal range and handling ease."

A Ruger Charger 10/22 that I just traded for... They are not making these anymore, a really cool pistol comes with one 10 round ruger mag. Asking $400. I know these retailed for less but they do not make them anymore and are a bit difficult to get in good shape... this one is in great shape... but if you want it I would be willing to make trades as well up or down.

A solid Ruger 10/22 with a BSA Scope... Nice model has a metal buttplate on it.. not sure exact model... Asking $295, 

A Springfield Armory XD .45 ACP with 3 mags and accessories. This pistol has nightsights on it. I think that is about a 100 dollar extra from the factory? Asking $635 OBO includes leather mag holster (less than year old), leather outsidewaistband (less than a year old), and kydex/leather insidewaistband holster (6months old). Will not include accessories unless the price is right!

Let me know what, if anything you are interested in. Might make a deal for a package of all three, might trade some+ cash for a nice .308 battle rifle. Think M1a, G3, FNFAL.

Looking for Steyr products, FN products, .308 battle rifles, nice hunting rifles/shotguns. Also would be willing to trade for the right .357/.38 snub nose (smiths, rugers) personally do not like Tauruses. Also looking for .45 colt double action revolvers Smith and Wesson Mountain Gun, Ruger Redhawk. Also looking for Ruger GP100 Wiley Clapp or otherwise. Would also like a ruger vaquero in .45 colt.

This particular one had a fake FH pressed on over the barrel after the threads were removed by the factory at the behest of the importer, as required for Bush 1s directives on imported ""assault rifles"".

HK bbls are larger at the muzzle on the G3 series, so since the factory had removed the threads, the bbl was too small to thread to the original 15mm x 1 spec.

So, we here at AZEX, shortened the bbl, and rethreaded it where the diameter of the bbl became 15mm again so that a correct HK type flash hider could be affixed to it.

The barrel was threaded just before the handguard giving the rifle the appearance of the G3K factory HK rifle...one of the least encountered versions. Except where the G3K uses a shorter 33 handguard, this uses the standard G3 handguard that came on the gun as imported. (Which for inexplicable reasons has been modified by the factory so that it won't accept the clip on bipod)This results in a shorter handier .308 battle rifle without excessive length. ALL standard HK claw mounts and accessories for a G3/HK91 will fit on this rifle. It's HK spec receiver is not some ""home rolled from a flat"" clone. It's a factory gun built at an HK licensed factory.

It's non NFA as the barrel is not less than 16"". The FH is soldered in place with 1100degree silver solder as per ATF regs.

Paddle mag release installed.

Entire barreled action refinished in Parkote, moly over park back to factory color and sheen. 1 20rd HK mag included.

The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1 inch overall length and an 18.5 inch cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 14 rounds of 12 gage 2-3/4 inch rounds (7 per tube). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

Metal and wood is in good condition. The second gun is a 1964 model ""Gallery"" gun.

The gallery guns also have the spoon on the bottom of the receiver to kick the spent cartridges back to the booth. Metal and wood is also in good condition on this gun. These guns would make great additions to your collection or some good pieces to start with. I'll sell them individually or as a pair. Asking $2,200 for the 56 gun by itself.

Here's some info on the brass:

http://38super.net/Pages/Brass.html

Rimless 38 Super Brass

A new breed of 38 Super brass was born some years back that transformed the 38 Super into a rimless cartridge.  As the name suggests, the semi-rim was eliminated. The new rim diameter is close to the case wall diameter. On the samples measured, the rim was no more than .007 inches wider than the case wall diameter (in typical semi-rimmed cases the rim is roughly .020 wider than the case wall, see Table 1). The rimless cases are intended to headspace on the case mouth. If you have an older barrel, the rimless cases might slip farther into the chamber than the semi-rimmed cases.

One impetus for the development of rimless cases was that the semi-rimmed 38 Super case did not always feed reliably from double column magazines. Several companies make pistols (STI, SVI, EAA Witness), or their components (Caspian, Para Ordnance), that use double column 38 Super magazines. The rimless case improves feeding reliability in these magazines. These pistol designs are popular in practical shooting sports such as IPSC.  

Rimless cases are made by Starline (38 Super Comp; 38 TJ (TJ stands for Todd Jarrett)), Hornady (38 TJ), Lapua (38 Super Lapua) and Armscor (38 Super RL). No major U.S. ammunition manufacturer offers loaded ammunition in these cases, but one smaller manufacturer does (Atlanta Arms and Ammo). Table 2 denotes actual measurements made of some virgin 38 Super rimless cases that are commonly used in the U.S. The case rim and the extractor groove diameters are the only external dimensions that vary from the standard 38 Super case. Note that the ""TJ"" cases have a narrower extractor groove dimension than other rimless cases."

Extra magazine holder is inletted into the the right hand of the buttstock. Open sights came with rifle and an EAW Quick Disconnect scope mounting system was professionally installed by New England Custom Guns in Claremont New Hampshire. The EAW bases and one set of rings come with the rifle, but NOT the Schmidt and Bender 1.5-6x32 scope that is pictured on the rifle. The EAW bases and rings cost $473.00 and are by far the best Quick Disconnect scope mounts on the market IMHO. Additional sets of rings are available for $250.00 if you want a back up scope for your rifle. The rifle shows some signs of use, because it was not a safe queen and I did use it on several African safaris, but it is in very good condition. Check out all of the photos and you will find a few shallow dings, but no cracks, in the stock and three places where the bluing is rubbed very thin, the end of the bolt and two places on the barrel. This rifle shoots sub MOA groups and I have made many 400 yard plus kills with it including one at 600 yards. This was my ""light"" rifle and I used it mainly for plains game, but it has also taken elephant, cape buffalo, lion and leopard. My ""heavy"" rifle was usually a .470 or .500 Nitro Express double rifle and I didn't want to have a .270 Win in my hands when I came across a Dagga' boy while tracking a Sable. The extra magazine in the butt stock facilitates a quick change between soft and solids as the situation dictated. I will part with the Schmidt and Bender Scope that is currently mounted and sighted in on the rifle for an additional $1,000.00. I accept USPS Money Orders or personal and business checks drawn on the Bank of America. If you wish the rifle insured for shipment the cost is an additional $2.00 per $100.00 of insured value, you select the value you want insured up to the purchase price."

This listing is for One Choke Tube; buyers, however, may take as many extras as we have on hand, same per-tube price and with no additional shipping charges. When Remington introduced its factory Rem-Choke system in the mid 1980s, we already knew we had winners with Remington’s 870 and 1100 series shotguns. That is especially true with the 870 Super Mag and 11-87 shotguns in 3 1/2 inch chambers; and here is one of the best accessories ever for those Rem-Choke threaded Remingtons, the Long Spur extended and ported choke tube manufactured by Hi-Viz Gun Sight Company of Fort Collins, Colorado. Photos show several specimens we came across from a distributor liquidation in South Carolina. These are all brand new in their factory packages, Hi-Viz part number LSHREM, 12 gauge .675 muzzle diameter blue steel choke tubes with five recessed ports for dampened felt recoil, and knurling for easy removal and re-installation. These tubes are made for any 12 gauge Remington Shotgun that accepts a standard Rem-Choke. These will Not fit Mossberg shotguns; won’t fit Winchesters, Brownings, or Benellis; won’t fit the gear shift lever of a 1959 Edsel. They will only fit Remington 12 gauge Shotguns that are factory threaded for Rem-Chokes, manufactured since about 1985. Replacement price on Factory or similar tubes is $35 apiece or more in our area. We're offering these, however, for half that.

Photos show several specimens we came across from a distributor liquidation in South Carolina. These are all brand new in their factory packages, Hi-Viz part number LSHM835, 12 gauge .705 muzzle diameter blue steel choke tubes with five recessed ports for dampened felt recoil, and knurling for easy removal and re-installation. These tubes are made for the two Mossberg Series shotguns 835 and 935, the ones whose tubes are labeled Accu-Mag; the 3 1/2 inch chambered Mossbergs in 12 gauge. These will Not fit Mossberg 500 series shotguns, won’t fit Remingtons; won’t fit Winchesters, Brownings, or Benellis; won’t fit the gear shift lever of a 1959 Edsel.

The P9S uses a delayed roller lock action which makes it one (if not the most) quietest suppressor platform.  The P9S is one of the few platforms that do not require suppressors to have a LID / Nielson (recoil booster) device, so you can have a shorter suppressor platform.  
This pistol has been professionally setup for a suppressor by TROS in Oregon with 1/2x28 threads.  Pistol itself is in great shape with a low round count. I'm also including a spare buffer and two magazines (sorry no box).

This listing is for One holster; buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-holster price, and with no additional shipping charges. Here is a very nice replica of the U.S. Army issued shoulder holsters for John Moses Browning’s 1911A1 pistol that went into service in World War I, and has now continued to protect and serve our country for more than a century. This variant is the most traditional, where the strap for the right shoulder goes across the soldier’s chest, and the pistol sits under his or her left arm. This holster is for a right handed shooter. Photo specimens and their identical mates are some we found in an old Appalachian Warehouse recently. Manufacturer is Surya Company of Dehradun, Republic of India. This holster will fit any 1911 type pistol whose barrel measures 5 inches or shorter; and that includes everything from Armscors to Colts to Umarex .22 copies to Wilson Combat pistols. Our Cousin Ernest from Mississippi even carries his Ruger 22/45 in one of the old originals. Like any new, real leather holster, the first two weeks will be a very tight fit. If that weren’t the case, leather holsters would get too loose too quickly. Construction is .155 thick tanned Moroccan style genuine cow leather, just like the originals. Leather retaining tabs on the reverse side is secured by stitching that is similar to the original Boyts, only not as closely looped. Strap stud, instead of being brass like the originals, is glossy anodized aluminum alloy, and it’s good enough, too. Dimensions are exactly like the originals, from the top of the back flat to the blued brass snap that holds the belt loop securely. Color, as the photos show, is brown leather finish. The AOC Thompson 1911 showing in some of our photos is not included but we offer them many times on different ads from this one. Original Government Issue World War II holsters like this one command prices upwards of $300 apiece. We’re offering these excellent Replica holsters, the ones in the photos or their identical mates, however, each for only $ 59.00. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.

SPECIFICATIONS


SKYSCREEN CHARACTERISTICS:

Shooting Area	103 sq in
Active Area	84 sq in
Beam Width	30 degrees
Beam Thickness
(6 inches above unit)	0.1 inch

SCREEN SPACING:

Minimum spacing of 1 foot is allowed; minimum spacing of 2 feet is recommended. Spacing of 4 feet is suggested for high velocity rifles. Spacing of primary screens can be set from 1 to 15 feet; proof screen is always set midway between primary screens.


PRINTER:

The optional built-in printer prints with real ink on standard 2.25 inch plain paper. It prints primary velocity, round number, and proof velocity as each round is fired. It prints statistical summary of primary velocity.

TEMPERATURE OPERATING RANGE:

0° to 50° Centigrade, 32° to 122° Fahrenheit. 
Systems typically operate at temperatures down to 0°F or -18°C.

EDIT MODE:

An edit mode allows for instant replay of up to twenty shots. During replay you can omit questioned shots from the summary.

BATTERY:

A single nine-volt NEDA 1604 alkaline battery is supplied. A fresh battery will operate the system for up to 25 hours including 1000 print lines. Internal battery compartment includes space for spare battery.

CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR FREQUENCY:

4.0 MHz oscillator for 0.25 microsecond time resolution

ACCURACY:

The expected error on any one shot depends on both velocity and screen spacing. Typical errors are shown in the table. The table assumes good light conditions, dark bullets, exact screen spacing, and shooting through the center of the Skyscreen III window. Actual errors under your shooting conditions will be reliably indicated by the PROOF CHANNEL
1 FT	2 FT	4 FT	8 FT
1000 FPS	5 fps	3 fps	1 fps	1 fps
2000 FPS	10 fps	5 fps	3 fps	2 fps
3000 FPS	16 fps	8 fps	4 fps	2 fps
4000 FPS	21 fps	10 fps	5 fps	3 fps
You will typically see the above errors as differences between the primary and proof channels of a Model 35P as you shoot under ""normal"" conditions.

Note: It's easy to claim fantastic accuracy with a chronograph measuring only one velocity. Who checks the claims? You know your accuracy only with the PROOF CHANNEL, or by using two chronographs on each shot. We know our chronographs are more accurate and more reliable, so we invite you to check each shot.


PROOF CHANNEL:

The system alerts you with a flashing display and printed asterisk if there is a significant difference between the two velocity readings. Differences which trigger the alert are shown for typical velocities and screen spacings.

1 FT	2 FT	4 FT	8 FT
1000 FPS	42 fps	21 fps	10 fps	5 fps
2000 FPS	83 fps	42 fps	21 fps	10 fps
3000 FPS	125 fps	63 fps	31 fps	16 fps
4000 FPS	166 fps	83 fps	42 fps	21 fps

STANDARD DEVIATION

Professional statisticians have long preferred standard deviation as the best measure of uniformity. We admit, standard deviation is a dog to compute. That's why Oehler chronographs compute it automatically.

Before calculators and computers were common, people used substitutes for standard deviation. One substitute is extreme spread or the difference between fastest and slowest shots. Our chronographs include extreme spread because shooters expect it.

Lately a second substitute, mean absolute deviation, has been resurrected. One manufacturer promotes MAD as a new discovery and a miracle answer to measuring velocity uniformity. Like comparing chopped steak to sirloin, mean absolute deviation gets you by, but it's not as good as standard deviation. Don't take our word for it; ask any statistician or check an elementary statistics text.

CONDENSED INSTRUCTIONS

The Model 35 comes with a 30 page instruction book expanding on these condensed instructions. It's simple to use.

Mount the two primary skyscreens at the ends of the rail with the proof skyscreen at the middle.  Place the skyscreens approximately 10' in front of the gun. Position so that a shot aimed at the target will pass through the center of the skyscreen windows.
Plug skyscreen cables into the M35. Plugging in the start cable turns on the system. Push reset button until you see 0.  Fire through skyscreen windows. The shot number and then primary velocity will be displayed. (The M35P automatically prints proof velocity, shot number, and primary velocity.)
If the PROOF CHANNEL detects an error, the display flashes and an asterisk is printed. Use the OMIT button to erase any velocity that you suspect is incorrect. Fire additional shots as desired. You may use the EDIT and STEP buttons to replay the entire shot string. You may OMIT undesired readings as you replay the shots. Push the SUMMARY button to summarize the group. Display and printer will show high, low, extreme spread, average or mean, and standard deviation for primary channel. Fire more shots to add to the same group, or push the RESET button to start a new group.

Production of the legendary Model 35P was resumed in 2010 and is continuing.

For your convenience, we pack a Model 35P Chronograph with printer and three Skyscreen III detectors, a four-foot mounting rail, and two folding stands in a hard-side case. It's ready to work.

The complete system price is $575 with $20 shipping for domestic UPS ground.

Purchased this PX4 new 4 months ago(still have receipt). It is the first pistol I've ever purchased/owned personally so i can assure you it has been treated like a baby. I have taken VERY well care of this PX4 and in turn have not had a single issue with it. I've shot all kinds of ammo, HD, +P, factory, ect.. never had a FTF or FTE. Gun shoots flawlessly and is a joy to shoot, the rotating barrel helps reduce muzzle flip and instead of snapping up it pushes back which greatly helps with accurate follow up shots. Has upgraded ""D"" trigger spring giving a noticeably lighter DA trigger pull at around 5 lbs. Also has upgraded slim controls which convert it from a type F (decocker/safety) to a type G (deckcoker only). Will come with all factory parts, Small & Medium back straps(wearing large in pics), 2 mags, box, all manuals, holster (never used)"

This bad boy is all new in the box never fired and has a new Trijicon Tri power sitting on top of a new LaRue Tactical LT150 QR mount. it also has the brightest weapon light made which is a new Elzetta C Charlie 333 900 lumens light made right here in America and sold to the DEA and ICE. It sits in a new Elzetta ZSM mount with side rail. What makes this bad different from the others is a AIMSHOT LS8300 Green Laser. Try to buy or find one of these they are only sold to the US Military on official letterheads only. You can call Jeff at AIMSHOT in Atlanta to verify this. This one was sent from Afghanistan by a close friend who is a SFO. This thing is crazy bright night or day and looks like something from STAR WARS at night. You will go to jail real quick if you get caught with it. Comes with two tail caps and zero tool. The only other one of these I have ever seen sold on GB about a month ago for 859$ and they went crazy for it. Its a very underrated 50mvL laser according to Jeff at AIMSHOT and is indestructible Thanks so much for looking.."

A favorite for any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities, the Ruger Mini-14 Ranch .223 Rem/5.56mm Rifle is made for unparalleled reliability in harsh conditions. The Mini-14 Ranch starts with a simple and rugged Garand-style action with breechbolt locking system for trustworthy performance in less than optimal operating conditions. The gun's heavy, hammer-forged, 18.5'' barrel is extra rigid for exceptional accuracy. Rear adjustable aperture sight and protected, non-glare post front sight. Patented integral scope mounts machined directly on the solid-steel receiver provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings. Hardwood stock. Garand-type safety. Capacity: 5+1.

I've had this gun for about 5 years.  I've probably put 500 rounds thru it.  For this caliber, I tend to use an AR.  But the mini-14 has a very retro look and feel about it. 
It's very much fun to shoot.

This listing is for One holster; buyers, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-holster price, and with no additional shipping charges. Here is a very nice replica of the U.S. Army issued holsters for John Moses Browning’s 1911A1 pistol that went into service in World War I, and has now continued to protect and serve our country for more than a century. Photo specimens and their identical mates are some we found in an old Appalachian Warehouse recently. Manufacturer is Surya Company of Dehradun, Republic of India. This holster will fit any 1911 type pistol whose barrel measures 5 inches or shorter; and that includes everything from Armscors to Colts to Umarex .22 copies to Wilson Combat pistols. Our Cousin Ernest from Mississippi even carries his Ruger 22/45 in one of the old originals. Like any new, real leather holster, the first two weeks will be a very tight fit. If that weren’t the case, leather holsters would get too loose too quickly. Construction is .155 thick tanned Moroccan style genuine cow leather, just like the originals. This holster has more of a mahogany brown finish, whereas our #002 has a lighter, more reddish finish. ALICE retaining plate on the reverse side is secured by copper tabs, not as slickly finished as the brass tabs were on the original Boyts, but good enough. Flap stud, instead of being brass like the originals, is glossy anodized aluminum alloy, and it’s good enough, too. Dimensions are exactly like the originals, from the top of the US marked flat to the blue steel eyelet that holds its genuine leather leg string strap. Color, as the photos show, is Mahogany brown leather finish. We’re offering these excellent Replica holsters, the ones in the photos or their identical mates, each for only $ 49.00. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.

This is a perfectly functioning true Russian AK-74.

This rifle has been well cared for, and has about 300 rounds through the barrel. It functions perfectly an shoots great.

Tritium night sights, front post and rear.
Beautiful wood furniture (blonde in color)
Brand new Rifle Dynamics M4 stock adapter

The models I am looking for as follows;
Chiefs special CS9 DAO, but may consider the DA/SA model as well but really want the CS9 DAO ;)
S&W 3913, these are also known as 'lady smith' but would also like the DAO model 3953 instead - I don't care in the least if it has lady smith on the side, I am secure enough in my manhood to carry it anyway. Hell, I would carry a pink gun if I liked it enough. 

Also, since I am looking for those I might as well look for a sig P6/P225. Or... sig P239 in 9mm prefer DAK.


If you have something similar, let me know! I would like a single stack, all metal (prefer stainless) DAO/DAK/DA/SA

This listing is for ONE holster from the same lot showing in the photos. Buyers, however, may take any number of extras at the same per-holster price and with no additional shipping charges. From very light duty in the Soviet Union comes these attractive, protective and eminently serviceable leather holsters originally designed for the Russian PM Makarov Pistol. Since the PM is a descendant of the original Walther PP series, the parent Walthers will fit as well. Also, since these holsters are genuine leather construction from hopefully contented Russian cows, they will stretch and form to pistols as dimensionally large as the CZ82 in one of our photos. Measurements will accommodate a pistol whose length measures up to 7 inches from its muzzle to its grip frame strut beneath its hammer; with a slide thickness of up to 1 3/8 inches; and with a muzzle height of up to 1 1/4 inches measured from the top of the front sight to the bottom of the slide. The pistol’s height from the top of the rear sight to the floorplate bottom of an in-battery magazine should not exceed 5 3/4 inches. The original PM Makarov carries a single-stacked magazine, but note that the CZ82’s mag is double stacked, and the magazine case on the holster face accepted it with some energy output upon initial insertion. Our photographer affirms that he can get a Beretta 84 Cheetah into one of these, but we didn’t have one at press time. The Zastava M70 .32 Automatics are a go, but Zastava M57s and CZ52s are a no go, they are too long. Owners of pistols whose dimensions are right at 7 inches Overall Length, 5 3/4 inches height, 1 3/8 inch laterally measured slide thickness, and 1 1/4 inch slide height at the muzzle should be prepared to allow the leather to stretch for up to 2 weeks. Magazine height from base to mouth should not exceed 4 1/4 inches; the CZ82’s magazine measures 3/4 inch wide by 1 inch front to back, and that appears to be the maximum for a double stacked mag to fit into the pouch compartment. Manufacturer on these was probably the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant or one of its affiliates in the city by that name. Construction is smooth grained dark brown leather outer, with natural soft suede type finish inner. Stitching is close looped cotton twine. Strap is eye type, secured by a two piece brass stud. Belt loops are doubled, and will accommodate up to a 2 1/4 inch wide belt. This is a well made holster that will protect a pistol very well, and its styling is distinctively European. Surface wear is minimal, and we do not believe these served on duty for more than 2 or 3 years, if that long. Most specimens are marked on the inner flap by the O.T.K., the Russian Office of Technical Control in loose translation, certifying its fitness for duty use. Dates are mostly mid 1970s. We’re offering specimens from the photo lot each for only $ 24.00. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Grips, Magazines, slings, holsters, scopes, mounts, parts & most any small light items, entire accessory orders only $10.00 total shipping no matter how many a person buys. $10.00 for an entire order, Not $10.00 per item or anything of the sort. $20 Flat Fee on magazine orders to Alaska, Hawaii, or Puerto Rico, and gun parts to PR civilians must ship to an FFL.
