History
During World War II, the U.S. government tasked Coleman to develop a compact stove for military use. The stove had to be lightweight, no larger than a quart-sized thermos bottle, burn any kind of fuel, and operate in weather from -60 to +125 °Fahrenheit. Within 60 days, Coleman came up with what became the G.I. Pocket Stove. Designated the Model 520 Coleman Military Burner, the stove first saw service in November 1942 when 5,000 of the stoves accompanied U.S. forces during the invasion of North Africa. Over 1 million of the stoves were produced for war use, where it won high praise in the field: Ernie Pyle ranked it ""just behind the Jeep"" in its usefulness.

By the end of the war, Coleman began production of a civilian version of the Model 520, designated the Model 530 and advertised as the G.I. pocket stove. The Model 530 was promoted by Coleman as the ""perfect pal for hunting, fishing and camping trips"" that would ""slip easily into a hunting coat pocket, glove compartment of a car, or corner of [a] picnic hamper."" The single-burner G.I. Pocket Stove was only manufactured between 1946 and 1949; afterwards Coleman did not manufacture another single-burner, non-military backpacking stove until 1972. Larger single-burner stoves continued production starting with the 500 Sportsters"

Excellent condition with lots of extras. It was purchased in June, but I haven't used it for much of anything other than constantly ordering new parts and modifications. I've used it at the range twice and it shoots excellent. A great addition for a plinker or small game hunter. 

This is the 25 round version, rather than the 10 round. It originally came with a red dot sight, which is included in the sale. I have also purchased two 25 round magazines, a loader, a 4x32 tactical scope, bipod, flashlight, laser sight, and rail covers. I'll also include an unopened box of Federal Premium ammo (I believe it is a 325 round box). 

Originally paid $399.99 at Gander Mountain in Charlottesville (can include receipt). It does come with an extended 1 year warranty through Gander Mountain and a free routine maintenance. The extra magazine and all of the modifications were purchased afterward. The cash price is a great deal at $350.00.

It is a Kolpak Polar Pak Model PC075T3.

The online description is:
Polar-Pak coolers and freezers are made with the same rugged, high performance construction that has made Kolpak the leader in walk-in refrigeration.  The Polar-Pak modular panels of 4"" 100% foamed in place non-CFC urethane foam offer superior insulating capabilities. The exterior and interior of top-quality galvanized metal offer an attractive and rugged metal finish. Polar-Pak also offers superior air circulation around the coils making it both economical and efficient to run.

Specifications : 208/230v, Single phase 
Width : 96"" Depth : 84.5"" Height : 88.5""

This walk-in cooler is upgraded with a Johnson Controls A419 temperature controller with the drop in (from the top) refrigeration system. I personally helped install it and can guarantee it is in working order. It is located in the Eagle Creek area for local pickup.

It was won at an auction, delivered and installed and not currently used enough to take up all the real estate in my friend's garage. He was planning on buying some hunting ground to build a hunting cabin on to move the walk-in to, but got engaged so those plans are on hold.

I can arrange delivery and installation if needed for a fair price. Seller is asking $3500 or best offer. I know it's not brand new, but new ones go for around $10K. Used ones in similar or worse condition sell at auction for just under $4K. If I can't get a decent offer, I'll end up buying it from my friend. I do not know if my friend is open to trades or trades plus cash. I will present any fair offer to him though."

Feel free to inquire but I will be holding it till that date.

Just out of storage is a old 1986 Cobray  S.W.D. M-11 also nicknamed the mac 11. It is in excellent condition and I just cleaned it up. It is not rusted or beat up but the bag is a bit faded due to age.



These older SWD'S with the full kit and bag are being offered for sale for $950 on gun broker. That is a bit steep in my opinion so I am willing to consider offers. Would like to find a possible trade for a handgun valued around 600 dollars. I prefer revolvers especially Smith and Wesson. 

 May entertain somewhat higher grade shotguns. O/U and SxS .

These fall under the category of a pistol so you must be 21 with FL ID and must be legally able to own a firearm. I reserve the right to refuse sale to anyone for any reason.

(Please serious buyer's only)

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the complete set of Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates would be $300.00"

Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles.

I'm not going to answer questions unless there is something not covered in the post.

I have a polish AK74. I'm not completely certain, but believe the receiver is stamped and it's a Century Arms rebuild. The receiver is dated 1991. The gun has been refurbished and has a TAPCO trigger and a trigger job. The trigger is light and smooth. The gun cycles and fires smoothly with harldy any recoil. I am the second known owner, but with a receiver that's 23 years old I'm sure it's been around the block more than once. I have only put 100 rounds through the barrel; I cannot speak for the previous owner/owners. I'm not too familiar with the sights, but they look pretty standard with a front post sight and a flip up adjustable rear sight. The receiver cover has some mild wear when I bought it. It looks like the previous owner took a steel brush to it. You can't tell in pictures you'll have to see it in person. It's a bit discolored because of it. It has a bayonet and the cleaning rod with the gun. The barrel is a bit dirty. I don't have the necessary tools to clean it properly, but don't worry no corrosive ammo was fired by me. I do not have any other accessories or other guns I'm willing to sell so please do not ask. You will not get a response back. I'm conducting a local sale only (MIAMI-DADE). Please do not ask if I'm willing to travel or transfer, you will not get a response back. Price is negotiable, but not selling for less than 325. Buyer must sign a bill of sale and have a copy of driver's license.

Ruger 4191 Red Label Over/Under 12ga 28"" 3"" Walnut Stock SS Rec/Blued Barrel

Ruger's Red Label Shotgun has returned with its world-renowned rugged
construction, handsome American styling and brings refined inner workings,
a redesigned center of gravity and reduced recoil, making it lively in the
hand and even more pleasurable to shoot. It is perfect for hunting upland
game, waterfowling, sporting clays, skeet or even just informal clay target
shooting. The precision matched, blued alloy steel, cold hammer-forged
barrel is made of high-strength chrome-molybdenum steel featuring a 2""
forcing cone and maximum back boring for superior recoil reduction and more
uniform patterns. It has a 1/4"" dovetailed, free-floating, ventilated rib
with brass bead front sight and is stress-relieved, contour-grounded,
precisely fitted and silver-brazed (not soft-soldered) to the finished
monoblock. The finely polished, stainless steel receiver is
corrosion-resistant and has no exposed pins or screws. The Red Label is set
off with a beautifully crafted, cut-checkered American walnut stock
featuring a traditional pistol grip, tapered, slim forend and a stainless
steel latch release. A soft Pachmayr buttpad is mounted on the 14.5"" length
of pull stock. It comes with five steel-shot compatible, screw-in Briley
chokes, featuring two skeet chokes and one full, one modified and one
improved cylinder choke, plus a premium-quality Briley choke tube wrench.
Built by American workers in American factories, the Ruger Red Label
shotgun is another 100% American-made product from Ruger.

Well, that’s not true, I couldn’t decide which route to take for ONE all-purpose rifle so I flipped a coin and the M1A lost.
This M1A is a mix of US GI parts with the only commercial part being the Springfield receiver. Based upon the serial number and what SA told me the receiver is a 1994 build.
As far as I can tell everything else is USGI.
TRW bolt
HRA barrel dated 2-61
SA USGI trigger housing
HRA safety
Winchester hammer
HRA op rod
The flash hider assembly is obviously commercial.

This rifle is a real dream to shoot and very accurate for what amounts to a battle rifle. Will come with both a Boyds walnut stock and a USGI fiberglass stock with the black crinkle finish. As you can see in the pics it does have the scout rail mounted. This would really be an ideal rifle for any of you looking for an M1A.


Please don’t message me saying how you can go and buy an M1A at XXX gunshop for less than that. No you can’t, not like this one. The only thing not mil-spec on this is the receiver. If you’re going to run an M1A this is what you want.


I will also throw in a SA Gen 4 scope mount.


Included also is a GI cleaning kit in the Boyds stock and two 20 round magazines ( USGI).

I have 5 extra magazines available for $30 each if you buy the rifle.

The ONLY trade interest I have would be for a USGI M1 Carbine in good shape."

I have put tons of money into it and now that I have a wife and kid I can't justify anymore. Its 1 of roughly 20 made in its year and color. I recently had the engine completely rebuilt and while it was in the shop I had the transmission swapped with a low mile used trans. The shop also installed a new radiator. It drove for about a week and then I found water in the transmission fluid. I believe because the transmission is radiator cooled that the new radiator that was installed failed and leaked back into the transmission. The car is worth roughly 5,000.00 running but I have more than that in aftermarket parts. The vehicle is as is but should be an easy fix for the mechanically inclined. It has roughly 120,000 miles on the body and less than 1000 on the rebuilt engine. I have a hand full of cosmetic ""upgrades"" including 18"" wheels with low profile Z rated tires. I also replaced the old clothe interior with fake leather custom ordered to match the color of the car and it needs to be finished. The car has a lot of little projects that need to be finished but could absolutely be a show car some day. Tag expired in 2013. I am interested in 1940-1960s model pickups, or newer trucks that are 4x4 and in decent condition.I will entertain gun trades, but please be realistic in value.

M-A1 & 5 mags! 3 15rd mags and 2 12rd mags,"South, Hattiesburg, Mississippi",$ 550,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 23, 2014",Handguns,Steyr                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Striker Fire                                                                                ,Pistol,"I am selling my Steyr M40-A1, 40 caliber pistol with 5 magazines for $550. Two of them are the factory 12-round magazines and three are 15-round S&W mags that still fit flush. If you are not familiar with this gun the first thing that you will notice is the trapezoid sights. They are a patented design that has been shown to offer faster sight acquisition while blocking less of the field of view.
 Three nice things about this gun, compared to the Glock are that it has a take-down lever (even easier that taking down a Glock), and there is a safety key (if you have kids in the house, you can lock the gun), it is quick to unlock, the key fits right in where the safety lever is located. The last thing is that it has a round-in-the-chamber indicator; It is a nipple on the back of the gun, just under the rear site. It doesn’t just show you that the gun is cocked; it indicates whether there is a bullet in the chamber. You can see it clearly, but even in the dark you can feel it.
 There is a rubber grip on the handle that I find very comfortable, but if it is not your thing it easily removable back to the original stock grip. 
 I cannot say enough good things about the company, Steyr. The gun functions flawlessly. The only reason that I have ever had to contact the company was the replace the key and the manual. They mailed me both, free of charge. It only took about a thirty-second call. So nice to have friendly, southern-people answering the phone and not a machine.
 The capacity is 16 rounds with the Smith and Wesson extended magazines. I am including 3 of them or the capacity is 13 rounds with the stock 2 magazines that I am also including.
 It weighs only 23 ounces, and has a 4 inch barrel. If you are into 9 millimeter you can convert it as simply as changing the barrel; that is the only difference.
 Here is a nice long YouTube video that goes into great detail.

 I can sell this to any Mississippi resident hassle-free. If you can't show a Mississippi ID we have to have it registered for an out-of -state sale. The last that I checked it would be a $15 cost that would be added to the sale."

This rifle was ""sporterized"" long ago by someone who knew what he was doing.  It has a very nice Fajen stock in good grade walnut, and the crude military sights have been replaced with a set of Williams open sights.  The barrel is 21"" and the bore is bright and shiny.  The gun and the stock are in very good condition, with over 85% of the original metal finish and the stock sound and free of any significant dings or gouges.  It comes with two boxes (40 rounds) of Norma factory ammunition loaded with soft point bullets; a box of brand new Norma brass, and a bag of bullets in the correct 0.268"" diameter.  This is about as nice a ""loaner"" or truck gun as you will find, not some beater that Bubba hacked in his basement in 1964.  The caliber (6.5x52 Carcano) is, like all the 6.5's, an outstanding hunting round for deer sized animals, and Norma ammunition is the best there is.  Included are also several of the 6-round ""en bloc"" clips this rifle uses (try finding these aftermarket!) and a set of brand new, never-used, Lee reloading dies.  You will get years of use out of this rifle.  It will also be a fine gun for a new hunter, as the recoil with the 6.5 is very mild.  A far better choice for a small-statured hunter or youth than any .243!  Contact me through armslist or my web site (www.nrvoutdoors.com) and I can send pictures, I have none to post at the moment.

Some of these rifles were made by Beretta: I haven't checked to see if this one was, but it's nicely finished and looks better than most of the stuff that came out of Italian government arsenals."

NFA Firearms Trust Template

FAST AND EASY TRANSFERS!

This is a FIREARMS SPECIFIC TRUST, with specific language relevant to the acquisition and possession of NFA regulated weapons. This is NOT a Quicken Willmaker trust! Simply input your relevant information, have the trust notarized, and you're ready to roll! All instructions and explanation of the different sections of the trust are included.

Why choose an NFA Trust?

#1) NO FINGERPRINTS! NO PHOTOS! NO CHIEF OF POLICE 
SIGNATURE REQUIRED! This will save you the time, money, and the hassle of dealing with an uncooperative and/or uninformed CLEO.

#2) EASE OF TRANSFER TO HEIRS! With an NFA trust you have the ability to add (or subtract) co-trustees at any time. co-trustees are able to take possession of any NFA item registered to the trust in the unfortunate event of the trustee's passing.

#3) FASTER TRANSFERS! With a proper NFA trust, you have the ability to file ATF Form 1's and Form 4's on the ATF's E-File website. Current wait times for taking possession of items after e-filing are approx 3-6 months. Wait times on paper forms are running 12-16 months!!!
