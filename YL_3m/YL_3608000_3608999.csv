It has barely visible ring marks which will probably come off with a little cleaning and the front rubber lens cover has a slight notch I cut out of it to make it easier to clear a mounting tail.  A new cover is $16 if it bothers you.  Otherwise the scope is absolutely flawless and in new condition.  All original stickers, manuals, box are included.

Price is firm and no trades please.

I also have Nightforce Ultralight Titanium medium 1"" rings which I will include for free if you want them."

I am mainly looking for another .45 and maybe the right 9mm, but pistols listed bellow will be considered(NO SHOTGUNS, RIFLES, or HKs)and I am willing to include cash for the right trade. 

Price $650, will go lower if you find a better price, but the cheapest i see a USP 45 compact going for on armslist is in Dallas there is a police trade in for $659 with out night sights ($100) and only one magazine ($50 a piece minimum online) and so I think $650 is a very fair price.

This weapon is intended for civilian and security use, and mimics the famous M16 rifle in its layout and placement of most controls. It is remarkably light for its caliber and size, because of extensive use of modern, high strength plastics.

Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes conventional gas-operated action with annual (ring-type) gas piston, which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip. Standard sights include front post, installed on the M16-style removable base, and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight. I ALSO HAVE AN ARMS MOUNT ON THE CARRYING HANDLE FOR OPTIC? LASER?

The Geissele 2 Stage (G2S) was designed to be a high quality, cost effective option of the SSA. The G2S is a 4.5lb. non-adjustable combat trigger that is a precision two-stage trigger and allows precise and accurate trigger control. The G2S is manufactured from the same tool steel as the SSA. Visually, from the outside of the weapon there is no difference from the SSA and the feel and reliability is the same. The G2S however has a different way of holding the hammer pin in place, there is no laser markings, and the parts are only spot checked for MP."

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

It appears to be all USGI, but I believe the receiver and barrel are commercial made. But I honestly don't know a ton about Alpine carbines. It was just in a group of stuff I bought. But the serial is 2555. The bolt and trigger housing is Underwood. The slide is Saginaw Gear and has a four digit number stamped in the slide. It is not visible when in the stock. The rear sight is inland, and the stock is a M2 Springfield Armory. The stock has a repair that you can see in one of the pics. The barrel is a 3ME and the bore is good. I'm looking for $575 on it.

This SIG Sauer P226 is chambered in 9mm.  It is German made as opposed to most SIGs you will see in your local retail location.  Stamped, ""Made in Germany"" on the slide, and other side of the slide is stamped with German markings.  German SIGS are not rare in themselves, but the only German SIGS I have ever seen are older and dated guns and have internal extractors.  This is a newer SIG with the external extractor.  Also, this gun is noticeably lighter that the New Hampshire produced SIGS that I also own.  The slide is noticeably lighter.  This weapon came from the factory with E2 grips.
 Unlike most SIGs you see in your local retail, this one was made in Germany:
 Factory installed E2 grips.  Like all guns straight from Germany, this gun did not have night sights.  I had a SIG certified armor install Trijicon night sights on the rear ($50.00) and an SRT (Short Reset Trigger) ($50.00).  The weapon came with two magazines, I will sell it with a third magazine ($45.00 value).

Weapon was brand new when I got it. I have only fired 250-300 rounds through it. 
Will also include a Fobus paddle holster.

Cash is king, however would entertain trade offers
Looking for low end AR or used AR.  Rifles chambered in 5.45x39, or 30 carbine.  Benelli Shotguns.  If your trade offer is valued higher then the pistol, I would happily pay the difference."

If you have recently purchased a .40 caliber firearm and don’t know what type of ammo you - or the firearm – will perform better with here is your opportunity to try many brands and weights.  

Here are the details for the assortment:  

Federal American Eagle, 180 grain, FMJ (x150-rounds) 

Herters, 165 grain, Total Nylon Jacket (x150) 

CCI Blazer Brass, 180 grain, FMJ (x250) 

Black Talon, 180 grain, SXT (x20) 

Federal Premium, Personal Defense, HST, loose rounds (x50)

Speer Lawman, 180 grain, FMJ (x50) 

Fiochi, 170 grain, FMJTC (x100) 

I also have 128 rounds of loose brass cased .40 S&W left over from my last range trip.  It looks to all be stamped as Speer.  

That’s a total of 898 rounds ready to be launched in a downrange direction at a high rate of speed.  

These are all complete rounds, there are none that are just casings or whatever.  

I do not want to split up the ammo between buyers.  I would like to make one sale and be done.  

To clarify, if you buy 1,000-rounds of .40 caliber S&W ball / target ammo in bulk (one type / brand) at Sportsmansguide.com it will be more expensive than my price here.  Yet that’s not what I’m selling.  I am selling an assortment for the shooter that wants to truly appreciate which round the firearm and the shooter perform best with. I am also not just selling typical ball ammo - there are some specialty and home defense loads that sell at much higher rates.  I hope that clarifies my ad.

I figure if people are going to supplement the ""too lazy to get a real job so I will further rip off the tax paying workers who already support me"" those in need of 22 LR ammo will support a single father whom works every hour I can get just to keep a roof over our head as well as support those too good to work. 
I have 2 rounds of CCI hollow point  I will sale for $3, 12 rounds of Federal for the unbelievable low price of $12 and 6 rounds of Eley for $24. If you are looking for boxes of ammo I have those as well, CCI 100 round box for $74.99(yes, I paid $7.49 at Walmart last week) , 333 round box for the low price of $57.99 (yes I paid $17.99 at Walmart a month or so ago), 50 round box of Federal for $25.00 (yes, I paid $3.59 at Walmart prior to the idiocy and hoarders started).  

Ok, now that it should be blatantly obvious that I am NOT selling for those prices, get real folks let these hoarding a-holes choke on ammo they can't use and only buy it to rip you off. They will cry supply and demand, well if you hoarding pricks that have no job besides picking up you welfare check from the mailbox would quit buying up every box the working folks could actually buy ammo. So please be a little diligent and patient in searching Walmart early in the morning on your day off from your job, order it online (yes with a minimum amount of searching 22LR can be had for between $0.05 & 0.08 a round) or just switch caliber."

Its in good shape with a little bit of carry wear but nothing major worth mentioning. Comes with two 8 round magazines. Has an excellent trigger, light and breaks very cleanly with a short reset. If you aren't familiar with these they are very similar to a Kahr CW9, basically the single stack 9mm Glock has yet to make.

It carries nicely but I prefer to pocket carry so I'd like something with a shorter grip. I'd be interested in a Ruger SR9c or LC9 or an M&P Shield in trade. Might also consider J frame sized .38 special revolvers or possibly a used S&W Model 10 or the same guns mentioned in .40.

I bought it new for $324 a few years ago, now the run about $349 new.

It comes with the original hard plastic case and all the original Sig paperwork, lock, extra spring and a few other parts that came with it.

I have two holsters for it. One is a Fobus paddle holster still in the bag. The other is a Sig paddle holster with a retention button that locks on the trigger guard so it can't come out without pressing it and it holds a second magazine. The second magazine comes with this firearm too.

This is a nice piece to shoot, very accurate. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is picky on ammo and the only stuff that it feeds and fires reliably from a full magazine is CCI. I have tried several brands of cheap ammo and they work most of the time if you only put 8 rounds in the ten round mags, federal seems to work the best, winchester and remington both had more failures. There is a second spring that came with it and I have not tried putting that one in, it might help but I have the ""standard velocity ammo"" spring in it now and the other is ""high velocity"".

In any case, it's a nice handgun for camping or plinking and with the accessories I'm selling with it, a great deal. The extra mag was $30 alone. 

$250 cash and carry!"

The WASR series rifles use a Romanian made receiver, but lack the dimple above the magazine well seen in the SAR series of Romanian AKM rifles.

This is probably the most common version of relatively non-modified AK-47s you will see in the United States. Although with the recent embargo on Russian products there is no telling when/if these might begin to disappear.

I have shot about 500 rounds through this and I can say it's a very fun, very accurate rifle for what it is. I am in a place where I need cash and have to sell, otherwise I wouldn't. The bayonet is nice as well, and can be used on its own as a hunting knife. It's not as stable as the blade on an SKS, and I would never shoot with it attached, but aside from that it's neat to have it.

I am asking $650 which is in line with other ads for the same weapon across Armslist and on other firearms sights. I need the cash so please don't ask me to trade for another firearm. I will consider trades for other items with cash value that I think I can sell easily like gold or silver coins or something else like that. I will not be able to take your stated value on the items you wish to trade, but will need to confirm that I can get my money's worth first.

For full price, I will come to you. If you bargain me down a little, you come to me.

This is a fun gun to own, and is even practical with the right sight for hunting at relatively short ranges if you so chose. 

I have 1000 rounds of ammunition for this that is a mixed lot of factory Russian ammo. The ammo sells for between $5 for 15 and $5 for 20. Because the ammo is now in an ammo crate I won't break it up. If you are interested in buying it, I will sell all of it for a flat, firm $200 which is between a $50 and about $125 discount already. This is a good deal.

I will include all the clips shown (around 8) for the full price of $650. One is the standard factory clip and the rest are Bulgarian 30s and 40s. The 40 round clips are especially nice, and unlike many non-factory clips these fit well and work properly. I have never had one jam."

The PT22 is a .22LR semi-automatic pistol produced by Taurus and features an 8+1 round capacity magazine.. The PT22 is a cast steel frame and slide, manufactured in Florida, USA. It has a spur-less hammer, and a long but smooth double action only (DAO) trigger. 
Something these little Taurus pistols have been praised for is the tip-up barrel design. What looks something like a slide release on the left side of the gun is actually a barrel release. Press it forward and the rear of the barrel pops up for loading a round directly into the chamber. To load the PT-22, then, simply load the magazine with cartridges, fully insert the magazine into the butt of the gun until it catches, pop up the barrel, insert a cartridge, and snap the barrel back down into the closed position.  
There is no need to rack the slide, which is a benefit to those who, because of arthritis or other hand weakness, are unable to operate conventional auto pistols.

It has a butter-smooth double-action trigger pull that measures eight and one-half pounds resistance, and a single-action pull that weighs in at four and one-quarter pounds average.

National Match
These are the finest pistol barrels made in the world!
Because of the care exercised in manufacturing, and unwillingness to compromise on any step
of the process.
Made with the finest material available (type 416 stainless steel)
Machining processes are accomplished on CNC equipment for the highest, close tolerance production.
Heat treating is done in a vacuum furnace for clean, consistent hardness of 40-43 Rc.
Barrels are bored and rifled using ECM process (electro-chemical machine). This process produces greater 
accuracy (=/- 50 millionths of an inch) and a superior finish (8 RMS or better). It also creates less stress than 
button, broach cutting.
No FFL required.
The end result is a good looking, top quality barrel with consistent, accurate and long lasting performance. 

  This particular barrel is extremely fast. I used it as a 40 cal conversion for my Glock 32  357 Sig for awhile until I bought a 40 cal Glock 23 and sold the Glock 32. I tested various reloads, plated, plain lead,  factory FMJ and JHP's over my chronograph with this barrel and my factory Glock barrel and this EFK barrel was always 20 to 50 fps faster than the Glock barrel. It does have standard rifling so  shooting lead is not an issue. I have to use the factory Glock barrel in my LE duty pistol Glock 23 per LE dept. policy so this barrel is just gathering dust. It has about 1000 rds thru it.

The red dot sight is not included in the deal as priced. It's nothing fancy anyway. The clip in the gun holds 46 rds, the rest are 30s. All are included and all are factory clips in perfect working order. 

I have fired about 250 rounds through this and have had no problems with it. I am selling it because we need the money, otherwise I wouldn't. No gun trades. I will consider trades of other items I can sell easily myself, but I have to confirm what I can get for them before I accept. Sometimes this is different that what people tell me things are worth, unfortunately.

Beyond that, this has not been altered in any way outside of the factory, takes .223 or 5.56 and is a great starter, or lower priced AR that is accurate and fun to shoot in general without having to spend $2-$3k on fancy name brands.

I have quite a lot of factory (but not super fancy) ammo for this and would consider a deal on 1000 rounds of it. The ammo is in an ammo box (included) so I'm not going to hand count it out to sort it. The listed price is for the gun, the hard case it came with, and the four clips.

If you pay my asking price I will come to you. If you don't you come to me. I have tried to price this fairly based on other similar listings and I believe I have done so, please don't low ball me in return."

I'm asking $500 OBO. The reason is this Shield also includes the Apex carry kit as well as the Apex trigger kit. This is over $160 not counting labor. It also comes with a Viridian r5 green laser. I can remove the laser if you don't want it, otherwise it will cost a bit extra. This is a great concealed carry pistol and shoots like a gun much larger than its size. With that being said I was recently given a gun which I prefer to carry so this has been collecting dust. It also comes with the box and all original paperwork. If you were considering getting a Shield and adding the Apex kits anyway this is a great way to save money! Text me REDACTED"

This gun is in excellent shape.  It has exactly 6 rounds through it, just to check function.

I bought it a little over a week ago and I really wanted this gun to work for me but my hand doesn’t fit the gun the way I want it to (I blame my hand, not the gun).  That’s a shame because it’s an outstanding design and every inch a Glock.  Its slim profile makes it great for concealed carry.  Plus...this model is made by the Glock factory in the USA (in GA).

The envelopes containing the documentation packet and factory test fire casing are both still sealed.  The envelope with the test fire casing is dated 08/05/14 so you know this is a brand new gun.  

Also includes a very low-profile, Blade-Tech Klipt Ambi kydex holster (IWB) which makes the gun disappear when worn.  The full package comes just the way it came from Glock, including factory lock with keys, factory box and all paperwork that came from the factory (as shown in photo), and the two 6-round mags supplied by Glock (both with pinky extension floorplates installed; the original flat floorplates are included as well).
