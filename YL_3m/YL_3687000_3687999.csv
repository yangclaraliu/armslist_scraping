So I have around $3,300.00 invested in it, but I obviously don't expect to get that back out of it. Just know I won't trade for you PSA AR with a Troy Alpha rail. Please make a decent offer for the same in value. If you want to get full value on your trade then I want full value for my rifle. I don't care if you have never shot it. Once you bought it then it was used. I will be fair if you are being fair. Open to negotiating so make offers."

For sale is a Coast to Coast Stores Model 288 tube fed .22 rifle.  The rifle was manufactured by Savage Arms and sold under the Coast to Coast Stores brand.  

This rifle is in great condition, it looks like it was set in a closet and forgotten about.  It needed to have the dust removed from it more than anything.  All parts appear to be original and the silver colored parts still have a nice quality shine to them.  

The front sight still has the original hood and the wood stock is in excellent condition with only a small (~1/2”) scratch on the underside of the stock and a slight scratch on the barrel near the front sight (see first photo).  I hope the pictures properly show what great shape this rifle is in.  

Rifle comes with 100-rounds of .22LR ammo.  

More photos available - just let me know if you’d like me to send you some."

The scope is made in the USA and is one of Burris's higher quality scopes. Features Hi-Lume lenses and a rugged heavy duty construction. This scope has a super-wide field of view and is excellent for quick target acquisition on close or moving targets but has plenty of magnification for a precision shot at 200-250 yards. 

 This scope can mount very low, close to the rifles receiver with a good cheek weld which is very desirable for quick and accurate shooting. An excellent choice for hunting or AR application.  

 Acceptable payment is cash, US Postal Money Order, PayPal plus 3% or I can hold the scope until your personal check clears. No bank checks. I can ship to most US locations for $12.

 The best way to contact me is by phone at four one zero, three seven five, forty two eighty nine or email your phone number. 

 This scope sold new for around $400. Burris provides a life time warranty on the scope."

I have sold my AR just recently that was chambered in 5.56, and do not know when I will be getting back into the AR platform.  As such, I am starting to sell off part of my current ammo supply.  Never had any problems with Prvi and in my opinion much better (and cheaper btw) than the 100ct/boxes at wallyworld.  It is good brass too and although I don't reload I give it to my friend who does and he loves it!  Please contact me anytime; in no hurry to sell and will have more on hand than offered if you really want more.

Includes original scabbard and hanger chain. This is from the classic and desirable Eickhorn manufacturer.

As you can see in the photos, it's not in mint condition. Some of the leather on the scabbard is coming off and fragile in spots. This is common if you're familiar with these daggers. Some of the wire is a bit loose at the bottom of the handle and some wear on the leather grip. Tip of blade is damaged and the blade shows some wear as seen in the pics. My asking price reflects these imperfections and I'm open to reasonable offers and trades. Really looking for handguns or revolvers.

With a large rollover cheek piece for scope usage and straight comb design to minimize cheek slap when shooting, 
the hand conforming thumbhole allows for increased accuracy while distributing the recoil among the palm and shoulder 
thus minimizing muzzle jump and felt recoil. The forend is proportioned to complement barrels from 21 inches to 25 inches 
in length nicely and will accommodate barreled actions with standard sporter contour barrels, and larger barrels up to a 
tapered varmint design can be inlet in these stocks. The forend also has side vents which permit the free floating barrel 
to cool efficiently for those long days at the range. 

This rifle was purchased new by me, added new laminate thumbhole stock and scope, then placed in safe. Never fired. 

Includes Owners Manual and Gun Lock.

Hawke is one of Europe's most popular scope manufacturers. The Japanese made Frontier line was the flagship of Hawke optics. Due to rising manufacturing costs, Hawke could not continue to sell these excellent scopes at a highly competitive price. The reviews for this scope are outstanding. From the superior Japanese glass to the quality turrets and internal adjustments with Nightforce type knurled adjustment knobs, this scope is a reflection of high quality. Please google Hawke Frontier 4-16x42 to confirm.

 For long range shooting, the scope has 80 MOA of elevation and target turrets to dial in your shots if desired. The compact design and 1 inch tube allows the scope to be mounted low to the rifle receiver.

 The scope when available, actually cost around $580 to $600. The list price was much higher. The scope is an exceptional value at $365.

 Acceptable method of payment is cash, US Postal Money Order, PayPal plus 3% or I can hold the scope until your personal check clears. No bank checks. I can ship to most US locations for $12.

Selling 'cause I'm buying a house and need closing/inspection money. Not interested in any trades...FIRM on the price. If you can buy the AMMO ALONE for this price, go for it! And....with a rifle? 

Must have an I.D. (valid) before I release this to ANYONE. 

I will not sale to anyone with a California, Massachusetts, New York, Colorado or Connecticut ID. Having an ID from those states indicates that you MAY live there, and based upon the fact that these states political representatives are not ""gun friendly"" and that they are giving a hard time to citizens from such areas, I chose not to conduct any firearms related transactions with such persons. I don't want to make the news for selling a semi auto rifle and 2,000 rounds of ammo to anyone that lives in liberal ""la-la"" lands.

No trades please (as stated above). Feel free to contact me via EMAIL and I'll answer any questions you may have. Please don't send me your phone number and ask me to call you.....cause I won't. Too many stalkers/Bots/people that just want to collect phone numbers for political campaign ads/whatever. I will give you my number AFTER YOU decide to come into town to look at the gear/stuff. I will meet you in a public area (Walmart...FERNLEY) and we will go from there. 

Sorry if this ad and my requests are weird. Just had too many emails where people wanna trade stuff (when I said no trades) and where they want ME to call them to discuss things that are readily available online....and I did call two people and ended up reaching Del Taco and Dominos Pizza in Michigan.

Long-range rifle shooters (and even short-range ones) know that consistency on target means taking yourself out of the stabilization equation and supporting that rifle with some sort of bipod, tripod, rest, or front & rear bags. We’ve long suffered with having to take multiple bags on trips to the range or into the field because you never know how much elevation you need your bags to provide. Crusader Gear has engineered a solution by making one bag that can be configured in a number of different ways in order to provide the maximum functionality. Use it flat when you just need a little, or fold it in half, use it like a mini A-frame, or stand it up on end when you need the most support under the buttstock or forend of your rifle. The one-inch webbing strap serves as a carry strap, a handle, or cinches the bag in half to help it maintain its position without slipping or flattening out. Crusader Gear’s Multi-Position Rifle Bag is constructed of 1000D Cordura nylon and filled with poly pellets that will not absorb moisture, so this bag will not get heavier in the rain or humid air. No more weighing down your rucksack, range bag or drag bag with multiple shooting bags. This one can do it all."
