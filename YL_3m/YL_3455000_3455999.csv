Contrary to popular belief, the ""blinding muzzle flash"" is nothing that any person can't handle.

 The name ""Pug"" may have derived from the Latin Pugnus, meaning Fist. With this in mind, the NAA Pug can be characterized as multum in parvo (""much in little"") in reference to the small and convenient size.

Squat and sturdy like its namesake dog, The NAA Pug is chambered in 22 Magnum and sports a 1"" heavy barrel. You can count on this stocky companion to deliver a bite even worse than his bark.

Slightly oversized pebble-textured rubber grips enable the handler to keep a firm ""leash"" on this pocket-sized puppy. The XS sighting system provides a quick sight picture and will enable the handler to direct the bite.

The NAA-PUG-T comes with a Tritium sight. 

As with every NAA Mini-Revolver, the hammer need not rest on an empty chamber. Using the original half-way notch cylinder, the hammer may rest safely and securely without chance of accidental discharge.

Come check this pistol out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte. Give me a call @ 980-237-eight9eight1 if you have any questions. Shipping can be arranged for $15.

Today, a Colt 1911 is once again proudly serving at the side of our country’s military. After a rigorous selection process, the United States Marine Corps selected the Colt Rail Gun as their Close Quarters Battle Pistol (CQBP). This marks the first time since the end of World War II that a Colt 1911 is being shipped to the United States Government. To honor the brave men and women of this important staple of America’s military might, the Colt CQBP will be made available in limited quantities through the Colt Custom Shop. What makes the CQBP stand out is its Desert Tan Cerakoted Stainless Steel Receiver and Slide, Novak® 3 Dot Night Sights and Flat, Serrated Mainspring Housing with Lanyard Loop. The pistol also features an Enhanced Hammer, Colt Tactical Ambidextrous Safety Lock, and a 5” National Match® Barrel. The Colt Custom Shop performs hand fitting of critical mating parts and each firearm is test fired by the Custom Shop and supplied with the actual test target. Features Novak® 3 Dot Night Sights Enhanced Hammer Ambidextrous Safety Lock Long, Solid Aluminum Trigger Flat, Serrated Mainspring Housing with Lanyard Loop Desert Tan Cerakoted Stainless Steel Receiver and Slide 5” National Match® Barrel MIL-STD-1913 Accessory Rail. If paying by check please wait until money enters my account before I ship the gun.

This is the Colt Marine made by Colt's custom shop, unlike the models that come in a blue Colt hard case and sell for about $400 cheaper.

Chambered in .308 (7.62x51 NATO) I bought this rifle right after my deployment and installed the Sage EBR chassis myself. The reason I'm selling it is because it just collects dust in the corner of my room. I have my AR-15 that I primarily use. I spent 1600 on the springfield national match rifle and the Sage International EBR chassis was 850. Total investment that I spent was 2450.

This means the right side slide release lever is gone, the left side release is much narrower and the ""batwing"" safety levers are now flush and act as a decocker.  

I think Beretta's are under appreciated due to perceived ""bulk"" and the slide mounted safety.  The Type G conversion goes a long way in addressing those concerns.  I have also found that the rotating barrel concept does work well in reducing felt recoil, which helps make this gun highly accurate.  It's hard to describe the feeling as the the trigger releases the hammer; I can only say it's like ""butter.""

I had made the conversion as I was intending this to be my EDC.  However, I already have several other options (mainly far more expensive ones) and simply chose this as the most expendable.  Bottom line is gun still looks new (I have had it for less than three months).  250 rounds through at most.  Gun will remain a safe queen until sold.  

I am selling vs. trading.  The price is extremely fair as I don't wish to play games.

Again, this Type G makes it much better for carry and having 15+1 capacity is great.   

Illinois law will be followed for in-state transfer or I can ship FFL to FFL for $35 to anywhere in conus.  Box and all papers, manual, etc. are included."

Benelli SuperNova 12GA Tactical Black Shotgun 20155
The Benelli SuperNova embodies a modular design concept into a pump action shotgun. With the optional SteadyGrip stock, this shotgun can be transformed into a high-performance turkey gun or deer slayer. It’s like having several Benelli shotguns in one. There’s even a barrel with rifle sights for home defense and a SuperNova Tactical fitted with a ghost-ring rear sight and pistol grip. At the heart of the Benelli SuperNova shotgun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the new SuperNova super-light, super-strong and almost completely impervious to any weather element.

In 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, they've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.

FEATURES

 	Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.
	3 Position Safety Decocker
Try the ambidextrous Three-Position Safety on any Taurus pistol capable of firing in both single action and double action. It's easily operated and provided at no additional charge. Depress with your thumb and safely drop the hammer to de-cock the pistol. The safety returns to the OFF position, ready for double action shooting. Push the safety up and your cocked pistol is safe to carry in the single action mode. When applied to a de-cocked pistol, safety is ON and the first shot is double action.
 	Taurus Security System (TSS)a
All the Taurus family of revolvers features the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your firearm and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
 	Ambidextrous 3-Position Safety
Features Positive dentents for SAFE, FIRE and DECOCK
 	Accessory Rail
Features the Genuine Picatinny Rail allowing use of many accessories
	Decocker Lever
Allows the Firearm to be safely decocked from the cocked position

The Springfield Armory had delivered approximately 843,000 M1903 rifles, but due to the difficulties in production, rather than re-tool the Pattern 14 factories to produce the standard U.S. rifle, the M1903 Springfield, it was realized that it would be much quicker to adapt the British design for the U.S. .30-06 cartridge, for which it was well-suited. Accordingly, Remington Arms Co. altered the design for caliber .30-06, under the close supervision of the U.S. Army Ordnance Department, which was formally adopted as the U.S. Rifle, Caliber .30, Model of 1917."

Other Informantion: The CQB T-dot reticle addresses some of the shortcomings of other eotech reticles. With a second dot for holdovers (at 500 yards with a 50/200 yard zero) As well as a T in the reticle that covers mechanical offset for CQB situations. Also features handy built-in QD mount! This unit is brand new with box and all paperwork.

This rare model is only sold through Brownells for $549.00...

http://www.brownells....OGRAPHIC-SIGHT

From their website:
The Brownells CQB T-Dot Sight is designed for combat and competition shooters who frequently address targets at close quarters. It corrects a common problem with combat-zeroed optics mounted on an AR-type rifle: the point of impact is significantly lower than the point of aim at close quarters distances. Built by EOTech exclusively for Brownells and based on the popular EOTech EXPS2, the CQB T-Dot eliminates the “guesstimating” when aiming at these targets. It retains the parent design’s 65 MOA circle illuminated reticle with two aiming points calibrated for 50-200 yards and 500 yards. The bottom of the T-Dot’s circle is left open, with a “T” indicating a precise aiming reference zeroed for about 7 yards. All aiming points are calibrated for 5.56mm NATO ammunition. Windage and elevation are adjustable in ½ MOA increments.

These rifles are very good quality and was some of the best to come out with century's name on them. If your into the AK world for any amount of time then you know how well these rifles are built. Also, how hard they are to find. 

RPK 1.6mm receiver, RPK bulged trunnion, milled pattern thick barrel, factory night sites, grenade sight, longer handguards, longer LOP stock, ect, ect, are some of the advantages this rifle has over other AK rifles. Rifle was duracoated and the wood refinished about a year ago. Has sat in the safe since. The rifle shoots as good as it looks. In fact, it's one of my most accurate AKs.

I've put maybe 40 rounds through it, with one failure to extract out of the bunch that I've chalked up to using old ammo.

It lacks the bayonet lug integral to the front barrel band, and the rear sight is damaged and needs to be replaced. A small bit of work is needed to the heatshield to extend the metal tab that engages with the receiver to actually hold it on. It also lacks the oiler or any sort of accessory components. This is all stuff I could have fixed in a weekend with less than $100, but I've been too caught up in messing with ARs and AKs.

I will sell if the offer is right, but the cash offer will probably be more than the gun is worth in it's present state. I'd much rather trade it for something else interesting to someone who will show the gun a little more love than I've been- despite it's being a post-war reproduction, it'd still make a pretty gun with some effort.

The gun will come with a mostly-depleted box of Prvi Partisan .30 carbine (I believe it has 25 rounds left in) and a 30 round magazine that appears to be new production."

I am not desperate to sell this so please no lowball offers or trade offers wanting full retail price for your used gun. I would prefer to just sell for cash and I am not looking to trade, but if you are reasonable about a fair value for your gun then I am willing to consider taking it as a partial trade with the difference in cash."

The gun has been babied and aside from some slight marks on the rail from mounting, it is mint. It has less than 100 rounds through it. I purchased it about five years ago when Bushmaster was the premiere AR manufacturer for law enforcement using hand matched parts and the fit is superb. It's quality is definitely a cut above the mega production bushmasters off the shelf. The upper has a Yankee Hill quadrail, and Yankee Hill flash suppressor/compensator direct from Bushmaster. The A3 handle has military sized twin apertures. The barrel is polygonal rifled and chrome lined comparable to Noveske or HK. with a scope the rifle is an absolute tack driver. It has an A3 handle  quick detachable see thru scope mount rail from Bushmaster. I added the slanted front handle and the rubber rail covers. The lower has an Ergo deluxe tactical grip. It has an enhanced BCM trigger and comes with two bushmaster mags. The BSA reflex sight is not included, but I can throw it in for $60 more I will sell the upper for $625 or $900 for the whole rifle. The price is good considering the gun cost me almost $1400 without the extras and is just about like new."
