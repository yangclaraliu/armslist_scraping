The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in black, grey, and olive drab.

MSRP	$333.00


The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

Armscor/Rock Island M1911-A1 MSP 1911 Midsize GI .45ACP

The Rock Island Armory 1911 series consists of a product line of single-action recoil operated semi-automatic pistols. They are designed and manufactured by Armscor in Marikina City, Philippines, and distributed in the United States by Armscor USA, located in Pahrump, Nevada.

RIA (Rock Island Armory) 1911s are clones of the US Military G.I. M1911-A1, the standard issue US Service pistol from 1911 to 1985. Most RIA models are targeted for the low-end price point of the 1911 pistol market and are basic entry level MIL-SPEC versions of the 1911, however, the RIA Tactical, Compact, and Match models offer additional semi-custom high end features. The Compact model features a skeletonized hammer and beavertail grip safety while the Tactical model also adds a target-grade hammer and trigger as well as an ambidextrous safety, and enhanced contrast combat sights. Armscor is an ISO 9001 certified-compliant company which manufactures Rock Island pistols using CNC (Computer Numerical Control) equipment. RIA 1911 series pistols are constructed of 4140 chromoly steel with a cast frame, and are available in .45 ACP, .38 Super, 9mm Luger, and .22 TCM chamberings.

This rifle has a BD date code. For those that don't know, the HK MR556 is a short stroke piston operated rifle built as a civilian version of the 416. The 416 is in use by Marines (IAR27) and by select special forces. It is an outstandingly clean operating system. It also has been upgraded with HK licensed Troy Micro flip-up front and rear sights($190). The sights give absolute 1-1 co-witness to the Aimpoint. It has had the barrel re-profiled to the SOCOM profile by Jayson at IGF. He re-profiles and works on HK's for a living. His work is second to none. It also comes with a 14.5"" SS barrel custom made to fit the HK MR556 and 416, it has been Duracoated and includes a BCM flash hider with pin to lengthen it to 16"" overall. I bought the barrel for another upper but decided to let it go. The upper has a zero round count, while the lower has a 30 rounds or less count. I used it with my other upper to test the other uppers accuracy. I have a larger trigger guard on it but includes stock flat trigger guard. It has 7 HK High Reliability Magazines (2 I bought used and 5 never fired). It also has 5 HK polymer magazines. It comes with all the paperwork and hard case from HK. I will include the Vickers Padded Combat two point sling with quick release. The Aimpoint PRO is used but in perfect condition with box,spacer (not used as to give co-witness to the HK low profile sights), and paperwork. There is almost $500 worth of magazines at HK's price. The total of the barrel re-profile and nitriding (meloniting) is $340. The extra barrel (new), I put a value of $300 even though it cost more than that to have it made and include an extra barrel nut (not pictured). I also have an HK barrel nut tool that will fit HK's proprietary barrel nut. On a side note the barrel tab was removed by Jayson to allow either the MR556 or 416 BCGs to fit the upper, the 14.5"" barrel was made without the tab, so it will work with either also. I honestly am not looking to trade for anything. The only thing I can think I might trade on is partially on a SCAR 17S or DD AR+ cash. Please note that I will drive within a reasonable area to meet, but prefer to deal FTF. Must show ID, CCW or PPP to buy this. Sorry for the inconvenience, but better safe than sorry. Price is firm and not negotiable. Please no low ballers I really do not need to sell this and only thought I might as it is a safe queen, I have no problem keeping it as I have way more in it than my price. More photos are available of any and all parts of the rifle. Just email me and request photos. I can take close-ups of the BCG, barrel, sights, etc."

 I have for sale a very gently used Vortex Viper HST 4-16X44 scope. It has a 30MM tube and  has the VMR-1 MRAD Reticle.  Included are a set of Burris XTR Tactical rings. This is an excellent scope that I had mounted on a Savage Rifle in 223. I shot approximately 100 rounds with the scope mounted.

I am selling it because I did not get to use it often on my clubs 600 yard range.

Vortex Optics has the best warranty in the world of Optics. It does not matter if you are the original owner or not. If something goes wrong with the scope they will replace it. 

MSRP is $669.00 I am asking $495 or best offer with the rings.

I can be reached at REDACTED. I am not interested in trades.

A word about 80% lowers. The ATF considers an 80% lower as ""not a firearm"". It is perfectly legal to finish an 80% lower YOURSELF to create a working firearm. The important word here is YOURSELF. With your OWN tools. Read here for a detailed description-

22 TCM case details
The 22TCM (Tuason Craig Micromagnum)[2] is a proprietary cartridge developed by Fred Craig and Rock Island Armory. Before the cartridge was commercialized, it was called the 22 Micro-Mag. The 22TCM is a bottle necked cartridge referenced as a short 5.56 with performance that exceeds the 5.7x28 FN while being smaller in length and re-loadable. Standard factory loads are 40-grain jacketed soft hollow point. Armscor has announced a new round the 22TCM9R which will be the same case as the 22TCM but have an overall length of the 9mmx19 round. The company plans to release this round in summer of 2015 with a Glock 22TCM9R conversion slide to allow the 22TCM to fit in a 9mm length magazine, hence the ""9R"" designation. The 22TCM9R will in fact still be a 40GR bullet but will be a fully jacketed hollow point instead.

The 22TCM is based on the 5.56 nato case, shortened so that the shoulder is at approximately the same length as a 38 super cartridge. The cartridge is designed to feed from a Para-Ordnance style double column .38 Super magazine. Currently only Rock Island Armory catalogs firearms chambered in 22TCM: a 1911 style semi-auto pistol (also available with optional additional 9mm barrel and recoil spring), and a bolt action rifle (which reportedly can use the same magazines as the pistols); and only Armscor (the parent company of Rock Island Armory) manufactures ammunition."

This particular model has the upgraded Trijicon fully adjustable, 3-Dot tritium night sights installed from the factory, as well as the integral accessory rail. This 1911 is truly a work of art and has the potential to be the centerpiece of any gun collection. Included with the pistol is a hard carry case, hip holster, twin mag carrier, cleaning brush, factory literature, and two 7 round magazines. The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class. TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission. Sometimes performance isn't optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™. Come check this pistol out in person at The Arms Room in Charlotte.

This is one of the more complete units, as it has the rear takedown pocket machined already. All that is required is purchase of a jig and tooling to finish the fire control pocket and drill for trigger pins and safety. This machining can be done with a drill press, mill, or router, depending on the type of Jig that is purchased. These are available from multiple sources on the internet.

A word about 80% lowers. The ATF considers an 80% lower as ""not a firearm"". It is perfectly legal to finish an 80% lower YOURSELF to create a working firearm. The important word here is YOURSELF. With your OWN tools. Read here for a detailed description-

http://blog.princelaw.com/2015/01/03/atf-issues-first-ruling-of-the-new-year-is-it-the-end-of-80-lowers/

So- please do not ask me if I can finish, help finish, or refer you to someone who can finish this for you. I cannot and will not, as that would be illegal. I can give you an opinion that these 80% lowers will somehow become legislated out of existence before too long. I'm selling this and the other Billet one listed here because I became interested in other things. Asking $75.00, face to face cash only. Willing to do a bit of a discount if you purchase both."

•Dan Wesson BB revolver
•12-gram CO2 cartridge
•6-rd BB cylinder
•Fixed front sight
•Adjustable rear sight
•Textured grips
•Double-/single-action
•Manual safety*
•Working ejector rod
•Includes detachable Weaver rail, speedloader and 6 shells**

*If the gun is cocked, the manual safety will not engage. For the safety to engage, the gun must be uncocked. If you cock the gun and then try to engage the safety, you will still be able to pull the trigger...and the gun will shoot the projectile!

**Each shell should be loaded with one steel BB and then loaded into the gun's cylinder.

This is one of the most realistic BB revolvers made. The cylinder swings out, and you insert 6 shells with the included speedloader. When you've emptied the cylinder, push out the empty shells with the ejector rod.

The Dan Wesson CO2 BB revolver has an 8"" barrel and textured grips. It's a great piece if you enjoy shooting firearms but don't want to go to the range for every session.

 When shooting a BB gun, everyone in the vicinity should wear safety glasses. Never shoot at hard objects. Steel BBs easily ricochet, so everyone in the area must wear safety glasses. Remember to remove all pets before commencing to shoot."

Very accurate and it's got a lifetime warranty. Built like a tank unlike the cheese air rifles like ya see everywhere. This is a critter killing machine and they never hear it coming. I got another one I'm keeping. Bought this 48 for the wife to squirl hunt with but she hasn't had time to go so getting rid of it. I found using these air guns for squirl hunting it don't spook the rest of them when ya shoot. Making it a lot more fun hunting. And it don't have any problems taking one at 50 yards and putting it down. At 1100 fps it's shooting right with a 22lr. Rifle with some pellets and scope. No sling 250.00 rifle has decades of life in it. It's truly a life time rifle. Excellent trigger as well just top notch equipment. New these rifles run from 450.00 to 550.

Picked this up a couple weeks ago and after putting 300 flawless rounds thorugh it, realized it just isnt for me.   After doing some research on the gun it has a frame recall that has never been taken care of.  I called Glock with the serial number and they said indeed it was eligible for a free frame.  They said they will also replace any worn internal parts for free as well as include a free factory extended slide release and free factory extended mag release.  (GLock always throws in a couple free mags as well)You just have to overnight it cack to Glock via FEDEX.  Called FEDEX and the total cost to overnight gun back to Glock would be $25-$30 bucks.  So for basically the cost of the gun plus $30, you will have a brand new gun in a model that they dont make anymore.  Turnaround time per Glock is approx 2 weeks to replace the frame.  


 Will also trade for a Gen 3 or 4 Glock 19 or Gen 3 or 4 Glock 17.

I'm the original owner, I purchased it brand new over at Northside here in Columbus, about 4 years ago. I've fired it maybe 3 times, with a total round count of,at most, 100 rounds, not even close to being fully broken in.
 It functions absolutely perfectly, everything is 100% exactly as it should be. 
 The pistol has largely been a bed-side gun, mostly just sitting in it's case since I got it. Again, you can't tell it from a brand new one under the counter at a gun store. The ONLY difference in this one and a brand new one (other than cost)  is that somebody other than you spent $30 in ammo establishing that it feeds and ejects properly !! This is a high-quality, highly popular pistol, that is virtually brand-new, and isn't stolen or F'd up, so please don't be running any more ridiculous, low-ball offers by me. I've had enough of them already. 
 Included is all the factory-original stuff: hard case, cleaning kit, paperwork, spent shell casing, lock,both 15-round mags, plus a quality leather belt-slide holster (which this pistol has never been carried in, so no holster wear,whatsoever).
 Prospective purchasers must be over 21, and able to legally own a firearm. Buyer must also be a Georgia resident, and able to prove it with valid drivers license or carry permit.
 I do have my Georgia carry permit, so everything's good on my end.
 If the ad is still up, then I still have the pistol. I won't respond to e-mails asking, ""do you still have the item?"".

Beautiful German Luger, 1918 all matching numbers except clip. Lowest known serial number for this model.  Shoots perfectly (115 gr. 9mm parabellum FMJ *ONLY* [NO PLUS P'S]). Most awesome carry pistol, ever. Scares hell out of people. This one was professionally refinished in the '50's, perfect two tone,  no military or police stamps. 

BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE! sorry. Comes with the soft case it's been living in and a leather holster (for awesome carrying, not period correct). I also have a detachable stock (probably a reproduction)... for your *other* artillery model Luger... not for this one... (although it fits this one, but that would be less-than-legal). $1200 for the works."

The rifle is CMP Special Grade with means the CMP armorers have reparkerized the metal components, and fitted a new barrel as well as walnut stock.  It's a great weapon that I've shot less than 300 rounds through.  The only damage is on the outside of the barrel near the front sight post where the parkerized finish is scratched - see photos.  Apart from that it is a well taken care of piece.   The ammunition is also a CMP purchase and is HXP....which I've found to be quality and have not had a problem with it.  The price is firm and I can send additional better quality photos of rifle upon request from serious offers.  Thanks.  And please if you think you can get a better price on this amazing lot somewhere else, please do so and save your time by not emailing me and telling me about it."

By now, their innovative double action pistols are traditional classics. In 2004, Sig Arms launched their Revolution series descendants of John M. Browning’s Colt 1911, traditional pistols with excellence and innovation that we expect from the company. Recently, Sig has gone to using the conventional 1911 name. This is Sig’s 1911TTT variant, Sig’s counterpart to the Colt Gold Cup Elite series. The 1911 TTT – or Triple T, writes the SIG SAUER® staff, is a two-tone 1911 with Nitron® slide and black controls on a Natural Stainless frame. This non-railed pistol is accented by beautiful custom wood grips and topped off with adjustable combat night sights. The all stainless steel frame and slide of the Triple T are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance. The frame features 25-line per inch checkering on the front strap – while the mainspring housing has 20-line per inch checkering – and both the frame and slide are de-horned for comfortable full-size carry. Like all SIG SAUER products the 1911 TTT pistol contains only premium internal parts including a match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The 1911 TTT features a beavertail grip safety with speed bump, extended thumb safety, firing pin safety and hammer intercept notch … . As far as other specs, manufacturer is Sig Sauer of Exeter, NH. Caliber, of course, is .45 ACP, .45 Automatic. Trigger is serrated face coated alloy with overtravel adjustment. Trigger pull is 5 pound vicinity with minimal felt creep. The 1911 TTT has dovetailed black anodized Siglite® sights in white bar rear / dot front, both of them dovetailed into the slide. Note that the rear sight has Novak style contours, but is windage and elevation adjustable. Grip frame is checker serrated fore and aft; extended magazine release and main safety with beavertail grip safety and serrated top skeleton Commander style hammer. Barrel is 5 inch stainless. Weight empty is 41.6 ounces, with center of gravity at the trigger guard to frame junction. Magazines with the photo specimen are factory 8 rounders, polished stainless body with slot style black polymer floor plates and blue steel cartridge followers. The followers, interestingly, bear a Check-Mate patent number. This pistol will accept any 1911 Government type magazine that fits a full size grip frame. Similarly equipped Colt Pistols command prices upwards of $2000 apiece in our area. We’re offering the Sig 1911 TTT CA in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 689.00.

This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1942 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped in May of 1942. It is stamped with WB inside a Box for Colonel Waldemar S. Broberg, Hartford/Springfield Ordnance District, Army Inspector of Ordnance: July 1, 1941 - June 16, 1942. The WB inspected pistols are a little more rare for that time frame.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. But not all pistols back then were stamped with ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted national match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by the military, as the barrel has been re-stamped. This gun is in its original time frame finish (parkerized). All Proof markings to fit era. Bore is excellent and looks shinning.

This pistol is a shooter. It is amazingly tight and special fitted for accuracy. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection.

The ""P"" proof mark is located near the magazine release and on top of the slide, in front of the rear sight. Cross cannons ordnance mark on the right rear of the frame, to the right of the hammer pin.
