This AMT Stainless Match Pistol is almost an exact replica of the Ruger MK Original .22LR Pistol. The big difference is the AMT is all Stainless. So close were the designs that AMT was taken to court by Ruger for Patent Infringement. That court case terminated the AMT Production line.

AMT production ran from 1986 through 1993. Their production facility was located in Covina, California.

Product Information:
Designed for volume production, the Lee 6-Cavity Bullet Mold blocks are machined from commercial quality aluminum and feature steel bushing and alignment pins. Lee mold blocks are machined from aluminum blocks making them rust resistant. Aluminum molds heat up and cool down faster than iron or steel molds so good bullets can usually be produced after only a few casts. In addition, they are one-third the weight of iron or steel mold blocks for less fatigue during extended casting sessions. To ensure the best possible bullets, mold block halves are CNC machined for unmatched roundness and size control. Lee 6-Cavity molds come with a cam operated, hard-anodized sprue plate which is held tightly with tempered spring washers at each end. Weights given are Lee's weights with suggested alloy; actual weight may vary due to alloy mixture used. Handles ARE NOT included (#117-892).

Technical Information:
Material: Machined Aluminum Mold Blocks and Hard Anodized Sprue Plate

Rust resistant aluminum blocks

Only 500 made in the 1950's. One in similar condition just sold for $3,162 at the Rock Island Auction. This is an extremely rare piece of history as it is the first pistol produced with an aluminum frame. The pistol is mechanically sound and functions perfect. The nickel plating is a little dull in some spots due to being kept in a leather holster. The box has a little bit of staining on it, but it still has the sticker on the bottom, which I am told is rare!

The Whitney Wolverine was an advanced, ""space-aged"", light-weight aluminum, semi-automatic, .22 LR caliber pistol created in 1956. It had a 10 round magazine, a barrel 4.625 inches (117.5 mm) long and a weight of only 23 ounces (650 g)

The Wolverine was engineered by Robert Hillberg, who learned about aluminum casting during WWII while working with aircraft guns and later became research engineer for High Standard Manufacturing Company.[3] Only 13,371 of these .22 semi automatic pistols were made in its short period of production between 1956 and 1958.[4] There were approximately 500 nickel plated according to company records, the rest finished in varying shades of anodized blue, The plastic grips came in either a black,dark brown or white, the white grips are found mostly on the nickel plated models. The frame being investment cast by Alcoa was a new idea for the gun industry at the time, now it is widely used by almost every major gun manufacturer today.

The full-length, free float handguard keeps your hands cool and provides plenty of room for accessories. As an added touch, Radical Firearms has included the Sig Sauer Stabilizing Arm Brace!

Also available is the Lee 125-RF flat nose. This bullet is for 38 or 357, but can also be sized down to .3565 for use in 9mm. This is also available in either alloy. http://www.titanreloading.com/image/cache/data/Products/90306-600x600.jpg

10 BHN alloy begins to mushroom at impact velocities of 1300 fps. You may prefer the harder alloy for better penetration.  It is needed in faster twist rifles like Marlin and Handi Rifles to maintain accuracy in the 1600-1800 fps range. It is also needed in 1 in 10"" fast twist 9mms. 

 The only time we run harder bullets for pistols is in 9mm. This is because the common 1 in 10"" twist rate is too much for the softer bullets. 357 mag has a gentler twist rate of 1 in 16"" and the medium alloy works great there all the way to max loads. In the slow twist ( 1 in 30"") of our Rossi rifles, 10 BHN shoots 2 MOA at 1800 FPS with Lil' Gun and expands to 55-60 cal in water all the way to 150 yards.

In original case.  Includes one 13-round flush mag, and one 16-round extended mag.  I'll also throw a trigger lock, a cleaning kit and some 9mm snap-caps for practice if you want.

This is a great shooter, and decent carry gun with the 13-round mag.  Also ideal for beginners - the grip safety is easy to use and forces you to actually grip the gun in order to enable firing, combined with the trigger safety the chance of accidental discharge is greatly reduced.  I love this gun, but I'm moving to California for a new job, where private sales are illegal as is the XM."

Unlike its competitors, the P320 does not require the operator to pull the trigger nor use a special tool to take-down the firearm for cleaning or routine maintenance.

Featuring a modular grip frame and removable fire control assembly pioneered by SIG SAUER, the P320 is customizable to any hand size or duty requirement. The P320 can quickly be converted from a Full-size to a Carry pistol. Slide and barrel conversions allow the P320 to change between calibers and barrel lengths as well.
With a partially pretensioned striker, the P320 has a short, crisp trigger pull with a quick, pronounced reset right out-of-the-box. The P320 comes in two trigger variants: a standard trigger and a tabbed safety trigger for specific law enforcement clients. Featuring the SIG SAUER internal safety system, the P320 has no external safety or decocking lever to snag or hang up on the draw. A frame-mounted thumb safety version will be available for law enforcement needs. SIGLITE® night sights come standard, and the reversible magazine release makes the P320 completely ambidextrous.

Whatever the requirement, patrol duty, competition, time at the shooting range, or concealed carry, the P320 brings SIG SAUER legendary reliability, durability, and quality to the polymer-framed, striker-fired duty pistol"

It's all numbers matching except for the bayonet but that's pretty normal. The stamping on the receiver is fairly light, but you can still make everything out and all the other numbers are very deep. Very good shooter, the bore is dark but still has sharp rifling and is as accurate as I can be. I do still have the box for this rifle I believe. Also has the sling, 3 ammo pouches, and tool kit.

Next up is a 1946 Izzy M44. This rifle is beautiful. All numbers match and are easily visible. Bore is nice and shiny with sharp rifling. This thing shoots true though I will say the bolt is just a touch sticky.

I also have 872 rounds of 7.62x54r ammo to go with the guns. 440 in a sealed spam can, 340 in 20 rd paper packages (from a previously open spam can), 34 rds of wolf, and 58 rds of loose surplus. I also am including 20 stripper clips to the first person who wants them. I WILL NOT SEPARATE THE AMMO OUT, unless the guns go first and the buyers don't want the ammo. 

I would obviously like to sell everything all together as a package. Price for it all would be $650

""The CACFL is a long (15"") handguard designed as a lightweight handguard and includes the Carbon Arms nut system. The threaded assembly attaches to the threaded upper receiver and includes the barrel nut. The tube is easily removed for cleaning and adjustments making this modular system one of the simplest while maintaining excellent strength and rigidity. Mounting hardware and instructions are included. Lightweight, strong and cool, even in rapid fire, this hand guard brings your rifle into the current era of advanced materials.

As compared to the ""Feather"" the Clark CF tube weighs about 50% more, and the JP/VTac slotted aluminum tubes weigh about 230% more! All of the ""Feather"" tubes are drilled at 90, 180 and 270 degrees at the distal end for stud attachment points. Drilling Carbon Fiber is NOT recommended as it requires special cutters and the particulates created by high speed cutters can be harmful. The tubes are supplied with the required hardware and installation instructions.

There are very good reasons why our handguards are not ""ventilated"" or slotted. While the heat build up in this new system is less than our previous version, we do also offer the heat shield kit. Adding the heat shield to the handguard results in a handguard that remains cool even with the most happy of trigger fingers with negligible weight gain.""


I used this handguard for exactly 1 day. It works great, I just decided to go in a different direction. The handguard, barrel nut and lock ring are included in the sale.

Let me know if you have any questions.

This rifle was purchased some time ago by a friend who wanted to introduce me to Airsoft. While under enemy fire, we threw ourselves into a ditch for cover. Having not yet grown into full coordination of my limbs, I fell on the rifle, breaking the stock from the receiver. Disheartened, we did a thorough but messy JB Weld job to put it back together. It remains, to this day, functional, but has never seen action since. 

Now several years later, I have rediscovered it, although my Airsoft days are long behind me. As it is taking up space, I feel the best thing to do is get rid of it, although I don't want to throw it away - and I did spend money on it.  I've heavily discounted it for the damage, which is listed below:

- Stock broke off from the receiver and has been JB Welded back together. (This is the main issue). The fix appears solid and it can be cocked without issue.
- Due to the impromptu nature of the repair job, there are JB Weld smears around the stock and grip and part of the receiver.
- The tripod in the picture does not seem to want to stay on, but has never wanted to stay on in the first place.
- Pictures have been included that hopefully show the apperance.

This would make a good first airsoft rifle for someone young perhaps, or just getting into the game. As I am not familiar with the rules for selling airsoft weapons, I will treat it like an actual rifle - AZ ID required, over 18 only, and will ask if you are prohibited from possessing a weapon. If you have any questions or would like to inspect, please do not hesitate to contact me."

Product Description:
The HK45 Compact uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance. Using HK’s unique internal mechanical recoil reduction system reduces the recoil forces imparted to the weapon and shooter by as much as 30%, improving shooter control during rapid firing and increasing component service life.

Capable of firing standard .45 ACP ball through +P ammunition, the HK45 Compact has an 8-round magazine capacity but can also use 10-round magazines, including those designed for the full-size HK45. The HK45 combines the accuracy, modularity, reliability, and minimum 20,000 round service life of the renowned USP45 Compact with the improved ergonomics of the P2000 series pistols. HK45 Compacts can be also be fitted with threaded barrels for use with muzzle mounted sound suppressors. 

Each HK45 Compact comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter’s hand.

Both the HK45 Compact and full-size HK45 use an improved USP-style control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever. The control lever is frame mounted and is quickly accessible; it has a positive stop and returns to the “fire” position after decocking.

Also available is the Lee 125-RF flat nose. This bullet is for 38 or 357, but can also be sized down to .3565 for use in 9mm. This is also available in either alloy. http://www.titanreloading.com/image/cache/data/Products/90306-600x600.jpg

You may prefer the harder alloy for better penetration. It is needed in faster twist rifles like Marlin and Handi Rifles to maintain accuracy in the 1600-1800 fps range. It is also needed in 1 in 10"" fast twist 9mms. 

The only time we run harder bullets for pistols is in 9mm. This is because the common 1 in 10"" twist rate is too much for the softer bullets. 357 mag has a gentler twist rate of 1 in 16"" and the medium alloy works great there all the way to max loads. 10 BHN begins to mushroom at impact velocities of 1300 fps. In the slow twist ( 1 in 30"") of our Rossi rifles, 10 BHN shoots 2 MOA at 1800 FPS with Lil' Gun and expands to 55-60 cal in water all the way to 150 yards.

The included cantilever mount is good for a lower 1/3rd cowitness on an AR. The sight also features an ""auto on"" with movement/vibration.

The ALG Defense ALG Combat Trigger (ACT) is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the ACT is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however it is sharper and the grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the traditional reliability of a stock trigger remains.This is accomplished by polishing the sear surfaces smooth and HardLubing the trigger components. HardLubing is ALG’s term for electroless Nickel plating with an integral modifier to the base nickel plate. Either Boron or Teflon is used to enhance surface hardness, wear resistance and corrosion resistance and also create favorable tribological properties of the trigger components. Combined with the JP Yellow trigger springs. Trigger weight approx. 3 1/2 pounds.

I put this together to be a serious combat shotgun without a buncha dead weight you see on most (i.e. lasers, aluminum rail kits and side saddles).  Shotgun shoots and handles great; the 13 inch LOP stock is ideal for a squared up shooting stance and the action is silk.  I was at $375 but I've come down to $350 to move it a little quicker.  $350 is about what most similar model 500's go for, and this is a true 590.  Not interested in trades so please don't offer, I'm looking just for cash to fund another purchase."
