Its the brightest weapon light you have ever seen. Its mounted in one of Elzettas ZSM indestructible mounts with side rail. The laser system is a AIMSHOT LS8300. These are only sold to elite military forces on military po only no sales to the public or even law enforcement. You can call Jeff at AIMSHOT in Atlanta to verify this. This laser looks like something from a Pink Floyd concert. Its the brightest beam and dot you have ever seen day or night. I have come very close to getting in trouble with it here on the lake at night. You can follow the beam as far as your eyes can see at night and yes you will go to jail if caught with it. It was sent to me by a close friend who is a SFO in Afghanistan. It comes with 2 tail caps one click and one pressure and zero tool. This laser makes the rest of them like like they came from WAL MART! The only other one of these I have ever seen sold on GB a month ago for 859$  PLEASE NOTE I WILL NOT SEPERATE ANY PART OF THIS RIFLE BUT THANKS FOR ALL THE OFFERS AND IF YOU CAN DUPLICATE THIS ONE WITH ALL NEW INCLUDING THE LS8300 FOR 2200 YOU CAN COME AND GET THIS ONE FOR FREE PLUS A CASE OF YOUR FAVORITE BREW!!!

More than just another deer cartridge, the venerable .30-30 has been the king of deer calibers since the first rifle chambered in this ageless round was produced in 1894. In fact, it’s a safe bet that in the past century, no other round has put more antlers on the wall and venison in the freezer than the .30-30. So it only made sense that Henry, America’s most storied rifle maker, would produce a rifle chambered for this legendary caliber. This latest addition to our world-famous line of lever-action repeaters was built with the traditional deer hunter in mind. Like its predecessors, it’s both lightweight (just 7 to 8.3lbs.) and maneuverable (39″ long), – the perfect combination for hunting in dense timber and heavy brush.

Photo specimen is representative from a handful of virtually identical shotguns, all of them are within 5 percentage points on their finish grade, excellent condition. We can furnish photos of any exact specimen upon request. Dealers, law enforcement, and collectors may take any number of virtually identical shotguns we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no extra shipping charges. The Mossberg model 500 has never been as prestigious as the arch-competitor Remington 870, but it’s just as tried, and just as true. Here is a very attractive specimen from Mossberg’s model 500 Military & Police series. Manufacturer, of course, is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Model is 500, Persuader series; factory sku is 50411 or thereabouts. Type is pump or slide action shotgun. Construction is steel barrel and working parts all built into an alloy receiver that undercuts the 870 on weight, with durable synthetic stock and traditional synthetic forend. Finish is blued steel with semi gloss black anodized receiver. Trigger group housing is high impact black polymer, with .292 smooth faced combat trigger. Safety is top tang type. Barrel is 3 inch chambered 18 1/2 inch matte blue steel plain bead sight, with .730 vicinity Cylinder Bore muzzle. Magazine capacity is 5 rounds of 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 rounds of 3 inch shells, 5+1 capacity on 2 3/4 inch shells. Weight empty is 6 3/4 pounds, with center of gravity at the breech. Buttstock measures 13 7/8 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 7/8 inch black rubber factory recoil pad. Stock drop is 1 1/2 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt, with a right hand cant of about 3/4 inch. If this shotgun didn’t have a heat shield, we have added a trench type black polymer heat shield for the barrel, that will be obvious from the photos. This model 500 comes to us from Mossberg’s distribution system. It is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or a showgirl at a Firearms Industry trade show. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal on this shotgun, as its photos show. We rate it as Excellent, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Often a person can spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. This 500 Special Purpose comes in a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers. If this shotgun was test fired, it was fewer than 20 times.  Replacement pricing on mossberg com was well over $400 on this shotgun. We’re offering the Mossberg 500 in the photos, however, or one of its substantially identical mates, 		for only	$ 219.00.

It is out of my 1988 Jeep Cherokee, the old chain was making a lot of noise,
so we changed the chain, I still did not like the way it sounded while the
Jeep was on blocks, so we changed it out with another transfer case,
the other transfer case made the exact same noise while it was still on the blocks, but when we put the Jeep on the ground, it worked perfect, so this Transfer case should be OK. Everything inside the Transfer case looked good, and seemed to be fine.
This Transfer case has never leaked a drop of fluid since I have owned it(2004).
Tag on tansfer case says 231 AMC which is the same as the 231 J

Has a brand new chain in it with 0 miles on it.

By popular demand, Buffalo Bore is introducing five new 38 Super+P loads. With three different expanding loads and two penetrating loads, we have covered the basis of anything you'd like to accomplish with the 38 Super+P cartridge. These are full power 38 Super+P loads. All five of these loads feature flash suppressed powders so the shooter will not be blinded if firing in low light. Feeding, function and accuracy was very good in all three of our test pistols.

The color did not quite match the Magpul FDE shade, and I believe I also did not bake the Cerakote quite at long as it needed. The finish has deteriorated in several spots, and the effect is illustrated and displayed in the pictures below. I feel that the price reflects these aesthetic 'quirks'

This GB is in excellent ++ condition. Shoots very well with low recoil and great accuracy. Three 18rd magazines and everything that came in box. These guns are becoming more and more rare. Here's some info found I found on the web...

Type: Double Action
Chamber: 9x19mm Luger/Parabellum
Weight: 845 g empty; 1285 g loaed
Length: 216 mm
Barrel length: 136 mm
Capacity: 18 rounds


The development of the GB pistol was started by Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG (now Steyr-Mannliher AG), Austria, in the early 1970s, when the Austrian army announced its plans to replace aging P38s and High Powers with the new pistol. Original design, labelled as PI-18, was developed in 1974, and final version, called GB, entered production in 1981. The production of the GB was ceased circa 1988, after some 15.000 to 20.000 pistols had been produced.

The GB is a blowback-operated, gas-retarded blowback semi auto pistol. It uses some of the hot powder gases, feed from the barrel into the front part of the slide, to slow down the retraction of the slide before the bullet leave the barrel. This scheme was developed by German engineer Barnitzke at the end of the WW2. The gas brake is formed by the barrel, its bushing and the slide.

The trigger of the GB is of double action design, with the slide mounted decocker lever. GB also featured firing pin block that unlocks the firing pin only when the trigger is completely depressed.

The frame and the slide is made from carbon steel with special high-strength finish. Barrel has polygonal rifling and is chrome lined, and solidly attached to the frame.

The sights are fixed and featured white-dot inserts (one in the front sight blade and two - around the rear sights notch). Some early GBs were manufactured with steel grip panels, with all the rest manufactured with plastic checkered grips.

Thanks to its gas-retarded blowback design and solid weight, that resulted in low felt recoil, and to the barrel with polygonal rifling, that doesn't move when firing, the Steyr GB displayed very good accuracy. While the GB failed at the Austrian and USA Army pistol trials (won respectively by Glock 17 and Beretta 92FS-B), it was used by some Law Enforcement and Special Operations forces, and also was sold to civilians in Europe and USA."

*Chiappa M9-22
two magazines, case, cleaning rod - $229
Chiappa is an Italian firm that specializes in replica firearms. Founded in 1958 by Ezechile Chiappa, the name is now an umbrella for several brands, including Armi Sport and Kimar. Chiappa’s M9-22 is made under the Kimar brand, labeled Chiappa and distributed by the U.S. firm MKS Supply. Visually it’s a Beretta 92FS, but with changes necessary for it to function as a rimfire, and it comes at a cost of around $300. It’s available in a wood- or plastic-stocked Standard model, and the plastic-stocked Tactical model with Novak-style sights and a threaded barrel.

Both models exhibit the same profile, controls, and double-action/single-action trigger as the original, but use a frame cast from a zinc alloy the company refers to as Chiapp alloy. Both the process and material are sufficient for the lower pressures of the .22 Long Rifle cartridge. The gun’s 37-ounce weight is surprising, given its chambering. It’s not until wallets are weighed that the M9-22 regains its charm.

Chiappa calls its action a “fixed barrel blow-back” system. Its 51⁄8-inch barrel sleeve is cast as an integral part of the frame, complete with the feed ramp. A steel barrel insert is rifled with a 1:16-inch twist, and it’s fitted into the sleeve then secured with a set screw. The gun’s recoil spring guide rod looks rather fragile; it contains two holes in each end, the forward of which assists in assembly.

The Chiappa’s magazine release, slide release lever, decocker/manual safety, hammer, and take down lever all function like its center-fire brethren, except the decocker/manual safety and the sights are made of plastic rather than metal. Its 10-round magazine is made from plastic, save the spring, and weighs 1.5 ounces. We appreciated that it falls free of the magazine well when released.

The decocker/manual safety system is a proven one. Safely drop the hammer by rolling the ambidextrous decocking lever down. This movement disconnects and shields the firing pin by rolling it up and out of the path of the hammer. With the lever and therefore the hammer in the down position—the safe position—the trigger can still be pulled in double-action mode, thereby cocking and dropping the hammer, without the possibility of firing. If the gun is dropped accidentally, the firing pin block prevents it from reaching the primer unless the trigger is pulled. To fire, rotate the decocking/manual safety up, then either pull the trigger in double-action mode, or manually cock the hammer to fire the first round in single-action mode. Despite the decocker/safety being made of plastic, it functions fine.

It uses a reliable system that creates cocking leverage by pulling an external, sliding trigger bar that engages the hammer when the slide is installed. Trigger pressure cocks the hammer before pushing the sear disconnect forward to release it. The double-action trigger pull measured slightly more than 12 pounds—so stout some petite shooters couldn’t pull it. The trigger’s single-action pull weight measured 5 pounds, 8 ounces and had a slight bit of creep.

The steel extractor is mounted in the right side of the slide. The ejector is integral with the magazine; as the extractor pulls the case back the case rim scrapes by the magazine and ejects it. One big advantage of the open-slide design of the M9 is that jams or misfires—common to .22 Long Rifles—are reduced thanks to ample ejection port clearance. Jams that do occur are easily cleared.

The stocks are made of plastic or wood, although the wood panels make the gun’s grip 1/4 inch thicker than the plastic ones. It should be noted that this pistol’s grip frame is oversized already: The minimum measurement between the trigger and the backstrap is 2.92 inches.

At the range, the M9-22 demanded a break-in period of 200 rounds before it began to function reliably. Prior to that it would shoot, eject the spent case, send a fresh round into battery, but fail to re-cock the hammer. The frequency of the malfunction occurred less as the gun was fired, but it happened 34 times in 500 rounds. Low-recoiling Remington CBee rounds would not cycle, and it was very sensitive to hand pressure on the slide. After break-in, the M9-22 became pleasurable to shoot and  proved to be accurate.

Out of the box the Chiappa shot consistently high and left. Windage was adjusted by loosening a set screw on the rear sight before drifting. Elevation, however, must be zeroed by filing the fixed plastic front sight. Both are matte-black just like the rest of the firearm.

After shooting, the gun appeared as though it was much more harshly used than it had been, no thanks to its finish that scrapes away when making contact with harder surfaces. A line on the barrel was etched by the slide. Even given the pistol’s low price, Chiappa could do a better job in that regard.

Disassembly is trickier than with the original. With the takedown latch rotated and removed and the hammer hyperextended with the provided key, the slide can be pulled rearward and off the frame. During reassembly, use the key to pin the guide rod to the slide by inserting it in the guide rod’s forward hole. Then move the slide forward, taking the guide rod with it, exposing the hole in the frame to reinsert the takedown latch.

The M9-22 is an inexpensive firearm meant for low-cost fun and realistic practice—especially if you’re a fan of the Beretta.

The Benelli SuperSport is the ultimate in speed for shooters looking for a fast trap shotgun, competition shotgun, or sporting clays shotgun. The SuperSport's ComforTech recoil-dampening system allows the shooter to recover for the critical second shot up to 69% faster than with other comparable shotguns - that's fast! Couple the quick recovery speed with a ported barrel that keeps muzzle climb to a minimum, and it's doubly fast. The ComforTech system's special gel recoil pad and comb insert reduce felt recoil by up to 48% compared to the competition.

I have only fired 50 rounds through this gun and it shoots great and accurately, just like you would expect from a Glock. It just does not fit my hands very well. It comes with everything that you would expect from a new Glock, the factory box, 2 mags, cleaning brush, papers, and anything else you can think of with a new glock. Since it is new, everything has matching numbers. 

I am asking either $600 cash or trade for a Glock 21 Gen 3 that is either like new condition like mine, or new is preferred, we can work out something for any lesser conditions. All the factory stuff is preferred (matching box, at least 2 mags, etc.) but not necessary as long as you tell me what is missing and we can work something out. Be prepared to have pictures for trades. I will put priority on trades over cash when it comes down to it. Contact me by going though the contact seller button and I will answer in the order that it was received. If there are any questions or want additional pictures, do not hesitate to contact me. I will respond to all emails within 24hrs or less.

I have a valid driver's license and CPL, so I expect you to have them as well. I will not do business with anyone who does not have these two IDs. I will write down one of these and ask that you sign a private bill of sale for my records and my protection. Or you have the choice of doing a private transfer at a location that is most convient if you don't feel comfortable giving me those numbers. Again, this is for my protection as well yours

The Benelli SuperSport is the ultimate in speed for shooters looking for a fast trap shotgun, competition shotgun, or sporting clays shotgun. The SuperSport's ComforTech recoil-dampening system allows the shooter to recover for the critical second shot up to 69% faster than with other comparable shotguns - that's fast! Couple the quick recovery speed with a ported barrel that keeps muzzle climb to a minimum, and it's doubly fast. The ComforTech system's special gel recoil pad and comb insert reduce felt recoil by up to 48% compared to the competition.

The cylinder is mounted on a central axis and operated by a hand with a double finger whose more extended action allowed the cylinder-ratchet to be cut in a larger circle, giving more torsional force to the cylinder. This 1894-manufacutured SAA is a late black powder model with a Colt authentication letter included. The bore has some minor pitting, but otherwise it's in NRA Good condition.

The M2 Field is the workhorse of the Benelli semi-auto line. Light, nimble, but ruggedly built, the Benelli M2 is built around the ultra-reliable Inertia Driven bolt mechanism. The Inertia Driven system allows the M2 to digest nearly any 12-gauge cartridge, from 2 3/4 in. target loads to the heaviest 3 in. magnums. Benelli engineers have also adapted the ComforTech recoil system for the M2. This revolutionary system reduces felt recoil by up to 48%, and cuts muzzle climb by 15%. When combined, this puts the you back on target up to 69% faster than any other comparable semi-automatic shotgun. The M2 is not only faster, but with the new ComforTech system, it may be the most comfortable shotgun you ever will shoot. The M2 is a workhorse with the speed of a thoroughbred.

I have been finding steady stock of .22lr at Academy on 41st.  Im sure its the same at the other location, and other LGS.  I was able to pick up 1,000 rds of M-22 for about $53 last week, and another 525 brick of Federal this morning for $22.  If you do the math that is about .04 to .05 cpr.  I know the frustration of not being able to find .22lr the last year or so, but the more you cave in and buy them online for .08, .09, .10 cpr and in many cases twice that you are contributing to the a-holes that buy them at the prices I just mentioned who turn around and gouge everyone else.  Academy had at least 30 or more bricks this morning, and I've seen a fairly consistent stock over the last several weeks.  You still might need to get there close to open but you don't have to get there hours ahead of time.  I got there at 0745 this morning and they open at 8.  They still had plenty when I left.  Please help out all the true shooting enthusiasts and resist buy .22lr at prices over .05 to .07 for target rounds cpr because supply is copying back up.  If you stop buying from the gougers they will not be able to sell their stock and stop buying it up before you can at the store.  Also, I have been flagging ALL posts that are selling basic target 22's for anything over .08cpr due to being overpriced.  I don't care what you, as the seller, paid for them.  Just because you claim to have spent .10cpr doesn't make the value actually worth .10cpr.  You basically over paid yourself, and thats not my problem.  To all you arms list users, please help me by flagging blatant price gouging.  It's not hard to get great deals on ammo.

Rocky® C4T Military-Inspired Duty Boot is an extremely light performance boot  just 15 ounces  that's designed or rigorous work.

The boot's lightweight EVA/rubber outsole resists anything you can throw at it: slips, oils, heat, abrasions, chemicals and metal chips.

Helping you focus on your duty, these are water-resistant and fast-drying black boots. Ventilation holes on the outer sides promote breathability. You have work to do and can't be distracted by wet boots. The Rocky C4T keeps up.

These also are comfortable duty boots. The Rocky Air-PortTM Cushion Footbed is molded from durable PU that will never break down or lose its shape. The Air-Port Cushion Footbed circulates air with every step.

Something that may seem minor to others ""” lacing ""” is important when your day consists of tough duty. There's no time to waste and long-lasting laces are a must, so Rocky designed this military boot with speed eyelets and NATO hooks through which soldiers will pull their 550 cord laces.

These boots have af dual performance material upper with a polishable toe section.

The Rocky C4T allows you to move light-footed while providing outstanding support.

The scope actually came with a marlin 336w I bought at dick's, it's a Chinese made 3-9x40. Has decent glass and holds zero (although not yet zeroed to this rifle). 

There are two marks on the butt stock, a line on the left side, looks almost like a crack in then photo, but it's just a scratch (probably from previous owner pulling it out of the safe). There is also a round ding a couple inches in front of the bullseye on the bottom of the stock. The receiver also has 3 area where scratches were cold blued over making the bluing somewhat uneven. There is however, no rust or pitting anywhere on the rifle. The rifle is in excellent shape with clean bore and strong rifling. It has the red magazine follower for leverevolution ammo.

FROM THE MANUFACTURER:
Originally designed for the American market, the USP (Universal Self-loading Pistol) has found international acceptance as an accurate and ultra-reliable handgun. Features favored by U.S. law enforcement and military users provided much of the design criteria for the USP. The controls are uniquely American, influenced by such famous designs as the Government Model 1911 pistol. All USPs use a fiber-reinforced polymer frame stiffened by stainless steel inserts at areas subject to stress and friction. The USP control lever, a combination safety and decocking lever, is frame mounted and quickly accessible, unlike the slide-mounted safeties common on many semi-automatic pistols. Using a modified Browning-type action with a special patented recoil reduction system, the USP recoil reduction system reduces recoil effects on pistol components and also lowers the recoil forces felt by the shooter. This same recoil reduction system has been tested and proven in the HK Mark 23 pistol developed for the U.S. Special Operations Command. The USP recoil reduction system is insensitive to ammunition types and requires no special adjustment or maintenance. It functions effectively in all USP models.

Features:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Extended slide release
Patented Lock-Out Safety device

FROM THE MANUFACTURER:
The first of the many recent additions to the Heckler & Koch handgun line, the P2000 and incorporate features of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with the latest innovations of HK engineers. A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike. Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines.

MFG Description:
The most compact 9mm in the Sig Sauer product line, the P938 offers the
ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to
the P238 pistol. The single action only trigger coupled with full-size
Siglite Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet
is still easy to carry concealed. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938
easy for left- and right-handed shooters. With dimensions just slightly
larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs 6+1 9mm rounds (7+1 in
finger rest mags) into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked SAO
trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the
1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in
familiar places. The P938 comes in multiple finishes.

FROM THE MANUFACTURER: The P239® was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols.

FROM THE MANUFACTURER: The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights.  The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

A local gun shop states that the weapon is worth between $1,500 to $2,000 dollars.  The weapon comes with the lock, 1 magazine and an aftermarket case.

I will trade for a Kimber Ultra Raptor || or Tactical Kimber .45 with 3' barrel, or a colt defender!!!!
