It will take both .22 short and .22lr. It has some finish wear on the lever and around the front barrel band. It fires and extracts flawlessly, and is a very accurate little rifle. It has a Weaver B4 scope mounted on the side, and it really helps for plinking at longer ranges. The scope mount itself is missing two screws, but these should be fairly simple to replace. This would make a fantastic rifle for a new/younger shooter, helping them learn the basics.

I am unsure the exact age, but it is old enough that it does not have a serial number so that would be pre-1968. I have not fired this gun, I inherited it and I am selling it in the condition in which I received it. It comes apart fine, the hammer cocks back and releases when you pull the trigger, you can see the firing pin move forward when the hammer hits it, but the trigger seems to be lacking a return spring. I looked it up and the spring can be purchased for $2.90 at Numrich Gun parts (I will include the parts diagram and part number for the spring). It also has an ejector for the shell. Bead front sight. 28"" barrel. Everything appears to be original. Bore is bright and shiny, no pitting or rust inside the barrel.

I have no real reason to sell the firearm, but would like to up the caliber to a 45 ACP for a ""woods"" gun here in FL. I'm most interested in a gen 3 G30SF and Gen 4 G30 simply for the conversion capability to a 10mm. However, I also may be interested in a G30S, G36, or certain 1911 carry pistols in 45 ACP. Any cash offers are firm as I have over $850 wrapped up into this firearm. I do not expect to make my money back but I will not agree to low ball offers. Please let me know if interested.

The class is the NRA Basic Pistol / FL Concealed Weapons Permit class.  It covers safety, hands on classroom training, live fire training at the range, personal gun selection, cleaning/caring for a firearm and the laws/rules/procedures for the FL Concealed Weapons Permit. I also have a section of the class dedicated to personal defense with a firearm.  It is not necessary to own a firearm to attend the class as I have demo models.  If you own a firearm, I encourage you bring it to class so you can train with it.  We typically spend 3 to 3 1/2 hours in the classroom and about an hour on the range.  I hold the classes either at Homewood Suites Hotel Conference Room or Pensacola Indoor Shooting Range depending on availability.   My class is $85 per student and may be paid in cash, money order or local check.  Price includes class and all training materials.  Since we must complete live fire exercises there is an additional range fee of $15.  Additional charges apply if you wish to use a rental gun or purchase ammo.  Pensacola Indoor Shooting Range offers a large variety of rental guns if you wish to try out different models. Once you complete the class you will receive a certificate that satisfies the requirements for the FL CWP.  You then fill out an application, have your fingerprints and picture taken and submit the application.  The cost of the actual permit is $70 and the fingerprint / backround check is $42.  The permit is good for 7 years.

This shotgun is built on the famous AK-47 action that has been proven by years of very reliable combat action! The shotgun is used to deliver single shots. It is reloaded automatically due to the energy of powder combustion gases bled from the barrel bore through the barrel port. The shotgun may be equipped with a sight leaf adjustable for windage and elevation, which makes zeroing and firing at moving targets more convenient. The gas motive unit is adjustable to match the parameters of internal ballistics inherent to the standard cartridges and ""Magnum"" cartridges, as well."

The class is the NRA Basic Pistol / FL Concealed Weapons Permit class.  It covers safety, hands on classroom training, live fire training at the range, personal gun selection, cleaning/caring for a firearm and the laws/rules/procedures for the FL Concealed Weapons Permit. I also have a section of the class dedicated to personal defense with a firearm.  It is not necessary to own a firearm to attend the class as I have demo models.  If you own a firearm, I encourage you bring it to class so you can train with it.  We typically spend 3 to 3 1/2 hours in the classroom and about an hour on the range.  I hold the classes either at Homewood Suites Hotel Conference Room or Pensacola Indoor Shooting Range depending on availability.   My class is $85 per student and may be paid in cash, money order or local check.  Price includes class and all training materials.  Since we must complete live fire exercises there is an additional range fee of $15.  Additional charges apply if you wish to use a rental gun or purchase ammo.  Pensacola Indoor Shooting Range offers a large variety of rental guns if you wish to try out different models. Once you complete the class you will receive a certificate that satisfies the requirements for the FL CWP.  You then fill out an application, have your fingerprints and picture taken and submit the application.  The cost of the actual permit is $70 and the fingerprint / backround check is $42.  The permit is good for 7 years.

Here is a list of my current class schedule and registration link for them. You can register now and pay on the day of class.  There are additional classes in the future call or email for extended schedule.

I built this and find myself never shooting it.  I would like to see what I can trade or sell it for....the worse thing I can say is no.

It shows exterior wear to the finish from a holster but the inside is very clean; it functions perfectly.  All (Barrel, slide, and frame) matching serial numbers .  The manufacture date stamp on the slide is “HH” which makes the manufacture date 1977.  These guns were only imported for 3 years (as best I could research it) 1977-1980.  Additionally less than 3,000 of the BDA P220 9mm were imported to the US in the three year time period.   It has a euro style magazine release, a lanyard clip, and still has the original Browning grips.  It comes with one magazine.  

If you are looking for a 9mm to shoot and use this may not be for you, although there is absolutely nothing wrong with the gun.  It is very reliable and could be used or carried.  I would think someone interested in collecting older firearms would be more interested in this firearm as there were less the 3,000 imported and it was the first year Sig Sauer imported the automatic pistol under the partnership with Browning.

I am asking $900.00 or make me a reasonable offer.  Willing to ship through FFL buyer pays shipping.

I will require a legal FFL transfer to the buyer.  Please let me know if you have any questions."

I also replaced the plastic bolt shroud with a machined aluminum one and replaced the bolt with a custom large aluminum bolt so that it is easy to work in cold weather with gloves on. I have used this as a hunting rifle and it works great because of its light weight and accuracy. This would also work great as a bench rifle. This does not come with a scope but I will include a one piece scope mount made by DNZ. I did research and this was the best one that I could find for accuracy. It has been torqued down with a torque wrench and locked with loctite. This also comes with 1 accuracy international 5 round mag. Only selling because I am doing much more bow hunting and need to get rid of some of my gun collection. I am open to other trades in .308 caliber so let me know what you have.

After initial sighting in I put 5 rounds inside of 3/4 MOA circle.

I have put well over $1800 in the setup of this gun. The rifle alone goes for $750 stock with no scope. I am looking to get $900 but give me your best offer and I'll see if I can work with you."

Comes with box/papers/thumb saver magazine tool (steel)/ruger lock. Armordillo IWB kydex, 1.5"" belt loop. Could be easily changed. Two magazines (17 rd & 10 rd). The 10 round makes this 0.5"" smaller than a Glock 19, the 17 rounder makes it very nice for holding at the range. For those who don't like the idea of carrying ""Condition zero"", there is an ambi safety with a crisp and intuitive snap. Loaded chamber indicator with both color and tactile area on top of slide.

This is a fine weapon, and looks fantastic. It has a big toothy external extractor for exceptional reliability, and a very nice crisp trigger. I actually think this weapon has a nicer pull and feel than my Glock 19, but we all carry the same weapon in my family. I don't need a 4th compact 9mm, so I'm looking for a buyer (or maybe a trade).

Academy sells these for $460 locally w/o the XS sights. Bud's will sell it for $425 w/o the sights. Amazon wants $115 for the XS sights, and the spring kit is $40 w/o shipping. The Holster only has value if you like THAT particular holster, so I consider it a bonus."
