Description: The ALG Defense Advanced Combat Trigger (ACT) is designed for those shooters where tradition, value and regulatory concerns are of primary importance. The pull of the ACT is very similar to a standard mil-spec trigger, however it is sharper and the grittiness of the stock trigger pull has been removed while the traditional reliability of a stock trigger remains. The pull weight is not lower than the M4/M16 minimum weight specification of 5.5lbs.

Item Number: 05-199

Availability: Out of stock

Note: HardLubing is ALG's term for electroless Nickel plating with an integral modifier to the base nickel plate. Either Boron or Teflon is used to enhance surface hardness, wear resistance and corrosion resistance and also create favorable tribological properties of the trigger components. Testing has shown that differential coating of the trigger parts contributes to the sharpness of the ACT's single stage pull. The trigger component is plated with Nickel-Boron which has a high surface hardness combined with excellent wear resistance. The color is a pleasing matte light grey that may be painted on non-functional surfaces if the shooter so desires (such as the trigger bow that is visible outside the lower receiver). The hammer, disconnector and trigger/hammer pins are plated with Nickel-Teflon which combines a low coefficient of friction with good wear resistance. The Teflon impregnation colors the metal a mottled, greyish/green. Parts coated with Nickel-Teflon cannot be painted. Both coatings are highly corrosion resistant eliminating the oil seal of traditional phosphated firearm components.

1. Performance Advantages for the Shooter 
• The ALG Defense ACT trigger pull is smoother and sharper than a stock trigger. This is accomplished by polishing the sear surfaces smooth and HardLubing the trigger components. 
• Sear geometry has not been changed from the standard profile so the high reliability that the stock trigger is known for is unchanged. 
• Trigger and hammer are made from true 8620 alloy steel military specification castings, correctly carburized, quenched and tempered for high surface hardness. 
• Disconnector is 1070 High Carbon steel properly Austempered into the spring range of hardness. 
• Springs are corrosion resistant and meet military specifications. 
• A full force hammer spring is used for positive ignition of all type of ammunition. 
• Trigger and hammer pins are improved over stock mild steel by using 4140 Chrome-Moly steel that has been quenched and tempered. Pins are centerless ground to a fine finish and a diameter 0.001” larger than stock to reduce play in the trigger assembly while retaining a slip fit into the weapon lower receiver. Both pins are Nickel-Teflon coated. 
• Pull weight is above the U.S. Military minimum pull weight of 5.5lbs but does not reach near the upper limit of 9.5lbs. Generally, the pull weight is about 6.0lbs. 

2. Advantages for the Armorer 
• The ALG Defense ACT trigger is an enhanced standard trigger so maintenance and installation procedures are unchanged. 
• Trigger assembly parts may be interchanged between triggers, there are no matched sets.

Several types and configurations of this rifle can be found for sale (including pistols), but rarely in this condition and with the painted-wooden stock option. It also features a stamped-steel receiver like most of the bullpup rifles produced by Gwinn.

The stamped-steel upper receiver and aluminum billet lower receiver are in great condition, with a little sign of tarnish on the upper. The internals look clean, and the barrel bore is shiny and clean. Some scuff marks can be found here-and-there - most likely from display and use. Wood is also in excellent shape with little sign of wear or use - just a few scuffs here-and-there.

The side-cocking charging handle work smooth - but is a little wobbly. Probably designed that way to ensure it won't bind during recip.

A rarely seen, very early semi-automatic rifle from the mid 70’s. It’s chambered in 5.56mm/.223 and uses standard AR-15 magazines. It was sold under the name ""Assault Rifle"" which confused a lot of people. The Gwinn Arms Company of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, were in business from 1972 -1974 before Gwinn went bankrupt, and Quality Parts (reformed as Bushmaster ) bought them out. Mark Gwinn was the inventor of the original bushmaster rifle. Later Mack W. Gwinn JR Started the MGI - Mack Gwinn Industries (Modern manufacturer of quick change barrel system and other components for the AR-15).

It was sold under the name ""Assault Rifle"" which confused a lot of people. The Gwinn Arms Company of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, were in business from 1972 -1974 before Gwinn went bankrupt, and Quality Parts (reformed as Bushmaster ) bought them out. Mark Gwinn was the inventor of the original bushmaster rifle. Later Mack W. Gwinn JR Started the MGI - Mack Gwinn Industries (Modern manufacturer of quick change barrel system and other components for the AR-15).

The rifle has had some serious furniture upgrades, including:

- Standard M4 contoured barrel ($290)
- A VLTOR CASV fore-end with elevated uninterrupted rail ($220)
- A VLTOR gas block with integrated flip-up front sight; this can fold down to create a Picatinny rail on the gas block
- VLTOR flash-hider ($60)
- An ERGO contoured pistol grip ($45)
- Mag-Pul CTR stock ($45)
- The rear sight is a Yankee Hill (about $90)
- ADE laser light combo ($75)
- FAB Defense mag foregrip ($49)
- FAB Defense angled foregrip ($49)
- Tru Glo Red Dot sight (green and red) ($135)
- 1000 Rounds of .223 ($600+)
- 3 30 round PMAGS ($65) 

Even with all of these improvements, it is surprisingly light – and dead-on accurate. 

Just an FYI, I paid $1750 for this brand new without the upgrades. 
I'm asking $1750 OBO for everything, which is a steal for all upgrades and ammo.

The stamped-steel upper receiver and aluminum billet lower receiver are in great condition, with a little sign of tarnish on the upper. The internals look clean, and the barrel bore is shiny and clean. Some scuff marks can be found here-and-there - most likely from display and use. Wood is also in excellent shape with little sign of wear or use - just a few scuffs here-and-there.

The side-cocking charging handle work smooth - but is a little wobbly. Probably designed that way to ensure it won't bind during recip.

A rarely seen, very early semi-automatic rifle from the mid 70’s. It’s chambered in 5.56mm/.223 and uses standard AR-15 magazines. It was sold under the name ""Assault Rifle"" which confused a lot of people. The Gwinn Arms Company of Winston-Salem, North Carolina, were in business from 1972 -1974 before Gwinn went bankrupt, and Quality Parts (reformed as Bushmaster ) bought them out.

The stamped-steel upper receiver and aluminum billet lower receiver are in great condition, with a little sign of tarnish on the upper.

A rarely seen, very early semi-automatic rifle from the mid 70’s. It’s chambered in 5.56mm/.223 and uses standard AR-15 magazines.

386,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3887386,For Sale:  HEAVY 32 H&R MAG. +P  Ammo - 130 gr. Hard Cast Keith (1125fps) - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 23,"Listed On: Tuesday, January 6, 2015",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"https://www.extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=270






HEAVY 32 H&R MAG. +P  Ammo - 130 gr. Hard Cast Keith (1125fps) - 20 Round Box






This 32 H&R +P load is designed for those who need a very deep penetrating hard cast heavy load. This load should penetrate about three feet into flesh and bone. While we have not tried it, based on our knowledge of other like-designed revolver loads in 357, and 44, this bullet should easily penetrate a large bear’s skull. The bullet is 21-22 BHN and is properly lubed and will not substantially lead foul barrels.

We are using a flash retarded powder so that the shooter will not be blinded by his/her own gunfire in low light situations.

See our below velocities fired from real world, over-the-counter revolvers. We do not use long laboratory barrels to establish our published velocities as this will produce unrealistically fast velocities and will not tell the customer what his/her gun is producing in the real world where it matters.

1164 fps - USFA Sparrow Hawk 7.5 inch
1139 fps - Ruger Black Hawk 5.5 inch
1133 fps - Ruger SP101 3 inch
You’ll note the absence of the Taurus Titanium 2 inch revolver we referenced in the press release of our 100gr. JHP 32 H&R +P load. (ITEM 36A) We elected to remove the Taurus data from this press release as not only did we have to polish the tool marks out of the Taurus chambers to get smooth extraction as we mentioned in the item 36A press release, but our particular Taurus would “key hole” cast bullets. We did not experience this with any other test guns, including many that are not referenced here. Only the Taurus would not shoot hard cast bullets well and only the Taurus gave sticky extraction of fired cases, unless we polished the chambers. We experienced no issues of ANY sort with ANY of our other test guns.

This load is safe for use in all 32 H&R Mag. and 327 Federal firearms, except for, as of this writing, (05-17-11) the long out-of-production H&R revolvers. Do not use ANY+P ammunition in the original H&R revolvers."

Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Here are genuine CZ, Czeska Zbrojovka, factory magazines for the CZ52 pistols that are abundant throughout the Country and throughout the world. Manufacturer is the CZ parent factory that makes all CZ’s firearms, in Strakonice, Czech Republic. These were not imported through CZ USA. Construction is entirely blue steel, from the bottom of the CZ mfg marked floor plate to the stepped cartridge follower. Body sides are ported for round count, as the photos show. Each magazine holds 8 rounds of 7.62x25 ammunition, a caliber we know and respect as the 32 Tokarev caliber. These magazines come to us well preserved and packed in grease, all brand new and unissued. Each magazine comes to us wrapped in its individual plastic bag, sealed in lots of 10 and shipped in cases of 250 magazines. These magazines fit only CZ52 Pistols chambered in 7.62x25 caliber. They will not fit the Yugoslavian Zastava M57 Pistols; will not fit the Polish Radom TT-30; will not fit .32 ACP caliber CZ pistols; will not fit the trunk key hole on a 1953 Nash Metropolitan Convertible. They will only fit CZ52 pistols like the one we had last year showing, or partially showing, in some of our photos. All magazines for these fine pistols are in short supply; especially factory CZ mags like these. We only have a small lot of these, fewer than 1000 on hand at press time, and this is a one-time deal. Our friends in New York charge over $50 apiece for these magazines, and they’re sold out. Our single magazine price is $29 per.

Model 45's were used by the French military for weapons training. This rifle is chambered in .22 Long Rifle and utilizes a very robust Mauser-type action that is similar to that used on the German KKW trainers. Per the norm of military trainers, this rifle is ""over built"", meaning it is extremely well built and unlike modern .22 rifles manufactured today. Model 45's are known for their accuracy, which I can attest to as I have fired about 50 rounds out of this rifle. This specimen is in excellent condition (beautiful wood and original parkerization) and complete with a correct leather sling, the correct front sight hood (which is almost always missing on Mod. 45s), correct metal butt plate marked (""MAS""), and three five-round detachable magazines (each marked Mod. 45).

I have about 200rds through it and it is easily able to hold 1/2MOA groups at 100yds with my set up. I have a 2nd stock with it that I added weight to to reduce felt recoil for bench shooting/long range shooting. The camo patterned stock(with action in and unloaded) weighs 10bs while the heavier black stock with the action mounted weighs in at 16.4lbs.

The gun itself is guaranteed by Ruger to hold 1MOA groups at 100yds and has an integral bedding system in the stocks, which makes switching it between the heavy and lighter stock easy and keeps the points of impact the same between the two stocks everytime. The barrel is floated with a 1/10 twist rate at 22"" long.

Here is the breakdown of upgrades:
-extended bolt handle(have the stock one as well)
-2nd stock
-spring loaded bipod

Impressed with the reliability and accuracy of the Astra 400 largo pistols supplied by Astra in WW2 the Third Reich asked Astra to design a similar pistol in 9mm luger. The Astra 600 was the result. About 10,000 were delivered then the supply lines were cut as the war turned. The West German police later bought most of the stock, based on the great quality of the pistols. See wikipedia.com for more.

The date code on this gun is P which indicates it was made in 1945, but the serial number is in the 52000 range, so it was probably in the batch that was ordered but never got delivered to the Nazis.

This is as nice as a 600 as you're likely to find, especially at this price. I can accept a current C&R or we will have to conduct the sale at a local FFL to enact the transfer legally. DO NOT ASK ME TO SKIRT THE LAW. IT WON'T HAPPEN.

BONUS: If I sell this by January 12th I'll throw in an EXTRA MAGAZINE."

This is a barely used Advantage Arms 1911 .22 LR TARGET Conversion kit in excellent condition, with original box plus many extras. The Kit costs $350 through Advantage Arms website, but they are out of stock. This kit comes with both the standard 1911 sight rail and the target version scope mount rail (a $60 value! great for using a scope or red dot sight). See pictures for condition, these are pictures of the actual kit and extra accessories. Also includes original unused magazine plus an extra new GSG magazine ($45 value). Also includes a extra recoil spring for firing lower velocity ammo, and an extra pair of sight screws ($10 value). That's over a $460 value for $345 OBO - Less than the cost of the kit alone if ordered elsewhere.
The installation procedure takes 30 seconds, plus you can save 35 ¢ on each round fired. Just think, you will pay for your conversion kit after firing just a few bricks of .22LR ammo.
This kit comes with both the standard sight rail and target scope mount rail version. The 1911 Target Conversion Kit is our most accurate conversion kit. The barrel is fixed solid to the frame with the sights mounted to the barrel. Accuracy is not affected by the movement of the slide, and is super accurate with a red dot or small scope.
EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF the 1911 TARGET CONVERSION KIT
1 ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
Target models use Champion adjustable sights. 
2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique magazine design and patented heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR conversion kits.
3. FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 4140 steel.
4. THE 30 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your 1911 pistol. Simply remove the 1911 magazine and slide as outlined in your 1911 owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, insert the slide stop pin and tighten guide rod. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.
This procedure can be accomplished in less than 30 seconds with some practice.
COMPATIBILITY OF OUR 1911 CONVERSION KITS
Our 1911 .22LR Conversion kit is designed to fit any full size 1911-A1 frame made to U.S. government msil-specs. I used this kit with my Sig Sauer Tacops 1911, and it's a tack driver using CCI Mini Mags .22 ammo. This is a great way to get trigger time on your 1911 with much cheaper ammo. Highly recommend Remington ""Golden Bullets"" for everyday plinking and CCI MiniMags or Federal Automatch for better accuracy. I accept payment through PayPal to: REDACTED. Thanks"

I bought this around July to hunt Pennsylvania this past gun season. I didn’t get to shoot anything with it but was still nice to carry a handgun in the holster up a mountain instead of dragging a rifle through the woods. Anyway, My buddy and I decided we are not going to hunt PA anymore because we joined hunting club here in NJ instead. So I will not have the need for this anymore because handgun hunting is not allowed in NJ. 

I would say the round count through this gun is probably about 40 to 50 rounds. I reload and my buddy has the same gun so I basically knew where to start with the load.  I use a 200gr bullet with 20.2gr of H110 and he uses 22.4 gr. My Load is very accurate and easy to handle but still very fast. I was only looking to shoot 50 yards at the most in the woods so I didn’t need a bullet with crazy speeds.

SO what I have for you is: the gun, scope, rings, mount, the case in the picture, the original box and hammer security keys. I also have an adjustable shoulder holster too.

Everything cost me about $925   make me an offer??"
