The Px4 is built around a modular concept so these pistols can be adapted
to different needs. The Px4 features an exclusive, Beretta-designed locked
breech with rotating barrel system, reducing felt recoil and muzzle rise.
Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance, as well as ease
of cleaning and feature a deeply recessed combat muzzle crown to protect
the rifling. The light frame employs a durable fiberglass-reinforced
polymer with a milstd-1913 picatinny rail and a modular grip system for a
custom fit. The manual lever safety and slide stop lever are both
ambidextrous while the magazine release button is reversible. The Bruniton
non-reflective black coating is offer superior resistance against corrosion
and wear.

Chambered in 7.62x39. Original (Zastava military factory) Yugo hammer-forged barrel and receiver; in other words, the desirable AK heavy barrel and thicker, heavy duty RPK-style receiver with reinforced trunnion. Nice M70 wood furniture with the desirable Serbian crest (only a fraction of OPAPs came with this nicely done coat-of-arms). Side optics rail. Sights are straight, bore and bolt face are pristine, and everything is tight, as expected for a brand new, unfired rifle.

Comes with two (2) Euro 30-round steel magazines, box, and papers. 

If you are looking for a well-built, rugged, good-looking AK, this is it! Perfect for shooting or showing off. Even has something for investors, as this M70 rifle is a limited Zastava factory production run from NOS parts, and is expected to increase in value comparable to other original factory barreled and receiver AK rifles that are no longer imported. 

Asking $790 cash FTF. Firm.

You can still buy these at Atlantic Firearms for $759 shipped (plus whatever you pay for transfers), see https://www.atlanticfirearms.com/component/virtuemart/shipping-rifles/zastava-ak-47-m70-pap-7-62x39-rifle-detail.html?Itemid=0, but once their stock runs out, these Yugo O-PAP rifles will only be available on the secondary market and prices will start to increase. Or you can buy this one, unfired, with a crest, and an in-person inspection.

Don't miss this opportunity to own this classic and iconic AK rifle! Whether you are a new owner and want a top-quality rifle for your first AK or a long-time collector looking to fill a hole in your AK collection, this rifle has something for you.

I live in Birmingham, but travel to Huntsville and Mobile regularly. I can provide proof (e.g. pistol permit) that I am a good guy and as many references as you need from recent firearms transactions. Deal with confidence. I won't waste your time, please don't waste mine."

It is a great shooter with a smooth action and excellent accuracy!  The dept only issued the Beretta's for a few years before changing to glock, so it still has a lifetime of use left in it. Because it was a police weapon it does have the Teflon coated slide and receiver for smooth fast action along with all moving internal parts of the weapon  being Teflon coated.  It also has night sights and an upgraded trigger for easier single action trigger pull.  Weapon has been decommissioned by the Police Dept so it is legal to own.

This rifle was purchased new in 1984 prior to the import bans, and these AKs from Norinco are considered to be some of the best made.  This is a full numbers-matching rifle, and additional pictures can be provided if needed.  The furniture is the stock reddish/brown phenolic ""bakelite"" material, and is fitted with the stock slant muzzle break.  I also have the stock cleaning kit for the buttstock, original nylon/leather sling, and the matching bakelite bayonet.  The tube insert in the stock for the cleaning kit is cracked, so the kit would rattle inside, but the spring hinged buttplate and compartment are still fully functional.  The barrel is still in great condition, and the rifle is still fully functional and ready to shoot or just be a collectible safe queen.

I am also including eight (8) 30-round magazines (all steel mags), an AK47 manual, an M16-style muzzle break, and a soft rifle case.

This is a rare piece, and is a very early import as it was manufactured before Norinco began stamping their logo and the model type onto the receiver.  This also features the ""S"" and ""C"" markings for the safety selector instead of the later ""S"" and ""F"" markings.  These are a great piece of history and will be rock solid for years to come.

Asking $1,650 for everything OBO, not looking for trades and will not split up the rifle and accessories.

FTF or local FFL if you would like, cash sale only, must have a valid Texas DL or CHL, must legally be able to own this rifle, and must be willing to completely fill out a firearms bill of sale.

4"" barrel
Being a 28-3 makes it a rarer bird since they weren't making as many of these in the 1980's.  In fact it's toward the end of the production run of these.  I think this was made in 1985 or so.
Adjustable rear sight.
Finish is good but has some honest holster wear.  It does not have any markings on it but I think it was either a police officer or security gun.  The wear is consistent with something that spent a lot of time in a holster.  Mechanically it is perfect.  Locks up tight.  Shoots straight and every time.
Being an N frame this thing will make light .38 Special loads seem like you're shooting .22LR while it will also handle 180gr Buffalo Bore .357 Magnum heavy hitters.  You'll break before the gun does.
The action is nice and smooth and breaks cleanly.  Nice and worn in from a gun that has seen use and care over it's life.

Included with it is it's original small Magna grips, a set of the bigger S&W Combat grips, and a set of Pachmayr Presentation grips.  The Combat grips go for over $75 each when you can find them.  These are a bit used but they match the gun nicely and fill the hand much better than the Magnas.  The Pachmayr grips reduce the felt recoil nicely but aren't as visually appealing.

Honestly, I don't want to sell it.  It's a neat gun.  It's useful and it's also a rarer gun.  I've gotten the big Combat grips and I like it with them.  However unfortunately I have some other pressing needs.
That said I won't consider low ball offers.  Find a gun like this with all the extras for anywhere near my asking price.  Bet it's not a -3 either.  I've done a few searches and haven't found any -3's up for sale anywhere.

$550 Or Best (Reasonable) Offer - cash only.  Gun is in the Paducah (Western Kentucky) area.  Face to face with a legal KY resident with a Driver's License or CCDW card.  You must be legally able to possess firearms.

Thank you."

Hold the PX4 Storm Compact and you'll immediately realize that this handgun can do it all. Perfectly sized and balanced, it is equally suited for concealed carry, home- or personal defense as well as recreational shooting. With its full grip, full-capacity magazine, accessory rail and interchangeable backstraps, you will get a further sense of its versatility. But it is at the shooting range that this double/single-action compact handgun will truly wow you: thanks to its rotary barrel system, recoil dissipates radially, resulting in much less thump in your hand and super-fast follow-up shots

It is engineered to be absolutely reliable and ultra-durable, and it is capable of shooting well over 100,000 rounds without any part breakage. And its dimensions that fall right in between the full-size PX4 Storm and its sub-compact counterpart make it perfect for everyday holster carry (concealed or open), offering light weight and smaller proportions while still affording a full grip.

 In a holster or purse, an automatic firing-pin block and a manual safety enable you to confidently carry it all day--day after day, without any worries. Furthermore, it is easy to use and take apart for cleaning, and its tough Bruniton finish make it even more trouble-free to maintain. In short, the PX4 Storm Compact will give you years and years--and thousands upon thousands of rounds--of reliable service, accuracy and safety for personal or home defense.

Here is a delightful reincarnation of the fabled Winchester 1892 Trapper, an R92 Lever Action chambered in .45 Colt Caliber, manufactured in Brazil by Rossi and imported by Braztech, a wing of Taurus International in Miami. We have sold these fine little rifles for four decades now, first Interarms import, and now Braztech. Its only departure from the classic 1892 design is a hammer block safety, mounted unobtrusively on top of the bolt just forward of the hammer, and the Taurus key system lock on the back of the hammer. Metal is entirely blue steel, and the stock and forend are walnut finished Brazilian hardwood. Buttplate is blue steel as well. Weight is a well balanced 6 pounds empty. Barrel is 16 inches long, and capacity is 8 + 1 rounds of .45 Colt ammunition. Buyer will receive the Carbine in the photo or one of its identical mates. Replacement price on these is upwards of $600 in our area. We're offering this Rossi 92 trapper Carbine, however, for only $ 539.00. 2% discount if payment is with USPS Money Order & not credit card.

This is a Smith & Wesson M&P 15T that I bought a little over a year ago, I've only put about 200 rounds through it, and thoroughly cleaned it after each use. These are a few of the main specs: 16"" 5.56 NATO Melonite treated barrel with a 1/8 5R twist rate, Chrome bolt carrier and gas key, 10"" anti-twist free floating quad rail, M4 feed ramps, 7075 T6 aluminum receiver.

Included in the price are the following: 7 PMags (6-30 round and 1-40 round, both a Magpul CTR and a Blackhawk Knoxx buttstock, Magpul front and rear BUIS, Magpul RSA (rail sling attachment), Magpul vertical foregrip,  4 sets of Magpul XTM rail covers (1 each in Black, FDE, OD Green and Foliage), Troy rail covers in black (Enough to cover the whole quad rail), Blackhawk tactical rifle bag, Blackhawk Ergo pistol grip, Blackhawk riser mount, rail mouted bipod, Leapers 3-9x40 scope with red/green illuminated reticle, Trudot 1x red/green dot scope and a KinetiTech fake silencer.

Also included in the price are about 450 rounds of assorted 5.56 and .223 ammo (including roughly 60 Hollowpoints and over 100 green tip steel core ""penetrators"") 

I am certainly willing to negotiate price, however, this is all being sold as a package. So don't ask me to remove certain accessories in order to reduce the price. Feel free to offer trades but the total value of the trade needs to equal the asking price.
I'm particularly interested in tactical shotguns like a Mossberg 500/590 or Remington 870 (home defense style, not hunting)

The Optimized Duty Sight (ODS) was made for those professionals whose lives depend on their weapons. The ODS was designed by Special Forces veterans with years of counter terrorism combat experience and extensive experience training Special Operators in counter terrorism operations at the most elite schools in the Special Operations Community.

The ODS was designed to take advantage of the inborn hardwiring of our brains to instinctively find symmetry. These sights have three vertical and three horizontal alignment features that the eye automatically lines up while the operator is presenting the weapon to the target (see picture). This 3X3 alignment design allows for the most rapid sight alignment of any iron sights on the market. The Optimized Duty Sight was also designed to quickly give the operator a more refined sight picture (relation of the sights on the target) by the narrow profile front sight and the angled facets cut into the rear sight. These features enable the operator to see more of the target thru the sights while maintaining sight alignment thru the engagement.

The luminous lines on the rear sight and the Tritium dot and luminous vertical line on the front sight allow for precise sight alignment in low light environments. All of these unique design features on the ODS facilitate faster target acquisition, quicker sight alignment, a more refined sight picture, and ultimately more timely and accurate fire on target. In addition to the novel sighting system of the ODS, the external construction of the ODS were specifically engineered for the eventuality of clearing or charging the pistol during one hand operations. The reverse slope of both the front and rear sight can be used to bite into clothing, belt, steering wheel, or virtually any edge to facilitate racking the slide."

Perfect for home defense and a deer slayer. Chambered for 2 3/4 and 3"" shells. $300 cash $350 trade

 Next up is my stainless Taurus circuit Judge. According to the taurus web site this is no longer offered as a Taurus only available under the sister company Rossi. This one is stamped Taurus. Has both chokes, choke wrench, lock key, everything but the original box. It does show some handling wear but locks up nice and tight with a brite and sharp bore. I really like this gun and hate to see it go but I got the bug to start a new project so something has to go to fund it. Chambered for .45LC and 2 1/2 or 3"" .410 shells. The rossi web site lists MSRP as $715 and some change, I'll let this go for $500 cash $600 in trade.

 As stated in the head line I do also have some cash to boot. My prices are fair and firm so low balling or whining will just get you ignored. All reasonable people will receive a response even if it's a no thank you."

12 Gauge Bore snake: ~$17
Mixed 12 gauge ammo (mostly target load, but there is a box of slugs as well): $25

All of the above items were bought over time and add up to ~ $658 invested into this gun. I used it to plink and as a home defense piece and have treated it very well. 

I am willing to work with the price a bit, just shoot me an offer. The worst I will say is ""no thanks"". If you have any questions, shoot me an email.

UPDATE: The Mossberg 500 fixed stock has sold. I lowered the price accordingly, however, I am still willing to negotiate a price."

717,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3118717,For Sale/Trade:  2 gun display cases / cabinets - Until Tuesday Only!,"Brookfield, Milwaukee, Wisconsin",$ 0,"Listed On: Friday, September 26, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"*Must get rid of by Tuesday!*

I have two display cases, one is a corner wall unit, the other is more of a traditional floor display case.  Both are in good structural shape, but both could use a new set of paint.

The corner cabinet has a display section with glass doors and 3 glass shelves, and a lower cabinet with one shelf with a pull-out drawer in between the two sections..  All shelves are adjustable.  It also features a built-in fluorescent light, switch, and plug to show off whatever you have inside.  Everything was removed to make it easier to transport, but it includes all the screws and shelving brackets, including the two bolts to mount it to the wall.  Everything works fine, and would be great for showing off your handguns, or you could leave the glass shelves out and install racks on the sides for rifles. The cabinet and drawer is perfect for ammo, range bags, etc.
Approximate measurements are: 27 5/8 each wall, approx 41 1/4 across face, 81"" to peak

The other display case has a glass top and front, like you'd see in a store. I glued down some American flag motif material on the bottom of the case. Two shelves in the back. This doesn't include any doors, although there's tracks for sliding doors across the back of the glass portion if you want to buy or make some.  It easily fits 2 rifles or shotguns with accessories or some handguns, but the uses are endless.
Approximate dimensions: 71 1/4"" long x 15"" deep x 32"" high

Looking to get rid of one or both.  You haul or I can deliver them to your curb for a little extra cash to cover my gas and time, or I might include it depending on the deal we work out."

Most of the parts are from my Rock River Arms AR15 that I have replaced over time. The parts include.

- Matrix Aerospace lower receiver (they mill lowers and uppers for Ruger's SR556, http://www.matrixaero.com) 
- Palmetto State Armory upper receiver
- CMMG bolt carrier group
- 16"" barrel 223/5.56 Wylde chamber with a 1:9 twist and parkerized
Everything else: pistol grip, hand guards, trigger, buttock etc. are off my rock river rifle.

Included: red/green dot sight with four reticle options and levels of illumination, original case included. Additionally there are flip up iron sights both on the front and back. Also it comes with a 120 lumen tactical light with an additional pressure switch. The light has a rail on the bottom of it if you wanted to add a laser. Lastly, it has a single point sling adapter on it and comes with a single point sling that is black and part elastic for comfort. 

This rifle is a great deal. I built it to be a home defense weapon with top of the line parts and am selling it for what I have in it. I wanted to get some practice gun smithing but instead opted to watch the gunsmith assemble it so I can try on my next rifle. So this rifle is professionally assembled and tested. 

I will ship as long as buyer covers the cost. $50 = ($30 shipping + $20 FFL fee on my end)

Features: 
Bushnell Elite 3200 Rifle Scopes feature resettable fingertip adjustments for windage and elevation with repeatable audible clicks. They also feature 1-piece hammer forged aluminum titanium alloy tubes and multi-coated lenses that have been treated with Bushnell's Rainguard coating. This scope features 1/10 milliradian (MIL) windage and elevation turrets and a Mil-dot reticle; this is also known as MIL/MIL. The combination of these two features enables the shooter to make quick and precise corrections. By using the Mil-dot reticle to measure how far off the shot is in MILs, each dot is 1 MIL apart, the shooter does not need to convert milliradians to minutes of angle in order to correct the point of aim. With traditional 1/4 MOA turrets, if the point of impact is measured to be 1.5 MILs low the shooter needs to convert the MILs to MOA and then adjust the turrets which can be confusing. With a MIL/MIL rifle scope if the shot is 1.5 mils low then the shooter simply turns the turret 1.5 mils or 15 clicks. The mil-dot reticle can also be used to determine how far away an object of known size is. These features are usually only found in very expensive scopes, but MidwayUSA has worked with Bushnell to bring you this exclusive high quality rifle scope at a very reasonable price. Bushnell Elite 3200 Rifle Scopes are waterproof, fogproof and shockproof and covered by the Bushnell limited lifetime warranty.

Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun."

The rifle barrel is in good shape with good rifling. The serial # is 200XX and are all matching, and according to my research date this gun to 1930-31 but please do your own research. Other markings on the barrels include Krupp-Lauf, SUHL, Nitro, 64mm 58-1/2 2/29, 16 16/1, St.m.G emil kerner senior suhl.

 Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun."

MAG5-60
The SureFire high-capacity magazine for 5.56x45 mm (.223 Remington) ammunition, also available in a 100-round version, is compatible with M4/M16/AR-15 variants and other firearms that accept standard STANAG 4179 magazines. Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

The Midwest Industries AK SS Extended Handguard has been installed, allowing the operator to place their hand farther forward towards the muzzle in the more modern shooting technique, as well as keeping vertical foregrips or AFGs out of the way during mag changes. It is also advantageous if you are mounting a weaponlight, as it reduces the ""shadow"" of the front sight post. The handguard comes with several rail sections that are fully modular, allowing you to place rails where you need them, leaving the rest of the handguard very streamlined. The gas tube cover is railed to accept red dot sights or scout scopes.

Other enhancements are the Magpul MOE AK grip, ambidextrous single point sling mount plate(located between the grip and the receiver), bird cage muzzle brake and the collapsible stock tube and Magpul MOE stock. Fully collapsed, the stock is shorter than the original LOP, and the ability to extend it makes shooting a breeze for us larger statured Americans.

Also included are the original wood furniture, nine 30 round magazines and MOLLE magazine pouch. I'll also throw in 100 rounds of ammo!

This is an outstanding weapons system, giving you the versatility of many AR15 features with the hard hitting 7.62x39 round and legendary AKM reliability.

All told there is over 1200 invested in this platform. Price is $850 with everything included. I realize the price on AKs is going down, but keep in mind I've cut the cost of every enhancement and accessory in half so it's not like I'm trying to gouge anyone here. Feel free to make an offer, but ridiculous low ball offers will not be entertained. Please do your research, and you'll see you are getting an incredible deal on this package. Potential trade interests are listed below. 

***I am only looking for the trades specified. I don't have a need for hunting rifles, shotguns, .22s, or blackpowder weapons. While I appreciate the interest, items such as these have no role to serve for me. Thanks!***

-357 Revolver
-6"" Or Longer Barrel Preferred 
-Ruger GP100 would be ideal, would consider other makes/models but no cheap junk
-Not looking for anything with a shaved/bobbed hammer

Now heres a little about me... I have no criminal convictions of any kind and am willing to sigh a bill of sale assuming that you, the seller will as well. I have my own place, my own company, etc and Im not a ""gangbanger"". Just a 2A enthusiast. 

Im also 20... The ""You have to be 21 to buy a handgun"" rule which weve all heard applies only to FFLs/dealers. Its left up to the states to decide the age limit for handgun ownership for residents of that state. 

Many states, Texas included, make no additional restrictions for handguns, thus they have the same age limit as long guns. 

If my age bothers you, please dont contact me. Otherwise, I have cash, texas DL, and will sign a bill of sale and I'd love to hear from you. 

Thanks for your time."

I've got one 1953 No 4 Mk I in good shootable condition, one barreled action No 4 Mk 1 1/2 1958, and sporterized No 4 Mk I 1943. I can't see where it's made, but I'm sure it's British. The Rifle is 1953 RFI from Ishapore. The barreled action is 1958 RFI from Ishapore also.   The 1943 is mainly just a parts gun. The receiver is rough and the barrel is black. The other two bores are clean and bright. The No 1 1/2 has the trigger incorporated into the receiver but has a bent firing pin. It's the nicest receiver and could be turned into a really nice rifle. 

I also have a box of spare wood pieces. A bunch of handguards, some new, and two butt stocks. I also have a small box of extra metal parts and a set of go - no go gauges. All goes for $350 or I'll sell just the good rifle for $250.     Waxahachie area. Text REDACTED   I can email other pics if interested."

 Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun."
