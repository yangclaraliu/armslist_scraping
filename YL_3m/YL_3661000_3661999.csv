2 months ago I bought 2 matching Black Rain AR's for me and my wife (cute I know, but hey, she let me ;) 
These are AMAZING rifles but they are just a bit to heavy for my wife, so I'm going a different way for her and have also decided to build something else special/custom for myself. My lose your gain of a sweet rifle! 


Each have about 75 ish or less rounds though them, basically just broke in the barrels, then 1 or 2 mags.

They have the fallowing:

- CNC Billet recievers 
- Nickel Boron coated Bolt Carrier groups
- 1-8 twist, .223 Wyled chambers (take both 5.56 & .223 but more accurate) 16"" Stainless     Steel, fluted barrel
- 7"" super light quadrail
- KNS Anti walk trigger pins
- Magpul MOE grip & Stock
- Magpul ASAP Sling mount
- Oversize charging handle latch
- Black Rain's signature crazy looking Pineapple muzzle

These are expensive rifles, as seen here, http://www.blackrainordnance.com/bro-pg5/

I'm letting them go cheap hoping to get on to my new projects soon ;)

It was racked and never issued, the gun later converted to M4 and the upper surplussed.  It is complete all the way through with the correct A.O. Toolcraft bcg, FN chromed-lined, hammer forged 1/9 barrel, etc.   It has rack wear but it barely used and perhaps not fired other than initial testing. 

It has a PSA lower that has been modified to give a partial-fence early A1 lower look, and PSA logo and model removed (legal information - maker, location, s/n remain of course).  It has been refinished in Dark Parkerizing grey and is close to the Colt M-16 grey.  AR fire control group, of course.  The lower was given some after-finish aging to give an early Viet Nam era look.  The furniture is an early-vietnam era M16a1 stock that has been carefully refinished and in excellent condition.  The magazine is a Viet Nam era Simmonds 20rd. with original finish.  The USAF actually issued guns like this - updates of their earlier XM16e1 models updated with an A2 upper.  So that was the theme.

Hate to sell but need the money.  Can ship in-state if needed, otherwise ftf with 18+ year old non-felonious WA resident.

A successor to the top-selling Ruger Mark II, the Mark III is a .22 semi auto pistol that's excellent for sport shooting and hunting due to its proven design and reliability. Also, its rugged frame and tapered bolt ears allow for easy handling in almost any environment and exceptional accuracy.

This pistol is the target edition of Ruger's Mark III, it has the blued finish, all metal frame (not the cheap new polymer frame), scope mounting rail/frame, checkered metal grips, a loaded-chamber indicator, and many more features. Some specs include a 5.5 inch barrel, bull barrel, adjustable rear sights, etc (if interested in more details, specs sheets are readily available online). This gun in particular is used but in excellent condition. If I were to rate it from 1-10 in terms of condition (10 being brand new) this gun would easily rate at 9!(and only because its not brand new!) Does not have a scratch on it! It has seen less than 50 rounds. I'm only selling it because I don't give it the use it deserves. The gun includes two 10 round magazines, a plastic case, user manual, and a custom made wooden grip for the dedicated target shooter. The suggested retail price for this gun, brand new, is up-most of $460! Here you have the opportunity to own a legendary pistol, of excellent quality, in excellent condition, at an excellent price!"

This gun shoots great and I've never had cycling issues with either mag or ammo.  Despite it's light weight recoil is extremely manageable with the brake making this gun a very pleasant shooter, although be prepared for fire balls. The receiver/bolt is in fantastic shape with minor wear on some external parts (which I think make the gun look even better) and this rifle has zero rust. I have to fund another build so I'm forced to sell off one of my battle rifles. This gun will make someone very happy.

This Gen 4 26 has that ""teflon"" finish that alot of the gen 3's had. Very few of the 4's were lucky enough to get it. Do a search on google. Almost all gen 4's have a smooth, matte black finish. Problem is, that finish shows handling and holster marks the second you use it. Gen 4's come with a third magazine, stippling, larger ambidexterous mag ejector and interchangeable backstraps. The 26 Gen 4's have 3 total backstraps.

This finish looks shinier and even feels extremely indestructable. Just like the tefflon coating on really expensive pans. This gun is perfect. Not so much as a little mark on the barrel ramp (pic 2). I wish I could do a better job of explaining the look/feel of the finish other than it is much more attractive and after watching the youtube videos and reading everything people had to say about it on the Glock forums, compared to the flat matte finish which shows holster wear after each use, this one will take a beating and still look new. 

Some will say, ""a Glock is tool and I like it to look used..."" Well, my truck is too and I don't want it scratched up/faded after using it when it could look perfect for a long time. Just my opinion.

Has grip extenions for all 3 mags, slide release extension and glock tool along with all the stuff/papers/lock/backstraps, etc. that it came with.

I also have an ankle holster for it and some ammo.

Also have an extra factory SS Remington barrel in 300 Weatherby barrel with muzzle break.  Has the factory polished bolt and floor plate. The factory recall HAS BEEN COMPLETED (I sent it in back in the early spring). I'm trying to generate some funds to build a small deer rifle for my kids. Therefore I don't need this one as much as I thought I did. My plans were to switch to 300 Weatherby originally.

I also have a BlackHawk Knoxx Axiom UltraLight Recoil Reducing (adjustable LOP) stock. It really works! VERY little recoil with this stock!!!

1) Need $550 cash for rifle and scope rings/bases
2) Need $700 cash for rifle, BlackHawk Axiom Stock, factory stock and scope rings/bases.
3) Need $800 cash for rifle, extra 300 Weatherby barrel w/muzzle break, rings/bases and factory stock
4) Need $950 for both barrels (300 Weatherby SS Factory Remington barrel with SS Muzzle break), both stocks and rings/bases.
5) I have lots of 300 Weatherby factory (Norma) ammo and brass I can sell for a good price if you buy the entire package.

RMR
https://www.trijicon.com/na_en/products/product3.php?pid=RM05G

This setup has only been mounted once to a .308 bench rifle and has about 200 rounds through the rifle while mounted. I would rate it as like new condition. The glass on this setup is great.

The ACOG is a .308 ballistics reticle with a green horseshoe and the RMR is a 9 MOA green dot for fast acquisition in close quarters.

I would be willing to sell the ACOG, mount and killflash alone for $1000 and the RMR alone for $400."

The 535 marks a new era for Mossberg pump-action shotguns.

It's chambered to handle 12-gauge, 2-3/4"", 3"", and even 3-1/2"" magnum loads, for maximum stopping power. Rugged and reliable, the 535 is the ultimate pump gun, loaded with features usually found on shotguns costing much more, all built into a lightweight design that's easy to carry."

History of the Beretta 92FS
Designed in 1975 by Carlo Beretta, Giuseppe Mazzetti, and Vittorio Valle; the Beretta 92 (made in Italy) pistol is an evolution from the M1922 and M1951. Taking the open slide design from the M1922 and its alloy frame and locking barrel from the M1951. Along the way the Beretta 92 also adopted a direct feed and a ""double-stacked"" high capacity design to its magazine.

In order to meet the requirements of select law enforcement agencies, Beretta added a slide-mounted combined safety and docking lever. Thus the Beretta 92S was born and adopted by several Italian law enforcement and military units.

Eventually Beretta modified the 92SB (a special model with a firing pin block designed for the U.S. Air Force) with an enlarged hammer pin to stop the slide from flying off the frame in response to reports of defective slides during U.S. Military testing."
