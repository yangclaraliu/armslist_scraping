The Smith and Wesson Model 39 was the first U.S. designed double action (DA) semi-automatic pistol marketed in the United States.  In 1949, Smith and Wesson began development of the Model 39 DA semi-auto in caliber 9x19mm Luger. Smith and Wesson began selling the Model 39 commercially in 1955. This is considered a first generation pistol. Since the Model 39 came out, S&W has continuously developed the design into its third generation pistols now on the market. First generation models use a 2 digit model number, second generation use 3 digits, and third generation models use 4 digits.

The only time this rifle has been out of the box was to take the pictures. 
On a another note--because of the ban previously placed on Russian importation of these, this puppy is only going to go up in value. 
Whether you're buying a reliable gun to put thousands of rounds downrange, or a collector's item, this is definitely a smart buy. 

It is equipped with a 20.5"" chrome-lined, heavy fluted, target BBL with a pinned on thread protector over the 14x1 threaded muzzle. 
The firearm is semi-automatic, and has beautiful finished wood buttstock and forearm. Everything on the rifle is in 100% perfect condition--it isnt like the unfinished models that are cracked and need replacing. I wouldnt change a thing on it, but for those who want to add an optic or mount for a scope, there is a side rail that came mounted on the gun.

This gun comes with one 5rd mag and one 10rd mag, which are both still sealed in their original plastic, as well as a cleaning rod/handle (in the brown paper in the pics) and a very detailed manual. 

Stop looking and buy the thing already ;)

Introducing the new SIG SAUER Classic centerfire pistols in .22LR Rimfire models. The same Classic pistols that have been used by civilian, law enforcement, and military personnel the world over, can now have these same models factory built in .22LR. The SIG SAUER® Classic .22’s are built on the same frame as their centerfire counterparts. All Classic .22’s feature the same SIG SAUER Four-Point safety system which employs a decocking lever, a patented automatic firing pin safety block, a safety intercept notch, and a trigger bar disconector. The new machined slides also feature a front sight adjustable for drift and a rear sight adjustable for both windage and elevation.

With the purchase of a new SIG SAUER Classic .22 shooters can now enjoy hours of serious training at the range for a fraction of what they would pay practicing with full recoil centerfire rounds. SIG SAUER Classic .22’s are shipped in a lockable case with one 10-round magazine.

Be sure to check out the new SIG SAUER X-CHANGE Kit™ is the perfect accessory for your SIG SAUER Classic .22 rimfire pistols. Now shooters can add SIG SAUER centerfire performance with just the change out of the slide assembly, barrel, recoil system, and magazine to the standard .45 caliber production pistol. Exchanging components does not alter the reliability or accuracy of either assembly.

Owning a SIG SAUER Classic .22 and a centerfire X-CHANGE Kit provides the added benefit of owning two pistols in a single premium package. More shooting at a lower cost with the full size SIG SAUER pistol you’re accustomed to; the SIG SAUER Classic .22 caliber pistols that now include the option for centerfire performance with a SIG SAUER X-CHANGE Kit.

The only time this rifle has been out of the box was to take the pictures. 
On a another note--because of the ban previously placed on Russian importation of these, this puppy is only going to go up in value. 
Whether you're buying a reliable gun to put thousands of rounds downrange, or to sit on until the next ""scare,"" this is definitely a safe buy. 

It is equipped with a 20.5"" chrome lined barrel.
The firearm is semi-automatic, and has beautiful finished wood buttstock and forearm. Everything on the rifle is in 100% perfect condition--it isnt like the unfinished models that are cracked and need replacing. I wouldnt change a thing on it, but for those who want to add an optic or mount for a scope, there is a side rail that came mounted on the gun.

This gun comes with one 5rd mag, a cleaning rod/handle, and a very detailed manual. 

Stop looking and buy the thing already ;)

These are listed all over the internet for $1000+ but I am prepared to let this one go for $899."

The ARX100 is the ultimate evolution of the modern sporting rifle. Designed
for ease of use and ultimate reliability, the ARX100's feature set is
unparalleled. The cold hammer forged barrel can be removed and replaced
with various lengths and calibers in a matter of seconds. Case ejection can
be switched from right to left with the simple push of a button. All of the
critical controls on the ARX100 are completely ambidextrous. With a
constant contact piston system, the ARX100 can easily feed and fire under
the most unforgiving conditions. The lightweight, technopolymer receiver
allows for reliable operation with virtually no lubricant. To make
maintenance easy, the ARX100 has no pins and can be completely disassembled
with no tools at all. Simplicity, flexibility, reliability. The ARX100 is
the next step in modern sporting rifle evolution."

This is an Academy Sports exclusive item. I bought it a couple of months ago as a low-cost introduction to .44 Magnum because I wasn't sure whether I'd like the caliber or not. Turns out I do like it so I've moved up to a S&W with a longer bbl. 

So now this one's up for sale as I no longer have a real need for it. I've run 50 .44 Specials and 10 .44 Magnums through it with no issues. It runs fine and is obviously a powerful yet concealable weapon, accurate enough for SD. I especially like the ribbed rubber grips which provide a firm grasp while cushioning recoil a lot.

I will only sell to those who present a NC CCW permit and NCDL and can come within a 15 minute drive of Greensboro and meet face-to-face with cash. Cash sale is highly desired but I will also likely respond yes or no to reasonable trade possibilities.

600,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3461600,For Sale/Trade:  A brief observation,"Kentucky, Kentucky, United States",$ 0,"Listed On: Thursday, September 4, 2014",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have noticed a lot of complaints about no shows and deals being set up that fall through. We all have our own theories as to where this outbreak branches from. We all agree to it's purpose though, to help disable this particular market place. This action makes us all angry. But what baffles me is this. We have done more damage to this community ourselves than any outside entity could possibly hope to accomplish. This is partially due to just plain price gouging, low ball offering, and illegal flipping ( it IS unlawful to buy a gun with the intention of selling it for profit without holding an FFL). And now we have a saturated market especially with ""black guns"" because of a huge wave of panic buying. 
 We still have an opportunity to regain this market of honest and fair buyers and sellers. If the few of us left will simply use the flagging system that was put in place to allow us to self-regulate, we can make this the great resource it was almost two years ago. I personally have found other avenues to sell my firearms although I do continue to list mine here in the hopes that I can get a fair price and put a firearm into the hands of a responsible person who will appreciate it versus it just sitting in my safe doing no one any good. And I have not made a purchase or trade stemming from this site in over a year now. I get better purchase prices from the gun stores than I can get here. 
 The other practice that we need to self enforce, and it can only be self enforced in it's truest sense is personal integrity. Just because you saw someone else list the same gun you have above it's true worth doesn't make it ok for you to follow suit. This simply floods the site with, well what we are seeing now. A stagnate pool of overpriced run of the mill guns anybody can buy at their local gun store for less. A little self control will go a long way. And not just with sellers but buyers as well. It's the buyer that fed this behavior from sellers. Every time a buyer pays more than retail or pays retail on a used gun it spurs more people to try to sell their gun for these inflated prices. So all you guys who paid too much for something and complains about this market take a look in the mirror. You are just as much to blame.
 Now I have seen a few guns that fit the category of being worth what someone will pay. Collectors grade guns that are no longer being manufactured. My rant is not directed at you guys. Those are the ads that keep me scrolling through the list. Even when I can't afford them it's a privilege to be able to view the photos and give me the opportunity to research something I didn't know existed before. 
 In closing, what I am asking for is all of us gun owners to show the responsibility and class that we should and need to show the rest of the nation. We have a tremendous burden to be men and women that can show this nation that gun owners are not petty immature red necks with short fuses that can't even get along with ourselves let alone someone who has an opposing viewpoint. Lets make this a community that can have pride in being a part of this instead of a bunch of sharks praying on the unwitting and furthering the mind set of the ""Me first, what can you do for ME"" generation."

I am looking for permission to do some urban archery hunting this season on your property.  The season runs until March and I am looking to help out local landowners with over-populated deer in and around their homes quietly.  I would also be willing to help with upkeep of the area as time permits for access to your property.  

If you are interested in discussing details, please contact me at this address.  I would be respectful and follow all legal requirements while engaging in hunting practices.  I am a legal resident of the U.S., have a valid VA drivers license, and CCW permit.  I also have been working for various state agencies dealing with conservation and recreation of Virginia's natural resources.  

If you are looking to control the population of deer in your immediate area, I would like to help.  If you are looking to have some help with filling the freezer this year and don't get enough time out in the woods or would like to simply impart your hunting experience on an individual who is willing to learn, I would also like to help.  I am trying to get out and gain some more experience hunting in varied terrains and areas.

Sorry to be so direct but it takes time to answer the emails and send photos to people who are not a buyer, I buy & sell here and prefer to deal with serious and interested people.

Sorry due to my work schedule currently it is a pickup only in MIDLAND, MI or it can be shipped to your FFL for an additional 15.00 shipping charge, sorry these are the only options I can offer, Thank You for LOOKING!

UPDATED - FREE SHIPPING, through the end of the year, thanks for looking

Payment methods - 
Cash in hand on pickup, in person, with CPL / purchase permit - MI
United States Postal Money Order / Charge Card - Shipped to FFL, thanks

IF THE LISTING IS UP THE ITEM IS AVAILABLE, WILL UPDATE AS ""SOLD PENDING FUNDS"", if being shipped or it will be taken down if purchased .

The gun is listed here & for sale locally on consignment at Insight Firearms in Midland, MI if you're local and want to stop in to see it, should it sell there first I will update it here as quick as I possibly can, thanks for looking

UPDATED INFO, as requested - Several people have asked about the bluing condition, I tried to take good pics but its a 71 - 72, best I can determine, appears to be all original and light wear is visible as in the pics, it has been used although in very good condition overall, bore is great and it shots VERY accurate! - My wife prefers for revolver and I imply don't need it so when it sells it sells, thanks again.

Thanks for looking have a GREAT day, Martin

Local purchase requires - Michigan driver license & CPL, (or purchase permit, if no CPL) ONLY – NO exceptions!"
