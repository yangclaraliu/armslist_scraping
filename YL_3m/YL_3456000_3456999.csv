The gun will come with 2 16rd LE clips, a FOBUS holster, and the tan soft carrying case.  

This model HK and the soft carrying case are rare.

If you can find them, these guns go for about for around $800-1000 used.  

The only issues are superficial. The gun is missing a very small piece of the grip tape and the paint on the extractor is coming off (common with some handguns). If you call HK, they will supposedly send you a new extractor. Or you can pay $35 for both new grip tape and a extractor."

All the serial numbers match including the number on the bottom of the magazine, this is rare due to soldiers swapping mags for a fresh one in the field under fire. Also the Cartouche's under the stock are still visible and all the stamps show this to be a good original rifle including the stamp to say it was accepted in England. The stock has some dings but is in good condition with no cracks. Rifling is very good, clean bright bore. Bolt action is very good and safety is fully functioning.

The polished stainless steel finish and laser etching on the frame are available on all Kahr Elite K series pistols - the K9, MK9, K40 and the MK40. The lustrous finish complements our innovative designs and solid construction. The magazine well is beveled for easier magazine reloading. The feed ramp on the barrel is polished to a high luster to insure reliable feeding with all types of ammo. Laser engraving on the frame provides the finishing touch to the polished stainless steel - for an appearance as impressive as its capabilities.

The firearm is in excellent condition and has only had about 500 light target loads put through it (used for skeet, not hunting). It has 28"" barrels with a ventilated rib, and the stock and forend have been polished to a high gloss finish from the original satin finish, which really makes the dark walnut wood pop (hard to tell from the attached pictures because of poor lighting). The finish on the firearm is perfect, with the exception of a couple of small dings on the bottom of the stock (see picture below). I've never had any problems with this shotgun at all and I am only selling because I recently bought an 1100, so I don't use this gun enough to justify holding on to it. It is an excellent beginner/intermediate skeet gun and/or a field gun for small game.  

The shotgun comes with the 5 original choke tubes (1-Full, 1-Improved Modified, 1-Modified, 2-Improved Cylinder) and the wrench. It also comes with an L.L. Bean waxed canvas & leather take-down case (this is a $75 case). Also comes with a Limbsaver slip-on recoil pad for length-of-pull extension and extra recoil protection.

If you dont know, Finnish mosins are of the best quality. this rifle shoots 1 inch grouping at 100 yards, or simply 1 MOA. not one corrosive round was fired through this system. the receiver and barrel were duracoated flat black to reduce glare and for additional protection from the elements. all in the picture comes with the weapon except the suppressor. there is one 5 round DBM. any questions please ask. i am open for fair trades. you'll be hard pressed to find rifle like this for a similar price. i know mosins around here seem to have a bad rap. well, if you havent shot one, your opinion is invalid. mosins are more sturdy, more reliable, and finnish models are just as accurate as a rem 700 bullbarrel 308. dont believe me? if youre serious about buying, you are invited to shoot it yourself and see at a local range. i stand behind my items to show good faith with transactions. 100% satisfaction guaranteed. Thanks for looking!"

Bull barrel and match grade trigger. I am only considering a trade because I am not a large framed guy and I find it difficult to conceal. (1911s don't get any smaller than this so I've accepted that I'll be carrying my LCR instead.) I don't want to part with it, but it makes sense that if I'm going to have one 1911 it should be a full size. Only 200 rounds through it. Still needs 300 more rounds to be ""broken in"" and considered legit for concealed carry. This model does not have night sights, just low-profile black sights. The sights however are VERY accurate and effective. This is the link to the model: http://www.kimberamerica.com/1911/ultra-carry-ii/stainless-ultra-carry-ii

Things I can do are as listed

•stippling(about any pattern you want)
•design of your choice in the grip
•grip reduction
•removal of hump or finger groves (i.e. Glocks)
•raised trigger guard cut(for higher grip on gun)
•radiused mag well cuts 

As far as trigger work I can polish the internals where metal rides on metal, replace your connector and springs for a lighter, smoother trigger. On the m&p models I do a custom trigger job without changing any internal parts and can create a reliable 2.25lb pull but can also make it anywhere from 6lbs to 2.25lbs to suit your needs. 

If you have any questions, would like me to do your handgun, want a price list, or want more info and pictures please text or call me at REDACTED or email me through armslist. If you don't see what you want done let me know and I can probably do it. Thanks!

The Heckler and Koch 416 Pistol is a handgun version of the H&K 416, chambered in .22LR. This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the .22 416 rifle. Like the other .22 LR firearms offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22. The barrel measures 9 inches in length and its rails are machined. The 416’s pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 pistol are the same as the .22LR 416 rifles. They are made of high-strength polymer and designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. The estimated retail price for the 416 pistol is $459.

Operation

A blowback system operates the .22 caliber HK 416 Pistol. The dust cover functions and the bolt remains open when the magazine empties. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation and its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’."
