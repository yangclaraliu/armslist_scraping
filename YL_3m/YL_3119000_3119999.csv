I've also got a ton of .300 WIN MAG (match grade ammunition and brass) as well as reloading dies I can add to the table.

This is the model of the Remington 700 they no longer produce for civilian purchase. This is due to the PSS having such a high production cost being as how Remington spared no expense with this rifle. On top of that, it has been gone through completely and upgraded fully to be the most consistent and accurate long range and competition effective weapon possible. It's chambered in .300 WIN MAG so that it can reach out and touch something when necessary. This round obviously has substantial stopping force as well. The barrel is match grade and target crowned with a custom muzzle break to increase muzzle velocity and reduce recoil, while maintaining every ounce of accuracy. Also has Competition Match Grade Trigger with 1.5# pull. No expense spared on this rifle.

Idling problem. When first starting up, will drive and shift fine, but after ~15 minutes of driving or left to idle service engine light will turn on and will idle high. Also happens if you drive it for a little bit, shut it off and then back on. Sometimes goes away after a little while but not always. May be a simple fix, I don't know.

It comes with a 12 round and 10 round magazine. They don't make stainless anymore so these are harder to come by. I personally have transitioned from .45 caliber pistols to 9mm pistols after receiving extensive training and no longer have a use for this pistol. It's in great shape and there is nothing wrong with it. It has just been sitting in my safe not being used. I probably put 200-300 rounds through it over the past 5 years and haven't touched it since (except for cleaning!). It has a DA/SA safety/decocker (some models don't). This is the same gun special operations use sometimes so it has the wider trigger guard and bigger buttons so it's easier to use with gloves on, etc.

This compact, multiple-output Helmet Light features three white LEDs, two red LEDs, and one blinking infrared LED that serves as a personal Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) beacon. The white primary LEDs are perfect for general-purpose, close-work illumination; the red secondary LEDs serve the same purpose in a low-signature, night-vision-friendly color. 

Helmet Light features a durable, watertight polymer body in Desert Tan. Attaches to any Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH) via an included ambidextrous mount with 20 preset positions that allow the light to be rotated 360 degrees when attached. Once either mount has been attached to the helmet, Helmet Light can be quickly and easily slid on and locked securely in place. Pressing a lever on the mount unlocks the light, allowing for quick removal for servicing or transfer onto its optional Z71 carry clip, which attaches to any MOLLE or ALICE vest.

The “Baby” of the Desert Eagle family offers an excellent handgun value and plenty of firepower. The grip design is exceptionally comfortable and well liked by shooters. Since 2008 the Baby Desert Eagle was no longer imported into the US, however beginning again in 2011 with the acquisition of Magnum Research by Kahr Arms we are excited to bring this popular firearm back to the US market. 
Trigger action of the Baby Desert Eagle pistol is double action/single action (DA/SA) and is available in three popular calibers (9mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP) and several barrel lengths. The Baby Desert Eagle pistol is available in either a steel frame or a polymer frame with a black finish. The steel frames and slides are produced from high quality carbon steel with an attractive matte black oxide finish. Full size and semi-compact models feature a tactical rail for optional lasers and/or flashlights. All models come with a slide mounted decocking safety with dual levers and upgraded fixed combat sights with three white dots. The rear sight is well designed in appearance and is snag free."

I would really like to trade for an AR of some sort, nothing crazy, a base model will do. For the right trade I also have so parts for the Beretta that i ordered today that i can include, this would mean setting up the trade and waiting until they come in to actually exchange guns. Those parts include: Factory Beretta Steel Trigger, Factory Beretta Picatinny Rail, Crimson Trace Railmaster Laser, Green Night Sights, FDE Hogue full wrap grips, Real Carbon Fiber IWB Holster...easily a few hundred dollars worth of upgrades!

Springfield Armory's Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5 Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used.

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster.

It's more gun than I need. I only wanted a regular ol' Plain Jane Glock 17 (maybe like a Gen 2). A beater one is fine. 

Anyway, I know that this particular model is rather collectable but I'd be served quite well with a standard Glock (I don't even need it to have a rail). I'm happy to trade this for a regular Glock 17 of some sort plus some cash. Like I said, yours can be well-worn and beat up. 

This model goes for about $650 to $750 on Gunbroker (without the 3rd mag or the $119.00 Trijicon Heinie night sights) so I'd take trades that are kind of in that ballpark but I'm open to hearing any offer you throw out."

With factory reloads it can be a bit picky, but that's to be expected. In terms of features, it has a classic HK-style lower and rear drum sight. The front sight is a hybrid AR15/HK sight that uses standard an AR sight post, so you can drop in aftermarket night sights if you want. Overall, I rate it a solid 8 out of 10.

I have $235 in Academy store credit I would like to use as partial payment with cash to make up the rest of the guns value. We can meet at Academy and verify the gift card amounts. I would really like to find a Kahr CM or PM9 and they don't have those at academy, if I don't get any offers soon I will just get the ruger or maybe a diamond back db9 from Academy and use my store credit.  Maybe you want a new gun from Academy and want to get rid of your old one!

This rifle is equipped with the Magnum Lite® revolutionary patented graphite bull barrel, exclusive to Magnum Research. The patented uni-directional graphite fibers, parallel to the bore axis, results in a barrel with 6x the stiffness of the equivalent weight of steel. The lighter barrel weights are easier to wield and dissipate heat up to 43% faster than steel. The result is rim fire performance of extreme accuracy.

One is LNIB with 400 rounds fired and minor holster wear. The other is BNIB, has only been factory fired and hasn't been carried. They both come from factory with 1 ACT-MAG. These are very nice pistols and I've never had a failure out of the one I've shot. I don't need to sell them and will probably regret it if they do sell so my price is very firm or ""set in stone"". They come with a DeSantis New York Shoulder rig that will holster both or one and a mag pouch. They also come with Pachmeyr grips along with the original ones. In my opinion it doesn't get any more awesome and that's why I bought all of this. This is a package deal and I will not split any of it up.

I have a couple of these barrel/receiver assemblies.  Very good bluing and low shot count.  These are the longer barrel, and intended for the longer feed tube that Marlin has since gone away from.  I have one of these I keep to swap with my 795 so I have the original short barrel as open sights and this long barrel as a scoped upper…maybe you want one for bird shot, or you need a nice barrel/receiver for a restoration project.  You could even build up your own Mod 60 from these….all other parts are readily attainable via ebay or the aftermarket (ie: not a firearm).  I have barrel bands for attaching the magazine tube, also some spare screws for attachment to the stock/trigger guard if you need.

Made the trade for this weapon recently but I've found it's not really what I need right now. Have a PCS coming up and could use cash in hand rather than the extra handgun. Previous owner stated approximately 200 rounds downrange, I've put one box of 50 through it to get a feel for it. Very nice shooting weapon, possibly even nicer than the P238 I used to have. The weapon came to me with an aftermarket stainless steel trigger installed as an improvement over the stock plastic trigger, there is some small marring on the right side of the frame at the trigger pin as captured in the photos.

Includes all Sig items in the box, OWB holster, lock, manual. Also includes both 6 and 7 round extended magazine, IWB nylon holster, 100 rounds of range ammunition (124 grain) and 50 rounds of Speer Gold Dot 124 grain +P duty ammunition.

I can travel outside the Hampton roads area if the deal is right. Two forms of ID from you, to prove residency and eligibility for handgun ownership. Military on orders in the area is an acceptable option as well. I'll provide a Bill of Sale for signature."

Sig 220, rail, bright Night Sights, sig box, 2 mags (1 stainless) excellent; I did a search on the numbers and letters on the night sights, and one poster said they were Meprolight sights, 2011, which makes sense in view of the apparent age of this pistol.

Paid $850 for this which appears little fired and is typical Sig quality -- for sale reduced to $800

Gun has no cosmetic or functioning issues.

I will consider case quantities of ammunition plus cash.

This pistol is the newer style Sig, and I believe it likely to be two to three years old, based on its serial number and a search I did on Sig Forum.
