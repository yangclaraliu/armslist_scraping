The Browning Automatic 5, most often Auto-5 or simply A-5, is a recoil-operated semi-automatic shotgun designed by John Browning. It was the first successful semi-automatic shotgun design, and remained in production until 1998. The name of the shotgun designates that it is an autoloader with a capacity of five rounds, four in the magazine and one in the chamber.  

The Browning Auto-5 was the first mass-produced semi-automatic shotgun. Designed by John Browning in 1898 and patented in 1900,[2] it was produced continually for almost 100 years by several makers with production ending in 1998. It features a distinctive high rear end, earning it the nickname ""Humpback"". The top of the action goes straight back on a level with the barrel before cutting down sharply towards the buttstock. This distinctive feature makes it easy to identify A-5s from a distance. A-5s were produced in a variety of gauges, with 12 and 20 predominating; 16 gauge (not produced between 1976 and 1987) models were also available. The gun saw military service worldwide between World War I and the Vietnam War.

These are manufactured in Korea by KCI, that nation’s leading arms manufacturer, and imported by American Tactical Imports. Construction is high impact opaque polymer, ATI Product number is 572810. Factory recommendation against hollow point ammunition is on the box; the best ammo anyway is the factory FN Ballistic Tip rounds; and that recommendation by itself, along with ATI’s warranty, indicates the quality of their fine magazines. These magazines hold 10 rounds of 5.7x28 caliber ammunition, forty fewer rounds than the standard issue AT number 572850. Comparative photo of the 850 shows how construction on the 810 came into compliance with California and similar regulations, with internally molded rib blocks that cannot be removed without destroying the magazines. Replacement pricing on these magazines is upwards of $50 apiece or more in our area if a person can even find One. Our single magazine price is $29.

The 32 ACP auto inhabits a valuable and useful place in our society as a defensive cartridge, mostly because of the easily concealable, tiny pistols chambered for it. HOWEVER, because of the very limited size of the cartridge, it is plagued with limited power and therefore most of the existing ammo in 32 ACP suffers from not being reliable as a man-stopper. We've studied and examined nearly all available 32 ammo and find it wanting as a reliable means of self defense, especially against a large, drugged up/pain free, determined attacker.

Here's the problem. The current 32 ACP frangible ammo delivers a large amount of surface trauma, but lacks sufficient penetration. For example, if you shot me or another sane man in the face, with modern, frangible 32 ACP ammo, it would blow off a big portion of my cheek. I would undoubtedly fall to the ground in shock and pain, but I would be very much alive and functional if I could get past the pain, as that frangible bullet would have stopped somewhere in my face, never making it to my brain. However, if you shot a drugged up maniac in the face with that same frangible bullet and blew half his cheek off, he would keep right on coming because he is insane and is not thinking like you or I. Plus, he is likely pain free and fear free and won't know that part of his cheek is missing and if he did know, he would not care. So, whatever 32 ACP ammo you shoot him in the face with, had better go through his face and blow his brain stem out the back of his head, because only a CNS (central nervous system) hit with a 32 ACP is going to stop him. Likewise, a torso hit to the sternum needs to penetrate deep enough to blow all the way through his spine in order to shut him down instantly. If you fail to shut him down instantly, you and your loved ones are going to have to find a way to survive while you wait for him to bleed out and pass out. The best chance of survival for you and your loved ones, is to shut down the attacker instantly. So, we've designed this 32 ACP+P load to keep you and yours alive under the worst of scenarios.

This 32 ACP+P ammo will better all American made 32 ACP+P ammo by 110 fps to 150 fps with a heavier bullet than any other American made 32 ACP ammo.

Item 30A/20 is a 75gr. HARD cast bullet with a flat nose. It is traveling over 1,000 fps out of my 3.4 inch Beretta Mod. 70. We've used a flash suppressed powder so that you won't be blinded by your own gunfire in the dark. This is significant as well over 90% of all civilian shootings in America occur in low light when the criminal element is out and about. Also, this flat nosed, nonexpanding, hard cast, bullet will penetrate deeply and will do much more damage than the typical round nosed FMJ bullet. Round nosed bullets tend to slip and slide through living tissue, doing little damage as opposed to a flat nosed bullet. The flat nose not only wounds much more than a round nosed bullet, but it actually keeps the penetration straight and thus deeper. Notice the below velocities from my personal 32 ACP pistols. These are real world guns and thus the speeds are realistic and not the exaggerated speeds you'll see produced from laboratory test barrels. What you see with Buffalo Bore Ammo advertising, is truly what you get in the ""real world"" where it matters. You can expect 20+ inches of straight line penetration in flesh and bone with this load. If you are worried about over-penetration with this load, DON'T! You chose to carry a tiny under-powered 32 ACP pistol and the trade off is that now you are going to have to stay alive using this pistol and over-penetration will be the least of your worries if you end up needing this gun to save yourself or your family.

A. Berretta Mod. 70, 3 inch bbl.- 1001 fps

B. Kel Tek, 2.5 inch bbl - 910 fps

C. Seecamp, 2 inch bbl. - 856 fps

The above bullet speeds are 110 fps to 150 fps faster than the Winchester 71 gr. FMJ ammo on the American market. Not only is our bullet heavier than any other American made 32 ACP ammo, but it is moving about 15% to 20% faster - with that heavier bullet!
Feeding and function was flawless in the three test pistols listed above."

135,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3511135,For Sale/Trade:  45* Angle BUIS dioptic iron sights,"NE Tacoma, Federal Way, Seattle, Washington",$ 20,"Listed On: Saturday, October 4, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"These sights are brand new. No wear at all. They are super sturdy for the price. Full adjustments for windage and yardage. Very snug fit.

Machined from lightweight, extremely durable 7075 aluminum, Mil-Spec hard anodized 
Same height above bore as standard-issue M4 / M16A4 sights 
1/2 MOA elevation and windage adjustments 
Ambidextrous sights easily and securely mount to Picatinny rails using a flathead screwdriver 
Low-profile sights extend only .2"" above top rail, don't interfere with primary optics or military IR illuminator /laser sight 

For AR-15 / M16 type rifles, optical sights provide superior performance at longer ranges, but iron sights can be more effective for close-range engagements. 
However, attaching an optical sight either prevents the use of iron sights or results in a setup that produces a front sight ""shadow"" on the optical image, and/or results in problematic transitions from optical to backup iron sights. 
Not anymore. Rapid Transition Sights (RTS) provide shooters with the quickest possible transition between longer- and closer-range target acquisition, greatly increasing their efficiency and effectiveness in battle and competition. 
These sights mount directly to a weapon's Picatinny rail, offset from center by approximately 45°. 

This unique offset position makes transitioning from optical to iron sights simply a matter of quickly canting the weapon with your wrists and locking on to the target. 
There's no removing a hand from the weapon or making a manual adjustment, and no cluttered field of vision or iron sights blocking the optical sight. 
Just smooth, quick transitions that could mean the difference between winning or losing a competition, or more importantly - a gunfight. 
Weight: Rear sight - 3 ounces (85g) / Front sight - 1.5 ounces (44g)"

The XD 4"" Full Size pistol from Springfield Armory sets the standard for polymer pistols. The XD 4"" Full size has everything you want and need in a pistol- superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD 4"" Full Size is the original XD offered from Springfield Armory, and the most basic XD. This is the XD that started it all. 
The XD 4"" Full Size has a four inch barrel and a full-sized frame. This means you'll get the handling and accuracy you'd expect from a standard sized pistol.  All Springfield Armory XD's have several features that make the XD easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator let you know without a doubt, by touch and by feel, whether or not the pistol is loaded and cocked. The grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, and the firing pin block safety combine to prevent accidental discharges.
Whether you're looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, realibility or features, you're in the right place. (Springfields website)

These 1911s are manufactured in the Philippines by Armscor (Rock Island) and then Cimarron Firearms Company in Fredericksburg, TX does the finish work. These are designed to be close replicas to the original 1911, not the later A1 model. This is a 70 series 1911. The trigger has been cleaned up by Fayetteville Firearms, and breaks at a crisp 4 lbs. Also, the original wood grips have been replaced with a $100 set of Wilson Combat grips that really finish it off. This gun is new in box, and comes with 1 mag, original wood grips, and hard case. You will not find a more beautiful 1911 for any price, let alone anywhere close to what I am asking. From everything I have read, they shoot as well as they look. From handling this piece, I definitely believe it.

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY This listing is for One Magazine; Buyers, however, may take any number we have available at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Photo shows brand new factory magazines for the Browning Double Mode 9mm Pistol, the BDM. The pistol was similar to the venerable Hi-Power, but the magazines did not interchange. These magazines are what we call take-outs; that is, they were taken out of new pistol boxes when a certain onerous Federal Law sunset in 2004. Manufacturer was Mec-Gar as principal supplier to Browning Arms. These are factory Browning magazines. Construction is all steel body and springs with a slick bright blue finish. Cartridge follower and floorplate or tail piece are polymer. Each magazine holds 10 rounds of 9mm ammunition: 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, 9mm Luger, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Marking, as the photos show, is Browning BDM / 9mm Luger / 10 Rd Cpcty / Made in USA. This magazine is for the full size BDM pistol. It will not fit a Hi-Power, or an FNP, or the cigarette lighter cavity of a 1953 Nash Metropolitan Convertible. We have plenty of similar construction 10 Shot Hi-Power Magazines at very attractive prices anyway, less than $20 apiece. Replacement pricing for these BDM magazines is upwards of $60.00 apiece, and they aren’t always easy to come by. We're offering the magazines in the photos or their identical mates, however, for only $ 29.00 apiece. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10

The Stainless Target II 9mm blends the features and performance expected from Kimber in a stainless steel pistol with increased resistance to the elements. Essentially a stainless steel version of the Custom II with adjustable sights, it has a match grade barrel, chamber, trigger and barrel bushing, along with a frame and slide carefully machined from solid steel. A 1911 fits almost any size hand and points naturally for faster and more accurate shooting, an advantage that is impossible to overstate. The single-stage trigger breaks at 4–5 pounds without the creep and overtravel common to other designs, and the 1911 safety system has never been equaled. Combined with the proven accuracy and performance of the 9mm cartridge, the Stainless Target II is one of the best choices for daily carry.

Year of manufacture is 1985, well before the recent recall on the ""X-mark Pro"" trigger.  Speaking of the trigger, this one is absolutely beautiful!  Crisp, with very little (if any) overtravel.  The trigger and the smoothness of the action won me over when I was considering whether or not to buy it.  I bought this rifle up to use the action for building up a precision .260 or 7mm-08, but I've since realized that I just don't have the finances for it.

This unique feature allows the shooter to choose which action they prefer without having to purchase another pistol.  The Fast Action Trigger comes standard for most States except CA and MA which come with the Double Action Only trigger.  Since the triggers are interchangeable the shooter can always purchase one of our trigger conversion kits and enjoy the features of both trigger systems.

Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.

The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands.  The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American.

Highlights for all models:

Compact Ergonomic Lightweight Design
Interchangeable Fast Action or Double Action Only Trigger
California, Massachusetts, Maryland and New York Approved
Snag Free Design Ideal for Concealed Carry

MSRP on it is $650 from Ruger and they are hard to come by. This one will hold its value and no 10/22 collection is complete without one. All factory built with standard 10/22 reliability inside a high quality Nordic Components aluminum chassis. Super accurate rifle, with a true free floated heavy barrel straight from Ruger. This is the better model with the threaded barrel and collapsable stock (not the California legal version). Also has Ruger brand flip-up sights. Never been fired, comes brand new in box with everything, and still in the plastic. Takes all 10/22 mags and even internal upgrades, because it has all standard 10/22 internal components. I hate to let this rifle go, but I will for the right offer. Mainly looking for a high end handgun for it, but I will consider all offers for any other cool/interesting trades that you may have.

I had a Powder River Precision match-grade trigger installed by a professional gunsmith, as well as grip panels for better control. The trigger breaks at about 3lbs, has absolutely no overtravel and a very short reset. It would be perfect for shooting competitively or just shooting for fun. 

As you can see in the pictures, I have all the original accessories with the exception of the holster, but I have an aftermarket holster that I will include with the gun. 

The retail price for this pistol is over $700, but I'm selling it for $600 OBO. I will also consider trades for a Ruger Gunsite Scout, a Remington 700 or Savage Model 10."

The whole thing is topped with my favorite reasonably-priced optic, the Bushnell Illuminated 1x/2x Red/Green Dot MP Scope. Ok it’s not a Trijicon (and you are not spending thousands), but it sure looks really awesome, has elevation and windage adjustments, intensity dial, and even a 3-dot iron sight in case your battery goes dead!. This setup is what I carry most often and I really enjoy all types of shooting with it. It does everything well, is lightweight, sturdy, and performs as well for short or longer ranges. It is a great gun for all-around use.
I am sure you will love this AR

TOO BAD FOR ALL YOU LOW-BALLERS...YOU MISSED OUT ON A FINE WEAPON! 

This one sold on 9/19 for $450 without a batted eye to a REALLY COOL former marine and new friend! This guy really knew his stuff about S & W weapons and their value. Particularly the model 6946. He told me that he would have expected to pay more for this particular weapon, and so he jumped at the low price I was asking! 

Obviously HE wasn't like the LOW-BALLING IDIOTS on here who try on a daily basis as a ""business"" to steal guns from legitimate owners! These lowlife LOW-BALLERS prey on sellers who may be in financial peril, steal the gun from the seller with a ridiculous low offer, and then re-sale the gun later for a profit for themselves. 

That's the tactic of someone like a maggot pawn shop operator! It takes a REAL SCUMBAG to take advantage of and feed off someone's financial dismay, by making a ridiculous offer hoping the seller is desperate and hurting enough to take it!  What you LOW-BALLERS don't realize is that there's a lot of guys like me here on AL who buy and trade guns as a hobby...not because we need money...we do it just because we love guns!

In MY book, LOW-BALLERS are SCUMBAGS plain and simple. And they're too stupid to realize that they de-value the entire Armslist re-sale and trading market by being the assholes that they are!! 

All you good people out there selling and trading on Armslist should make a stand against the low-ballers on Armslist by not even acknowledging them! Just do like I did in my ad by saying in print... ""BUYERS adored...LOWBALLERS ignored!"" or ""B.A.L.I."" (Right below your phone number!) Maybe then these assholes will get the message and hopefully not ruin this great 2nd Amendment backing red-blooded AMERICAN site!"

I bought this used two years ago and sent it to the S&W mothership in Springfield Mass. for a little refurbishing and a full re-bluing, plus I've outfitted it with Boone Trading Company ""Bonded Ivory"" grips... So it looks really nice now... Nearly as-new. The original wood grips are also included. I've run less than 100 rounds (.38's) through
it since the re-bluing. (Holster not included. S&W factory re-bluing invoice is included.) 

Back in the 60's, 70's, 80's... Model 19's were very popular for law-enforcement carry and are legendary for their balance and easy point-shooting. This one was produced sometime around 1980. I'm letting it go because I find myself shooting my 6"" more so this one doesn't see much action... and, I can use some funds. Cash deal for $550 is highly preferred but I will respond to reasonable firearm trade offers.

I'm the original owner of the rifle and have shot exactly 23 rounds of Barnes Vortex 130gr ammo through the rifle.  The rifle was purchased for my wife to use for hunting big game, but she nor the rifle ever made it into the field, only to the range for sighting in.  My wife has had a change of heart about wanting to hunt, therefore the rifle is no longer needed. 

The Ruger All Weather Rifle has a Matte Stainless Steel Barrel, Black Synthetic Stock and Matte Stainless Steel Scope Rings and Bases (Rings and Bases come standard with this rifle from Ruger).  The Scope on this rifle is a Brunton Echo 3x9x40mm with the #5 Ballistic Reticle which comes with a Lifetime Warranty.  Included with the Rifle and Scope is 1 Box of Barnes Vortex 130gr ammo, 1 Box of Federal 130gr Soft Point ammo, 1 Black Soft Rifle Case and a Viper Bore-Snake.  I have sighted the rifle in to be 1.5"" high at 100 yards leaving it dead on at 200 yards.   This rifle shoots Sub 1"" groups at 100 yards and very capable of shooting accurately out to 400-500 yards. The picture of the target below is indicative of the accuracy this rifle is capable of at 200 yards.  Total weight of this rifle including the scope is just under 8lbs, making it extremely lightweight and easy to carry over long distances.

The Swedish Mauser Stock Disk markings on this rifle are:  Section 1 is marked ""1"" indicating a 6.51mm bore.  When the barrel erosion reached 6.55mm, it was decommissioned and replaced.  This would be considered near excellent bore at the time the disk was marked.  Section 2 ""Condition of Bore"" is marked ""1"" to indicate Minimal darkening in areas.  When the bore reached an evaluation of 4, it was replaced and is therefore not listed on the disk.  These markings indicate a very good to excellent bore in my opinion.

The 'Thunderer was designed in 1990 by Cimarron founder and president ""Texas Jack"" Harvey and is produced only by A. Uberti exclusively for Cimarron Firearms Co.

To paraphrase the famed film director John Ford, ""If this isn't the way the old west six guns were, it's the way they should have been!' Firearms buffs have often wondered why the single action was never produced in the 19th century with the grips of the double-action Thunderer revolvers. Now you can have the best of both worlds, in four handsome and practical barrel lengths. The compact 3 1/2-incher is a superb carry single-action. This mating of two popular frontier six-shooters has given birth to one of today's most sought after single action wheel guns!"" - Phil Spangenberger -
