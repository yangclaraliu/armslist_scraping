Barrel: Barrel is made for Palmetto State Armory by FN Manufacturing using their proprietary blend of hammer forged chrome molly vanadium that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension with extended feedramps, and a carbine gas system.   The barrel has an A2 style profile, is mil-spec phosphate coated, and MP/HP tested.  The upper is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, and an A2 flash hider.

It's a .357 Magnum/.38 Special, 6 shot K-frame with a half-lug.  The gun is currently wearing a set of very grippy diamond pattern G10 grips from VZ, I will also include the original S&W medallion grips with the gun.  It has never been carried, lockup and timing are both excellent.  No flame cutting, sights are aligned and in good working order.  These are much lighter and more agile in hand than the newer Mod. 686s that replaced the M19.  This is a 19-4, so it was the last version of the gun produced with a pinned barrel and recessed cylinders, as such it features the most up-to-date build quality without sacraficing the desirable features from older S&Ws.  The trigger is extremely smooth, fantastic double action and a very light, crisp single action, you honestly couldn't ask for any better.

It is the original Stock with proof markings (partially covered by paint). Stock was modified to add checkering, fill in sling cut out, and then painted black. Correct phenolic resin hand guard. Serial Number 99**  Marked ""99** K.43 qve 45"" 

Original bluing of late war (1945) last ditch gun Number matching assembled from parts from subcontractors (please read below). All correct metal: butt plate, bands, trigger guard. The bolt for the 1945 K43 is different than all earlier rifles, it is not ground down. 

Great gun to restore or get replacement stock for.  

Although the nomenclature would lead many to believe that the K43 was a shortened version of the G43, this is not the case. In mid to late 1944, the Germans changed nomenclature on the issue semi-automatic rifle from G43 to K43, supposedly at the request of the Fuhrer. Notable changes at or about this time included omission of the threaded muzzle, a manual type receiver dust cover (to replace the reciprocating type), omission of the milling and ""ribbing"" on front sight ramps and buttplate trap doors, and hollowed out bolt carrier handles. Gas system components were continuously revised. To say that a K43 would definitely have all of these features is definitely not the case, because there are a myriad of transitional variations between contractors, and at somewhat varying times, and left over or previously rejected parts were used helter-skelter throughout production. A very few 1945 dated rifles produced by Walther are marked G43 or G43/K43. previously rejected or manufactured milled steel recievers made by a subcontractor were already marked G43 and were used here and there in late production.

Berlin Luebecker Machinenfabrik produced the G43 beginning some time in early 1944, when they ceased G41(W) production. BLM used only forged receivers, and had a unique time saving barrel forging machine. Interestingly, throughout production, BLM utilized a part left over from the G41(W): a milled steel bolt housing, instead of a stamped sheetmetal one will sporadically appear. Also unique to BLM were the phenolic resin (also incorrectly called bakelite) Durofol handguards, and the stocks have a rounded and tapered area where the Walther and Gustloff stocks have the flat. Berlin Lubecker changed nomenclature late in 1944 to K43. there are only two letter blocks known of this variety, ""i"" and ""k"". this is the second scarcest variety after AC43 guns. Production of DUV44 K43's would amount to less than 20,000 units. Beginning with the ""l"" letter block in 1945, BLM changed the three letter code from DUV to QVE, and continued production up until the final days of the war, when most finished rifles and parts at this time were shipped to another company owned plant in Czechoslovakia via train. Perhaps this is why the majority of Czech reworked guns have DUV and QVE codes. All in all, approximately 462,000 rifles were completed by all three manufacturers by the end of hostilities."

Eotech 517 Holographic Sight, just mounted and taken to the range one day this summer. Not selling it, its listen only for use in partial trade. My price would be the new price since its seen no real use.

Pick up an XD® and you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how natural it feels. Whether you reach for a Full Size, a Compact or a Sub-Compact, the first thing you’ll notice is how it nestles perfectly in your hand. Next, discover the ease with which you can acquire your target. Because it uses the same perfect grip angle as John Moses Browning’s proven 1911, the XD® points effortlessly and naturally.

XD®’s come loaded with features that set them apart from the competition. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator give the shooter instant tactile and visual feedback about the condition of the pistol. This means you can know at a glance – or at a touch – if there is a chambered round and if the striker is cocked. Three separate safeties guard against accidental discharges and provide extra peace of mind. The Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ prevents unintentional rearward movement of the trigger. The grip safety keeps the pistol from firing unless the shooter has a firm grasp on it. And an internal firing pin block goes the extra mile to bring you a pistol fully designed with safety in mind.

The accessory rail that comes standard on every XD® gives you the flexibility to mount a light, laser or other accessory on your pistol. An ambidextrous magazine release means the XD® doesn’t care whether or not you’re a lefty. The fully supported ramped barrel and rugged Melonite® or stainless steel finish will keep your XD® running round after round. And the high polish stainless steel magazines drop free with refreshing eagerness.

Whether you’re a new shooter or a seasoned pro, you’ll find that the XD® series stands out from the competition. Get your hands on an XD® today, and experience what a polymer pistol should be.

Essentials Kit includes: Firearm (fixed dovetails sights, 3.1"" barrel), hard plastic case, cable lock, factory paperwork, and one (1)  13 round magazine.

Pick up an XD® and you’ll be pleasantly surprised at how natural it feels. Whether you reach for a Full Size, a Compact or a Sub-Compact, the first thing you’ll notice is how it nestles perfectly in your hand. Next, discover the ease with which you can acquire your target. Because it uses the same perfect grip angle as John Moses Browning’s proven 1911, the XD® points effortlessly and naturally.

XD®’s come loaded with features that set them apart from the competition. The striker status indicator and loaded chamber indicator give the shooter instant tactile and visual feedback about the condition of the pistol. This means you can know at a glance – or at a touch – if there is a chambered round and if the striker is cocked. Three separate safeties guard against accidental discharges and provide extra peace of mind. The Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ prevents unintentional rearward movement of the trigger. The grip safety keeps the pistol from firing unless the shooter has a firm grasp on it. And an internal firing pin block goes the extra mile to bring you a pistol fully designed with safety in mind.

The accessory rail that comes standard on every XD® gives you the flexibility to mount a light, laser or other accessory on your pistol. An ambidextrous magazine release means the XD® doesn’t care whether or not you’re a lefty. The fully supported ramped barrel and rugged Melonite® or stainless steel finish will keep your XD® running round after round. And the high polish stainless steel magazines drop free with refreshing eagerness.

Whether you’re a new shooter or a seasoned pro, you’ll find that the XD® series stands out from the competition. Get your hands on an XD® today, and experience what a polymer pistol should be.

Essentials Kit includes: Firearm (fixed dovetails sights, 3.1"" barrel), hard plastic case, cable lock, factory paperwork, and one (1)  13 round magazine.

Comes with 6x 17 round magazines and an Apex aluminum trigger kit installed (seriously, the stock trigger sucked so hard that I ordered a replacement as soon as I got the gun home, I had the trigger installed by a gunsmith and it's much better now, breaks at a crisp 4lbs with very minimal takeup, it's a very easy trigger to shoot well).  DOES NOT COME WITH THE RMR but I'll include all the original mounting brackets.  It already has high sights installed and comes with rubberized backstraps for a better grip than the standard M&P.  

The gun cost me around 800$ new plus a 165$ trigger kit and the mags ran 40$ each.  I'm looking to get 820$ for the gun and mags.  I would straight trade this for a H&K P30 or trade it toward an H&K 45.  I would also accept a trade for a 9mm Gen 4 Glock if you add some cash.  Not interested in long gun trades, I have too many rifles and shotguns and I have a storage issue.  This is a great deal on a ready-to-run M&P, it's comp ready, all you need is a holster and some ammo."

This is a special edition hand built .45 ACP revolver made as a collab with Clint Smith at the Thunder Ranch.  It's an extremely well made gun, hand built by the Performance Center.  Features a 4 inch shrouded barrel with a 1913 under rail for a light attachment, interchangable front sight blades (comes with a brass bead), scandium N frame, 6 shot cylinder with moonclip capability, Performance Center trigger with overtravel stock, all PC internal parts (made of bar stock steel with case bluing rather than standard S&W MIM parts) and all the original kit and kaboodle.  The gun comes in a Eagle Industries soft case with the Thunder Ranch logo on it.  I'll throw in a whole mess of Moonclips and a Wilson Combat De-Mooner.  

  Why you need this gun... This gun is a reloader's dream, it can shoot everything from weak target loads to high pressure +Ps and do it with absolute reliability.  Reloads are super easy, .45ACP's are so short and fat that they're easy to manipulate during reloads, much moreso than other cartridges like .357 when on Moonclips, so you can shoot this gun as fast as a semi-auto.  The trigger combined with a fixed barrel makes it one of the most accurate pistols available, I've fired around 50 rounds thru the gun and it grouped better than my Nighthawk 1911.  Couple all that stuff with the fact that this is a limited edition, hand built collectable S&W, and you're looking at a fantastic investment that's a joy to shoot and own.  

I'm asking 1200$ for the gun, that's what I paid for it, and I'll throw in a box of Remington Golden Sabers.  I'm not looking for long guns, but if you want to offer a trade, I'm looking to standardize my handguns on 9mm and 45ACP Glocks and H&Ks.  I'd take a straight trade for a pair of 9mm Glocks or a straight trade for an H&K 45 Tactical.  I'd also take a trade for a Glock and 700$ cash, or a P30 and 400$ cash."

With all of that being said, it still shoots like a champ, it's a glock, not pretty but it goes bang every time you tickle it's bang button. It has been my nightstand gun for a few years now. I finally broke down and got a brand new one, so I bid this old girl a fond farewell."

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods.  Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles. Simple rugged Garand-style action with breech bolt locking system, a fixed-pistol gas system and self cleaning moving gas cylinder gives unparalleled reliability under harsh operating conditions. Heavy , hammer-forged barrel for extra rigidity and accuracy. Accurate sighting system with “ghost ring” adjustable rear aperture sight and a protected, non-glare post front sight. Patented integral scope mounts, machined directly on the solid-steel receiver provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings. Eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field. Flat, rifle-style butt pad for recoil reduction.

Since the Mark VI has been out of production for nearly 100 years, replacement parts are hard to come by. If you've searched for this spring, you've found (as I did) that they can't be purchased anywhere at any price. These new-manufacture Webley Mark VI extractor springs are reproductions made of modern spring steel using an original spring as a template. These springs are the same size as the original and fit perfectly in the Mark VI. The parts diagram shows the location of the extractor spring for reference. I don't believe these springs work in any other Webley models, so do your research before you buy. Take advantage of this limited-availability offer to restore your Mark VI to full function before they're all gone. If you buy two or more springs at the same time, I'll ship them together at no additional cost. If you prefer to purchase through ebay, you'll find this spring listed for sale there too."

Condition: I'd conservatively rate the finish at 80%+, as the Nitron finish is a little worn, and there are holster marks on the frame.  The mostvisible marks are on the front strap of the grip.

Sights:  Night sights -- glowing well and very visible

This pistol comes with one factory magazine.

Pricing:  $490 + $20 FFL Fee.  I searched gunbroker and online retailers to get an estimate of value.  The lowest price I could find was $475, after shipping/transfer, and that was for a police trade-in with no guarantee of functioning night sights.  Brick/mortar shops priced this pistol at $5500+ retail, but obviously no educated buyer would pay that.  I believe my price is fair, and would like to politely decline trade-offers and negotiations below my asking price.

It's worth noting that I am a private collector, and not a dealer.  I realize that going through an FFL for a private sale is not necessary, but for documentation purposes, and safety concerns for both parties, I am requiring this as part of the sale.  I also realize that this requirement may not be viewed favorably by many people, and I'd politely request that you do not contact me if you are opposed to transferring through an FFL.  No cash would change hands until the actual time of transfer, after you've been able to see the actual firearm."

Condition: I'd conservatively rate the finish at 98%+ as this pistol has less than one box of rounds through it, and was cleaned immediately after.  There are no visible wear marks, and any discoloration is due to generous application of CLP.

Sights:  Three dot painted on.

This pistol comes with two factory magazines.

Pricing:  $375 + $20 FFL Fee.  I searched gunbroker and online retailers to get an estimate of value.

I believe my price is fair, and would like to politely decline trade-offers and negotiations below my asking price.


It's worth noting that I am a private collector, and not a dealer.  I realize that going through an FFL for a private sale is not necessary, but for documentation purposes, and safety concerns for both parties, I am requiring this as part of the sale.  I also realize that this requirement may not be viewed favorably by many people, and I'd politely request that you do not contact me if you are opposed to transferring through an FFL.  No cash would change hands until the actual time of transfer, after you've been able to see the actual firearm."

It's worth noting that I am a private collector, and not a dealer.  I realize that going through an FFL for a private sale is not necessary, but for documentation purposes, and safety concerns for both parties, I am requiring this as part of the sale.  I also realize that this requirement may not be viewed favorably by many people, and I'd politely request that you do not contact me if you are opposed to transferring through an FFL.  No cash would change hands until the actual time of transfer, after you've been able to see the actual firearm."

No, it's not a Colt, but they didn't have the right manufacturer to choose from (when making the ad)! This is the 2nd most accurate .45 I have, right behind my Target SIG. It shoots my own hand-cast bullet/softball reloads in an excellent fashion! (see target) Slide, barrel and frame all match. The grips have really excellent function and are non-slip! I was a collector of Ballester-Molinas, and this is one of the best two I had. These really are good shooting firearms! The target pictured was 25 rounds at 50' offhand; two handed hold. NOTE: There was a really good article written up in the ""National Rifleman"" I believe in the February of 2014 issue about Ballester-Molinas! If you have a moment, look it up! It is very interesting and informative about these pistols. Other pictures available upon request. NOTE: I normally access my desktop about once per day, so please pardon the slow response.

The P239® was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of engineering we call “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols. The P239 is available in three calibers – 9mm, .357SIG or .40S&W – offering you the choice that’s right for you.
