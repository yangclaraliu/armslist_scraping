I am the original owner and the gun just sits in my safe. It's time for me to convert it into cash for other projects. 

If you follow SIGs, you know what this gun has become. It is truly a legend and the price they are bringing these days reflects that. As time moves on, they are becoming harder to find in this condition. As a two-tone with factory full nickel controls, this is even more rare. 

On GunBroker, this gun would likely bring $1400+. I'm putting it on Armslist for a local buyer at $1100. I'm not interested in trades and the price will not change. Cash only.

Since Browning Hi-Powers price out in the $1000 range, few of us will ever own one. Here is a piece to consider, though. From its career with the Israeli civilian Police, the Mishteret Y’Israel, comes this FEG Hungarian Made Hi-Power Clone. It served alongside a majority of FN Browning Hi-Powers with Jerusalem’s Police Department. This is the classic configuration of the Hi-Power with round Commander hammer. Caliber is THE 9mm, 9mm Luger, 9x19, 9mm Parabellum, call it what you will. Construction is entirely steel, 118 mm or 4 5/8 inch barrel, right-hand-twist 6 groove; magazine safety and firing pin safety; weight empty 32 oz / 900 g; fixed sights; single action only with lever safety; .265 smooth face combat trigger and matching Commander style hammer. Serial number is B 20,000 range, 1992 or 1993 production. Numbers are all matching. Slide is marked cal. 9mm Parabellum / Made in Hungary FEG-Budapest. Importer marking appears inconspicuously on the forward right side of the frame. Most of this pistol’s mates that came into the United States were labeled as PJK9HP models by then-current importer Mr. Michael Kassnar. Magazine included standard issue 13 + 1. Surface detractions are moderate, principally palm contact whitening to the grip frame front- and backstraps. Grip panels show adjacent smooth wear. There is extensive edge whitening and some brow freckling on the right side of the slide’s muzzle area. We rate this Hi-Power as Good, perhaps Very Good, 70 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice so that our distinguished shoppers can judge finish grade for themselves. It is well maintained mechanically, however; bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent. Most likely this pistol will require throating before it will feel sharp-nosed hollowpoint ammo; that was the case with even FN Hi-Powers made during these years. We’re offering this collectable, serviceable Hungarian- Israeli Hi-Power for only $ 349.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. Maryland Roster shows MBK-9HP, this pistol. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 13 shot magazines are restricted, we will sub a Mec-Gar 10 shot magazine, includes Chicago Cook County IL, Hawaii, [and Maryland after 9/15/13].

From its career with the Israeli civilian Police, the Mishteret Y’Israel, comes this FEG Hungarian Made R9, or P9R, Pistol, a Hi-Power clone, that we know as the GKK92 from the Kassnar Days of the 1980s and 1990s. Thanks to Mr. Michael Kassnar for his serial and model contributions. Importation to the US was for 1992 only, but some of this pistol’s mates have the digits 86 on the barrel cowl, possibly the first year of production but with no US Importation until 1992. This specimen is distinctive not only because of its configuration, but also because of its service history alongside a majority of FN Hi-Powers with the Israelis. This is the R9 variant double action, a long smooth pull from a resting hammer on the first shot, then stiff but crisp 7 pound vicinity single action pull until the operator engages the slide mounted safety lever that serves as a decocker. Front sight is stake on, and rear sight dovetailed in. Caliber is THE 9mm, 9mm Luger, 9x19, 9mm Parabellum, call it what you will. Manufacturer is Fegyver És Gépgyár, known as Femaru and later simply FEG, of Budapest, Hungary. With the exception of the anodized alloy mainspring housing back strap, construction is entirely steel, 118 mm or 4 5/8 inch barrel, right-hand-twist 6 groove; NO magazine safety or firing pin safety, only the main safety lever that completely separates the hammer from the firing pin. Weight empty 32.75 oz / 927 g; fixed sights; .400 smooth face combat trigger and .250 center hole serrated spur hammer. Finish is blue steel, with walnut grip panels. Barrel, frame and slide have matching serial numbers. Surface detractions are moderate, with edge whitening and scouring, and finish freckling that is not readily conspicuous. We rate this Hi-Power as Very Good finishwise, 75 to 80 percent vicinity by our estimate. Photos, at any rate, ought to suffice so that our distinguished shoppers can judge finish grade for themselves. It is excellent mechanically, bore, chamber and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent. Lateral play to the slide is minimal to moderate, but this is normal and we sell plenty of Sig Sauers with lateral play. Most likely this pistol will require throating before it will feel sharp-nosed hollowpoint ammo; rounder nosed Remington hollowpoints and any ball ammunition will be fine. Magazine is ban period new & unissued 10 round, but a full capacity magazine will hold 15 rounds. We’re offering this still attractive, serviceable and even collectable Israeli FEG R9 pistol for only $ 289.00. Not transferable to civilians in California, District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. Buyers may add any number of 10 shot magazines like the one in the photos only $23 each and with no additional shipping charges.

Pics are of actual for sale items.

The ""why I'm selling this"": the gun has been in the back of my safe since I bought it new circa 1993 or 1994. Nothing wrong with it, I just don't use it, and I can put the money to use elsewhere.

It's in good shape. Very minimal wear on the finish. I took it out hunting one year (only suitable gun I had then), but that and I think one range trip were it. More wear is from moving it from place to place than from shooting.

It's got at most 100 rounds through it. I don't recall any problems back when I actually shot it. I'd be up front if there were. Bore looks great.

I bought a ""USGI"" synthetic stock for it back in the 90's via mail order. Unlikely some Chinese cloned piece at that time, but I'm no expert on M14 parts, so I can only say what it was sold to me as. I glass bed the action to the stock, filled in the selector hole with the epoxy, and filled some of the gap for the operating rod with the same epoxy. The filled locations should be smoothed out, and stock should be sprayed with paint, but it's functional. I have the original wood stock it came with as well, no problems with it either, just wanted the synthetic one.

I've got four 20rd magazines for it, and a 5rd and one USGI magazine pouch to go with (pictured). One 20rd and the 5rd magazine definitely came with the gun so are Chinese. The other three I can't remember..I would hope USGI, but I can't tell the difference other than finish between them and the Chinese ones. There is some very slight surface rust on a couple of the magazine bodies. 

It has an S&K scope mount (no-drill, does not tie into the receiver bridge) on it. It's a ""three piece"" mount (upper and lower halves are separate as is the rail section) and I can't comment on how sturdy it is, just that it's there and I used it. Never did test for accuracy. 

I know there are purists out there, but not that long ago I was looking at the M1A series of rifles, and saw it said at least once that these Polytech guns aren't necessarily bad when compared to ones like the modern Springfield offerings, as the Polytechs are forged receivers (vs cast on the low-end present-day US guns). Again, I'm no expert, do your own research, but my understanding was that these can be a good base for a buildup.

Not interested in much for trades. I would consider some reloading components in partial trade, but I don't need much. Perhaps some rifle powder. Good on just about everything else unless you have some .308 bullets, and even that would depend on what they are.

Changed my mind. Would also take a GOOD plasma cutter (no 110V cutters, no HF/Chinese stuff) in trade. Would take an owner-bottle argon and/or tri-mix (for welding stainless) cylinder as partial trade as well. Just opening up ideas for folks. 

Asking $900. Contact me if you have questions or offers. I am uninterested in dealing with shipping, would prefer face to face. I do travel the I5 corridor from Centralia to Vancouver nearly every weekend if you want to meet somewhere along there."

Hey all,
Got lucky again and an order I had placed and I thought got canceled processed and was delivered. I'm selling it at cost to me with shipping and tax so price is for pick up in Norman only. Would also consider trades for certain pistols (derringers in bigger bores mainly), looking specially for a PF9 actually, and even trades for certain other ammunition. Here is what I have available as of now:

-15 boxes of 50 rounds (1,000 rounds total) of 40gr JHP Armscor precision 22mag ammo-$20 per 50 rounds

These are packaged in two 500 rd bricks, each containing 10 boxes of 50rds. I will break it up however you would like to buy it box wise or you can buy it all. It is all the same to me.

 Steps to attach the holster to vehicle seat:
 1. Move seat towards the steering wheel
 2. Find opening between the seat and seat back
 3. Attach and adjust the holster strap to the joint between seat and seat back (you may need to do this step because I did and I made it too long. I should of just left it the length it already was)
 4. For left handed users, swap the strap to the other side of the holster and follow previous steps
 How to adjust the thumb strap:
 Use a popsicle stick and slide it in between the velcro to loosen. Once you have the desired length, pull out the popsicle stick and press velcro back together.
 If the holster opening isn't wide enough to fit your weapon, flip over the holster as the bottom has a wider opening that fits larger guns. The straps will need to be switched as well.

They are a fairly new company started by the ORIGINAL Bushmaster staff/designers. The same people that brought you the awesome Bushmaster craftsmanship before they were bought out. The Carbon Fiber model's upper and lower receiver is actually made in Arizona by Patriot Ordnance Factory.

Like new Carbon Fiber Windham, chambered in .223 Wylde which will allow both .223 and 5.56 ammo to be fired with this AR. I have shot approximately 400 rounds through this rifle without the first malfunction and with hand loaded 62 grain ammo i was getting 1 MOA groups at 100 yards on a rifle rest. Graded at 98% by an experienced firearm appraiser, no scratches anywhere and has been stored in a hard case since purchased last year. Completely Original except for a Badger Ordnance Tactical Latch I installed on the charging handle.

Price includes Plano hard case and all literature/equipment included with firearm when new. Firearm includes a Davidson's lifetime warranty on top of the excellent customer service you get from Windham Weaponry. I also have MANY AR-15 accessories that were installed on this firearm beforehand, just ask about them and we can work something out if I have something you would like to get with the rifle.

Thank you for all the interest in my firearm but at this time i am accepting CASH ONLY. I am a disabled veteran and recently lost my job, so i am only selling this to pay bills. Thanks, and Gob bless!

Photo specimen is representative from this lot of shotguns, all of them are within 5 percentage points on their finish grade, excellent condition. We can furnish photos of any exact specimen upon request. Dealers, law enforcement, and collectors may take any number of virtually identical shotguns we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no extra shipping charges. Review any of the riot photos from the 1960s; all the riot guns were wood stocked, both functional and attractive. Mossberg’s shotguns of the period had a strong leg up on arch competitor Remington 870 because of their 3 inch capability. Now, neither company offers a wood stocked riot gun. This specimen in the photos, however, will accomplish that. It is both attractive and effective. ___ Manufacturer, of course, is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Model is 500, 5+1 capacity on 2 3/4 inch shells or 4 + 1 on 3 inch shells. Type is pump or slide action shotgun. Construction is steel barrel and working parts all built into an alloy receiver that undercuts the 870 on weight, with cut checkered semi gloss finish hardwood stock and forend. Finish is blue steel barrel, black anodized receiver, and chrome plated bolt and shell carrier. Trigger group housing is high impact black polymer, with .292 smooth faced gold plated trigger. Safety is top tang type. Chambering is 12 gauge; Barrel is 3 inch chambered blued steel, 18 1/2 inch Plain Bead Sight Cylinder bore. We have added a polymer Trench Gun type heat shield, and this Mossberg looks more like a Trench Gun than anything else made in the United States. Muzzle measures .728 vicinity, okay for any type 12 gauge load, from super light #9 to T steel to rifled slugs and buckshot.  Sight system is conventional brass bead sight. Magazine capacity is 5 rounds of 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 rounds of 3 inch shells, and the distinctive Mossberg adapter plug is included to bring a hunter in compliance with 2+1 shot regulations. Weight empty is 6 3/4 pounds, with center of gravity at the breech face. Buttstock measures 12 3/4 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 7/8 inch brown rubber factory recoil pad. Stock drop is 1 1/2 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt, with a right hand cant of about 3/4 inch. This is a Bantam length, over an inch shorter than standard, better for shorter armed shooters. This model 500 comes to us from Mossberg’s distribution system, with a new factory barrel. Original configuration was sku number 52133, Bantam. It is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or a showgirl at a Firearms Industry trade show. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal on this shotgun, as its photos show. Barrel is brand new and unfired. We rate it as Excellent, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Often a person can spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. This model 500 comes in a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers. Replacement pricing on mossberg com is over $400 on this shotgun. We’re offering the Mossberg 500 in the photos, 	however, or one of its virtually identical mates,    for only	$ 269.00.

The Spike's Tactical 12” BAR Rail is a 1pc free floating quad-rail that’s machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum with a barrel nut machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and finished in type III Hardcoat Anodizing on the rail and barrel nut. The 12” BAR rail weighs in at 479 grams (16.89 oz.) and has an ID of 1.79”.

The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called “cheese graters”. The BAR also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose, and of course; sexy styling.

But wait, there’s more! The BAR has 5 built in QD sockets (sling attachment points), allows for a continuous top rail, it’s compatible with many low profile gas blocks, and it’s made right here in the USA.

Photo specimen is representative from this lot of shotguns, all of them are within 5 percentage points on their finish grade, excellent condition. We can furnish photos of any exact specimen upon request. Dealers, law enforcement, and collectors may take any number of virtually identical shotguns we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no extra shipping charges.  The Mossberg model 500 has never been as prestigious as the arch-competitor Remington 870, but it’s just as tried, and just as true. Here is a shortened version of Mossberg’s model 500 all purpose 12 gauge pump. This listing is for the exact shotgun in the photos, but dealers are welcome to take any number of the same model, very similar condition, that we have on hand. Manufacturer, of course, is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Model is 500 Bantam, factory sku is 52132. With a wide selection of lowered recoil loads, both lead and steel, 12 gauge is a possibility for smaller framed or shorter armed shooters; after all, shooter flexibility is more crucial to effective shotgunning than shooter bulk. Type is pump or slide action shotgun. Construction is steel barrel and working parts all built into an alloy receiver that undercuts the 870 on weight, with cut checkered semi gloss finish hardwood stock and forend. Finish is blue steel barrel, black anodized receiver, and chrome plated bolt and shell carrier. Trigger group housing is high impact black polymer, with .292 smooth faced gold plated trigger. Safety is top tang type. Barrel is 3 inch chambered blued steel 24 inch Ventilated Rib, with 16 Ports for recoil reduction. Choke tube is marked as modified, but it measures .715 vicinity, something we call Improved Cylinder, steel, slug, and buckshot permissible. Accu-choke threads on the 500s are the same as old style Winchester Win-Choke and old style Browning Invector. Sight system is 12 post serrated top Ventilated Rib with brass center bead and ivory colored front bead sight. Magazine capacity is 5 rounds of 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 rounds of 3 inch shells, and the distinctive Mossberg adapter plug is included to bring a hunter in compliance with 2+1 shot regulations. Weight empty is 7 1/2 pounds, with center of gravity about 1 inch forward of the receiver. Buttstock measures 12 3/4 inches from the trigger face to the end of the 7/8 inch brown rubber factory recoil pad. Stock drop is 1 1/2 inches at the comb, and 2 1/2 inches at the butt, with a right hand cant of about 3/4 inch. Overall length is a quick handling 42.9 inches. The forend is positioned 2 inches closer to the receiver than on a standard 500; and length of pull is down 1 1/2 inches from standard. This model 500 comes to us from Mossberg’s distribution system. It is what we call a factory demo, probably a sales rep’s sample or a showgirl at a Firearms Industry trade show. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal on this shotgun, as its photos show. We rate it as Excellent, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Often a person can spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. This model 500 comes in a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers. If this shotgun was test fired, it was fewer than 20 times.  Replacement pricing on mossberg com is over $400 on this shotgun. We’re offering the Mossberg 500 in the photos, however, 		however, or one of its virtually identical mates,    for only	$ 229.00.	This shotgun comes with only one Accu-Choke tube, and no wrench. A quarter works well enough.  Accu-chokes are two slot tubes, 4 slot Remington wrenches won’t work.

Photo specimen is representative from this lot of shotguns, all of them are within 5 percentage points on their finish grade, excellent condition. We can furnish photos of any exact specimen upon request. Dealers, law enforcement, and collectors may take any number of virtually identical shotguns we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no extra shipping charges.  Here is a very powerful weapon, one that the operator should keep well away from his face. Not a comfortable shooting weapon, unless someone is doing varmint control with Super Light 2 3/4 inch shells, but a powerful one. For a good balance between firepower and felt recoil, a 3 inch Magnum load with 1 1/4  oz. BB Steel Shot delivers 90 Pellets at 1400 feet per second from the muzzle and that figures the rough equivalent of 2 boxes of .17 Mach II bullets all in one shot. Consumers must be at least 21 years of age to own one of these, any shotgun with a pistol grip has Federal Status as a hand gun for age requirement purposes. This is Mossberg's JIC series Dark Earth colored Cruiser, the Persuader 12 gauge pistol grip variant of the tried-and-true Model 500 slide action with tang safety, easily employed by Left Handed Shooters. This listing is for the exact shotgun in the photos. JIC stands for Just In Case. The Persuaders are virtual duplicates of the proven Mossberg military 500 and 590 models. Factory specs are: double slide bar pump shotgun; 12 gauge 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells; 18 1/2 inch Cylinder Bore Barrel with 16 ports to reduce muzzle climb; Dark Earth special purpose dip type factory metal finish, with matching high impact desert polymer forend and pistol grip; weight 5 3/4 pounds empty; capacity 5 + 1 with 2 3/4 inch shells, or 4 + 1 with 3 inch magnums; overall length 28 3/4 inches. This specimen is what we call a factory demo, a showpiece for Mossberg’s sales team that has been in Mossberg Corporate custody until we got it. Surface detractions are negligible to minimal on this shotgun, as its photos show. We rate it as Excellent, perhaps Near Mint, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to judge finish grade for themselves. Often a person can spot the letter U stamped on the left side of the receiver above the serial number. Bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright and clean. This 500 JIC Cruiser comes in a relabeled Mossberg Factory Box with factory lock, instruction manual, NSSF and NRA flyers. It does not come with any extras besides the added heat shield. We have even outfitted it with a matching trench type heat shield. If this shotgun was test fired, it was fewer than 20 times. Mossberg only made a few of these; the 53301 number is our best guess.	We’re offering the Mossberg in the photos, however, or one of its virtually identical mates,    for only		$ 299.00.	Buyers must be at least 21 Years of Age; the Cruiser grip gives this shotgun Other Weapon status on the 4473 form. Local pickup by a civilian non dealer has to be a Tennessee Resident. Dealers in one state cannot transfer over-the-counter to a resident of another state on cruiser grip shotguns."

The new design is a fiberglass-composite polymer over a zinc metal insert. Designed to give extra strength in the high-pressure sections, the Omni-Hybrid surpasses military pressure and weight-bearing testing.

This unique manufacturing process produces a lighter weight platform, with the total weight of the Omni-Hybrid stripped lower being 8 ounces, a ½ ounce lighter than a traditional aluminum AR lower.

“The Omni-Hybrid lower has gone through all the pressure and weight-baring testing of a traditional aluminum lower with flawless results,” says Joe Calabro, Director of Marketing for American Tactical. “We feel like this new manufacturing technique will help set the standard for AR lower manufacturing.”

The Omni-Hybrid stripped lower has an MSRP of $49.95, making it one of the most cost-effective multi-caliber lowers on the market today.

$49.95 Plus tax, no trades. Must be 21 or older and Arizona resident to purchase.

this is perfect for a bug-out bag or just a simple backpacking rifle 

13-7851 Since 1959, the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on for survival should they have to punch out over a remote area. Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well.

 Henry U.S. Survival AR-7
 Today, it's a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that's easy to carry but has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.

 Henry U.S. Survival AR-7
 Like the original Henry US Survival Rifle, our latest take on this innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 3.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear.

 Henry U.S. Survival AT-7 x-ray
 When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water-resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action.

 The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

 Henry US Survival in the wild
 Like the barrel, the receiver is also coated with a layer of waterproof Teflon for superior weatherproofing, waterproof protection, even in harsh salt water environments. Plus, the updated receiver is grooved making it easy to top it off with your favorite optics.

 The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is available in Black and Camo finishs. All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight.

Like new in the box, this is a beautiful Semi Auto  9mm, Feels good, Looks Good, well made. But its reasonably priced.
The SAR Arms B6P is the ultimate handgun designed for price, safety, and comfort. Designed after the already comfortable CZ-75, SAR Arms altered the design slightly to make it fit nicer in the average hand, and also used a polymer material for the frame to lessen the weight of the firearm. Just like the CZ-75, the B6P features the slimline slide to take away some of the weight and because of the lightweight polymer frame the gun is top heavy when unloaded. However, as soon as there are rounds in the magazine, the SAR Arms B6P has great balance that allows the user to shoot accurately with speed. With the 4.5"" barrel, the B6P can be easily concealed and could also be used as a great home defense firearm with it's (17+1) capacity.

I purchased the rifle new 3 months ago and have taken it to the range a grand total of ONE time during which I fired TWO twenty round magazines to dial in the sights and check for functionality. The rifle performed flawlessly and exceeded my expectations in accuracy. I took the rifle home, cleaned it, checked the bolt gap, and returned it to the safe... and there it has remained because I have found that I cannot afford to shoot 308 as much I would like.

Therefore, I have found myself with another excellent safe queen and without a safe big enough to continue stockpiling. Rifle comes with 6 mags + the original hard plastic case and manual (I can add 200 rounds 308 for the right deal!!).

890 is the price without the ammo. This is the CASH price, not the TRADE value. I will expect more in trade value.

Would like to trade for an Arsenal (or very high quality) AK in 7.62x39 or 5.45x39). If you offer an AK 74 I will need ammo to go with it. I will not entertain offers for handguns, shotguns. antiques, collectibles or anything of the sort.

The stock has some wear, but it can be refinished to new condition for $150ish. The barrel and action are in good condition and the blueing is nice. 

As for the scope:
It is a collectible Browning 4X rimfire scope made by Redfield. It has the ¾” tube. It is in great condition and has no damage. Crosshairs and glass are crisp and clear. 

This Browning 4x Rimfire scope was made between 1965 and 1976. FOV is 24 feet at 100 yards. Evidently when these scopes were marketed under the Redfield name they were called the Sport-STER 4. The STER apparently stood for Standard Eye Relief. The Browning ocular bell was smooth- not a serrated 3-ring design like Redfield. Otherwise, it’s supposed to be the same scope.

The ocular bell diameter is 1.15” and the objective bell diameter is 1.10”. Overall length is 9 1/8”. The diminutive dimensions make for a really nice look on any rifle and the optical quality with the fine cross hairs is on a par with newer scopes in this price range.

According to “Old Gunsights And Rifle Scopes” by Nick Stroebel (2008), the value was $150-$300 at publication. As you might imagine, they are becoming more desirable as time passes and, when you can find them, they are currently selling for about $250 - $325.



I am really looking to trade. I'd love to do a 241 for this rifle for a shotgun and another rifle. My trade interests are below."

The stock has some wear, but it can be refinished to new condition for $150ish. The barrel and action are in good condition and the blueing is nice. 

As for the scope:
It is a collectible Browning 4X rimfire scope made by Redfield. It has the ¾” tube. It is in great condition and has no damage. Crosshairs and glass are crisp and clear. 

This Browning 4x Rimfire scope was made between 1965 and 1976. FOV is 24 feet at 100 yards. Evidently when these scopes were marketed under the Redfield name they were called the Sport-STER 4. The STER apparently stood for Standard Eye Relief. The Browning ocular bell was smooth- not a serrated 3-ring design like Redfield. Otherwise, it’s supposed to be the same scope.

The ocular bell diameter is 1.15” and the objective bell diameter is 1.10”. Overall length is 9 1/8”. The diminutive dimensions make for a really nice look on any rifle and the optical quality with the fine cross hairs is on a par with newer scopes in this price range.

According to “Old Gunsights And Rifle Scopes” by Nick Stroebel (2008), the value was $150-$300 at publication. As you might imagine, they are becoming more desirable as time passes and, when you can find them, they are currently selling for about $250 - $325.

Acquired the shotgun in a partial trade and have no need for it, really selling to fund a motorcycle purchase.  I've personally only put a box of 20 shells through it after I got it just to see how it shot.  Shotgun shoots excellently, significantly less recoil than my Remington 870 but my Remington was the first shotgun I've ever purchased and would rather keep that for myself.

The gun has the Realtree APG Camo print on it, from the factory.  You can view the specs on the rifle here:

At only 1” wide, the XD-S™ features a low profile rear and fiber optic front sight, enabling easier and faster target acquisition.

A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best.

Been in the safe, haven't even cleaned off the factory oil.

Complete Base upper receiver assembly comes ready to install on mil-spec lower receiver to produce a reliable, positive-cycling gas piston gun. Adams Arms’ proven piston system doesn’t vent hot gases and burned powder into the bolt carrier and receiver, so the gun runs cooler, with less fouling and wear on the action, and easier maintenance. Short-stroke piston shaft eliminates concussive gas expansion in the upper receiver for less violent cycling, smoother feeding, and reduced felt recoil. The receiver is forged from 6061 T6 aluminum and features M4 feed ramp cuts and a 13-slot Picatinny-cut flattop rail. The adjustable gas block allows three levels of gas release: normal fire, firing with a suppressor attached, or a single round fired without cycling. Picatinny rail on top of gas block accepts a variety of clamp-on tactical sights. All models have melonite-lined barrels chambered for 5.56mm NATO, with an A2 flash hider and a black Melonite® finish for superb wear resistance and up to 60% more corrosion resistance than traditional phosphate coating.
