All these items were bought new during the holidays.  My asking price is less than what I have into it.  My only reason for selling is to fund a new project.  I will include all the factory boxes and bags that I accumulated with this build.

I require a signed bill of sale and proof of WI residency.  I will provide a copy for your records.

I personally would never sporterize an original Springfield rifle, but I bought this years ago after the previous owner started customizing it.  I went ahead and completed the build, and the rifle turned out absolutely beautiful.
This is a top notch deer rifle.  The quality is unmatched compared to today's manufactured rifles.
*Chambered in .300 Winchester Mag
*Custom muzzlebrake installed by Ahlman's.  The rifle recoils little more than a .243
*6.5 - 20 x 44 Cabelas Alaskan Guide Scope
*Jeweled bolt
*All professionally reblued by Ahlman's.
The only reason I am selling is to fund another project.  I really don't get a chance to use this rifle.  I've only fired about 10 rounds through it since I finished building it.  I am looking for cash only.  No lowball offers.  Sorry, no trades for now as I am looking for cash.  Thanks for looking, and have a great day!"

Factory 3-dot sights, Hogue rubber grips installed, and original factory S&W plastic grips provided.  Southpaws... please note that the combination safety lever and decocker is mounted on the slide’s left side on this pistol.  

Accurate, reliable and cleaned after each trip to the range.  Never carried.  I've taken this pistol to the range half a dozen times over many years and it’s always performed flawlessly.  Includes two 7-round factory magazines.  This is a fine looking pistol, with only a few light scuffs on the bead-blasted steel frame.  Serial no: TCP50XX.

This pistol is one of S&W’s Third Generation line.  It’s all steel, stoutly made, and it’s weight (2.3 lbs) helps with accuracy when firing multiple .45ACP rounds.  The trade-off is that it’s on the heavy side for concealed carry.   

They don’t make-em like this anymore.  IMO, this pistol has a far better feel than any of my plastic guns. Selling only to fund a custom 1911. Will include a DeSantis leather shoulder holster that I got on a trade, but never used.

Must be 21+ years of age and have (1) a VA driver’s license, and (2) a concealed carry permit, Virginia voter card, LEO ID or a copy of VA gun store invoice in your name in last year.

What makes this rifle a treat is that it is all original…it maintains the front sight hood (which is often removed and lost), the rear sight with elevation ladder (also often removed and lost), and the crown butt plate (which is often replaced with a soft recoil pad for the meek).  This rifle was manufactured in 1952, during the days when Husqvarna was using FN commercial actions to build their rifles.  As quoted by Frank de Haas in his book Bolt Action Rifles, “FN actions are made to the usual exacting FN quality, a quality so outstanding that no one should question it”.  And for the quality of the rifle as a whole, Ludwig Olsen in his book Mauser Bolt Rifles had this to say…”Some of the finest Mauser sporting rifles and carbines were made by Husqvarna Vapenfabriks, A. B., Huskvarna, Sweden”.  To further attest to the quality of Husky rifles…back in the day, Husqvarna used to “battle it out” with Sako of Finland, and anybody familiar with Sako rifles knows the kind of quality and price they demand.  Unfortunately, due to the radical change of the social and political atmosphere of Sweden towards firearms back in the 70s, Husqvarna (the world’s second oldest firearms manufacturer) stopped producing firearms to venture into other products. 

As for the rifle itself…the stock is in great condition with no cracks or splits and only the usual handling marks you would expect from normal use.  The checkering on the forearm and grip is still sharp and the butt plate is free of cracks or broken off pieces.  The barrel and receiver are free of rust or pitting and the bluing is spectacular.  The action is smooth and lock up is tight.  The bore is clean with good rifling.  It is outfitted with a vintage Weaver KV scope which is damage free with good optics.  All in all, this rifle is a treasure that can be cherished and proudly passed on from one generation to the next (can’t say that about the cheap synthetic crap they make nowadays).

Here is an Anschutz 1416 HB Classic, that is, it's the latest version of the ""Match 64"" action with a heavier barrel and traditional stock. It is in like-new condition with truly exceptional wood. You can read my range report on this gun at:

http://www.rimfirecentral.com/forums/showthread.php?t=554643

The scope is an inexpensive, but surprisingly nice, BSA Sweet 22. It's not included in the sale, but I'll leave it and the mounts on the gun for an additional $50.

I charge a fixed shipping price of $50 to all locations in the lower 48 states. That price includes a hard case and insurance, and in most cases, I'll ship by USPS.

Please feel free to check my Gunbroker feedback under ""dbuffington"", and please feel free to ask any questions. I'd rather lose a sale than have an unhappy customer.

Enjoy!

This is perhaps something you could purchase as a collectible, but truthfully, it is just so much fun to shoot…..you are going to want to shoot it!  This 9mm rifle comes with every possible accessory/add-on/aftermarket part that Calico originally offered:
*The telescoping skeleton-stock
*The forward Kelly grip
*The rail along the front of the barrel (weaver/picatinny rail for flashlight or laser activated by pressure switch)
*The rail and mounting system which rides above the helical cylinder-shaped magazines (weaver/picatinny rail for eotech/holographic sighting system

*The ""tactical ballsac"" brass catcher/leather pouch which mounts underneath where the brass is ejected (leave no brass below you as you rapidly cycle through 100 rounds of 9mm lead!)

*Factory ambidextrous safety
* Calico Muzzle Compensator

*The simplest firearm to field strip you will ever own!!!!

For those knowledgeable about Calico firearms, mine was born a m900 (as evidenced by that stamp on the piece as well), but with the added kelly grip, this now looks just like a model M-951


Basically, it is a top-loading, bottom-ejecting 9mm rifle that is part Glock, part Thompson Tommy Gun, part 80s sci-fi prop, part Gangsta Rap must-have.  It is smooth as butter to fire, and there is virtually no kickback!  I have fired this gun for repeated trigger pulls either with the stock fully extended as a rifle, or using both the pistol grip and kelly grip (Tommy Gun style) and even two-handed as a pistol with the stock fully closed, and it is fun and accurate either way, or anywhere in between!


What do you get?
Calico m900 rifle
One point sling black-bungee
Holographic sight mounted and sighted in (it is NOT an eotech, but for $50 off Amazon, it is was a great value, in my opinion-  great out to 75-100 yards no problem.  plus, you know you are gonna want to customize it yourself anyway…)
One 50 round magazine
One 100 round magazine
Calico speed-feeder magazine loader
Calico m900 Factory manual (!)

This was in movies like Total Recall and others from the 1980s and 1990s.  The rifle is light and is PERFECT as a collectible, a curio or odd show-off piece, or a legitimate home defense tool, or as a SHTF insurance plan….A little more on that:  This rifle ABSOLUTELY can be used effectively by females, elderly, or even teenage, tweenage, and even younger aged children in a zombie apocalypse.  The rollback system, light weight, and ergonomic grips make the Calico 9mm carbine rifle a true ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL weapon.  In a SHTF scenario, I know I would have either an AK or an AR and lots of magazines.  I would give my spouse or child the Calico and feel confident in their ability to use it!

Location:  in CONNECTICUT.  I will pay all shipping costs!  If there is an FFL fee on your end, I can not pay that, you will be responsible for that.  I will ship to your FFL from mine.  (You will not incur any FFL fee from my end.)  Let me clearly state that again:  FREE SHIPPING, I will pay that cost!

Looking to make a quick sale, no trades at this time, cash sale!

Asking $1350

Note:  This is definitely a confirmed pre-ban firearm.  For certain states where that might be advantageous, think about if the pre ban ""loophole"" is going to be open forever.

Last thing I will say:  Whenever I bring this Calico to the shooting range, it ALWAYS gets looks and heads turnin' and people asking what the heck it is, and if they can try.  It is really a fun firearm!"

It is was made by the Springfield Armory in 2004 with a cast reciever instead of the forged reciever of an orginal one. However this does not mean it is any less reliable and I have never had a problem with mine. I have put about 300 rounds through since I brought it back in 2005. This model is very accurate and has an excellent trigger that was done by Springfield when it left the factory. However this one like the originals needs to shoot the M2 ball ammo or get the gas port adjustable plug to shoot other .30-06 ammo through. You can shoot this while preserving your WW2 Garand. I will throw in the dozen of so en-bloc clips that I have for it. Depending on what you have a will throw in an orginal GI M1 bayonet.I take only cash. If you need more pics just let me know.

These came from the estate of a big game hunter out of Lenexa, and no real man cave is complete without something like it. All the mounts were very professional quality done.

CAPE BUFFALO - This guy's a monster and too cool. The image doesn't do him justice since it's from above and looking down, he comes in at 45"" from snout to back.
$1100.00

WILDEBEEST - Awesome piece and one that would make other guys mounts jealous, complete with the hair tuft hanging from the bottom (which you rarely see attached) and the nice gray tuft on the snout, was a good catch. $750.00

TSESSEBE - Even has the wrinkled neck features a lot of others don't take the time to include. Great looking mount and definitely not something you see everyday. This guy even includes a custom brass plaque that has the animal name ""Tsessebe"" and the place it was from ""Shangani"" and 1999 the year of the hunt. $650.00

This tactical knife is MINT!!  It has NEVER been carried or used to cut or pry anything. I got it a couple years ago from an ex-girlfriend, played with it a few times and put it in the safe where it's been ever since. Both sides of the non-serrated blade are factory sharp and the entire unit is immaculate, no scratches or blemishes anywhere on it.  It extends and retracts without incident and locks up solid with no blade play at all.

Microtech no longer makes this particular model and the ones I'm seeing from second hand dealers online are going for $600 or more.  I'm asking $550 OBO (Lowball offers will just be ignored).  I'd also consider a trade depending on what you're offering so feel free to put out whatever you've got, worst I can say is no.  The knife comes with a nylon belt pouch and the factory box.

100% Factory Built AR

Gun Selling for $1000-1100 on gunbroker avg pricing stock without upgrades.  The rail ($150), sling adapters ($46),  FDE butt stock ($49), and grip ($27) were factory installed.  The front grip ($38) and Ladders (appx $50) I installed.



This is $1400-1500 worth of gun and add ons, so don't waste our time low balling me and if you can buy it elsewhere cheaper, then go do it, I dont need to know about it. Please don't email or text me to tell me.



Im Asking $1250 firm cash price ..........or $1375 trade price as I'd rather have cash.   Again, dont waste our time if you dont want to pay this.  I dont need to sell it.



I really want an AR .308 new or like new and depending on gun, cant add cash, but maybe another gun with it.  I like Sig 716, but they have $200 rebate right now new so I cant trade high dollar for one since I can buy one $1200-1400 right now, but if we are close and its FDE preferably or black secondly, try me.  Also like DPMS SASS and obviously higher end Ar's too.

Other Trades I would consider are pistols plus cash or multi gun only Glocks (Gen 4 preferably ), Sig P238 or 938, Kimbers, Colts, Springfields, nicer brand 1911's,  possibly other Sigs like P226 in new condition but unless multi guns, possibly revolvers if new or like new condition..........all would need cash on top.  Don't want any pistols for even trade, would need at least $375  cash on top please.  If your gun is fired, especially sigs, its used, so dont try to tell me its worth MSRP 



Im not interested in war relics, collectibles, junkers, hi points, keltecs, shotguns or hunting rifles.



Thanks for looking.

Buttstock: Magpul MOE Rifle Stock (also added the correct rifle buffer tube, buffer and spring -- this reduced recoil quite a bit)

Forend: Apex Engineering, Gator Grip 15"" (This was purchased as a blem, but I could never find it, includes a rail section although I never installed it, extremely light forend)

Grip: Magpul MIAD

Brake: YHM Phantom, will accommodate a suppressor (a bit loud but recoil is very manageable with the rifle spring/buffer and this brake)

I have put it back into it's stock configuration with MBUS sights, 5 position stock, and 3 30 round PMAGs. I also have a clear BETA mag, quick loader for loose rounds, and a speed loader for rounds on stripper clips. To go along with the rifle I also have 560 rounds of American eagle 5.56x45 NATO 55 Grain FMJ XM193 ball ammo to toss in with this. I am open to parting out if you wish.

The rifle itself has been used by me, with less than 200 rounds down the pipe. The bolt face, gas rings, firing pin, and bolt carrier are all in great shape, with being cleaned thoroughly after each range trip. There is some very light wear on the rifle, but nothing more than a few abrasions from rounds ejecting and your normal use marks. I have never used anything other than non corrosive, brass ammunition in the rifle. The gun is in great shape and has been well taken care of with regular and thorough cleanings after each range trip.

I am asking for $775 obo for everything together as the rifle itself is set at MSRP of $839, the beta mag retails at $139 (this has never been used by me, just loaded and left alone) with the carry bag and graphite dry lube, and 560 rounds of 5.56x45 ammo will run upwards of $185-$200 easy. This is a great rifle for getting into AR-15's and I honestly would not be selling it if I didn't need the funds to complete a few rifle builds I have in the works.

I can be reached by the contact button here, or by texting me at 77zero-54nine-596three (apologies by trying to stay away from bots). Either contact will work as my email is tied into my phone as well. Please contact me, the worst I can say is no and I will not be rude about it either.

The rifle has had parts replaces by me, so the gas piston/piston block, firing pin, recoil spring, and extractor are all new. This is a really great firing gun, but as with any firearm that is it's age there are a few scratches mainly just on the receiver where the latch is moved to take the piston apart for cleaning. The rifle has the original cleaning rod from when it rolled off production lines in China, and it has all matching serial numbers. The rifling is still nice and deep, and although the rifle doesn't need it, I have always cleaned it and oiled it up nice after each range trip. The bolt is in great shape and so is the inside of the receiver.

In addition to the rifle, I also have a 30 round tapco SKS magazine that has been fitted to the stock, and can be installed by simply pressing a button to remove the trigger group, pull the standard 10 round factory mag out, and then replace the trigger group. From there you are able to use the removable magazines available and negate having to use stripper clips or load by hand. I also have a scope mount and rings that fit into the already tapped area on the back of the receiver, and the piston block has a standard rail built into it for the use of a red dot or other optic. I can also toss in 110 rounds of FMJ ammo and 100 rounds of hollow point ammo as well.

I have reduced the asking price down to $375 or best offer ($550 put into the weapon) for the work I put into the rifle, new stock (sadly the wooden one was trashed when I got the rifle), new firing pin, new extractor, scope mount, and tapping the receiver for said scope. I have plenty of pictures (since I can only upload three) and can send them upon request. You can reach me at my email listed on here, or by text or phone at 77zero-54nine-596three (apologies, trying to avoid bots). Don't think it's a fair price, go ahead and offer me something. As long as it's reasonable then I'll accept."
