All accessories shown are 100% unused either new in the box or as new condition. 

The Uzi carbine is similar in appearance to the Uzi submachine gun. The Uzi carbine is fitted with a 16"" barrel to meet the minimum rifle barrel length requirement for civilian sales in the United States. It fires from a closed-bolt position in semi-automatic mode only and uses a floating firing pin as opposed to a fixed firing pin. The FS-style selector switch has two positions ""F"" for ""fire"" and ""S"" for ""safe"". 

The Uzi is a family of Israeli open-bolt, blowback-operated submachine guns. Smaller variants are considered to be machine pistols. The Uzi was one of the first weapons to use a telescoping bolt design which allows the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip for a shorter weapon. 

The first Uzi submachine gun was designed by Major Uziel Gal in the late 1940s. The prototype was finished in 1950. First introduced to IDF special forces in 1954, the weapon was placed into general issue two years later. The Uzi has found use as a personal defense weapon by rear-echelon troops, officers, artillery troops and tankers, as well as a frontline weapon by elite light infantry assault forces. 

The Uzi has been exported to over 90 countries, over its service lifetime, it has been manufactured by Israel Military Industries, FN Herstal, and other manufacturers. From the 1960s through the 1980s, Uzi submachine guns were sold to more military, law enforcement and security markets than any other submachine gun ever made.

This is a Private Sale of my personal property, and I'm a verifiable U.S. Veteran

- the Walther P-22 Pistol, Caliber .22-Long Rifle is one of the safest pistols on the planet!

With a round in the chamber you can push the safety on and pull the trigger in single or double action and it will not fire. This makes it a great pistol for young or inexperienced shooters.

Comes with the original case, (2)- original German made 10-round magazines, an additional lower front site, the slide locking key, a push pin tool, the owner's manual, the un-used registration form, & the threaded barrel cap wrench. 

I'll include 100-rounds of un-boxed 22-LR ammo.

This model has a threaded barrel for silencers and you can change the backstrap for a better grip. The large one is installed & there is a medium one as well. It has a built in slide & trigger lock to secure it safely in your home. It uses a small key which is included.

The barrel length is 3.4-inches and you can also get an interchangeable 5-inch barrel to make it a target version. It has a dovetail on the lower front for a laser sight and Walther makes one specifically for this gun. They also make a Top Point-2 /Red Dot Sight.

I bought it new and have taken it to the range one time, for a total of about 75-rounds through it. I don't forsee using it much so I'm selling it for someone else to enjoy. It's in beautiful condition with only a few minor blemishes on it.

Selling it for $285.00- CASH ONLY.   (That is my absolute bottom dollar, Please don't waste your time if you don't agree to that price)

Be advised, to buy this gun from me you must be a Florida Resident, at least 21-years old, have a current Florida Driver's License or Florida CWP, and sign a handwritten ""Bill Of Sale"" with your Florida DL, or Florida CWP number on it. I have a Florida CWP and will provide the same for your personal records.

This is to protect me as it is registered in my name, and it protects you as well. (You should always have a Bill Of Sale when you Buy or Sell a gun from a Private Party. If you buy a Stolen Gun from someone and you don't have a receipt you could go to jail, and it stays on your record FOREVER!)

E-mail your phone number to set up an appointment. Please don't waste your time with low-ball offers. I'm in no hurry to sell it. I live in Clearwater, Florida, near US-19 and Curlew and you'll need to come there to purchase it.

I don't see any marks on the breech face, or in the barrels, so I don't think this has been fired. A really nice Rossi!  There is a very small ding in the wood and a spot of thinning blue on the top of the barrel.

According to the Ithaca website this gun was manufactured in 1948. They just do not make them like this anymore.

The bottom-eject on these Ithacas make them appealing to both right- and left-handed shooters. These also make great home defense guns because they are so easy to operate, and the safety is right by the trigger finger instead of on top of the tang like most modern guns. These older Ithacas are really nice all-around shotguns, great for hunting, or shorten the barrel for a home defense gun.

Price is $375.00, plus $30 for FedEx Ground shipping and insurance (Hawaii and Alaska will cost more).

I am a private individual and this gun is part of my collection that I'm selling. Please make sure your dealer will accept shipment from a non-FFL.

Description: Each SAM7R receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

The single micro hand controller can communicate with both collars by switching to dog 1 or 2.  My wife bought this system in 2006 for use in training our 2 Westies and hardly used.  She only charged the collars about 10 cycles.  I put a new battery in the hand controller, charged both collars and everything works as it is supposed to.  Notice the one darker picture with the neon light glowing.  I'm using a ""testing tool"", which 2 are provided and showing that the collar and transmitter are communicating and ""stimulus feature"" works correctly.  I did this on both collars with same results.

I was supposed to bury the perimeter containment wire for electric fence and once I saw that the wife wasn't using, it never happened.  All components for containment system never left the original box.  This system comes with different interchangeable skin contact probes depending on the length of you dogs hair and all original documentation.  The collar straps were also cut down a little to fit our medium size dogs.  If you would like this system for very large dogs you can buy replacement straps at ""gundogsupply.com"" part #RFA-382 for $11.95.  The only flaw to note is on the micro hand controller.  Notice in several of the pictures a ""orange button"" in the center.  There is a little ""slit"" running thru center of the soft rubber of button cover.

The cheapest I found this system new online with 2nd collar goes $423.

Shipping anywhere in the US is possible if you're willing to pay cost to your location.  I am willing to use what ever is the cheapest i.e. USPS, UPS.  You can estimate yourself by using USPS or UPS online estimators from my 44060 zip code with box size of 14""L x 10""W x 8""T and weighs 8#.  There may also be a possibility to ship in a Medium USPS flat rate box for $11.85 if your didn't care about the original boxing.  I could take all components out and repack in USPS box.

If you have any questions feel free to call us, shoot us an email, or stop in and check out our large selection of NEW & USED firearms! Description: The Ruger SR-762 brings the downrange authority of the .308 cartridge to the popular SR-556 family of two-stage, piston-driven, AR-style rifles. The SR-762 is a lightweight, quick-handling carbine that is an ideal rifle for those who appreciate the familiar and ergonomic AR-style platform. The .308 Win/7.62 NATO cartridge is perfect for hunting medium and most large-sized game and enhances the capability of the AR-style platform in defensive or tactical roles. The SR-762 retains the features of the original SR556 that make it a solid performer among AR-style rifles. It comes with a Manganese Phosphate/Hardcoat Anodized finish and a precision-filed, chrome-lined, cold-hammer-forged MilSpec 41V45 chrome-coly-vanadium steel barrel. It comes with a round, smooth-sided Ruger Lightweight Adaptable handguard with flattop receiver that features a Mil-Spec 1913 Picatinny rail. It also has a Hogue Monogrip pistol grip and comes with three 20-round Magpul PMAG magazines, a soft-sided case, and three finger-grooved rail covers.

Please do not read or look at this posting if you are offended in any way.

The Cutlass measures approximately 18 inches in length and is outstanding condition with no chips, cracks, material wear marks, dents or sharpening. It is original and complete with its scabbard, frog and knot.

The handle of this Eickhorn piece is exquisite from the retaining nut at the top to antler grip with crossed brass rifles to cross guard to clamshell (with outstanding enamel button of the black, half-open winged eagle with a target in the center of the bird with the two swastikas between the words spelling out the organization Deutscher schützen verband or German Shooting Association).

The blade is incredible in regards to its artwork detail and craftsmanship.  It has the Eickhorn pattern of the set of crossed rifles and a target with the shooting hat above it.  The scene has a hunter positioned to shoot his rifle at a stag and doe jumping over a log. The pattern ends with floral designs. The reverse of the blade has the Eickhorn 1935-41 squirrel with the scene featuring a boar’s head over a hunting bag with rifle and cutlass. In the center there is a dog chasing a stag jumping over a fence and the pattern ends with floraling.

The scabbard of this Cutlass is a black leather shell equipped with decorative twin lines running the length of the edges. The reverse of the scabbard is sewn up the center. The scabbard is equipped with matching brass mounts. The leather on it is in excellent condition.  The frog is also is excellent condition beyond where the end of the Cutlass rubbed up against it when inserted into the scabbard.

Please reference the photos and ask if you have any questions on this phenomenal Eickhorn piece.

Our Mission Statement

To be Denver’s premier indoor shooting range, training, and retail center by providing An Extraordinary Recreational Experience for shooting enthusiasts of all levels.  Bristlecone Shooting, Training & Retail Center is known for top-rate, safe facilities, first-class retail, exceptional customer service delivered by knowledgeable staff, as well as an unmatched dedication to the education, training, and development of our guests.

Meet the Bristlecone Owners and Founders

We are Bryan and Jacquelyn Clark. After moving to Colorado, we discovered few indoor shooting ranges where the focus was placed on the recreational experience and where we felt at home.  What’s more, we saw that many of the private Denver-area ranges had prohibitively long waiting lists. Instead of fighting the system, we decided to work with it by creating our own ideal shooting environment.

With backgrounds in law and business development, and with years of enjoyment in the shooting sports, we are excited to provide local shooting sport enthusiasts with access to a premier indoor shooting, training, and retail center. We hope you’ll visit us soon.
Bristlecone Shooting, Training & Retail Center

The Story Behind Our Name

As a locally-owned and operated company, we wanted our name to reflect our pride in the natural beauty of our Colorado environment, as well as showcase our enthusiasm about the outdoors.  Accordingly, we named our facility after one of our favorite trees—the Rocky Mountain Bristlecone Pine. This tree is native to Colorado and grows just below the tree line in alpine regions. But that’s not what makes this pine so amazing.

Not only is the Bristlecone the oldest living organism on the planet, but the wood is durable, extremely dense, and has incredible longevity. Rather than rotting like a typical tree, the Bristlecone Pine actually erodes like stone into beautiful patterns, creating interesting and gnarled shapes.

To us, the Bristlecone Pine parallels the firearms industry, which has also proven its longevity, endurance, and adaptability to changing conditions over the years."

you cannot find this gun for sale anymore. there are a coupe fake auction sites out there that say they have sold these for 366.00 but that is 100% not true and they say that about everygun to lure you to the site. please base prices off of gunbroker.com that is the only acurate site if you must base off of an auction site. these sold for $600+ when they were in stores.

the reason they are not sold anymore... gas operated shotguns will cycle through any shell clean. most semi auto shotguns are inertia based and will only cycle through when enough inertia is made from the load. gas ones cost too much to make when people didnt know the difference between gas and inertia. so they decided to make 12g models that werent gas and discontinued the gas ones. still easy to find parts for online, not that you'll need them.

This 15-round, dual magazine, pump-action tactical shotgun features the innovation and design typical of its award-winning manufacturer, UTAS. The UTS-15 is built for maximum performance, whether in combat or fast action big game hunting. Although lightweight, the UTS-15 is fabricated primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer and is respected by law enforcement, the military and hunters alike for its strength and reliability. The UTS-15 shotgun has two 7-round magazine tubes, which can feed alternately from right magazine to left magazine or be locked for individual use as in the case of using slugs on one shot and buck on the other. A simple selector will allow you to easily switch modes to accommodate any situation. Muzzle rise is greatly reduced since most of the weight is above the barrel by placement of the magazine tubes on top. Operate the UTS-15 in any position, even sideways or upside down, due to the spring-operated shell loading carriage, keeping the shells under constant tension. No matter how slow or fast the action is pumped on this shotgun you’ll get instant shell feeding every time"

Hunt like you mean it. Kimber Model 8400 WSM rifles are lightweight but heavy on performance. Specifically designed around the shorter dimensions of the WSM case, each of the five models offers value unmatched by any other brand. Hunt with the best. Hunt with a Kimber.

Model 8400 rifles chambered for WSM cartridges feature free-floated 24-inch match grade barrels, chambers and triggers. Barreled actions are bedded on twin aluminum pillars permanently bonded into the stock, and recoil lugs are glass bedded for both strength and accuracy. Classic, Classic Stainless, Classic Select Grade and SuperAmerica models feature properly shaped classic walnut stocks with hand-rubbed oil finish and hand-cut checkering. Montana models are hard-core mountain rifles with stainless steel barreled actions and Kevlar-carbon fiber stocks. Straight combs and Pachmayr Decelerator pads dramatically reduce felt recoil. Made entirely in the Kimber factory, the Model 8400 is the finest production sporting rifle available today."
