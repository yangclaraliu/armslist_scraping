Work done by myself

-Stippled the grip and trigger guard.

-Double under-cut the trigger guard.

-Polished all internal parts (I DID NOT TOUCH the sear face or firing pin lug! Those are still factory finish!) to improve trigger... it's fantastic and crisp!

The pistol comes with factory night sights that have plenty of light left in them, 2 factory mags, factory case, and 200 rounds of .40. It feels spectacular in hand, and runs like a typewriter. ZERO fail-to-feed/fire in the 500 rounds I have put through her. Only turning this one lose because its the wrong caliber... I'm getting out of the .40 game.

What I'm Looking For

Firstly, I'm really looking to sell on this one. I have another Glock that I'm looking to seriously upgrade... That being said, I am certainly willing to consider other firearm related offers, however, I'm only interested in the following calibers; 223/556, 7.62-39, 9mm, .22lr, 12gauge. Pleas limit offers to these calibers, as I'm trying to limit my ammo stash needs! I lovem all... poly, steel, rifle, revolver, sub-compact, full-size, tacticool, vintage... never know what I'll be interested in. I will respond to all offers, and If the ad is up, I still have the pistol.

Like most inventions, our holsters were created out of necessity. After trying many of the same holsters that our customers have carried, we decided to design a holster that could not only be carried all day, but could be carried all day comfortably.

COMFORT

Comfort was our biggest motivation in the design of our unique holsters. Each Series of Nate Squared Tactical holsters are made from quality oil-tanned leather, neoprene, and suede leather. Each holster is hand crafted to ensure the highest quality possible. We firmly stand behind the quality & craftsmanship of every holster we build.

The oil-tanned leather will provide a durable, yet safe contact for the handgun.
The soft suede backing allows your skin to breathe, so even when you sweat against the holster, it will still feel cool. The natural friction coefficient of suede     displaces a percentage of the weight of your firearm. This allows you to carry the     firearm without it's total weight pulling down against your waistband. It is the suede that allows us to utilize a design with a single clip.
Neoprene is sandwiched between the oil-tanned leather and the suede leather. The neoprene provides the padding to protect you from the various edges of the firearm (slide, rear sight, hammer, beavertail,     etc.) even when sitting in a vehicle, but also protects your investment. Neoprene (what wetsuits are     made of) is waterproof, creating a moisture barrier that will not allow sweat or skin acids to come in contact with your handgun"

With reduced weight due to polymer and aluminum furniture and ample rail space for optics and attachments, as well as the reliability of the AK design chambered in a common (and cheap) U.S. round, this should probably be the one rifle you own.

This is a Russian Saiga AK factory chambered in 5.56x45 with bullet guide installed to accept Galil mags. Saigas are the only new Russian AKs on the civilian market. It has been converted to the standard AK pistol grip (Polymer) configuration with polymer Warsaw length buttstock. One 30 round polymer Galil mag comes with the rifle.

A chaos rail system has been installed with a dogleg rail over the dust cover and a quad rail on the forearm. Rails are made of aluminum with a black powder coating. The FSB has been removed, with MBUS flip sights on the rails added for sighting. Glass can be added at the dust cover or forearm. The barrel has been threaded for 15x1M (HK) muzzle adapters and re-crowned with a .223 target crown. The bore is in excellent condition with less than 250 rounds through it. It comes with an AK-74 type compensator, vertical grip, and recoil buffer. The conversion was done with Tapco trigger parts from Carolina Shooter Supply as part of their 5.56 Saiga conversion package. A textured tromix bolt handle has been added for easier hand cycling, and a Kreb's peep sight is attached for use with an added front sight like a gas block sight.

I have a lot in this rifle ($1,200+), and it is an amazing shooter with a crisp trigger pull and a smooth action. It could use a bit of touch up as far as the finish is concerned, but other than that, it is solid. Willing to work with anyone on the price.

$800 OBO. I am open to a trade, and am looking for a Ruger Gunsite Scout or comparable scout rifle."

Its in great shape, but I already have a subcompact carry gun, so I'd like to trade it for something a bit bigger, mid or full sized in 9mm. Would primarily be interested in an XD9 Service model, Glock 19, Beretta 92, Stoeger Cougar, maybe an SP2022, or similar, Would also be interested in a mid size (4 inch barrel, no snubs) .357 or .38 special revolver. No Tauruses please. Let me know what you have, but I'm only looking for a 9mm semi auto or .38 special/.357 revolver, and I'm not interested in rifles or shotguns.

Would prefer to trade but will sell the gun and laser for $450.

Serial number puts this rifle in the first batch of WIN-13s produced. All parts are marked WRA for Winchester Repeating Arms except for the 1948 Springfield Armory barrel which was probably installed by the CMP. Muzzle wear is about a 1.5.  Original parkerized finish is a nice uniform patina. Stock and handguards are in good shape with typical dings and dents but no repairs or cracks that I can see. This rifle will ship in original CMP hardcase with all the paper work that came with it from CMP.

A short history of the WIN-13 Garand by Major Dick Culver:

""Winchester was producing rifles in the 2,5XX,XXX number range in early January 1945 and suddenly and inexplicably started producing rifles with a lower serial number range starting with 1,601,000. This series of serial numbers continued through Winchester's final production at serial number 1,640,000 in June 1945 for a total of 39,000 rifles. Starting with serial number1.601,000, Winchester changed their drawing number on the right leg of the receiver from D28291-2 to D28291-Win-13. 

Production total of 39,000 rifles places the Win-13s in a position of relative rarity and the Win-13 has become one of the more sought after variations of the M1 rifle. An air of mystery will always surround the serial number switch that caused this interesting Winchester variation to be one of the least common W.W.II production rifles."""

Nice well taken care of gun here!!!

I am in the Rock Hill/York area of SC, but can meet just about anywhere at a licensed FFL dealer to sell the gun.  Will meet at a local FFL and transfer the gun to you there.  Buyer assumes costs of transfer.

Comes with a 15 rd and 17 rd magazine, box, lock key, and all paperwork.  Great value here!  Price is negotiable, and would consider a trade for Glock 19 or Sig 2022.

If you're looking for non-magnetic 7.62x39 range ammo, then Sellier & Bellot's 7.62x39 ammo is an excellent choice. This high quality brass cased ammo does not contain steel in the projectile making it acceptable to shoot at ranges that have a non-magnetic ammo only policy. Brass casings also offer the added benefit of being more corrosion resistant making them more suitable for long-term storage as well as being reloadable."

Lee-Enfield No. 4 Mk I

By the late 1930s the need for new rifles grew and the Rifle, No. 4 Mk I was first issued in 1939 but not officially adopted until 1941. The No. 4 action was similar to the Mk VI, but lighter, stronger, and most importantly, easier to mass-produce. Unlike the SMLE, the No 4 Lee-Enfield barrel protruded from the end of the forestock. The No. 4 rifle was considerably heavier than the No. 1 Mk. III, largely due to its heavier barrel and a new bayonet was designed to go with the rifle: a spike bayonet, which was essentially a steel rod with a sharp point and was nicknamed ""pigsticker"" by soldiers. Towards the end of the Second World War, a bladed bayonet was developed, originally intended for use with the Sten gun‚Äîbut sharing the same mount as the No. 4's spike bayonet‚Äîand subsequently the No. 7 and No. 9 blade bayonets were issued for use with the No. 4 rifle as well.

I am willing to trade my Glock 23 Gen 4 with advanced upgraded spring set and trigger spring set for a much smoother and quicker trigger pull and reset. Factory sights and comes with three mags. to sweeten the deal if necessary I can throw in a few hundred rounds and a KingTuk holster (never opened). Pistol is broken in and treated very well, always cleaned thoroughly after each use. great pistol but need the shotgun. Gotta feed the family in these hard times. serious inquiries only please. my gun is worth more then a standard uses rem 870 or moss 500 so please keep the offers fair.

Description

From tactical training to plinking, varmint hunting to home defense, the HTA 90/22√¢‚Äû¬¢ from High Tower Armory√¢‚Äû¬¢ is the perfect stock system for your shooting needs. The High Tower Armory 90/22 is a compact, maneuverable stock kit for the Ruger√Ç¬Æ 10/22√Ç¬Æ which utilizes a bullpup design for superior balance and ergonomics. This incredibly durable, military grade polymer stock will reduce the overall length of most 10/22√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s to about 26 1/2 inches, just over the federally required minimum length for rifles. The HTA 90/22 also features a CNC machined monolithic aluminum Picatinny optics rail and aluminum bedding block, steel trigger linkage, as well as an ambidextrous steel charging handle which cycles the factory 10/22 bolt from forward positions. A safety extension is included to allow the original factory safety to be activated, in addition to a safety selector located near the trigger. This kit comes complete with a removable dummy suppressor, two side mounted Picatinny rails, and a detachable ammunition storage box for holding spare rounds in the field. Accepts factory 10 round magazines as well as most aftermarket high capacity magazines. Fits factory 18 1/2"" and .920"" bull barrels at least 18 inches in length (17 1/4 inches from receiver face to muzzle). Made in the USA. *Ruger 10/22 not included.

WARNING:¬†The HTA 90/22 can¬†NOT¬†be used by left-hand shooters as shell casings and hot gases are expelled near the shooter√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s face when firing from the left shoulder.

IMPORTANT:¬†PLEASE CHECK THAT YOUR RUGER 10/22 BARREL IS AT LEAST 18√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ IN LENGTH. MOST 10/22 barrels are long enough to produce a legal length rifle in the 90/22 stock system. However, some 10/22 variants and aftermarket barrels are shorter than 18"". Federal law requires rifles to have a minimum overall length of 26√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ. The HTA 90/22 requires a minimum barrel length of 18"" to achieve the 26"" overall length. You can check your barrel length by removing the barrel from the 10/22 receiver and measuring it from muzzle to breech. See the FAQ page for more information.

This is a brand new in box Colt LE6920 AR-15 semi-automatic rifle chambered for 5.56mm NATO. Throughout the world today, Colt's reliability, performance, and accuracy provide the confidence required to accomplish any mission. Colt's LE6920 Carbine shares many features of its combat-proven brother, the Colt M4. The heart of this carbine is its 16.1"" chrome-lined barrel. With a 1 in 7"" twist, ammunition selection is virtually unlimited. Colt teamed up with Magpul Industries to outfit this carbine with the most highly sought after accessories. A Magpul MOE carbine stock, MOE pistol grip, MOE vertical grip, and a Magpul Back-up Sight all come as standard equipment on this exceptional carbine. It has a ""F"" marked front sight gas block. A Troy Industries quad railed handguard is equipped, offering ample space for mounting popular accessories such as vertical grips, tactical lights, laser sights, and many others.

Though this is a new in box rifle, it was received from Colt with some a small scratch on the receiver. We have adjusted our price accordingly.
