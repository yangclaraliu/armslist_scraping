 This handgun has exactly 45 rounds through it. It shoots like a dream (Itâs a Sig). I purchased this handgun unfired a couple of months ago. Itâs a very nice gun. I enjoy it very much.

 The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleetâs special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.The slide is Nitron coated, and the frame hard anodized black. All external and internal parts are âphosphateâ coated, for resistance to salt water etc. It also has SIG Night sights.

 I have owned and do own, several Sig Sauer handguns. This Pistol is beautiful and would make a dependable, accurate sidearm. My only reason for offering in trade is that it is the last 9mm I own at this point. I am making the jump to complete .45, as those are the only other calibers I own. If I canât find a suitable trade for this MK25, I will happily keep it and leave it in the safe.

 Because this is the last 9mm I own, I have lots of extras to add to this package for the right deal.

 (1) Sig P226 9mm MK25, case, certification paperwork etc.

 (19) 15 round 226 magazines! Some are Sig, some are Mecgear some Promag, a few have no name. All work.

 (1) Set of Hogue replacement grips for P226

 (3) left handed holsters

 (1) Ambi shoulder universal holster

 Around 1000 in 9mm ammunition. Ranges from brass, to Aluminum, lead to home defense rounds. Blazer, UMC, PMC, Remington, Horniday Critical defense, Winchester etc

 This really is a complete package. Its worth quite a bit when you do the math. That being said, it is not for sale. I am only interested in giving this up for the right trade.

EDIT: Since I've had so many people requesting a sale price, The sale price is 1500 FIRM for everything. I'm not willing to negotiate sorry. 

 In order of preference:

 Sig Sauer P227 Tacops
 Sig Sauer P227
 Sig Sauer P220 Elite series
 Sig Sauer P220 Scorpion
 Sig Sauer 1911 Tacops or other railed 1911 series.
 Quality railed 1911âs of other manufacturers

âWhat we need to stand up and say is not only did they attack the USS Liberty, they did 9/11. They did it. I have had long conversations over the past two weeks with contacts at the Army War College, at itâs headquarters, Marine Corps and I made it absolutely clear in both cases that it is 100 percent certain that 9/11 was a Mossad operation. Period.â

Dr. Alan Sabrosky â Ph.D, University of Michigan, Former Director of Studies at the Army War College

âAll the intelligence services of America and Europeâ¦ know full well that the disastrous attack ( of 9/11 ) has been planned and realized from the Mossad.. with the aid of the Zionist world in order to put under accusation the Arabic countries and in order to induce the Western Powers to? take partâ¦ in Iraq and Afghanistan.â

Francesco Cossiga â the 43rd Prime Minister and the eighth President of the Italy. He was also a professor of constitutional law at the University of Sassari. (now deceased)

âFor the best and bravest documentary about Israeli false flag terror, watch filmmaker Mike Delaneyâs 9/11 Missing Links.â

Capt Eric May â Former Army Intelligence (with specialties in nuclear, biological and chemical warfare, military intelligence and public affairs), Staff Writer For VeteransTodays.com (He is also a former NBC editorial writer who has published widely, from Military Intelligence Magazine to The Wall Street Journal)


âNow you will discover the definitive truth about 9/11 and learn why even the most popular movies on the subject have failed to address the evidence exhaustively presented in this video. The facts will make it abundantly clear that the so-called 9/11 âTruthâ movement has been infiltrated and is ultimately controlled by the same criminal group who masterminded the attacks. As they say, âif you want to control the dissent, you lead the dissent.â Utilizing evidence from the FBI, CIA, NSA, US Armed Forces Intelligence sectors, Foreign Intelligence organizations, local law enforcement agencies and independent investigators, Missing Links goes where no other 9/11 video has dared to.â"

It takes anything from 2 3/4"" to 3 1/2"" shells so it is a great duck or goose gun. Absolutely nothing wrong with it aside from a few scratches or very slight wear marks on the receiver. Never abused or dropped, it was my hunting gun so its been through some fields and brush. I'm looking for another shotgun, primarily a slug gun strictly for deer hunting. What I'd really like to get for it is a slug gun in 12 or 20 gauge. FOID IS A MUST"

Whole Package is $850 cash value or Trade Value of $900. If not sold together then part values are Upper: $650, BCG & Charging Handle: $200. 

If you want the whole package I am working with BCMâs current list price for the Upper, Plus what I paid for the BCG. Original Prices: $1064 for the upper (BCM currently has these uppers listed on sale for $699 but they are out of stock), $169 for the BCG, and $44.95 for the charging handle. Thatâs $1278 total! As BCM puts it âYou save $428.00â - The Daniel Defense rail alone goes for $399.

I bought this upper when they first came out on the BCM site. In fact I went back and ordered another one later for second build. It was before they offered a BCG with their uppers so I bought mine separately. And just to show you I am not BSing you I have a print screen from my original order back in May."

I don't grade guns, nor am I a professional photographer. I've attempted to take the best photos I can and will describe the condition as best I can but please feel free to contact me if you have questions. I can be contacted by email or by phone at REDACTED. Ok, here goes nothing...The gun is in pretty good condition. The grips are darn near perfect. There is some light markings on each side of the frame under barrel. There is also a mark on the left side of the 7"" barrel about 1"" from the bore end. There is a small spot also under the gun just in front of the trigger guard. I have taken plenty of pictures and you should be able to see the marks in the pictures if you look at them. The 2 mags show some wear as expected but no damage. This is really a great pistol and will make a wonderful addition to any collection. Not to mention it's a very accurate pistol."

This weapon is absolutely perfect for someone who wants to carry a weapon at all times comfortably and have the element of surprise in their corner! 

LOOK AT MY DEAL...If you bought this weapon new it retails WITHOUT the Crimson Trace laser for $340 to $389.00 plus tax. The Crimson Trace Laser would be an additional $179.00 accessory plus tax. I'm INCLUDING IT in my entire selling price of $400.00!!!! But that's not all as you'll see down below!

UNLIKE OTHER LASERS the Crimson Trace laser is activated when the gun is gripped...and wherever the red dot is...that's where the bullet is going! No more worrying about hitting your target! There are cheaper manual on-off switch lasers like LaserMax and LaserLyte out there for around $100-$150, but they are not even close to the product quality of Crimson Trace. 

I'm also including an Elite ""inside the pocket"" holster which makes the weapon completely unnoticeable while carrying it in your pocket and so comfortable you can actually forget that you have a weapon in your pocket. If you went out and purchased an Elite pocket holster it retails for $27 plus tax. Again...I'M INCLUDING IT!

And finally...the Golden Saber +P ammo is a personal favorite ammo choice of mine for the shear ballistic power. It's an additional $25 if you went out and purchased it...but I'M INCLUDING IT free of charge in the deal! 

Weapon comes in the original box with a Ruger logo nylon zipper pouch.

That makes MY entire package valued at nearly $600 when adding everything up. 

BUT I'M SELLING IT ALL TO THE FIRST $400 FIRM! THAT'S RIGHT...$400 FIRM!!!  

Do your own research then you'll know that this is A STEAL OF A DEAL!! But you better hurry because this deal won't last long before somebody grabs it quick!

The STG-556 is a Steyr AUG A1 clone manufactured by Microtech Small Arms Research (MSAR). It was introduced at the 2007 SHOT Show. The STG-556's working system features a bolt release as seen on the M16 rifle; otherwise, the STG-556 retains the features similar to the Steyr AUG, such as having the quick-change barrel option and the ability to change which side the weapon ejects from by changing the bolt out for a right or left side bolt respectively. The STG-556 ships standard with right side ejector. The STG-556 is unable to use M-16 style magazines in most versions,other versions use the Steyr proprietary mags. The STG-556 is a short-stoke gas piston. The STG-556 rifle can be converted from either having a telescopic sight or a MIL-STD-1913 rail."

AR500 ArmorÂ® Level III Body Armor is manufactured from an extremely rugged ballistic grade steel core and coated with our PAXCON (a division of Line-X) spall and fragmentation protective coating. Our ballistic steel plate is unmatched in the industry and is formulated and treated specifically to our specifications for improved consistency, durability, and then tested to NIJ standards. Our ballistic plate core is stress fracture resistant, features an ultra-low profile of only .25â, and is designed to handle extreme abuse in day to day use, training, and less than ideal storage conditions. AR500 ArmorÂ® body armor will outlast alternative armor solutions such as Ceramic, Dyneema, UHMWPE, and raw/uncoated steel trauma plates.

Level III Rating: AR500 ArmorÂ® body armor is Stand-Alone and Multi-Hit capable. Designed to defeat rifle threats up to 7.62x51 M80 NATO Ball (.308 Winchester) at velocities up to 2,780 feet per second and all pistol calibers.

Our 8â x 10â Advanced Shooters Cut (ASC) plates are designed to fit in plate carriers with adjustable plate retention straps, and for those looking for the lightest most compact rifle protection while still maintaining vital coverage; or in dedicated Extra-Small and Small size plate carriers capable of accepting X-Small and Small SAPI body armor plates. These are an ideal choice when rifle threat protection is desired and weight and size constraints are in place. Just as rugged and reliable as our 10â x 12â plates, our 8â x 10â model is an affordable and versatile compact armor solution.

Featuring and ergonomic form, our curved 8"" x 10"" plate further improves ergonomics over standard flat body armor plates. The curve contours to your body and is recommended if you wear your body armor on a regular basis, or for duty use. A specific radius has been chosen for maximum comfort as a front or back plate for operators of varying height and weight; our curved 8"" x 10"" body armor can be used in either position in your plate carrier. To achieve the best ergonomics possible we recommend a curved front and back plate.

AR500 ArmorÂ® 8â x 10âBody Armor Features:

â¢8â x 10â body armor will fit in Plate Carriers with adjustable plate retention straps or ones that are capable of accepting X-Small and Small SAPI body armor plates

This 338 Win. Mag. load is the most versatile of all 338 Win. Mag. loads. The Barnes 225gr. TSX has no polymer tip to accelerate expansion on impact and therefore opens more slowly than the tipped versions of the TSX bullet. This slower start to expansion causes slightly deeper penetration than the tipped versions allow and this matters when shooting large animals such as moose and bison at bad angles. If I could use only one load for all my 338 hunting, this would be it because of its versatility. This Barnes 225gr. TSX bullet will normally penetrate deeper than 250gr. premium style partition bullets, yet it gives the higher velocity, flatter trajectory and lighter recoil of the 225gr. bullet.

 For smaller big game animals weighing under 600lbs, you will find our item 52D, (210gr. TTSX) which is tipped and gives more instant expansion, to deliver a more dramatic impact than the TSX bullet. Animals weighing under 600lbs do not need the extra penetration the TSX bullet gives over the TTSX bullet and the TTSX bullet will make larger entrance wounds and do more initial damage.

Both my 338âs have custom 22 inch barrels as the below velocities show. For your reference, 24 inch barrels will GENERALLY give almost 75 fps more velocity than 22 inch barrels and 26 inch barrels will GENERALLY give 50 to 60 fps more than 24 inch barrels.

For those of you who are not familiar with DAK its easy, its a double action only with a 6.6lb trigger pull everytime! DAK is amazing, it eliminates the traditional da pull of 10+lbs and it eliminates the need to cock and de-cock the firearm as needed! Very smooth and tastefully modest at 6.6lb pull everytime! It has the E2 grip kit. It comes with 2 magazines and i can add 160 FMJ's and 25 Golden Saber HP's. As you can see by the pictures, this firearm is in MINT condition! I am a Sig Sauer Armor and when I clean my Sigs, I clean my Sigs lol (full breakdown to the last pin)! This firearm has a minimal round count (40 rds fired as I bought 200 rds with it and your getting the other 160) and a fully disassembled and detail cleaning afterward. As you can see, there are very few IF ANY of the P229R DAK's listed on armslist. Price is very fair considering these go for $899-$929 in the stores plus taxes! That puts you at or just over $1000 out the door! Why pay that if you can have mine which is next to brand new at $400 less (not to mention im adding $75-$100 in ammo depending on where u buy it). Thanks and hope to hear from you soon. Taking best offer! Text me at 937fourzeroseven7251

PS. I was asked about the extractor so im including the info here. It is equipped with the ""short"" extractor, the good one, lol. The short extractor can be taken apart for cleaning with a simple screwdriver and then popped back in, the ""long"" extractor however, has a roll pin that has to be removed in order to remove the extractor. That roll pin is ""sacrificial"" meaning that once you remove it in order to remove the extractor, the roll pin has to be replaced with a new one. So yea, this P229 has the good extractor! ;)"

Here are the specs:

The Weaver Tactical Grand Slam Rifle Scope offers fully multi-coated Japanese lenses that reduce glare and give you edge to edge clarity and exceptional low light performance with 94% light transmission. All Grand Slams feature a fast focus eyepiece adjustment ring, and sure-grip power ring that helps you adjust the variable power scopes even with heavy gloves on. Finally, the Grand Slam's solid, 1-piece tube construction makes them waterproof, fogproof and shockproof. This scope features resettable 1/10 milliradian (MIL) windage and elevation turrets and a Mil-dot reticle, this is also known as MIL/MIL. The combination of these two features enables the shooter to make quick and precise corrections. By using the Mil-dot reticle to measure how far off the shot is in MILs, each dot is 1 MIL apart, the shooter does not need to convert milliradians to minutes of angle in order to correct the point of aim. With traditional 1/4 MOA turrets, if the point of impact is measured to be 1.5 mils low the shooter needs to convert the Mils to MOA and then adjust the turrets which can be confusing. With a Mil/Mil rifle scope if the shot is 1.5 mils low then the shooter simply turns the turret 1.5 mils or 15 clicks. The mil-dot reticle can also be used to determine how far away an object of known size is.
