I also have a hybrid iwb Comp-Tac Minotaur holster for the pistol. I don't think they make these holsters anymore and I don't see any ""Minotaur"" holsters on their site anymore. It shows some wear to the leather but is perfectly functional. I'd include that for $50.

It also comes with magazine well block adapter so that you can utilize the 32 round STEN magazine with a standard MILSPEC lower receiver. The 8.5 inch barrel is chambered for 9mm Luger and has a 1 in 16"" rate of twist and is ready for installation onto any standard AR-15 lower receiver. This assembly will only work with a standard MILSPEC lower receiver with the Olympic Arms 9mm polymer magazines or 32 round STEN magazines with the magazine well block adapter. It can also work with a “dedicated” 9mm lower if you change out the barrel and bolt carrier group assembly. This is an unfinished project that I have no need for anymore. The photos describe everything in detail. The last/bottom photo of the complete rifle is for illustrational purposes only utilizing the use of the adapter and STEN magazine--This is NOT my rifle because I borrowed the photo from the internet just for that reason.

This upper will fit and operate flawlessly on any MILSPEC AR lower. Allowing you to easily swap out your 5.56/.223 upper and begin firing 9mm ammo with no other changes to your AR pistol. All ATF rules apply to the new owner-which means this complete receiver can only added to an AR pistol platform or an ATF approved SBR. Don’t get caught without the legal paperwork from the ATF or local Law Enforcement. 

If you have inquiries or questions, all that I ask is that you would respect the seller’s wishes when the questions/inquiries are answered. What I am asking is--please don't low ball my selling price for any outrageous offer. The selling price is $625. All ATF laws apply in this transaction. This is not the first time that I've sold other firearms of mine. I don't have to sell this item, but since I own many other AR pistols in different calibers, I'd figure that I'd give a try out on the website. You can email me or text me @ REDACTED for more details or questions. I accept PayPal payments for this transaction as well if buyer wants it shipped. Shipping costs (USPS w/tracking # @ approximately $15) will apply to the buyer. I thank you for your time and inquiries."

The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.

TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission."

Recently had over $1050 worth of custom work to include parts performed. This included an accuracy and combat trigger (4.5 LB) job, new parts consist of Ed Brown Memory Groove Beavertail Grip Safety, Extractor, Disconnector, Ejector, Match Sear, a Videcki Combat trigger, a Wilson Combat two piece guide rod and a 25 LPI steel main spring housing. Feed Ramp was lightly milled and mirror polished, all springs with a Wolff combat pack, have currently installed a set of black/gray VZ Operators Grips but included are a second set of VZ Operator black micarta smooth finish grips. Prior to having the weapon given a fresh black parkerization finish application I sent the slide/frame to Mr. Woody at Gunfancy and had him recut all the lettering, that alone was over $200. The Gunsmith custom work was performed by a Combat Applications Group (Delta Force - CAG) Retired Senior Weapons Armorer who runs a local gunsmith shop serving the Fort Bragg/Fayetteville/Moore County surrounding area. Comes with 3 Wilson Combat 7 round magazines, one Colt factory 6 round, Bianchi IWB Holster, original box and manual. Since custom work weapon has seen 5 magazines through it, it would have more but range time but I can't handle the bore axis recoil on this shorty. This is mostly due to an old but recently returned hand injury, so this jewel sadly will go to help customize a Browning Hi Power 9mm project. Free shipping to all lower 48, AK/HI will have to pay, sorry, just too costly! Thanks for looking, note, it is for sale locally so despite the online GB auction it could be sold at any time, lowered my reserve price which does not cover the parts/custom work to set this weapon up for a quick sale to some lucky shooter, don't miss out on a very nicely tuned Officer's Model. Spotting on forward tip of slide in Gray VZ Grip pictures is an oil smudge, sorry, didn't see it on my camera. Money is hard earned today, you can rest assured you will get quality, please take a moment and scan my feedback, I take care of everyone who purchases from me, I pride myself in ""old school"" customer service and honesty.

The ATN Night Storm-HPT Night Vision Monocular, HPT, Black (NVMNNSTMHOB) is a commercially developed waterproof Night Vision Scope designed for Boating, Camping and other recreational uses. The ATN Night Storm HPT Black features all-glass six-element lens system with ATN proprietary IR sensitive coating, single simple to operate digital control and an Infrared Illuminator for total darkness usage. This Night Vision Scope from the line of ATN Night Vision Equipment is an excellent alternative to Night Vision Binoculars. A quality HPT image intensifier in a robust, floatable exterior shell makes the ATN Night Storm HPT Black ideal for your Night Vision needs.

HPT tubes are an upgrade of the CGT Generation tube. They are a Multi-Alkali compact 18 mm format MCP Image Intensifier. The HPT tube increases sensitivity, resolution, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). These improvements produce an exceptional image clarity and brightness. Most HPT specifications typically are equivalent to standard 3rd generation. Highlights of the HPT specifications are the typical SNR of 22 and resolution of 54-72 lp/mm.

The ATN Night Storm HPT Black Monocular is the latest in technology and the newest addition to the ATN line of Night Vision products. Strict standards and precision manufacturing have brought to you a rugged, yet lightweight, waterproof Night Vision Device, which provides superior optical calibration at an economical cost. Revolutionizing the Night Vision market was one of ATN's top priorities. They accomplished our this by combining a 6-element, F1.2, 50mm, heavy-coated glass lens with the ability to be submersed under water. They also were able to include a number of other options to make this unit even more superior than it was already. The sleek body, with contoured finger rests, houses a powerful high-resolution HPT generation intensifier tube which allow a 35,000 max light amplification. Once you enter a completely dark where no ambient light is to be found, you can take advantage of our built-in Total Darkness Technology which our Infrared Illuminator will provide. The unit also has an optional camera adapter, which will allows you to turn a regular household camera into a Night Vision camera.

If optimal picture is what you are in the market for, the ATN Night Storm HPT Black will satisfy your needs. The unit's diopter adjustment of +/- 5 and 1 m to infinity range of focus will allow you to focus in on any object in range. The ATN Night Storm HPT Black is one of the most accurate imaging devices on the market at a reasonable price.

Glock introduced the Glock 24 series of pistols at the 1994 SHOT Show. At first glance, the Glock 24 appears to be just another Glock 17L. But one only needs to look at the bigger hole in the end of the barrel to know that here is a ""real"" pistol. The Glock 24 has an overall length of 8.85 inches with a six-inch barrel. Height, including the magazine, is 5.45 inches, and it weighs 26.5 ounces unloaded, 2.2 ounces more than the Glock 17L. The grip has impressed checkering on front and rear for a firm grip. It has the same 3.5-pound trigger and extended magazine release as the Glock 17L and is available with either fixed or adjustable sights. Magazines made before President Clinton's infamous Crime Bill held 15 rounds, while later pistols come with 10-rounders. Even with the lower capacity magazine, with one up the spout, you ought to have enough rounds to solve almost any IPSC course ""problem,"" if you do your part. And like all new Glock magazines, the G24's fall free of the gun when the release is pressed, even when fully loaded. But Glock had one more surprise; the Glock 24 was available in two versions: plain barrel (24) or vented barrel (24C). The plain barrel Glock 24 meets all USPSA rules for use in Limited Class matches and is ideally suited for that purpose. The vented barrel Glock 24C is aimed (excuse the pun) directly at IPSC Open Class, and to a lesser degree at that other action pistol sport, bowling pin shooting.

The Glock 24C's barrel venting system is completely different from the earlier Glock l7Ls. Beginning 2 7/8 inches aft of the chamber are a series of four oval vents of increasing size cut into the top of the barrel, with the last one being 1 1/8 inches back from the muzzle. Powder gases are vented up out of each hole in tum as the bullet travels down the barrel. Gas pressure is lowered as the bullet travels past each vent hole, making it necessary for the next one to be larger to vent out a suitable amount of gas so as to continue the action of forcing down the barrel and reducing muzzle flip. The theory of the Glock 24Cs barrel vents is very similar to that of the ""Hybrid"" compensator system, which is finding increasing favor among serious action pistol shooters.

As a confirmed ""Glocker"" I was anxious to get my hands on one of the new 24s. The folks at Glock, Inc., in Smyrna, Georgia, kindly supplied me with one of the vented barrel Glock 24Cs to test. When the pistol arrived, the first thing I did was compare it to my Glock 17L. Except for the uncheckered grips on my early 17L, there was nothing to tell the two pistols apart at first glance. But I do have to admit that the 24, which was a new gun right off the assembly line, had a much nicer trigger than my well used 17L, a fact much appreciated when I started using it at IPSC and bowling pin matches. The pistol came with Glock's standard fixed sights, featuring a white dot front and white outlined rear notch. But enough looking - pistols are made for shooting, so it was off to my gun club to try it out. I took along several necessities: my adjustable pistol rest, targets, my Chrony Model F-1 chronograph and a supply of .40 S&W ammunition. I had a fairly varied assortment of test ammo, including Winchester, Remington, Hansen and some remanufactured ammo from 3-D Ammunition & Bullet Co. I arranged to borrow a Glock 22 from my friend Mark Craven so I could compare velocities between the standard length and long-barreled Glocks."

For sale or trade is a Charter Arms AR-7 Explorer - Survival Rifle. Email for photos. 
This is identical Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, as everything folds into the stock. Stock only holds one magazine, however. 1 magazine included. 6+1 capacity. 22LR. Peep sight with adjustable aperture. 

If you read up, you will see all AR7's have an occasional FTF issue. this one being no exception, however it was never overly often.

Was a fun novelty at the range. Doesn't fit in the collection any more. Wont be in a position to use it as intended either. Save yourself $90 from the Henry! 

Basically will only trade for a 10/22 receiver with $60 or a Pac-Lite upper and depending on the model will depend how much cash on top. 

Nice video of what i believe is the exact model of mine -

Fresh tune up! Rare most powerful air pistol. The Hy-Score pistol of the 700-series is unique, in that they are the only adult spring pistol made in this country. Model 700 was the first designed by Andrew Lawrence, the model 700 was the first iteration of the pistol. It was produced in 1947 only, and today commands about twice what an 800 brings. Also, the 700s don’t lose as much value as their condition deteriorates. If you’ve seen an 800, the 700 will look very familiar. The biggest differences were in the methods of manufacture, with the 700 being made more of solid steel and requiring more machining time. Novel cocking, too a latch unlocks the power plant tube, allowing the shooter to lift it up and tilt it forward. A link in the frame drags the piston forward during this motion until the sear catches it. This is reminiscent of the Beeman P1 (HW45) cocking process. The trigger uses leverage to reduce the pull, but nothing reduces a rather long, creepy movement. It is certainly not a target trigger, despite the word “target” in the pistol’s name. There is no adjustment; by opening the gun a small amount, you do get a dry-fire capability."

Fresh tune up! Rare most powerful air pistol. I live in Rochester,MN , but I am in Minneapolis every week(Franklin Avenue SE) and I can bring air gun to show you.
The Hy-Score pistol of the 700-series is unique, in that they are the only adult spring pistol made in this country. Model 700 was the first designed by Andrew Lawrence, the model 700 was the first iteration of the pistol. It was produced in 1947 only, and today commands about twice what an 800 brings. Also, the 700s don’t lose as much value as their condition deteriorates. If you’ve seen an 800, the 700 will look very familiar. The biggest differences were in the methods of manufacture, with the 700 being made more of solid steel and requiring more machining time. Novel cocking, too a latch unlocks the power plant tube, allowing the shooter to lift it up and tilt it forward. A link in the frame drags the piston forward during this motion until the sear catches it. This is reminiscent of the Beeman P1 (HW45) cocking process. The trigger uses leverage to reduce the pull, but nothing reduces a rather long, creepy movement. It is certainly not a target trigger, despite the word “target” in the pistol’s name. There is no adjustment; by opening the gun a small amount, you do get a dry-fire capability."

If you aren't familiar with the Cougar design it is the precursor to the Beretta PX4 and uses a rotating barrel action to improve accuracy and lower recoil. Identical to the Beretta Cougar aside from the name on the slide; Beretta transferred the tooling and manufacturing equipment to Stoeger, Stoeger being a subdivision of Benelli, which is in turn owned by Beretta. Has the same manual of arms as a Beretta 92/M9, so its a great choice if you're looking for a more compact version for carry.

Has some light holster wear from being carried but overall is in good shape, bought new about two months ago and only has about 200 rounds through it. Will come with two 13 round magazines. Depending on what you have I can also include an extra 15 round magazine (modified Beretta 92 mag) and I have a fair amount of 9mm ammo.

Primarily looking for a subcompact 9mm striker fired pistol in trade, really looking for a Ruger SR9c or LC9s (must be the striker fired LC9s, not interested in the standard LC9). Might also consider a J frame sized .38 special snub, but must have an exposed hammer (S&W 637, Ruger LCRx, etc). No Tauruses or Kel Tec's please.  Might be interested in other similar firearms, and would be willing to add cash to a deal depending on what you have.

This shotgun is almost new and lightly used with only about twenty shells through it. If you are not familiar with this shotgun it is made in Turkey by the same factories that make the Canik CZ75 clones and TP9, Winchester SXP, and many other quality firearms. This is a 5+1 pump action that will chamber 3 inch shells. Has a built in recoil pad and pistol grip, as well as a nice set of fiber optic ghost ring sights, a receiver mounted picatinny rail, a removable breacher choke, and is VERY lightweight. This is a Benelli pattern shotgun and will accept extended benelli magazine tubes. Very similar to a Benelli M3 (sans the semi auto functionality) for a fraction of the cost.

Im interested in several things in trade. Ive had a few shotguns with pistol grips and ring sights and Ive found that I prefer a straight stock with a bead sight. This shotgun retails for $299, Id like to trade it for a similalrly priced 12 gauge shotgun with a straight stock, bead sight, and 18-20 inch cylinder bore barrel, such as a Remington 870, Mossberg 500/maverick 88, winchester sxp, or similar. Only looking for combat/hd style shotguns, absolutely not interested in field guns, sorry.
 Might also be interested in a Taurus M85 or similar snub .38 special revolver, or a Polish P-64, or similar PPK style pistol in .32 acp, .380, or 9x18mm. Maybe a Ruger LCP or LC9, Taurus 709 or 740.
 Would also be interested in a case of 5.56 ammo or a Vortex Strikefire red dot and magnifier.
 Im also looking for a progressive reloading press, my turret is just too slow for the volume I reload.
 Might consider other firearms but no .22's or household junk. Looking for a trade value of $300-350, will consider partial trades plus cash.

If not interested in trading I will sell for $200 firm. I also have a decent amount of ammo, 50 shells of buckshot and 50 shells of various birdshot I can include for $50 extra.

Comes in original Glock hard case, along with all the paperwork and two 10 round magazines that do have the Pearce extensions on them, which makes them 12 round mags. For such a small hand gun, being able to carry 12 rounds per mag plus one in the chamber is way more practical than something like the Sig 938 or 238 or the S&W Shield which only contains approximately 6 rounds per magazine--that's twice the number of bullets per magazine!!
I am simply getting rid of this gun because I acquired it on a trade and have no use for it. It is a beautiful little thing, but I don't have any room for it in the safe and could really use some extra cash to help finish up a project I started a while back.

The mileage is 170,xxx and won't climb much higher since this car is no longer my daily driver.

All of these parts were replaced with brand new parts. This would make a great every day driver or first car for teenager.

The upper receiver assembly was originally built by Marty himself using one of the extra-thick DPMS upper receivers, a 20"" stainless Lothar Walther barrel, and a knurled aluminum handguard (one of the Castle Arms uppers). The upper receiver became a stumbling block when it came to installing a LaRue 13.2"" railed handguard, as the thickness made it impossible to insert the rail's screws. I had to hire a machinist to relieve a small pocket on each side of the receiver for the screws."

This auction is for one used second generation Glock 19 handgun with one magazine(no extra magazines). It is used, but in good condition, but there is a ton of wear/scratches on the right side of the grip from rubbing against something while in a holster. I put a couple mags through this handgun, it function perfectly. It has night sights, they are pretty dim, but you can still see them a bit at night. I believe this is a New York police trade-in, so it has a little heavier trigger pull. 

This is from my personal collection, I'm not an FFL. Make sure your FFL will accept shipments from individuals. For an additional fee, I should be able to ship it through dealer, if your transfer dealer requires it. The magazine included is a brand new 15 round factory mag. Make sure it is legal in your state. If you live in a state where it is legal, but the magazine is not, I can pin it to 10 rounds or swap it for a factory 10 round mag."

 Description: 
 The Micro Might handgun is a five shot, fixed cylinder mini-revolver. It is designed around an historical and simple single action mechanism. By ""fixed cylinder"" means that the cylinder does not swing out of the frame for loading and unloading. Removal of the cylinder is accomplished by removing the cylinder base pin and taking the cylinder completely out of the frame. By ""single action"" means that the trigger performs only one function: it releases the hammer.
 Ammunition Warning
 Micro Might Inc. produces and sells Micro Might handguns designed and chambered for two different calibers. The intended caliber is noted both on the shipping and storage box and on the barrel of the Micro Might handgun itself. If your revolver is chambered for 22LR, any good quality factory made 22 caliber ammunition in long rifle, long or short may be safely used in the revolver. The revolver will also safely handle high velocity 22 ammunition.
 If your revolver is chambered for 22WMRF ammunition, ONLY USE 22WMRF cartridges. This designation stands for 22 caliber Winchester Magnum Rimfire ammunition. Use of standard 22 caliber ammunition in the 22WMRF revolvers can result in malfunctions and serious injuries.
