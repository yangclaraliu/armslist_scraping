Handcrafted shelf with a drop down hidden compartment and hidden pull pin. Its made of distressed pine.  If your looking for a very clever sneaky place to hide your valuables, handgun, jewelry, cash etc. Here it is.   It measures overall approximately 18 1/2"" side to side, 8"" front to back and 3 1/2"" tall.  The drop down compartment has a useable area measuring 12 1/2"" wide, 5 1/2"" front to back and 1 3/4"" top to bottom.  The bottom is covered with a carpet liner.  You have quick access to the bottom compartment by pulling the disguised pin on the side (see the pics).  It looks like a decorative part of the shelf. Very sneaky and hard to figure out if you don't know what it does.  A thief can't steel what they can't find is what I had in mind when I created it.  I use screws to assemble the primary supporting structure .  That along with the way it is affixed to the wall it is very strong.  See the 4th picture.  Yes that's a 44lb concrete block sitting on it with no problems.  However I rate them at a 20lb capacity total inside and out to be on the safe side.  I custom build these in my Smoky Mountain Tennessee shop.  You will receive a shelf only like in the 1st picture stained special walnut.  I also offer a unfinished one that you can paint or stain yourself.  See my other listings.  It comes completely assembled as pictured.  Also included is 2 drywall mounting screws and a Velcro strap with screw that you can mount anywhere you want inside the compartment to secure any loose item you want.  The gun, picture, wagon, outhouse and candle pictured is for display purposes only and is not included with the shelf.  I ship every business day.  Credit cards and Pay pal Accepeted.

I bought this a couple weeks ago (used), ran 50 rounds through it, and decided I'm not manly enough. :(

However, if you're a red meat eating, hairy chested, dually driving brute, then this is the rig for you! Guaranteed to impress your friends on Facebook and send everyone else on the firing line cringing for cover and holding their ears after the first shot.

Comes with 4 mags and about 110 rounds of Hornaday 300gr jacketed hollow points, plus about 50 rounds of brass. I also have the holster for it. I'm not sure how to ship the ammo, so you gotta bear with me on that one.

Shoots awesome groups when you can keep from flinching. Condition is pretty good. These black models are prone to surface rust, but this one has survived pretty well so far. Shows some light holster wear and use. Nothing offensive, just trying to give full disclosure for no rude surprises.

Comes with original box, both cylinders, lock, manual, and original rosewood grips and hardware.  It currently has a Hogue Monogrip fitted (included) which is quite comfortable, but easily refitted with the original rosewood grips (included).

This revolver has very few rounds through it and neither cylinder has scoring.  The condition is like-new-in-box.  You'd be hard pressed to find any flaws in the condition.  It's a lot of fun to shoot--I'm just changing things up in my collection.

The gun is on display (for sale) at Gilcrest Farm Supply (FFL) and can be inspected and purchased Monday-Saturday.  This is John Taylor's store in Gilcrest.  He does not charge any transfer fee other than the $10 state fee.  While there is sales tax in Gilcrest, it's lower than the Metro area.  The lack of transfer fee, which can be $25-35-45 at most shops doing universal background checks, more than makes up for the sales tax.  In other words, if I sold you this gun out of my living room, we'd have to go to a shop and pay the store's universal BC fee plus the $10 state fee.

The price is $450.

It has Savage's adjustable Accu-Trigger. The thumbhole stock allows the shooter to get very close to the stock without hand interference.  It looks wild, but is very ergonomic and functional for accurate shooting.  The barrel is floated and does not contact the forend, for super accurate shooting.

Comes with original box, manual, lock, 5rd magazine, and trigger adjustment tool.  It includes a Pentax  Gameseeker 4-12x40 variable zoom scope with steel Weaver rings.  It has the bullet drop reticle, and while not a high end scope, has performed very well with this rifle.  The scope can be negotiated out of the deal, but I'd prefer that it went as a package.  I'm basically sacrificing it as part of the package deal.

The condition is like-new-in-box.  You'd be hard pressed to find any flaws in the condition.  It was only fired from a benchrest and thus never saw the rigors of being slung and carried in the field.  It's a lot of fun to shoot--I'm just changing things up in my collection.

The gun is on display (for sale) at Gilcrest Farm Supply (FFL) and can be inspected and purchased Monday-Saturday.  This is John Taylor's store in Gilcrest.  He does not charge any transfer fee other than the required $10 state fee.  While there is sales tax in Gilcrest, it's lower than the Metro area.  The lack of transfer fee, which can be $30-35-45 at most shops doing universal background checks, more than makes up for the sales tax.  In other words, if I sold you this gun out of my living room, we'd have to go to a shop and pay the store's universal BC fee plus the $10 state fee.

The price is $425.

If this ad is up, the gun is available. It wouldn't hurt to call Gilcrest Farm Supply to be sure it hasn't just sold REDACTED) before you trek there.

description:
After extensive testing of various optical sights, US Special Operations Command has standardized on the HWS as its 1x weapon optic for close quarter, urban combat zones. To meet the stringent requirements set and demanded by elite fighting forces, L-3 EOTech has developed the EOTECH 553 Holo Weapon Sight, 65 MOA Ring/1 MOA Dot Reticle, Black, NV Compatible, CR123 Battery (553.A65BLK), modeled after the ever popular, battle proven HWS design.

 The SU-231/PEQ (Model 553) base consists of 2 ARMS throw levers and is only adaptable to rails that properly accept the ARMS design.

 When used in Close Quarters Battle (CQB) environments, this revolutionary weapon optic delivers amazing speed and accuracy gains, uncompromising use of peripheral vision, leaves no muzzle-side optical signature and is packaged in a compact, durable unit. Now deployed with elite Special Forces and SWAT teams the world over, the HWS delivers vastly improved shooting performance for all levels of operators.

 This model HWS comes with a standard reticle - 65 MOA ring with alignment ticks and a 1 MOA aiming dot. The large, open ring is the key to the lightning quick eye recognition and unmatched target acquisition speed. Alternately, the 1 MOA can be used for precision aiming at distances as far as 500 yards where it only covers 5"" of the target scene. The reticle demonstrates its versatility for a host of close quarter and long range engagement scenarios.

 The versatility of this sight is remarkable, as it can be used in conjunction with a night vision monocular. This sight effectively produces an accurate and versatile night vision rifle scope. A special night vision setting allows the operator to immediately drop the brightness intensity of the holographic sight reticle to eliminate any ""halo"" effect and saturation of the night vision device. When the appropriate rail extension and quick release mechanisms are employed, this combination allows your weapon to go from broad daylight to no-light environments quickly, easily, and without losing zero.

 This is an extremely durable and reliable weapon sight. It is waterproof (66 feet submersion rating) and fogproof, with a repeatable 1 MOA after re-mounting. The window material is a 3/16"" thick shatterproof laminate with anti-glare and scratch resistant coatings, and the housing features a non-reflective black hard coat finish.

 Engineered for small to medium caliber weapon platforms, the 553 is an excellent choice for use in CQB or urban battle environments. Because it is also accurate for longer range sighting, it should be noted that the Eotech holosight technology leaves no muzzle-side optical signature. Whatever your tactical needs are, you can rely on the EoTech 553.

The rifle was made at Izhevsk in 1944 as seen on the receiver markings. (Zastava was the closest match in the Armslist manufacturer category.) Imported by Samco as marked under the muzzle.

This is fun at the range as well as good for deer hunting in the woods up north. It's compact and quick to point with a wide sling that makes it easy to carry. The rifle is clean and well taken care of, always dried and oiled at the end of the day ever since I cleaned off the cosmoline. There's no rust on the metal and no cracks in the wood.

I mounted a weaver base in place of the rear sight and put a BSA red dot on the rail. The original sight parts are included. There are two boxes (40 rounds) of soft point brass case Winchester ammo and approx 500 rounds of surplus ammo. 440 of that is still sealed in the can.

Here's my math for what I'm asking. Prices seem to be all over the place on the rifles with an average at $200. The scope base, red dot, and case are worth $60. The Winchester white box ammo is worth $40. The can of surplus ammo is worth at least $100 since that's the lowest sale I've seen on this in the last 6 months. Let's say the remaining 60 or 70 rounds are worth $15.

Make a reasonable cash offer. Trades of long guns will be considered. No muzzleloaders, shotguns, or handguns please. I can come up with cash to even the deal if you have a 450 Bushmaster upper or complete rifle to trade.

I will deal face to face, over 21, with MI drivers license only. I will provide a signed bill of sale copy for both of our records."

Selling an extra HK P2000 V2 I have. It's clean and never fired outside of the 1 round that HK put through it (included). It has the V2 LEM (Law Enforcement) CDA (Combat Defense Action) trigger group which does not include a magazine safety (can fire without mag in well) nor a trigger safety (no thumb/etc). It's designed for Law Enforcement personnel. 

I can ship, but will do so through an FFL. California residents, sorry for your new gun laws. If you happen to pick it up in Vegas, all I can do is advise you not to take it back over state lines - the rest is up to you.

Both are in excellent condition. Both cameras include everything that comes with it: all the mounting hardware (I only used the C-clamp mounts, so the screws and wall anchors are new in bag), cd, manual and box.

These are wireless cams, so the only time you need to connect an ethernet cable is when you first connect them to your computer. After that, they can be operated wirelessly, which is how I used them. Axis makes commercial quality cams, so these aren't going to crash on you while you're on vacation (i.e., when you need them most), unlike some of the cheap consumer level cams out there.

You can set the motion detection for the areas you want to monitor and have the cam take pics and email them to you when it detects motion - the nice thing about this is that it doesn't require leaving a computer running. You can also upload pics and/or video to a hosting server on the internet, or to your own computer.

$70 each. Shipping is available. Should be pretty inexpensive to ship if you don't want the box."

Now when doing research on this I was getting conflicting information on barrel length and rate of trist.  I also have found that some are selling these claiming to be a DMR when they are not.  All DMR's had the MAGPUL PRS stock - see large pic - if it does not have this stock it is not a DMR - per sig service.

I am NOT looking for trades at this time, just wanting to thin out some of my rifles that I never fired and probably never will.  If you are going to TRY and offer a trade, it will have to be an  upgrade or trade and cash. but still will have to be an upgrade as I will have to turn around and try and sell what you have not been able to

If you want the Sig soft case - that is an extra $100

Don't insult me and I won't return the favor - price is FIRM - Just the piston system Upper with a 20 inch bull barrel is going to cost you $1600  alone - I looked it up - I do not need the money and I am in no hurry to sell ANY of my firearms."

I have a NEW - NEVER FIRED  Sig Sauer 556002 rifle.  This is the original Swat version.  I see many calling the rifles a swat but this is the ONLY model that has the Folding AND cooalsible stock.  Come with a pistol fore grip and flash light, a Folding and collapsible Mag Pul stock and a full length quad rail.  I purchased these under the LE program and have $1950 in them, were selling for over $2180 at on line stores  I looked around at other sites to se what they are asking and what they are selling, a new HALO is selling for $1300 - I  am pricing this at $1750 - -  I have another that I have fired about 200 rounds through and still looks new.  Will sell that one for $1650

This is a brand new Sig Sauer 556 SWAT rifle. This gun shoots the .223 Remington or the 5.56mm nato round. It has a 16"" barrel with a 1:7 twist rate. It has a quad rail fore-end and flip-up front and rear sights. It comes with LED tactical flashlight that mounts into the vertical fore grip which also comes with this rifle. The gun comes standard with a factory hard case and (1) 30rd. magazine.  I have 2 extra Sig mags for this.  

 SIG 556 SWAT Like features the same high-performance two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system.  Accept standard AR / GI magazines. The SIG556 SWAT features a 16” military grade cold hammer forged barrel, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7”.  The flash suppressor retains a standard .5 x 28 TPI thread pattern, ensuring compatibility with after-market accessories. The vented full length  tactical quad rail forearm is machined from aircraft grade aluminum alloy and hard coat anodized for durability. The quad rail features four integrated steel Picatinny rails.  The Picatinny rail equipped receiver is made of high strength carbon steel with a durable wear-resistant Nitron® finish. The rifle comes standard with the flip up combat front and rear sight system. The trigger housing is machined from an aircraft grade aluminum alloy forging with a hard-coat anodized finish designed to survive extreme conditions. The rifle comes equipped with a smooth two-stage trigger, ambidextrous safety.  A 30-round magazine is supplied with each rifle. The rifle features the MAGPUL CTR Carbine Butt stock. This butt stock is adjustable for length of pull and features a unique locking mechanism that friction locks the stock to the receiver extension for zero movement. The  pistol grip features a storage compartment. The rifle also includes the Grip-Light vertical for end grip which features a removable tactical LED flashlight and mounts directly to the quad rail for ends. It also features a folding stock with the ability to collapse, providing the best of both worlds.

I am NOT looking for trades - just wanting to thin out my collection of things I have NEVER shot and probably never will.  If you want to make a trade offer you will have to up grade me as I will have to turn around and sell what ever you give me.

Do not confuse this with other cheaper versions of their so called swat rifles.  This is the folder / collapsible model,  which would set you back another $250 for the folding / collapsible stock, another $210 for the fore grip and flash light, and another $250 for a full length quad rail - if you purchased them separately from sig.  (used grips are selling between $160 and $180 on ebay).  Later models did not come with these items - hence the cheaper price tag.  A HALO model with just the side folder was listed on Gun Action for $1895 and did not have to fore grip, or the quad rail and only one mag. 

After looking at Halo's, Classic and other sig rifles that are NEW, the price is fair.  I don't need the money and if you think the price is too high then buy a Halo or Classic, they are good rifles  

I have a Sig Sauer soft case - that is an extra $100"
