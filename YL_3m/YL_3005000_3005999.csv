Overview[
The Zastava M92 chambers and fires the Soviet 7.62×39mm round. It is a gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, and selective fire firearm with an under folding metal stock. In general design, it is actually a modified hybrid of the Soviet AKMSU and AKS-74U carbines, but is easily distinguished by the design of pistol grip and especially by the handguard (which is longer), which is made out of a different wood type and has three cooling vents instead of the usual two. This feature gives the M92 less overheating on full auto mode.

The M92 also features a shorter barrel. Unlike most rifle rounds which would otherwise experience a loss of velocity out of a shorter barrel, the 7.62x39 round loses very little velocity when compared to a full length barrel. This makes it an excellent round for short-barrel rifles. The short barrel of the M92 may not lose enough velocity to even make a considerable difference when compared to the M70.

Design and features[edit]
The M92 is a gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, selective fire, shoulder-fired weapon with an underfolding stock. In contrast to the M70, the M92 also features a flash eliminator on the barrel end, which reduces muzzle flash and allows the user to see the bullet's point of impact. Like all carbine rifles, the M92 has a shorter effective range, quicker overheating and lower penetration when compared to original rifle, but it also has its own advantages, it is more efficient in close combat, the handling is improved and it has a higher rate of fire. Other advantages of a shorter barrel also gives it more portability and ease of concealment, making it popular for vehicle crews, pilots and special forces."

Price is exactly what i paid and firm, no trades. Thanks for looking.

It comes with GG&G side mount, Aimpoint PRO Optic, two Bulgarian 30rnd steel mags, Bulgarian issued sling, and Bulgarian military flash hider. Its in very good condition and has been a safe queen for a long time. The trigger is glassy smooth, and the action feels like a knife through hot butter. Its had a few hundred rounds through it and that's all.

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7R-61. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7R-61 is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7R-61 rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7R-61 receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7R-61 | 7.62x39mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14mm muzzle threads, muzzle brake, cleaning rod, bayonet lug, black polymer furniture, intermediate length buttstock, scope rail, two 30-round magazines, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

For sale is a very good used-condition Cub Cadet LT1042 42"" 19hp mower (small tractor). I bought this mower to help my wife's friend who couldn't afford to pay for lawn service. My wife's friend is now in a better place and I don't need it anymore. It mows perfect and starts right up. It has a new battery (3 months old), a clean carb, sharp blades, good belts, tight steering (I replaced the rack and pin), electronic pto, is peddle operated (no gears to shift) and can mow in reverse (you have to press an override button but it does save time). It has always been stored inside and has fresh gas. It comes with two extra (sharp) blades, a side discharge (it has the mulching plug in it now), and an extra rear tire. The lights work. It DOESN'T leak, smoke, or shake. It runs perfect and mows perfect.

The 5926 was built at the request of law enforcement agencies who required a frame mounted Sig style decocker on their duty weapons instead of the slide mounted ones found on the workhorse 5906/6906. Most of these ended up as issued duty guns and the majority of them I've seen have been pretty tired looking. Not this one. I bought this gun from the estate of a collector who usually bought new, shot a range session, cleaned and carefully stored his guns; never to be shot again. This alloy framed stainless slide pistol is nearly new, in it's original box with an unopened tool kit, manual, warranty card and spare 15 round magazine. Just like it came from the factory.

Item Specifics:

MFG:Utas
Model: UTS-15
Caliber: 12 Gauge
The UTS-15 tactical shotgun is a 12 ga. pump action shotgun with two 7-round alternately feeding or selectable magazine tubes, that measuring 28.3” in overall length with a 18.5” barrel chambers for 2 3/4” and 3” magnum ammunition. Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer the UTS-15 weighs only 6.9 lbs, for quick pointing and easy handling. The top mounted picatinny rail allows for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, which coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to adapt to any situation (sights and choke tube pictured not included)"

It is a F I Industries Model D .380. Looks like a mini 1911. Very nice condition. From the research I have done, this is a very rare pistol. I have taken it to two different gun stores and both said they have never seen one before in all the years they have been dealing.

I am no expert and cannot speak to the absolute truth of what I have read, but I found the following information on this pistol from several locations...

""In the 1970's Colt decided to offer a scaled down 1911 in .380 auto and chose to partner with Star instead of making their very own gun (called the Pony). After this product was announced, Colt, just coming out of bankruptcy, decided to discontinue all of their .380 products. Very few Colt-branded guns seem to have been sold. FI Industries bought up the parts and assembled them as the Model D. The frames were made in anticipation of the Colt deal, as all the early serial numbers start with ""CPA (Colt Pony Automatic).

Supposedly there were only around 100 made with the CPA serial numbers (which this one has). The plaque on the grip says ""FI Industries, Washington DC""

Open to offers from those who know more about this pistol and trades.

Must show identification and conceal carry permit."
