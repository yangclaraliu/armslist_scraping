The Benchmark for .22 Rifles – Experience the Tradition.

The Ruger® 10/22® rifle is America’s favorite .22 LR rifle, with proven performance in a wide range of styles for every rimfire application. Ideally suited for informal target shooting, “plinking,” small game hunting and action-shooting events, Ruger has sold millions of 10/22 rifles since their introduction in 1964. With its legendary action and renowned reliable rotary magazine, all 10/22 rifles are sleek, perfectly balanced, rugged and superbly accurate. With a variety of choices – from the standard 10/22 Carbine, to the tack-driving accuracy of the Target model, the 10/22 is still today’s most popular .22 rifle. It looks right, feels right, shoots right and continues to perform under heavy use – inspiring the most fanatical loyalty from its owners. With proven design, legendary reliability and the modern features demanded by today’s .22 LR shooters, these firearms are priced right to make keeping tradition affordable.

 I just have two in stock, and have them priced to sell for only $550.00 each

CZ 75D PCR Compact 9 mm Luger Pistol, Alloy Frame, Decocker, Black Polycoat, 14-Round Mags- CZ 91194

Product Description
The CZ 75D PCR is identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, but thanks to its forged aluminum alloy frame it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter, making it more comfortable for everyday carry. Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator.

Sig Sauer P938 9mm Sub-Compact Pistol, Rosewood Grips, Engraved Slide, Black Frame, 6-Round and 7-Round Magazines – Sig Sauer 938-9-MGE13



With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs Seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

NOTE: This model comes with one 6-round AND one 7-round magazine.

This shotgun has had a total of four shells through it. I bought it from the original owner who never fired it.

This shotgun retails for $579, so this begs the question why I'm only asking $400 for it. The reason is the previous owner didn't lower the feed ramp down when they went to field strip it so they could oil the gun, and the bolt slammed forward and damaged it. This is a relatively common problem on BR99's and MKA1919s and is easily fixed by sanding away the frayed edges of the feed ramp (http://forum.saiga-12.com/index.php?/topic/95234-br-99-issues/). I fixed the issue, and the shotgun does now feed shells from the magazine, but I just don't like the feel of the shotgun. I prefer my 870 and don't see me using this nearly as often as I thought I would. If the gun didn't have this fix, I'd ask for more, but because I had to perform a quick fix I'm only asking for $400.

Comes with three chokes, instruction booklet, and 2 5-round magazines.

I'm looking to sell it for a firm $400 or trade for a WASR 10/63. Am willing to meet up at a local range (A&A) if you want to inspect and fire the weapon, or would also be willing to meet up in a location in-between and do a simple exchange.

ASK FOR MORE PICTURES I HAVE PLENTY

 When I got it the stock was a light color and was in pretty bad condition so I restained it a much darker color, and clear coated it( clear didn't turn out the way it should have, its a little rough, and there's a slight run u can see in the picture) Also the barrel was covered in rust so I sanded it down to mostly bare metal, and primed it and painted it when black rustoleum, looks pretty good besides some minor paint wrinkles you can see in the pictures.

Reason I'm selling so cheap is bec the gun won't shoot repeatedly. It will shoot one round, cycle in another, but doesn't set the firing pin. But it fires just fine once you manually rack the bolt back and and eject the new cycled round out, and cycle a new one in. 

I'm thinking the problem is the spring is a little wore out, and somebody that knows what they are doing could probably shorten the spring and it would cycle and set the pin just fine.

Looking this one over, and honestly I don't know if it's ever been shot. The metal finish is perfect, the wood is fantastic.

It has the factory box and 2 10 round magazines (also takes cheap S&W 59 series mags). 

If you dont know much about these pistols, they are made in South Korea and have been their standard military sidearm for about 25 years. Unlike todays pistols, these guns have forged steel slides and barrels and forged aluminum frames, all internal parts are forged steel, not the cheaper and weaker metal injected molded steel of new production pistols. The barrel is chrome inside and out which makes cleaning very easy. 

The pistol is very accurate and due to its Tri-Action design, it has one of the best triggers I have ever seen on a pistol. The gun can be carried in double action mode, single action (cocked and locked like a 1911) or in Tri-Action which allows you to cock the pistol and push the hammer forward giving you a 4 Lb trigger pull that is completely safe. 

The gun is very light for its size and is very comparable to a Glock 9mm in weight. 
I really hate to get rid of this pistol as it is fairly rare and they keep going up in price, but I am more of a polymer pistol guy and I needed a light rail, so the wife says this one has to go. 


Interesting fact: the gun was imported by Kimber (same maker as the 1911's) and is marked as such on the side of the slide. 

The pistol does have normal holster wear for a gun that is 20+ year old, but overall the finish is in excellent condition, no damage or rust anywhere. 

Price is firm, I can ship via USPS to an FFL if needed, but prefer FTF with NE CCW or Permit Holder only. 

Here are some links to youtube reviews of this pistol and the new manufactured Lionheart LH9 ($700, same gun different name).

The LaRue OBR (Optimized Battle Rifle) was built from the ground up, using a newly designed upper-receiver platform, combined with a lower, inspired from our successful 5.56 MM lower. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet, for the optimum fit and consistency. The receiver components are designed with more material in critical areas to alleviate known issues of weakness in 7.62 platforms and to stiffen the receiver....translating into maximum accuracy.

The upper-rail provides generous room for all issue weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations (suitable for 7.62 MM). The built-in cant provides correct ballistic orientation for all inline night vision combinations. The MIL-STD-1913 side rails are detachable, so that they can be configured for Vis / IR illuminators, etc, or left off to keep rails pristine, without the need for bulky rail covers. The bottom rails are also detachable, and can be positioned anywhere along the entire lower length, for the interface of MIL-STD-1913 equipped bipods, grips, tripod mounts, etc. These rails are offered as spare parts for field-service replacement, keeping repair cost at a minimum.

Barrels:
Available in 16.1"", 18"" & 20"" lengths. All gas blocks feature our unique Port Selector Technology (PST), a two-point adjustable gas selector that allows optimum function between suppressed, and unsuppressed operation at the flip of a switch. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24, with an A2-type flash hider attached (other muzzle devices can be added at an additional cost).

Suppressor Compatibility:
LaRue 7.62 rifles with Port Selector Technology (PST) have been optimized for best-performance with SureFire suppressors. We understand that there are dozens of 7.62 suppressors to choose from on the market at this time. We feel that SureFire suppressors fall somewhere in the middle-range in regards to effect of performance with gas-operated rifles. Many users have met with success operating different models of their choice. Combined with variables in ammunition, 7.62 suppressor owners have experienced a large spectrum of conditions (much greater than seen with 5.56 suppressors). This range of variables is easy to manage with a bolt-action 7.62, but with a gas-operated system it is not. While we made a concerted effort to design a gas system that will work with a wide range of suppressors, we can not guarantee proper-function with suppressor hardware other than SureFire.

Internals:
The Bolts and Bolt Carriers are hand-polished hard-chrome with staked carrier keys. The carrier key contact areas are designed for zero gas leakage.

About LaRue Firearm Accuracy:
LaRue accuracy is known world-wide. The accuracy of each LaRue Rifle is proven at our 100-yard tunnel using match-grade ammunition. No LaRue firearm can leave the facility unless it obtains accuracy of less-than 1 MOA (1.047”) at 100 Yards. Each firearm ships with a copy of a 3-round group obtained from that actual firearm. While we guarantee the rifle is capable of sub-MOA accuracy, we can not guarantee the end-user will be able to shoot sub-MOA…since we have no control over shooting proficiency, familiarity with the system, ammunition choice, environmental factors, etc. LaRue firearms are precision instruments that require discipline, training, proper ammunition and maintenance to yield the best results"

These guns will work with S&W 15rnd mags but they do not fit flush Serial # on this gun is 1642356 This gun is in VG to Excellent Condition Rare find Hand picked for condition by the importer for me. Here is some info on the model = pistol had been developed and manufactured in Spain by Star Bonifacio Echeverria SA company. The Star 30M appeared in 1990 and had been adopted as a service pistol by the Spanish army and police, as well as by Peruvian police. Technically, the Star 30M is an updated version of the earlier Star 28M pistol. Star 30M is a recoil operated, locked breech pistol, that uses Browning-designed, linkless locking (High Power-type), with two lugs on the barrel and shaped cam under the chamber that interacts with slide stop axis iside the frame. Star 30M features double action trigger with slide mounted ambidextrous safety that locks firing ping only, leaving trigger and hammer unaffected in ""safety on"" position, thus allowing the gun to be ""dry fired"" (however, this is unsafe and is not recommended). Star 30M also features magazine safety, that disables firing when magazine in not in position. Another safety feature is a loaded chamber indicator. Star 30M features internal slide rails (like the SIG P-210 or CZ-75). The frame and slide are made from steel (the aluminium-alloy frame version of the Star 30M is called Star 30PK and is somewhat lighter, as one can expect). The front sight is fixed, the rear sight is dovetailed and thus can be ajusted for windage. Star 30M is a reliable, accurate service pistol. I will attach as may photos of the actual gun to this listing as I can but if you need more photos or have more questions feel free to contact me.

The M6A2™ rifle is a standard carbine available in various barrel lengths in 5.56mm NATO. The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

HECKLER & KOCH - VP9 - PISTOL - CALIBER: 9mm - STRIKER FIRED - BROWNING RECOIL OPERATED - TRIGGER PULL: 5.4lbs - MAGAZINES: 2 - CAPACITY: 15 ROUND - SIGHT RADIUS: 6.38"" - BARREL LENGTH: 4.09"" - WEIGHT W/EMPTY MAG: 26.56oz. - WEIGHT LOADED: 32oz. - INTERCHANGEABLE GRIP PANELS - Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail 
In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. 
HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. 
The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. 
The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. 
Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. 
A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. 
The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. 

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. 
HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. 
The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. 
Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis."

The 1.6mm version of this rifle has not been imported for some time, as they have gone to the less expensive 1mm receiver. the barrel on the rifle is a heavy/thicker material than most AK barrels and it is chrome lined along with the gas piston. This gun has only had about 150 rounds put down the tube, and the only markings on the rifle are from the safety (which is par for any AK). The rifling is still very strong given the very small amount of use this gun has seen, so it is good to go without any modifications. The trigger has also been polished and refined so it is a very smooth pull and lighter than most AK's on the market. The trigger actually gives my Smith and Wesson AR15 a run for it's money with what feels like less than a 3.5lb pull. The receiver also has space for a double hook trigger group to be mounted as these slots are already cut into the frame.

Along with the rifle you will also get 2 steel 30 round magazines, 160 rounds of ammo with both FMJ and JHP, and an installed no-slip sling. I fired the 90 rounds one magazine at a time, and the rifle was cleaned after each range trip, even though that is not completely needed with an AK. Let me know what you're offer is and we can talk from there. Blue Book value shows this gun at 90% is worth $750, and since the only mark on the weapon is from the safety, I'd say it was closer to 96% at least. I'm selling for well under blue book value so I assure you I am not attempting to gouge anyone with my price. I'm also flexible so gimme an offer! For trades I'd like to get close to the blue book value of $785. For cash I'd accept $700 OBO. Trades plus cash will fall into the second category.

It could use refinishing of the stock because it was my summertime Woodchuck rifle and DEET melts the finish, but don't let looks fool you. I once swore I would never sell this, but I haven't shot it in years and I must thin the herd in preparation for a move to warmer climates. Get it before someone in SC does.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol. It has been developed from the highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slide stop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters."

A Real bushwhacker. Rounds give deeper penetration than a 357 Magnum.  Penetrates some older model armored vests.   I'm not sure if I have the cleaning rod.  I always used a bore-snake, and religiously cleaned immediately after shooting.  The ammo box isn't included. $350 for the gun and $200 for the ammo.  Take the whole package for $525.00.  Private sale which must take place at my Palm Harbor office.  Don't waste my time if you aren't willing to sign off on a bill of sale, or won't let me make a copy of your Florida D/l.  You must be legally allowed to own a firearm, and be over 21."
