Equipped with Ameriglo pro idot night sights (less than 1 year old).  4 13-rd magazines Trade/Ask value:  $620.  Purchased in 2014. Has lock, backplates, loader etc.

ID checked / Bill of sale required.

I also have the following - not available separately unless G23 sells first and buyer uninterested in them:

Lone Wolf 9mm conversion barrel (would also fit G32) and Glock G19 spring:  Ask/trade:  $100

3 * G19 / 15-round 9mm mags (Glock brand, current model, as would be sold with a Gen4 G19) Ask/trade: $75

Galco King Tuk holster:  Ask $30
Blackhawk Serpa 2: Ask $30

I think the holsters will both work with all the normal 9/.40/.357 models.

Interest in trades would be limited.  I'm planning to get into a P320 or possibly a PPQ, both in 9mm, so those would be valid trade discussions. 

Can produce pics of G23 if necessary - but it's a G23 that looks essentially new.  No notable wear."

The gun is in overall nice shape, action is smooth on double or single action, lockup is tight, and there doesn't appear to be any function problems or issues. It is not recommended to shoot Plus P ammo in this series, only after 4th change is it recommended. I bought it from an FFL dealer some time ago, and have never made use of it, and have decided to offer it for sale.

The Smith and Wesson Model 39 was the first U.S. designed double action (DA) semi-automatic pistol marketed in the United States. In 1949, Smith and Wesson began development of the Model 39 DA semi-auto in caliber 9x19mm Luger. Smith and Wesson began selling the Model 39 commercially in 1955. This is considered a first generation pistol. Since the Model 39 came out, S&W has continuously developed the design into its third generation pistols now on the market."

Short Frame 45 ACP 3.78"" 10+1 FS Poly Grip/Frame Blk

The Glock 30SF in the legendary .45 Auto offers excellent out-of-the-box
precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big bore
caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of
the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact
dimensions, the G30SF is the first choice of plainclothes officers and
security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of
the receiver at the rear back-strap, offering increased comfort and control,
especially for shooters with smaller hands.

Hi there. Made the decision to switch back to 9mm. Got rid of my Glock 23, and now I'm looking to get rid of the Glock 22 as well. I am looking to trade for a Glock 26 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com) 

Comes with everything in the original box. 5 mags (3 factory, 2 brand new extended 31 round), lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me.

The quality of pictures are severely reduced when uploaded to armslist so it can make some textures look strange (like on the extended mags.) If you'd like the full size pictures, I can email them to you."

From Wikipedia:
Wingo was an experimental indoor shooting sport invented by Winchester in the early 1970s. The only Wingo facility built was in San Diego, California.
The equipment consisted of a bank of machines that created four-inch diameter hollow spheres of ice. The player had a custom-made .20 calibre shotgun that was about the same size and weight as a .22 calibre rifle. The choice of calibre was to prevent players from bringing their own .22 calibre shells from outside. The gun was tethered to the shooting bench to prevent it from being pointed toward spectators and to facilitate the wiring for the internal microphone that detected when the gun was fired. Only about 20 of these guns were made and they are now very rare collector's items.
In the game, four-inch diameter hollow spheres of ice were fired toward the shooter from one of five ports from a distance of 75 feet. When the player fired the gun a number from 1 to 10 was presented by the scoring machine. The number depended on how quickly the player fired, higher numbers for quicker reactions. If the player hit the sphere he/she scored the number presented by the scoring machine.
Winchester conducted the trial in San Diego, rather than a midwest city where shooting sports were more popular, because they wanted to see if it would catch on in a city where there was an abundance of pastimes. The sport was not financially successful and the Wingo facility was closed in less than a year. The facility is now a branch of the San Diego Superior Court.

There is also a factory letter from Winchester authenticating this rifle.

I'm motivated to sell.  I've owned this weapon since it was new and put every round through it.  I am going back to school and need the money.  It is an excellent gun and lives up to its reputation.  It handles extremely well for a full size handgun and has the lowest felt recoil of any .45 on the market (including its successors that cost twice as much).

The gun is AG date code meaning it was made after the latest revisions to firing block.  Honestly, I love the gun but am transitioning to the USP compact .45.   

Installed Meprolight Nightsights In early 2014. Very bright.

Variant 1.  I measured the DA/SA at 12 and 4.5 lbs respectively.  The gun is very accurate and training with the long but consistent DA pull will make you a better shooter.  Training with this gun is a whole lot of fun as its big slide and dual recaptured spring take all the punishment.  It's more fun to shoot then snappy 9mm in my opinion because of its recoil characteristics.

Comes with 2 HK USP Magazines with the extended baseplate.  Hold 12 rounds each.  

Gun has some very light holster wear that disappears with oil but the wear happened the second I started using a holster.  

Also have an aftermarket pic-rail adapter (not pictured)

I have holsters and extra magazines (pictured are 4-12rnd Pro Mags, 4 USP .45 12rnd Mags, 1-12rnd Mk.23 mag, stealth Gear IWB and SERPA holsters) as well if you're interested in adding to the asking price.  We can negotiate their prices in email.

Price is firm for the gun and two mags."

This is an extremely custom Ar-47. Everything is top of the line. 

The build started out as a mgi hydra lower. The upper is a custom sun devil manufacturing upper receiver that has been machined for a perfect fit to the lower. The hand guard alone was $450 (Daniel defense 12"" rail). Match grade jp trigger, BCM B5 furniture, BCM charging handle, etc.... Match grade barrel as well which has been chopped down and professionally pinned with a FN Scar heavy muzzle brake ($99 for the brake alone minus the labor cost). Has all of the custom airbrush work done as well. There are literally too many things to list. Beautiful gun...

Comes with 8 mags + ammo. 

This gun is one of a kind for sure. Mags fit perfectly and shoots beyond flawless. I can send you video upon request. 

Well over $3000 invested in gun. (I know, stupid of me)...

I can include a few hundred rounds with it.

Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools."

NOTE: Polytech was not in the selection list, so chose Norinco.

Safe Queen M1A.  Bought some years ago and only put about 100 rounds through it.

Comes with Bushnell Sportview 4X scope and an A.R.M.S. M21/14 W.B.MA., quick detachable, rail mount.  The ARMS mount features: Ultra low profile, Mil-Std 1913 Picatinny rail; work with Sage EBR Chassis; interchangeability for day and night vision optics; precision fit to the base integral with the receiver - two attaching points, plus a third contact point for ultimate stability; made of 8620 case hardened steel; and 100% MADE IN THE USA.

Included are 9 magazines: 1 – 10 round parkerized, 4 – 20 round parkerized, and 4 – 30 round after-market.  If memory serves me correctly, I bought the after-market mags since the gun was last fired, but found they seemed “stiffer” to insert/release than the parkerized units.

Rifle has a flash hider, fiberglass hand-guard, and the flip-up type butt plate.

Bought 100 rounds of Herter’s steel case ammo to try but never did, so I’ll include it in the sale.

Included is a hard case in which the rifle will be shipped to your FFL, and buyer pays FFL fees.

Local sale is fine, but transfer at FFL must still occur, and I will pay the fee if done at my Birdsboro, PA FFL location, otherwise the local FFL fee will be split equally between buyer and I.

No trades please.

EMAIL ANSWERS:
I bought the rifle years ago at a gun show from one of the dealers. I can't recall if it was new or not. I've shot 100-200 rounds through the rifle and have had no problems, nor have I seen any evidence of headspacing issues on the fired cases which I've reloaded. I really don't need to sell the rifle, but I'm just not using it as much as I thought.  I have not had the bolt chacked to determine its hardness number."

It's a Gen 3 pistol.  It comes with all of the factory accessories: a hard case, manuals, cleaning rod and brush and magazine loader.  It also comes with a 9 round magazine, and a 9 round magazine with a Pearce grip extension (making it a 10-round magazine).  The grip extension makes the pistol easier to hold for people with larger hands.

In addition to the factory accessories, this pistol also comes with a Lone Wolf brand .40 to 9mm conversion barrel.  Converting this G27 from .40 to 9mm requires nothing more than changing out the barrel and using 9mm magazines.  With this barrel, you have the choice of shooting .40 or 9mm (like the G26) out of this pistol.  To go along with the conversion barrel, I'm including four magazines.  All are Glock brand magazines.  One is 17 round, one is 10 round, and two are 12 round.

Also included is a Blackhawk CQC SERPA holster.  It comes with both the belt loop backing plate and the paddle backing plate.

I'm also throwing in some ammunition.  One box of Federal .40 180 grain FMJ FN (39 rounds left from a 50 round box) and one box of Federal .40 180 grain Hydra-Shok JHP (15 rounds left from a 20 round box).

The only shooting this gun has seen is the 16 rounds of .40 that are missing from these two boxes of ammo, as well as a few hundred rounds of 9mm shot through the conversion barrel.  It has been carried some, but shows no real signs of wear.

Although everything included would cost around $800 new, I am only asking $500.  The reason for the sale is that I have a S&W M&P9c that I prefer for carry, and I'd like to pick up a 1911 in .38 Super."

These function in .308 HK rifles, PTR rifles, and may work in other HK clone rifles.

Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic 12841Designed with input from a distinguished group of current and former professionals, the Patrol Rifle Optic incorporates many never before seen features to maximize this sight's performance within the challenging conditions faced by modern law enforcement. A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. The Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic's front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machine guns. The QRP2 mount for the PRO Optic also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the PRO Optic's front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches and fingerprints."

The ""Taurus Judge®"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 3"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law."
