I also have High-Cap mags that I will include if you are a LEO. Like the slightly larger P2000 model, the P2000 SK (subcompact) combines elements of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with recent technological innovations from HK engineers — only in a smaller, more concealable design. The P2000 SK is available with Law Enforcement Modification (also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact “LEM” (Law Enforcement Modification) model. This unique pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. The LEM/CDA trigger pull has been reduced to 7.3 – 8.5 pounds of pressure (32.5 – 37.8 Newtons), compared to 12 – 15 pounds (53.4 – 66.7 N) found on many conventional double action pistols. Optional adjustment by an HK certified armorer can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range. Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the Subcompact. The enhanced LEM/CDA trigger system combines the reliability of a double-action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single-action pistol. For shooters that prefer a conventional double-action/single-action pistol, a double-action/single-action variant is also available with a decock button mounted on the rear of the frame. A choice of two simple-to-install grip panels make it easy to custom-fit the P2000 Subcompact to any shooter’s hand. And the same ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers found on the P2000 make handling the Subcompact easy for both right- and left-handed shooters. A set of abbreviated “industry standard” mounting rails on the P2000 SK enable lights, laser aimers, and other accessories to be added by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 SK also can use widely available, reliable USP Compact magazines. If interested please call 604-9733"

Been in family since my Dad had it from before I was born and I am 56 yrs old. 
I remember him letting me shoot it when I was about 12 yrs old and never shot since. 
My Dad was finicky about this gun. Taking it down occasionally to oil it up but never shot it. 
Remained stored at the top of his closet occasionally taking it down to show company and talk about his days while serving in the Army at The Battle of Bulge.
Action is amazingly mint clean and tight.
Recently had it all gone over by a high end gun smith so I would know what my Dad had held onto for so long and now I know why. People have always tried to buy it from him. 
Really hate to sell and started to not sell it after the gun smith checked it all out but it sits in my closet now and I really have no use for it. The photos in this listing do no justice to the rifle. Even nicer than photos. I am not a good photographer.

Serious Inquiries Only 
I am not a gun expert and the gun smith can commincate to you about this rifle if you have specific gun talk questions and want an unbiased opinion. He builds guns and works government contracts. He called it mint and a beautiful rifle."

And, you can SBR it with some paperwork.


Over 1k invested into this incredible defensive pistol build. With a 10.5"" HBAR barrel, it's perfect for close quarters work but will also accurately reach out - not too short, not too long. I've set this up with the best value parts, Seekins MCSR KeyMod rail, Mag Tac magnesium lower, CMMG LPK, Sig SB15 Arm Brace, CP Mags (4 total NIB)... it's ready to run! 

The 7.62x39 round is an incredible performer, in both accuracy and kinetic energy - when used in a platform like this. More kinetic energy than the 5.56/.223, less expensive than the 300BLK cartridge.. and readily available ammo. This pistol will run reliably on premium, standard or steel cased ammo.. built to run it all.

This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1943 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped to Springfield Armory in February of 1943. It was Issued to an enlisted serviceman at the time. (Trying to find out who it was issued to now through different channels.) There are specific clues on the gun that tell you who it MIGHT have gone to.. There is AA inscribed (Not stamped) on the ivory grips and on the frame Next to GHD. GHD is significant because Col. Guy H. Drewry inspected ordnance from June 17, 1942 to July 15, 1945 For COLT.

After having multiple collectors and Colt dealers at the gun show look at it. ""AA"" is believed to stand for ""All American"" 82nd Airborne. Which would match the dates the gun was issued, and the eagle carved on the Ivory grips. 82 Airborne was the first Airborne division in US Army history and had three major drops, made their first drop in July of 1943 to invade Sicily. Second was Salerno on 13 September 1943. The third was the invasion of Normandy Jun 1944.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. BUT NOT ALL PISTOLS BACK THEN WERE STAMPED WITH ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for Military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted National match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by a gunsmith. At some point it was re-blued, and fixtures were 24k gold plated and Ivory grips added. It has been determined the gold was added many many years ago as some has worn off in spots. Bluing and finish is still very nice... Bore is excellent and looks shinning.

This pistol is a shooter. I have put 100 rounds through it and drives tacks. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection.

From Beretta: The TX4 Storm is a gas-operated semi-auto tactical shotgun optimized for home defense. With a 5+1 capacity, flawless feeding of different loads, ghost-ring sights, a soft-recoiling mechanism and a short, maneuverable 18.5"" barrel, it is perfect for its intended use right out of the box. 

The TX4 comes standard with a number of features highly prized by knowledgeable tactical shooters and law-enforcement professionals. The slim, elongated fore-end is ideal for quickly directing the barrel in different directions and moving it from target to target when negotiating tight spaces. The ghost-ring sights are designed for fast and intuitive target-acquisition, and the rear sight is removable should you want to equip the TX4 with the optics of your choice. For that purpose, a short Picatinny rail extends over the action, and will take a variety of tactical accessories without any modification.

One of the important features that sets the TX4 Storm apart from other tactical shotguns is that it reliably feeds and shoots loads of different power. Essentially, it is a semiauto shotgun that feeds as reliably as a pump: from mild low-recoil loads to full-power thumpers as well as slugs, the TX4 will keep cycling no matter what you feed it. Thanks to its self-regulating gas-operating system, the TX4 has a “smart” action that adapts itself precisely and efficiently to the load used without any adjustment on the user’s part. Also, the barrel is threaded for choke tubes (Optima-Bore HP and Optima-Choke HP choke tube system): the included choke may be easily replaced to tailor the shot pattern to the intended use.   Asking $1200 OBO please feel free to send offers the worst I can say is no. Thank you."

The 92S is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92S still has no match. Period.

Regardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92S consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only gives the 92S its extraordinary accuracy, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple this to the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92S remains the best pistol in its class.

Colt 1911 Government .22 w/Threaded Barrel

The Colt Government Model 22 is built by Carl Walther in Germany, and imported into the US.

The Government Model 22 is blowback operated, having the barrel rigidly attached to the frame. Like the centerfire 1911, the Colt Government Model 22 has a thumb safety, grip safety, magazine release, and slide lock that operate just like the centerfire 1911. This makes this Colt 22 particularly a great trainer or understudy to the centerfire 1911, as it has the same solid feel of its big brother, with a crisp trigger pull, identical trigger reach, and the same manual-of-arms as the centerfire 1911.

This Colt is finished in an overall matte black, and has a long 1911 style trigger, but with some 1911-A1 features as well. The front and rear sights are dovetailed into the frame, to allow for windage adjustment, and many aftermarket sights are available, should a different style than the plain black sights be desired. Like the centerfire 1911, the slide locks open on an empty magazine. The Colt 1911 22 magazine holds twelve rounds of 22 LR ammunition. The thumb safety is on the left side for right-handed use, and the grip safety works just like on a standard 1911. The slide lock is also identical in operation to the centerfire 1911, as is the magazine release, so operating this 22 LR Colt will be familiar to anyone who knows how to run a centerfire 1911. Only the disassembly procedure is different, due to the fixed-position barrel of the blowback design.
