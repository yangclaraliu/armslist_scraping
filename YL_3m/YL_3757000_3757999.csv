It is used but in excellent condition, timing is perfect, lock up is very tight, and practically no indication of flash erosion on the top strap. Rifling is sharp and clean, crown is perfect, this is a real beauty built for accuracy and reliability. I do not have the original box but it will come in the leather padded case pictured. I just purchased this pistol a short time ago, and have decided I want bigger. I am after something in .44 magnum to compliment a leaver gun I have in that caliber. I prefer Smiths. I currently have this gun advertised on Gunbroker as well so if you are interested speak soon. I would value it at $700 for a local face to face trade value."

I have a Pistol Permit and a NCID and im willing to sign a bill of sale for everything. I'm Looking mainly for pistols but im open to revolvers also. Can travel far up to 2 hours - over 2 hours you pay gas money but my car is a little 4 cylender it does good on gas.

1. Like new Jimenez .T-380 With a 49.99 Holster that fits the gun great you couldn't act for a better fitting holster. This 380 will eat any ammo u feed it flawlessly it has a 4 inch barrel and has an adjustable read site. Its the most accurate 380 I've ever shot only put 50 tula 380 (steel cased ammo the cheapest worst/dirtiest ammo you can buy and this gun ran all 50 flawlessly) 40 magtech 380 rounds - again ran flawlessly, 20 Horandy Critical duty hollowpoints - ran flawlessly 3 mags of fiochhio ammo - again it ran FLAWLESS.4 mags of various different hollowpoints i was just mixing the ammo in the mags to see if it would function and again FLAWLESS..... BOTTOM LINE I WOULD TRUST THIS GUN WITH MY LIFE. Some people say jeminez makes some not so good guns but this is the newer T-380  I quess they fixed the kinks if there were any. Or maybe I just got lucky and got a very good gun from them. I have videos on my youtube channel which if you email me I can prove(by emails you the videos or links to my youtube channels and you can watch me whoot the gun - just to prove this gun runs flawless..

 2. A used Taurus PT/22 22LR pistol its basically a clone of a beretta bobcat with the flip up barrel comes with a nice carrying box.. 

3. A Shoulder holster that will fit most any small pocket pistols but you can always switch the holster as it straps onto it if you want to add a different holster.

4. Mossberg and Sons 20 gauge single shot bolt action shotgun

5. A used weight lifting machine its a Infinity II Multi Station Training Center with 150 pounds of plates you can even add more plates if you can find them.(if you're into bodybuilding you'll like it)

6. A Gateway laptop that works just needs a charger. 

6. An Xbox 360 in working condiction that just needs a CD Rom you can purchase one on amazon for 36 dollars but everything works u can turn it on even go onto the internet you just need the cd rom to play games or watch dvd's i have a wireless controller that ill Include with it

1. Like new Jimenez .T-380 with a 49.99 Holster the holster fits this gun like a glove you couldnt ask for a better fitting holster for this gun..This 380 has almost zero recoil and is quieter than even my ,22lr pistol! it literally recoils no more than my ,22lr pistol! no lie! PERFECT for begginers, femalees, and the eldery. This 380 will eat any ammo u feed it flawlessly it has a 4 inch barrel and has an adjustable read site. Its the most accurate 380 I've ever shot i can consitly hit a soda caan at 50 yards!!! And I have video to prove it! 
only put 50 tula 380 (steel cased ammo the cheapest worst/dirtiest ammo you can buy and this gun ran all 50 flawlessly) 40 magtech 380 rounds - again ran flawlessly, 20 Horandy Critical duty hollowpoints - ran flawlessly 3 mags of fiochhio ammo - again it ran FLAWLESS.4 mags of various different hollowpoints i was just mixing the ammo in the mags to see if it would function and again FLAWLESS..... BOTTOM LINE I WOULD TRUST THIS GUN WITH MY LIFE. Some people say jeminez makes some not so good guns but this is the newer T-380  I quess they fixed the kinks if there were any.

Will sell cheap in a package deal or will separate. Most are square butt, one set is round butt. Please do not ask me what they fit or came off because I have no idea. I would say that none are J frame, they all fit a K frame or larger. The Uncle Mikes combat grips are discontinued years ago and fairly desirable. They also come with the proper grip screw for them. They range in condition from fairly nice to showing wear but none are cracked or damaged (although one grip does have a small chip out of the bottom). Priced at $15-$25 depending on which you want but if you take them all I will sell all 5 sets for only $15 a pair."

This handgun is different and better than 95% of other FEG firearms and here is why.
There are several Models of the FEG 380 handgun including the SMC model which is the Civilian model, the PA model which is the Polished Aluminum model (duo-tone) which can have premature wear issues and the R model which is the Police Pistol. This is an FEG Police Model .380acp semi-auto handgun Model R-61 imported by KBI Inc. in Harrisburg, PA. This is the Police model and as you can easily see by the pictures this handgun has had very little use and is in Excellent Near New Condition. This FEG is said to be a clone of the Walther PPK and some models like the R-61 are suppose to be just as dependable. This is a Double-Action .380acp pistol that comes with box, two extended round magazines, 81rds of factory ammunition, simulated alligator skin case and a pancake style holster (not pictured). The Extended Magazines are not standard and sell for $60 on Ebay.

Pistol - $320.00
Extra Extended Mag - $60.00
Win Ammo - $25.00

This 6+1 pistol has a stainless slide, steel reinforced polymer frame, steel guide rod & stainless steel trigger. The gun also comes with a total of 4 magazines (all are 6 round). 250 shots fired (200 is the recommended break in). The gun is nearly new cosmetically (no scratches or holster marks. Original box, factory test round, gun lock, manuals & warranty. 

I also have 150 rounds of Remington, 50 rounds of Tula, 20 rounds of Hornaday critical defense, 20 rounds of Barnes Tac-XPD & 3x 20 round boxes of Federal premium low recoil. All of the mags are topped off and there is still over 80 rounds of other bulk ammo included. I also have a Nylon Bulldog Extreme cell phone case holster still in the box along with a like new pistol range bag with 3 compartments, 4 mag pouches and a removable soft case for the pistol. I even have a pair of safety glassed with retractable earplugs I can toss in so you will be ready for the range.

I encourage you to do your research on the Kahr. Its a top rated pocket pistol compared to the LC9, bodyguard and glock42.  Safe & reliable with a smooth trigger. One of the smallest firearms among .380 CCW guns and also one of the easier to shot accurately. In my opinion it doesn't hurt your palm like the bodyguard & LC9 after a day at the range. Very lightweight, thin & concealable - see specs below. I estimate the gun, ammo, mags holster and range bag at about $500-600 but will take $450 cash and/or trade of equal value. I'm not desperate for cash or attached to the gun but I figured I would see whats out there...

I am not here to play games, and I need to sell this firearm and have the cash by Friday at the latest.  My need to sell it so quickly is your win.  I purchased the firearm 9/26/2014 from Gander Mountain and have only shot it three times for probably a total of 250 rounds.  In addition I have cleaned it after each time I shot it.  It is the Sig Sauer 716 Patrol, here is the link to the specs on the Sig website:

http://www.sigsauer.com/CatalogProductDetails/sig716-patrol.aspx   
I paid 2199 only a month and half ago.  It has magpul metallic sigts as well as 6 total magazine ranging in capacities.  I will through in 400 rounds of brass full metal jacket PMC 308 ammo ($200 value on a good day) I just purchased the ammo before I realized I needed to sell my SIG.  The best price I have seen is $2009 for this gun and that is not including a magazine or ammo.  I have original box and papers as well.  If the buyer isn't in Denver and can't meet in person they will need to cover all shipment cost as well as the transfer cost.  I belong to a local shooting range / dealer where we can do the transfer at if in town and if out of town they can work with the broker dealer of your choice and ship it to them.

If not in town I will have to ship to you the 400 rounds of ammo and the magazines separately, based upon state and federal laws.  I have 4 ten round magpul magazines.  In addition I have two 25 round magazine kits and two 20 round magazine clips.  Based upon the final price I will through in a nice Cabela's soft carrying case.

So given I need this transaction to be completed no later than Friday I am asking $1300 (you get it immediately along with all extras) or best offer.  Plus the buyer covers all transfer and shipping fees as well as money transfer fees (which I will want the money sent MoneyGram if the buyer is not in Denver).  The gun transfer fee is $30 at my shooting range/dealer.  Typically for the buyer it is between 20 and 30 at the dealer of their choice in addition there is typically the $10 background check fee for the buyer.

I have attached pics and this truly is a great offer.  This is an amazing gun but I need the money more than the guns and that is why I am offering such an amazing deal.  $1300 (plus fees) Or best offer.

Please contact me either by replying to this posting or if you are serious and offering full price or very close please text me at REDACTED any time or night and I will immediately get back to you..

Look forward to doing business with you,

 Bought it new earlier this week, and its only had 50 rounds through it, will come with its case, mag loader, and two 11 round magazines. These are solid steel CZ75 clones if you aren't familiar with them, uses CZ pattern mags and can be carried cocked and locked or hammer down. The .40 caliber C-100 is hard to find here in the states and was only released here recently. Functions well but I didn't like it like I thought I would.

 I'd be interested in trading it for a different mid sized .40 or one of the police trade in Glock 22's that have flooded the market lately. I just bought an engagement ring for my girlfriend so I have no cash to add to a trade, so looking for an even trade only. Really only interested in .40's but would still consider 9mm's. Would also be interested in a S&W J Frame snub revolver in .38 special of some sort.
 Would prefer to trade, but I'll sell for $300 firm if not interested in trading.

The PT22 is a steel frame and slide, manufactured in the USA. It has a spur-less hammer, and a long but smooth double action only (DAO) trigger. 
Something these little Taurus pistols have been praised for is the tip-up barrel design. What looks something like a slide release on the left side of the gun is actually a barrel release. Press it forward and the rear of the barrel pops up for loading a round directly into the chamber. There is no need to rack the slide, which is a benefit to those who, because of arthritis or other hand weakness, are unable to operate conventional auto pistols. Very accurate for its size with almost no felt recoil.

For sale or possible trade is a 9mm M&P pro series 9mm CORE. This is the optics ready model. Gun is in pristine condition. Previous owner stated round count around 100. I have not fired it. I took it on trade and decided I would rather have another 1911. This gun has the APEX competition kit installed with the aluminum trigger kit as well. This kit alone runs around $175 plus installation. The trigger pull and reset is incredible. All original parts included. Comes with 4 mags and the original box with backstraps. Asking $700. Primary trade interests would be 1911s. May consider other guns in 9 or 45 only. Trades must be in excellent condition. Will add cash for the right deal. FTF in the Evansville area. Will ask to see LTCH. 
Cash price reduced to $650."

Optics and 10 rd mag are NOT included in the sale of the rifle, but I will include a new, out of the package but not used 30 rd Pmag.. 

The upper is from Red X. It has a 16"" stainless, fluted barrel. It is a 1in10 twist and has 5/8x24 threads with their stainless steel x-treme muzzle brake. Keyhole forged aluminum upper receiver with dust cover and forward assist. Charging handle and Rock River Arms bcg are included if you're buying, or may want to keep yours if you're trading. $500 or trade for your similar 5.56 upper. Your upper doesn't have to be stainless, just similarly valued. 

I don't have much info on the lower because I got it in a trade a couple of years ago. I do know that it is a Spike's Tactical Model SL 15 ""Zombie"" lower. I don't know which brand of LPK is in it, but I have to assume it's standard. 

I have taken two deer with this rifle this season using reloads. The bullets were 150gr soft point over 15gr of H110. One at the totally unfair distance of about 15 feet and the other at about 70 yards. Neither shot was typical but neither deer ran more than 30 yards.

In conclusion, I am asking $500 for the complete upper or trade for your very similar upper. If buying, the BCG and CH come with. If trading, you can keep yours if you want and I'll keep mine. I am asking $800 for the rifle, minus the optics and 10rd mag. If buying, you will get a 30 rd new/used Pmag. If trading, there's not much need in trading mags.

 I am thinning my 1911 collection some.
 This is a V-10 Compensated 3 1/2"" barrel in .45 ACP.  This pistol honestly recoils like a 9mm...  ( In my opinion), the combination of a lightweight frame, Compact barrel, Compact grip ( still holds 7 plus 1 ) , and the power of the .45 with 9mm recoil, makes this a perfect carry pistol for a man OR a woman. And a quality manufacturer at an affordable price. Factory box and paperwork included.
 No Calif sales. Face to face in OK. Out of state requires an FFL. $35 covers transfer and shipping.

The additions that made it ideal for law enforcement also make it perfect for home defense, so we gladly offer it for sale to the public. A full-size 1911, the Specialist is chambered in .45 and loaded with features to satisfy a public servant’s special requirements. The forged stainless steel slide wears our popular Clark-style serrated rib with a single amber tritium dot in the rear sight and a green lamp with white target ring in front. The frame sports an integral 1913 Picatinny, 25 LPI front strap checkering, undercut trigger guard and recessed slide stop to enable the installation of laser grips. Equipped with an ambidextrous thumb safety, extended magazine release and detachable two-piece magwell, the Specialist is operator-friendly. It is finished off with a set of G10 VZ Operator II grips that force the hand into the beavertail and hold it there. The Specialist ships with two 8-round magazines with bump pads and is available in either a matte stainless finish or our Duty Black finish, which makes for an especially hardy pistol that scoffs at everyday wear and tear."

Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability: The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN."

Later imports that appear to be blued or flat black were refinished before being imported. Of course there is nothing wrong with the refurbed guns. However if you are a purist and/or a collector then the real deal in it's original ""as issued"" condition might be more desirable.

I took this particular pistol on trade recently and it is in absolutely excellent shape with only the slightest wear around the muzzle from being holstered. I rate it an easy 95%+ gun. The grips are the original brown Bakelite and they not chipped or cracked. Then the bore is bright and in great shape which is important since many of these pistols have dark or worse bores from the corrosive ammo they used.

Pistol comes with 2 magazines one of which is original to the pistol with the same gray phosphate finish. The other is a brand new blued model that's never had a round loaded in it. There is also an original cleaning rod, and a real CZ52 green nylon rope lanyard plus an operators manual printed in English.

Additionally there is an early original holster that is somewhat unusual because it's made of pig skin. It's in very good condition without any tears or bad stitches. The majority of the CZ52 holsters you'll see are light colored leather. So the pig skin version is another feature that collectors favor. You probably can't see this well from the photos because my iPad lacks the resolution to capture such fine details but it's very obviously pig skin when you see it in person.

Price is $350.00. FTF only picked up in the Brandon area. Buyer must be a Florida resident at least 21 years old.

I also have a collection of 252 rounds of 7.62x25 ammo as described below that I will sell to the buyer of this pistol only for an additional $70 which works out to less than $.30 a round

This is a copy of the S&W Model 686 (S&W and Taurus were owned by the same company at one time).

In 1970 Smith & Wesson had been purchased by a conglomerate named Bangor Punta. Bangor Punta also purchased 54% of Taurus. Thus, the two companies became ""sisters"". Smith & Wesson never owned Taurus. They were both independent companies. However, during the next seven years, a great deal of technology, methodology, machinery and tooling were passed between the two. So many Taurus models are actually S&W’s made on Brazil on Smith machinery and with Smith tooling.

Comes with everything in the original box. 5 mags (3 factory, 2 brand new extended 31 round), lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me."

845,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3757845,For Sale/Trade:  VERY RARE.  First year 1913 General Patton Cavalry Sabre,"Chicago, Chicago, Illinois",$ 800,"Listed On: Saturday, November 29, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"After doing some research on my cutlass I realized how rare this is.  This is the first year production (1913) Springfield Armory ""Patton"" Cavalry Sabre.  Not many of these have survived the years ESPECIALLY from 1913. Serial Number 3367.  This would be a great cutlass to add to any collection.  Shows minor signs of surface rust as to be expected but in overall good condition.

The cavalry saber, Model 1913, was the last saber issued to and used by the U.S. Cavalry. The designer of the ""last of the bright blades"" was Lieutenant George S. Patton, Jr. At the time of the redesign, Patton was ""Master of the Sword at the Mounted Service School"" at Fort Riley, Kansas. Quite an honor for a young Army Lieutenant. Because of his involvement with and enthusiasm for the cavalry saber Patton was given the first of many nicknames, ""Saber George.""

You may find these from later years for around $400- $600.  The only other 1913 I have seen was in worse condition and went for $1000.  I'm Asking for $800 cash or $1000 in trade value."

Complete package with manual, holster and 2 magazines.

This is a Walther P-38 9mm that is hard chromed. The gun is in excellent condition, I would say 90%.

There were three companies manufacturing these during WWII - Walther,  Mauser and Spreewerke. 

The serial numbers on this gun are distinct and all match. The wartime code on the gun is AC44 which designates it was made by the Walther company in 1944. The serial number is 327 J which says it was the 327th gun made in the 10th month as the "" J""  refers to month of manufacture. It has all the Waffenamt Proof marks consistent with the Walther Company. The original 8 round mag has the WaA135 with eagle which says it was made in the Mauser  factory for Walther Miltary in the 1940's (These original  mags by the way sell individually for $200 to $250). 

There is also a after-market 8 round blued magazine as 2nd mag.

The holster I believe is reproduction and is essentially brand new but has the stamp ""Otto Sindel, Berlin, 1938"" with Swastika and WaA91. Also stamped P-38.

Includes 1-30rd magazine, box and all original accessories and paperwork. Sig Sauer Model Number R556XI-16B-C. Introducing the SIG556xi, rewriting the standard for modularity, reliability, and performance for the modern rifle platform. Based on the legendary SG 550, the SIG556xi will change the way military, law enforcement, and responsible citizens look at adaptable rifles. Utilizing the time-tested rotating bolt and adjustable gas piston operating system, the SIG556xi allows operators a choice of caliber, barrel length, handguard/stock configurations and lower receivers. A removable barrel allows the operator to select the necessary length for a given mission. Adding the appropriate bolt, the SIG556xi can be changed to any of three calibers, 5.56x45mm NATO, 300 Blackout, and 7.62x39mm NATO. Users can also quickly change out the non-serialized lower receiver, allowing the use of either AR-style STANAG magazines or rock-and-lock AK-style magazines. The SIG556xi upper receiver is the serialized part, making the lower an easy to purchase part. Polymer handguards accept all Magpul® light and rail kits, while the aluminum and carbon fiber handguards accept 2”, 4”, and 6” M1913 rails. Barrels are available in 10”, 14.5”, and 16”. Truly ambidextrous, the SIG556xi features an ambi safety selector, magazine release and user swappable charging handle (right- or left-handed). Optional receiver end plates allow for the use of either AR receiver extension tubes and buttstocks or M1913 compatible stocks. Sig Sauer 556xi Rifle, 5.56x45mm, 1-30rd Mag"
