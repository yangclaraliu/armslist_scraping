I’m selling my Ruger GP100 (Model #01752). This one is # 69 of 2000 in the Wiley Clapp/Talo distributer exclusive model. I paid $779+Tax at Sportsmans Warehouse a few months back. I’ve put about 50 rounds through it. It is super accurate and really fun to shoot. Gun is in perfect working order and only shows very minor wear. never holstered and stored in my vault.
I’d love to keep it but it was an impulse buy at the time and now I just need to free up some cash.

With holiday season here I'm motivated to sell fast and make some money so make an offer

Please do not contact me if you're going to ask me to ship this, I can't and won't do that.
I also would prefer not to travel a large distance to sell this gun, but if the price is right I might consider it. If you're from Asheville, Black Mountain, Swanannoa, Oteen, Hendersonville, Arden, Old Fort, Morganton, Weaverville, Leicester, Candler, Canton, Fletcher, Fairview, or surrounding area let me know, we can work something out.. 
I will also be in the Robbinsville, Bryson City, Murphy area every now and then so let me know if you're interested and in that area or any area between Robbinsville and Asheville (cherokee, sylva, etc...).  Past that I don't really want to travel, but like I said I will consider it.

If you're interested shoot me an email. Any questions shoot me an email.
If you're offer is solid I'll give you my number so we can work something out faster than emailing back and forth.

330,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3767330,For Sale:  Advanced Armament Corporation AAC Ti-Rant .45,"Ellisville, Hattiesburg, Mississippi",$ 850,"Listed On: Saturday, June 2, 2018",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Ti-RANT .45 is the world’s first silencer for .45 ACP pistols that is truly stealthy when fired dry. The average dry sound signature of the Ti-RANT .45 is 133 dB when fired on a Heckler and Koch USP Tactical .45 with Remington 230 grain ammunition. This puts the dry performance of the Ti-RANT .45 squarely in the ballpark of most competitor's 9mm pistol silencers. With a wet charge of 5cc’s of water, the sound signature drops to 125 dB. To put it another way, our .45 silencer is quieter than some company’s .22 silencers. The Ti-RANT .45 does not stand out among a sea of posers just because of its jaw-dropping performance. Intelligent material selection gives the Ti-RANT .45 unequalled durability in a deceptively light-weight package. 

The Ti-RANT .45 incorporates AAC’s new A.S.A.P.™ CLUTCH. This highly evolved Nielsen device enables flawless semi-automatic operation on all relevant host pistols, and can be fully disassembled for cleaning or piston replacement with no tools in seconds. The Ti-RANT .45 can be outfitted with pistons threaded M16 x 1 Right Hand, M16 x 1 Left Hand, and two pistons threaded .578-28; one extended for the Sig P-220 and 1911’s with a full length guide rod, and a flush mount for 1911’s with a standard G.I. guide rod. For multi-caliber use, pistons are available in the most common 9mm and .40 thread patterns to allow use of the Ti-RANT 45 on hosts in those calibers.

It is used in good shape.  Has less than 1000rds through it.  Well maintained and a nice shooter.

16"" CAR lightweight barrel (light under handguards, not an HBAR) 1/9 twist & chrome lined.

F marked front sight base with bayonet lug and A2 flash hider.

Flat top upper, carbine handguards, 6 position stock, and standard RRA trigger group.

I replaced the original RRA BCG with an M16 BCG from AimSurplus.  It was advertised as MPI a and HP test bolt, however it is not marked as such.

The detach carry handle is Colt (I didn't have a rear sight when I bought this).  Therefore the carry handle is not marked with the RRA logo (I assure that it is a Colt carry handle).

I've also installed a set of KNS anti rotational trigger group pins.  They are the gen2 mod2 dogbone like type in black.  The original hammer / trigger pins will be included.

In addition, it has a RRA H buffer installed in lieu of the standard CAR buffer it came with.

I also properly staked the castle nut on the buffer tube.

Comes with sling and three used 30rd USGI mags made by Okay Ind.  No box or any other accessories included.

Everything on the POF is original with the exception of the Magpul ASAP end plate for single-point sling attachment.  The pinned compensator brings overall barrel length to 16"", and does a great job of keeping flat follow-up shots for rapid fire.  Ideal optics would be any red dot, or an ACOG, but would do very well scoped for longer range as well.  The barrel is 1/8 twist, fluted with a big heat-dissipating barrel nut, and ready for essentially any application.  The action is piston-driven with a very slick BCG, all very easy to clean.  The piston system has a setting for suppressed, if you're planning to go that route.  Like I said, ready to be customized for essentially any application."

I installed the Taurus factory extended grips so no fingers hang off the gun. MSRP$608 ASKING$475 Including a custom Clement Leather holster ($60 value).

Second the PT 709 Slim in 9mm +P. The name says it all. Its very slim. Easily concealable and comfortable. About 300 rounds through it. Installed Pearce grip extension and grip tape. The grip tape easily and cleanly removes if purchaser prefers. MSRP $404 ASKING $325 Including an Alien Gear holster 2.0 IWB ($40 value).

Third the 85 Poly Protector in 38spl +P. Super light weight but recoil easily managable. Smooth trigger. Nice pocket gun. No modifications. About 200 rounds through it. MSRP $398 ASKING $325 Including an Alien Gear Holster 2.0 IWB ($40 value).

All 3 guns are in great condition because my mom told me when I was a kid ""take care of your shit!"". All 3 are in working order. They MSRP together for $1410. ASKING $1125 if sold separately. I would bundle all 3 for $975. I will only consider trades for other firearms or firearms plus cash.

One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces.HK Heckler & Koch
Mark 23 .45 ACP 5.8 Inch Barrel Black Finish Polymer Frame 12 Round
Recoil operated with locked breech and tilting barrel. Grips made of glass fibre reinforced polymer with corrosion proof metal inserts. Ambidextrous safety with separate de-cocking lever for the hammer. Steel magazine with 12 round capacity. Integrated support rail for aiming units. Open square notch rear sight with contrast points.

 The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns - yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun.



The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more.

One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces.

On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1.

During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!

This person has contacted me and wanted to use Paypal for the transaction on a rifle. Since he did not live anywhere near me, he stated that he would be sending someone to pick it up. After exchanging Paypal information I was emailed several times (with the exact same email) by someone calling themselves Pedro and stating that they were holding the amount (the term escrow was never used) since it was a large sum of money, and a verification of funds email would soon follow. Even though he started off as Pedro, the email was signed as the President of Paypal. Information anyone with even slight Google-fu can look up.

Not too long after that, I received an email from the person that wanted to purchase the rifle, stating that the party that would be picking up the rifle has to be paid via Western Union before they would come and pick up the rifle. He stated that he included the amount for the Western Union payment along with their fee with the payment for the weapon. Without disclosing dollar amounts, the amount to be paid to the transporter was over 50% of the price for the rifle. As if that wasn't a tip off enough, the large amount, combined with the following email from Paypal definitely was. The next email I received (again received multiple times) stated that Paypal would hold the money until I went and paid the ""Company"" that would be picking up the rifle (and it was a guy's name, not a company) the $900 and sent Paypal security a copy of the receipt. Only when I had paid the $900 out of pocket would they release the money owed for the rifle, a reimbursement for the $900, and an extra $100 for the Western Union fees.

Not only were the emails in severely broken english, but why in the world would Paypal hold money in escrow until a third party had been paid for services that had not even been rendered yet. Also, why would a person want me to pay someone to pick up a purchase for him instead of paying them himself? A long read, but a cautionary one. Stay away from scams out there guys and gals."

Included is two 10 round magazines that came with the gun.

The Sig P226R in 9mm is the gun the Navy SEALS use, this is the same gun except chambered in 45acp. “At first glance, the P227 is deceptive. The size, shape, proportions and even the grip contours are so much like the P226 that unless you picked them up one right after the other, you’d be hard-pressed to tell which was which. If you had a P227 on the counter and let someone pick it up without a companion P226, it might be quite some time before they noticed the caliber designation on the barrel”. – Guns and Ammo Magazine

The bow is in great condition and shoots well. Included with the purchase of the bow are two truglow sights, one whisker biscuit, one quiver, one release, five broadheads, four feild points, one lighted nock, two stabilizers, one wrist strap release, Plano hard bow case, four GoldTip 5575 arrows, and a foam target. This is everything you need to get started bow hunting, I used the bow in Ohio this year to kill a eight pointer, the only reason I am selling it is because I am getting a good deal on a new bow. I am looking to sell the package for $375 or I would be willing to trade it for a semi automatic or bolt action hunting rifle with or with out optics.

""Considered by many to be the 'bowhunters bow'; the FX is not only lightweight and maneuverable, it's also hard-hitting and dead on accurate as well. Add to that the slimmer Mathews Competition grip and Realtree X-Tra Camouflage, and you've got a bow that preforms in the field.""

It used to be an 1898 full sized rifle but sometime in its life it was cut down to a 20"" barreled carbine. In my opinion it was a rather tasteful sporterization. The receiver is not drilled or tapped and the wood dose not have any cheesy checkering or anything like that. There is no rust or pitting anywhere on this gun. while there is not much bluing left ( I doubt it would be original anyway ) it has a very handsome patina. There are no cracks on the locking lug or bolt shank but there are some small and long hairline cracks on the upper handguard. You can see the most obvious one in the 3rd photo. It has a 2 position mauser style saftey that locks up the action when engaged. The capacity is 5+1, but is also equiped with a magazine cutoff switch for use as a single shot. Standard features for the time. The rear sight, when folded has increments of 100, 200, 300, B (battlefield zero perhaps? ) and 400 yards. If you flip the ladder up the notch resumes at 500 yards and goes up to 1900. With the ladder still up you also get a pep style appeture sight from 100 to 1800 yards. And finally on the very top of the ladder is a knotch set at 2000 yards. 

While this has lost its collectability because of the chopped barrel, it's still a piece of Americana, made by the REAL Springfield arsenal before they sold their name. So in that regard if you want something that still has a bit of history to it, but don't want to feel guilty about shooting, this may be of interest. I will include 40 factory bitterroot valley cartridges as well

The serial number starts with 582XXX. This is the thicker barreled version. 
This Mini 14 comes with 4 Ruger magazines, three 20rd mags and one 30rd mag. 
I installed a custom Trushot-Technologies barrel stabilizer which helps enhance accuracy and eliminate shot stringing. I also installed a front sling stud for bipod mounting or sling. Original front sling mount was removed, but reinstalled for selling. Also included is the picatinny rail shown in the photo, and two sets of Ruger steel scope rings, (1” and 30MM) which can be used with picatinny rail removed. The tuned trigger is amazing! I doubt you will ever find a mini 14 trigger like this one. It has a light but definite first stage, and light crisp second stage, it has a very short take up and reset. In side by side comparison, this trigger is very similar to Geissle SSA-E trigger which really helps with accuracy on the bench and offhand shooting. The action and trigger on this Mini is the absolute smoothest I have ever felt on any Mini 14, and accuracy (with the work done to this rifle) is better than what you can get off the shelf. Group in picture was shot was at 100yds. 
The rifle is used, but only to the extent to test the upgrades. I am confident that the owner of this Mini will not be disappointment.
ALL items mentioned included. NO TRADES PLEASE! CASH ONLY.
This item is for sale ONLY to those who currently are legally allowed to purchase firearms in the state of Oregon. I will want a copy of your currently active ODL for my records and signed bill of sale. If you are not allowed to legally own firearms in the state of Oregon please do not respond to this offer.
