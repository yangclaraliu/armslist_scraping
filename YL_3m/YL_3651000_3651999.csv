Call us at REDACTED

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

The underfolding stock locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, the stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it. This SAM7UF model 7.62x39.5mm caliber rifle, milled and forged receiver, chrome lined hammer forged barrel, 14x1mm muzzle left hand threads, muzzle nut, bayonet and accessory lugs, reinforced underfolding buttstock, black polymer pistol grip and handguards, stainless steel head shield, ambidextrous safety lever, sectional cleaning rod, 1x 10rnd, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit."

It will chamber both 2.75"" or 3"" magnum ammo and holds up to 6 in the tube and 1 in the chamber. It has black composite stocks with some scratches & wear from normal use. The receiver is blue steel, the barrel bore is bright with no pits and the action is in excellent condition. There are no plastic or MIM parts used on this gun (unlike the Express model). It was built to last with an action smooth-as-silk.  The 870 POLICE MAGNUM has these improved characteristics: An aluminum trigger group as opposed to the plastic one used in the Express models. An old style magazine retention system. A much smoother finish inside and out with minimal machine marks or burrs. The Police gun receives a higher level of inspection and finishing and is built in a special area of the plant from 100% inspected parts. It has a one piece barrel and the bore was polished. Heavy-duty trigger / sear spring. Heavy-duty shell lifter spring. The barrel is locked down with a ""ball detent"" system (as opposed to the lesser grade ""synthetic magazine spring retainer"" lock down used in the Express models). A milled extractor (as opposed to the MIM extractor used in the Express models). Remington builds these guns specifically for law enforcement and military use. They have to be 100% reliable and able to withstand the toughest of field conditions. For these reasons, the 870 POLICE MAGNUM was built to the highest standard for endurance and reliability.

I have taken it to hunt pigs twice with the current set up and two shots one about 175 yards and one 100 yards two pigs down.  Very fun gun to shoot and everyone drools over it in person.

I would like to move into a semi auto .308 but more specifically a PTR - 91.  I am open to other semi auto rifles that shoot .308.

Scout Scopes - I went through a few so here are my thoughts:

First Try - http://www.opticsplanet.com/redfield-counterstrike-red-dot-sight-matte.html

Loved the design with both red dot and laser - Very accurate out to 200 yards but just couldn't handle the 308 round - Had to return twice - In the end I found the iron sights to be just as good out to 200 yards 

Second Try - http://www.opticsplanet.com/burris-2-75x-heavy-plex-mat-scout-scopes.html

Great scope and had good eye relief and fit the scout concept of fast target acquisition but lacked on long range shots

Current Scope - http://www.opticsplanet.com/leapers-2-7x44-30mm-long-eye-relief-scout-rifle-scope.html

Best to date and IMO after trying multiple scopes and reading a million reviews the best scout scope on the market - Great Eye Relief - 4x provides quick target acquisition while stalking and 7x allows you to reach out and touch something - Illuminated recital is awesome (50 colors) and glass is just as good as Nikon - Has held zero since my 6th shot and is easy to make slight adjustments on the fly - parallax is great for LER scope - The downside is the scope is bigger than the others and a little heavy - UTG/Leapers make a quality product and feel free to research that.

This rifle still has its old scope numbers on the side of it. 

Every number matches on this rifle,  and the bore is excellent."

And the best of these rifles were thought to be the pre 1964 guns until 2008. In 2008, Winchester redesigned the Model 70 and went back to the better (and more expensive) building methods (aka pre 1964). This gun is the best of the best. It was made in 2008 and it's a Limited Edition 2008 which comes with a beautiful marble-walnut stock. 
Another important note about Model 70's. In 2013, Winchester decided to stop assembling the model 70's in the USA. That's right, any new Model 70 is now assembled in Portugal. 5+ years from now, the guns made from 2008-2013 will command a premium in their Portuguese assembled brethren.

About THIS gun! It's a 2008 Limited Edition Winchester Model 70 .270 WSM. It'll be perfect for ANY type of hunting in North America. It's NEVER BEEN FIRED, and the condition reflects this. There's a TINY nick on the bottom of the stock, and a little rubbing of the bluing on the barrel from sitting in the safe, but it's been repaired. I'm selling it because I think I'd rather have something that I wouldn't feel bad about dinging up when I go hunting. 
I believe my price of $650 is very fair, as this gun was over $1000 brand new.

 THE LEGEND CONTINUES, the legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic SWAT is a semi automatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate.

Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic SWAT features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as a aluminum quadrail forend that is ideally suited for mounting accessories. The Classic SWAT’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ barrel. SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor.

The SIG 556 Classic SWAT is available for law enforcement and responsible citizens. Obtaining a sight picture with the SIG556 SWAT model now takes place using a new rear rotary diopter sight, utilizing aperture calibrations from close quarter ranges out to 100m, 200m, and 300m.

I would classify this as a shooter/plinker with project potential. If you are looking for a safe queen, this is not your rifle. I purchased for a blueing project, but decided to let the Marlin be in its original skin once I thoroughly cleaned it up and some work. I added the front sight hood which is new and so does not have the same patina as the rest of the bluing. I think it is awesome looking as is. Please see pictures as I tried to show as much as possible. 

After I purchased the rifle, I realized that the original 781 cartridge guide spring (less than $8 on amazon) was broken off. This was not disclosed to me. It does not affect loading the 22lr, but I suspect the guide is there for the shorter rounds such as the 22 long / short to help it into the chamber. I don't know for sure this is just a hunch. I shot 22lr and it loads fine."

DOUBLE ACTION . AMBIDEXTROUS DE-Cocker Type SAFETY.Parkerized. Based on Beretta PT series but with SQUARE METAL FULL COVER  SLIDE like Glocks .  Comes with 2 Magazines. It is a LIGHTER WEIGHT GUN than the BERETTA PT 92 ,thus not as COMBERSOME to CARRY.
 You CAN Convert this Gun to 9mm Luger with JUST a BARRELL CHANGE!
   It is Based on the PT 92 Series but with  a Squared top Slide. Adjustable rear Sight, AMBIDEXTROUS DE-COCKER Type SAFETY (OH GOODY!)  and the SLIDE in MY OPINION OFFERS MUCH BETTER grip on it than MANY HANDGUNS !  IT CAN BE CARRIED "" COCKED & LOCKED "" Just like a 1911 except that the TAURUS PT 38S is a DOUBLE ACTION Pistol !
 The Sights are nice SQUARE COMBAT STYLE and the FLAT TOP SLIDE with these sights enable a FAST SIGHT ACQUISITION ! The Gun has had More Holster wear than Shooting Wear.
 It seems to be a LIGHTER GUN than Most Big Autos and is really EASIER to carry Around as it DOESN'T WEIGH a TON !! 
       The .38 SUPER HITS HARDER than 9MM Luger Round as the BULLET IS HEAVIER and a Bit FASTER!
 Comes with 2 Magazines and 1 box of 50 Winchester Silvertip HOLLOW POINT  Ammo and one box of 9mm Largo which is the same as the old COLT .38 Auto except with a Pointier Bullet  ( but I grind off the very end of the POINTY BULLET TIPS about 3mm as the Pointier Copper Round needs to be a tad shorter to fit in the Magazine.). Then they work fine . The 9mm Largo are cheaper than .38 SUPER so for Plinking they are fine.
  You CAN Convert this Gun to 9mm Luger with JUST a BARREL CHANGE!
 HOWEVER the 38 SUPER  is a longer Cartridge and can be Hand Loaded to much Higher Velocities than 9mm Luger..38 SUPER has a HEAVIER BULLET than 9mm Luger so even if they were going the SAME SPEED the .38 SUPER DELIVERS MORE POWER! 
 It is generally Only Loaded toSlightly Higher Speeds than 9mm Luger as the .38 Super uses the SAME CASE as the Old COLT .38 Automatic and Manufacturers stopped loading the .38 Super to it's REAL POTENTIAL after many Shooters Fired .38 SUPER in OLDER COLT .38 AUTOMATICS and BLEW THEM UP! 
 Think of the ORIGINAL .38 SUPER as a .38 AUTOMATIC MAGNUM or .357 MAGNUM!!  Guns Chambered for and Made for the OLD .38 AUTOMATIC round were DISCONTINUED in 1939 due to WW2 1911 Colt .45 Automatic contracts. 
    .38 AUTOMATIC WAS a VERY POPULAR HANDGUN in the CIVILIAN MARKET but  it was in Production in some form of COLT AUTOMATIC since 1900 (!!!! ) .
  BUT the .38 AUTOMATICS COULD NOT TAKE THE .38 SUPER ROUND!!
    SO,.. ANOTHER GREAT IDEA ( the HIGH VELOCITY  .38 SUPER Round ) HURT by Consumers BEING DUMBSH-TS!!

Easily removable if undesired, but very nice in dark. See picture. Less than 100 rounds through it. Bought for my fiancée new, but she changed her mind about carrying. I have the original paperwork, case, warranty card and lock.

I have spent over $475 on this gun, and to get it new, plus all the upgrades I have, would cost you the same amount, plus time to ship and transfer from an FFL.

Cash only. FTF. Must sign bill of sale. $400 firm. Must come to Keller. Will meet for extra $20 in DFW.

I will trade towards a Glock 20 or Glock 21, and am willing to throw in cash to even it out."

Another thought, Prices are still going up—We paid $ XXX.XX for these plots 30 years ago, and our asking price is less than what they are selling for now.  

80% of all Cemetery Property is sold under one and only one circumstance and that is a death that day. This death will require a Cemetery Plot at the Cemetery you have your property at and if you are found as having a way for the family or Funeral Director to know you have such property.  

Want to wait it out? They will more $$$ if you buy them from the Cemeteries.

This is our offer:

Description: Brookside Memorial Park: Prefer Selling Two (2) adjacent plots near a beautiful Old Oak, in the highly desirable ""Lakeview"" of Section 680, Spaces 1 & 2.  Space #1 is positioned towards the Lake, which is enjoyed by the Ducks and other birds.  Brookside Memorial Park is one of Houston's largest and most beautiful cemeteries you will ever come across.  It has some of the most beautiful landscape, which consists of enchanting 500+ year old Oak trees, a pond with a calm variety of Ducks, Geese and other birds swimming about.  Shade from the trees allow you and your loved ones enjoyment, while visiting the loved ones who reside in this one of a kind cemetery.  It is maintained by the staff at Brookside, which I must say they do a great job.  It is located off Hwy 59 and Lauder Road.  The Market Value for these beautiful plots (with easy access by the street, no getting out of your car and having to walk some distance to get to your loved ones) is normally over $6,500 each (check Ebay and others).

We are asking Buy price is $4,000 each, ($7,500 for Both).  We have other burial places, so this is the reason we are selling.

Thank you for the consideration! If trading a gun, Proof of residency required and if the buyer is out of state or needs shipping, then firearms must shipped from a FFL dealer in your area to me (I have a FFL) and applicable shipping/handling charges will be covered at buyer’s expense.

I did my research before I bought it, and ocean kayak only labels them as ""blems"" for cosmetic issues. Which I have looked it over, and cannot find anything out of the ordinary. 

I bought this from an older guy this summer, and he said he's only used it about 6 times, and I've only taken it out 5 times this summer. When I bought it, it still had the plastic packaging on the carry handles. 

Comes with a lowrance elite 3x color fishfinder, carlilse daytripper paddle, and a bass pro life jacket. Has an anchor trolley installed, and scupper plugs are included. All items were bought new from bass pro this summer, and have only seen the water 5 times. It also comes with a homemade kayak cart, but you'll have to get wheels. I used the wheels off of my furniture dolly, so I'll need to take those off. I just don't have as much time as I wanted to use, so it has to go. Taking up too much space in my garage, for how little I used it. 

I'm asking $800, may entertain offers but no lowballers. Just want to get close to what I put into it, and this kayak is in great condition. Just a little dirty from sand getting in the cockpit.

The flat top upper receiver allows for easy mounting of optical, night vision, and other tactical sighting systems. The tactical carbine is the answer to all the requirements of modern law enforcement, defensive use, or all around carbine."
