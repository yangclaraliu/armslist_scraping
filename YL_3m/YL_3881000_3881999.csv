Has a pistol length gas system (I may have a pistol gas tube laying around, but do not have a low profile gas block to go with it). It comes with a Yankee Hill flash hider. The crush washer on there was used once, so you can either use it again or get a new one, they aren't hard to find. Honestly, I have reused them before, but everyone and their mother during the ""mandatory"" safety briefing will say not to reuse. I used this barrel on a build (hence the scuffs and dimples for the gas block), but needed a shorty 5.56 for my wife, so away this one goes. Last two pics are what it looked like with an 11inch hand guard and the YHM flash hider.

The ""I-beam"" design provides the user a better field of view and is lighter than our LT660 mount. Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and matt black anodized to provide a durable non-reflective surface finish. The locking LaRue Speed Lever provides outstanding return to zero, the optic can be removed and replaced without loss of zero.

Early model.  Not carried.  I have had this gun for about 17 years and life changes means it's gotta go.  If you don't know about the champion models check out the link below.  This is an early model, so take a mill spec 1911, add target sights and knock an inch off the barrel and you have the Champion.  This model comes with black pearl grips, mainly because I have big hands and it felt better.  My loss is your gain.

Due to my current work situation I rarely get to the range anymore and unfortunately my little beauty doesn't get the attention she needs. A LWRC M6A2 16"" barrel gas piston rifle, commonly referred to as the Cadillac of piston AR's. Boy howdy is that a correct statement! I've only put just shy of 900 rounds through her, but damn if she never jammed AND kept at least 2MOA or better with stock PMC 55 grain ammunition. Even better when I fed her some 75 grain Hornady TAP. Since day one I coddled her with with dry impregnated Frog Lube, so she'll run like a champ as long as you don't coat her in petroleum based junk anytime soon.

So, the nitty and gritty of what I'm selling:
The M6A2 comes with troy BUIS, VLTOR Emod stock and Magpul pistol grip on top of its award winning operating system. Some other enhancements and extras that are included with the gun as follows:
- POF muzzle break
- Rock River Arms two stage trigger
- PRI gas buster charging handle
- Magpul BAD lever
- GG&G quick detach sling mount and rear sling attachment over castle nut
- Tango Down front grip
- Magpul sanoprene rail ladders
- Viking Tactics sling
- Tac Force nylon bag
- A Magpul Pmag

* I've got a Streamlight TLR-1 that can be added for $50 if interested and a small amount of PMC ammunition for $7.50 per box if you need a few

These parts have been used but are mechanically 100% functional and these were painted black and put into storage (the mags were surplus to begin with so they). The muzzle device was used for a bit and was replaced with something of my own personal preference, and I refinished it black as well while doing the magazines.

The 18-inch genuine factory brand Remington Model 870 12-Gauge Magazine Extension Kit increases mag tube capacity by two extra rounds. Dependable, factory made magazine extensions provide additional round capacity for tactical operations and competitions of varying intensities. The all-steel extension tubes attach directly to the end of the magazine tube. The included magazine clamp attaches around the barrel and the extension for added support, and limits the amount of energy you need to expend while using this extension kit. The magazine spring is formed from high strength music wire that resists set and will not weaken over time. The purchase of this item includes tube assembly, swivel assembly with screw, magazine extension spring and coupling. Its parkerized finish gives it a sleek, clean look.

This shotgun is in like new condition with only four shells through it. If you are not familiar with this shotgun it is made in Turkey by the same factories that make the Canik CZ75 clones and TP9, Winchester SXP, and many other quality firearms. This is a 5+1 pump action that will chamber 3 inch shells. Has a built in recoil pad and pistol grip, as well as a nice set of fiber optic ghost ring sights, a receiver mounted picatinny rail, a removable breacher choke, and is VERY lightweight. This is a Benelli pattern shotgun and will accept extended benelli magazine tubes. Very similar to a Benelli M3 (sans the semi auto functionality) for a fraction of the cost.

In great shape but Ive had a few shotguns with pistol grips and ring sights and Ive found that I prefer a straight stock with a bead sight. This shotgun retails for $299, Id like to trade it for a similalrly priced 12 gauge shotgun with a straight stock, bead sight, and 18-20 inch cylinder bore barrel, such as a Remington 870, Mossberg 500/maverick 88, winchester sxp, or similar. Only looking for combat/hd style shotguns, absolutely not interested in field guns, sorry.
Might also be interested in a Taurus M85 or similar snub .38 special revolver, or a Polish P-64, or similar PPK style pistol in .32 acp, .380, or 9x18mm.

If not interested in trading I will sell for $200 firm.  I also have a decent amount of buckshot I can include for $50 extra.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

Thanks!

Everything works on it. All the lights, switches and solenoids work. The game plays fine. The cabinet has quite a bit of wear in some of the black areas, but it is 35 years old! The CPU was just serviced. The playfield is pretty clean and bright. The backglass has some wear but still looks good.

The hallmark of the 1903 design was its simplicity, which helped make it the most copied pistol in the world. The only feature that might possibly be considered complex or extraneous was the grip safety, which most imitators omitted, but the 1903 was the first gun ever manufactured with a grip safety. I suspect that military feedback on the 1900 Colt Automatic Pistol had influenced Browning’s design philosophy.  The pistol could also be disassembled without tools, which was another military preference.
The Model 1903 had the recoil spring beneath the barrel.  The barrel was firmly secured to the receiver by a series of lugs on the underside which mated with slots in the receiver.  
The sear, disconnector, hammer, and all springs were mounted in the receiver behind the magazine well, as was the grip safety.  The magazines hold 8 rounds. The quality of workmanship and finish on the early versions of this gun were the finest in the world at the time. The guns were heat blued and polished with oil-soaked leather. The trigger and manual safety lever were given a brilliant fire blue. Type III:  Serial numbers from 105,051 to 468,097 The primary difference in this variant was the elimination of the barrel bushing. A lug was added to the bottom front end of the barrel to keep it locked in position. At approximately serial number 114,700 the screw that retained the safety was eliminated. At some point, the slide cutout into which the barrel rotated was machined further to the rear, so the slide did not have to be retracted as far to disassemble the gun, and the takedown arrow was lengthened. In 1917 the United States Navy purchased 200 .32 caliber pocket models with serial numbers between 227,226 and 260,924 this one being 2424XX. I do not know if they received any special markings. Comes with two original, two tone magazines, zip case with pocket for the extra magazine and ammo, and the original manual that is full of all the info needed for this pistol. Please make educated offers for this 90%+ original unrestored piece of USA history, from the most accomplished firearms designer ever, RIP JMB.

Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. 

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards.

Spiral fluted bolt. This gun uses AR15 magazines. It comes with 1 10 round mag. This gun is a tack driver! I bought it about a year ago and did a 20 round barrel break in. I then sighted it in at 100 yards and it's been a safe Queen ever since. The rifle is topped with a very nice Burris E1 Illuminated 3-9x40 scope that is mounted to Burris Z Rings and have Butler Creek flip caps. I also have the original box and paperwork for the Rifle and scope. I have an AR and I just don't take this out when I go hunting. It shoots sub MOA and is in perfect condition. The gun cost me $550 and change, the scope was $300 and change and the rings and caps were about $50. The scope was mounted right! It was leveled with the gun. I don't expect to get all my money back but I don't have to sell so no low ball offers please. This gun is set up and ready to go predator hunting! Prefer to sell but would consider trades. $800 OBO I'm motivated to sell. Make me a reasonable offer and chances are we'll make a deal.

For some reason the 10 round mags hold 11 with a lil room to spare. 22+1.... can we all say wow? ok back to reality. All mags work/feed fine with high base or magnum rounds (HOT loads).  This weapon is not made for crap type shells. Now I bought x2 salem6  mag extenders to extend the 5 round stockers to 10 rounds. Honestly its not worth the time. Just buy the 10s until were not allowed to anymore.

Yes I have had a few emails that state ""they"" can buy an Akdal 1919 for $ 700 ish.... Yes you can buy a STOCK AKDAL 1919 lol. BUT you can not buy a fully modified for that price...Not sure why I even responded to that. oh well I posted a pic of the stock version.  Hope it helps for informational purposes.

Note: the Magpul 6 position stock has been pinned to make it legal for the state of California, also has the California compliant mag release button. 

Note: the charging handle is on the left side!!!! yes keep your eyes on your target. Can be swapped over for left handers as well. Has a bad lever installed. Must have for this particular weapon imo. Installed a S.A.W. pistol grip on it. Comes with a forward pistol grip but imo not needed unless you a lil guy.. Sorry fellas!! I installed a door breach muzzle break. Has standard magpul flip up sights. Not sure what else but there it is.!! Oh the Barrel is aftermarket."

It hasn't been shot much, maybe 300 rounds. The barrel and frame rails are not showing very much wear.

The gun has also gone through the SIG Custom shop for just about all they offer. I have done the following: 

*Action Enhancement Package: trigger pull is phenomenal, coming in right around 8 pounds in DA, and 4.5 in SA. The DA pull is a smooth as you can get and both modes break like glass.

*Short Reset Trigger 

*SIG Service Package, which replaced all the worn pins and springs and new sights.  

*Barrel Target Crown, and the guide rod is polished.

*Reduced Reach Trigger Installation.

All of these services combines cost over $500 according to SIG's website. The grips are also somewhat rare now as they are the aluminum slim grips made by SIG, not the new ones made by Hogue. These have a more aggressive texture to them. 

The gun will also come with the SIGLite night sights, 5 MecGar made factory mags (not the Checkmate junk), the original case, and paperwork. 

If you offer a trade, I am not interested in hunting rifles or shotguns, or .22s unless it's a SW M41, Colt Woodsman, something like that. And definitely no junk, like Hi Point, Cobra, Bryco, etc."

I will have the money anyway within a month, so at that point I won't care how quickly this rifle sells, HOWEVER for the next 2 WEEKS, you can get everything you see here for the reduced price you see here. All trade values remain the same. (remember that is cash out the door, no tax, no shipping, no ffl fee).

This rifle is factory assembled in Serbia so it hasn't been assembled by the rivet gremlins at Century.

If you're going to offer a trade make it tantalizing and it doesn't hurt to be prepared to add cash.

This belonged to my grandfather, and I cannot recall him ever shooting it.  It has been fired though.  I test fired it recently, and it functions perfectly.
