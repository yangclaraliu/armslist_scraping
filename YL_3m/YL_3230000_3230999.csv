I will require a picture of your offer, and your phone number. If I like the offer I will call you to verify you a legit and determine when we can meet. It is in your best interest to be honest about the condition of your trade. If anything is not as described I will take my gun and walk away. Like I said I like my gun, I'm not going to trade for garbage and I won't tolerate any dishonesty or misrepresentation.

I have a Sig P938 extreme that I'm wanting to modify/customize. The extreme model comes with grey Hogue G10 grips and all black hardware from the factory. I'm wanting to swap for one with polished/nickel ect like some of the nightmare and other models have. 

I thought I might post this first to see if someone out there might have one with the nickel accents that might want to trade for an all black model with G10 grips before I buy the sepperate parts. The only catch is that I want to keep my slide and barrel. The slides and barrels are not matched to the frames by serial numbers ect and this will not affect anything. So in short I'll trade my extreme lower for your nightmare lower to get the nickel accents. 

Mine is new in the box (test fired only) so I would ask that yours be in at least near new cond also.

The frame has been stippled and the trigger guard has been undercut professionally by Daniel Kinsler of DK custom triggers. The stippling is not very aggressive but allows for a better grip on the gun if your hands are sweaty/wet and the undercut trigger guard allows for a higher grip to have more control. The night sights are made by Trijcion and were installed at Tactical Advantage Corp. in Knoxville.  I'm looking to trade for a Gen 4 Glock 19 in similar condition with similar extras to what I am offering or cash to make up the difference.

Accurate with unwaivering reliability helped make these Smith and wesson 2nd and 3rd generation pistols so famous and popular. The gun shoots great, has chewed up spit out every single type of ammo i've ever run through it from cheap steel case surplus ammo to ultra premium nickel cased hollow points. I only ever had 1 failure to fire and that was due to a bad primer in a batch of reloads i ran through it. Its easy to break down and clean which I did after every time it was shot and once every week regaurdless because it was my carry gun. It has a 3.5"" barrel and holds a 13rd double stack magazine. The mags are stated as 12rd capacity but I switch out all 4 mags followers to increase capacity to 13rds so it will hold a total of 14 rounds if theres one in the chamber. Traditional double/single action with slide mounted ambidextorious decocker/safety. Bobbed hammer so it wont catch on things when carried concealed. does have bluing wear some nicks here and there as I carried it daily but functions flawlessly. If interested I can get the gun duracoated either black and/or satin/aluminum color for $100, would take him a couple days to do it and you would have to pay him separately from me.

Swarovski AV4-12x50 - Reticle Rifle scope. Extremely light and very handy. Swarovski AV rifle scope. Top quality resolution and amazing brightness in a 1"" tube. Ideal for mountain hunting and stalking. Lightweight, variable magnification, very compact construction and guaranteed protection from recoils with at least 90 mm (3.5"") of eye relief. Reticle in 2nd image plane for clear recognition and low target obscuration, even with long-distance precision shooting.
With small or large caliber firearms, on your own reserve or on an expedition - when out hunting, the precision of your riflescope is crucial. This means with everyshot, and that is why you can rely on our riflescopes. The patented Swarovski leaf spring system® ensures reliable reticle adjustment, and means absolute shot resistance, even with large caliber firearms. Get the best performance out of your quality rifle with a Swarovski riflescope for all hunting applications.

Swarovski Optik produces some of the world's finest optical designs and products. From their beginnings in 1905 until today, founder Daniel Swarovski's ""Constantly improving what is good"" motto has endured as a company mantra. Their brilliant, innovative optical products & designs exemplify their commitment to uncompromising quality.
The lightweight and compact construction of Swarovski's Habicht AV 4-12x50 SR Riflescope makes it an ideal choice for stalking and hunting game across difficult terrain. Like all riflescopes from Swarovski, this highly-refined sighting optic features world-class resolution, and amazing brightness.
The 4-12x50 configuration of this scope offers the hunter an edge in light-transmission, and magnification. At 4x your field of view is remarkably wide, comfortable, and bright. Dialing the power up to 12x narrows the field of view and magnifies your target, isolating it from disturbing backgrounds. Accurate long-range shot-placement is now a possibility.
The twilight performance of this Habicht AV scope is remarkable, particularly at the lower end of the magnification range. The 50mm objective lens enhances the light-transmission significantly, affording you the ability to hunt during twilight with success.
1.0"" main-tube is nitrogen purged for water, fog, & dust proof performance
Patented zero setting system provides precision adjustment of impact point without tools
Micro-structure grooves prevent residual reflections inside the tube for bright contrasty images, even with back lighting.
Swarovski Habicht AV
Swarovski's Habicht AV (American Variable) riflescopes feature a lightweight low-profile 1.0"" main-tube, variable power, 1/4 MOA precision adjustments, Swarotop and Swarodur multilayer, anti-reflective lens coatings, and a reticle positioned in the second (non-magnifying) focal plane.
Swarovski Mounting Rail
The innovative SR (Swarovski Rail) mounting rail system is available on select offerings within the Swarovski riflescope family. The integral fine-toothed rail prevents any movement of the riflescope, regardless of the caliber or recoil of your firearm. Two finely crafted mounting bases with matching teeth engage the rail on the underside of the riflescope for a stable, repeatable and dependable mounting solution. By eliminating the need for traditional mounting rings, the SR system eliminates unsightly & devastating gouge marks on your riflescope's main tube.
In order to mount a Swarovski riflescope with an SR rail, you will need to purchase and install a slotted Weaver type rail or bases to your receiver. In addition, a pair of Swarovski Cross Slot Mount Bases must be employed in order to fit the scope to the firearm. This is a precision mounting system and as such it is recommended that a qualified gunsmith install the mounting bases to your receiver for a proper fit and perfect alignment with the axis of your bore.
TDS-Plex Reticle in the Second Focal Plane
The TDS-Plex reticle is a choice option for varminters and long-range hunters. Four medium length posts and fine cross hairs pull your eye directly to your point of aim. The lower portion of the vertical stadia is intersected by four stepped hash marks that assist the shooter in calculating bullet-drop compensation. 
This scope has the reticle positioned in the second focal plane so its dimension does not change when adjusting the magnification level. This leaves the sight picture unobstructed for a clear view at all times.

Blackfoot Ammunition is different than most ammunition manufacturers for several reasons, but one stands out more than any; our commitment to making ammunition to the same standards you would expect from bench rest competition shooters.

Everything Blackfoot Ammunition produces is hand made. Powders are digitally weighed and hand thrown, bullets are hand seated and primers hand seated. This is not cheap factory ammunition. There is a ton of that around if that is what you are looking for; but if you want to put all of your shots in a dime at 100yds  this is the ammunition to get.

Great chat on Swarovski & Kahles TDS reticle info:
http://www.opticstalk.com/swarovski-kahles-tds-reticle-info_topic5024.html

Swarovski Optik produces some of the world's finest optical designs and products. From their beginnings in 1905 until today, founder Daniel Swarovski's ""Constantly improving what is good"" motto has endured as a company mantra. Their brilliant, innovative optical products & designs exemplify their commitment to uncompromising quality.

Seasoned hunters rely on maximum concentration & intense observation for a successful hunt. Physical exertion, reliable gear and a bit of luck must also be factored in, but without being able to see your target, you can not hit your target. How often have you wished that your riflescope could deliver more zoom or even a teeny bit wider view? If it were possible, think of all the shots you've had to pass on becoming a reality.

Parallax Correction
Factory preset to 219 yd (200m)
Swarotop Coatings
Proprietary lens coatings increase light transmission & micro-grooves on the edges of lens elements prevent residual reflections inside the tube for bright, high-contrast images under all lighting conditions.
Operating Temperature
-4 to 131° F (-20 to +55° C)
(storage temperature range; -22 to +158° f -30 to +70° C)
Waterproof and Fogproof
Nitrogen purged main tube is waterproof to 13' (4.0m)
TDS Plex Reticle in Second Focal Plane
The TDS Plex reticle is a choice option for varminters and long-range hunters. Four medium length posts and fine cross hairs pull your eye directly to your point of aim. Along the horizontal stadia there are two additional aiming-point dots to assist the shooter in correcting for bullet deflection due to wind. The lower portion of the vertical stadia is intersected by four stepped hash marks that help to establish hold-overs to compensate for bullet drop.
Sophisticated Optical System with 6X Zoom
Broad magnification range offers both a wide field of view and the ability to zoom in for close-up observation
Swarovski SR Mounting Rail
The innovative SR (Swarovski Rail) mounting rail system is available on select offerings within the Swarovski riflescope family. The integral fine-toothed rail prevents any movement of the riflescope, regardless of the caliber or recoil of your firearm. Two finely crafted mounting bases with matching teeth engage the rail on the underside of the riflescope for a stable, repeatable and dependable mounting solution. By eliminating the need for traditional mounting rings, the SR system delivers a lower profile mounting option and eliminates unsightly & devastating gouge marks on your riflescope's main tube. In order to mount a Swarovski riflescope with an SR rail, you will need to purchase and install a slotted Weaver type rail or bases to your receiver. In addition, a pair of Swarovski Cross Slot Mount Bases must be employed in order to fit the scope to the firearm. This is a precision mounting system and as such it is recommended that a qualified gunsmith install the mounting bases to your receiver for a proper fit and perfect alignment with the axis of your bore. 
This riflescope comes packaged with a Swarovski cross slot mount set."

Item G-I-560. This rifle HAS been reblued (note the shiny appearance of the rifle). It is still a very nice collectible! The Winchester Model 1890 is a slide-action repeating rifle built in 1907 by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. History In the late 1880s, the Winchester Repeating Arms Company asked John Browning to design a replacement for the Model 1873 rifle, since the rim fire version of the Model 1873 had never achieved any great popularity. On June 26, 1888, a patent for the new design was issued to John and Matthew Browning.[1] Under this patent, Winchester created the first repeating slide action .22 rifle ever successfully developed and manufactured. The Model 1890 would prove to be the most successful repeating rim fire rifle for general all around shooting ever made by Winchester. Approximately 849,000 Model 1890 rifles were produced between 1890 and 1932, after which the Model 1890 was replaced by the Winchester Model 62 rifle. A final cleanup of stock on hand was completed in 1941.[2] For many years, the Model 1890 was considered to be the standard for use in shooting galleries, hence its nickname of ""gallery gun."" Design and Features The Model 1890 was a slide action, top ejecting rifle with an 18 inch magazine tube under the barrel. It had a 24 inch octagonal barrel, a plain walnut stock, and an overall weight of approximately 6 lbs. We have additional higher resolution pictures of this item available upon request.

Whitney Arms was a significant arms supplier just before and during the civil war.  While Eli Whitney wasn't the designer for his rifles and pistols, he had a talent for creating serviceable weapons from excess parts from other manufacturers.  His manufacturing prowess enabled his company to secure important (to the period) contracts with certain states.  Sporting rifles such as the No. 2 were a much smaller portion of the company's production.

SAFETY
 *Ultra Safety Assurance (USA)
 Trigger System™
 The USA Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.
*Loaded Chamber Indicator
 The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.
*Grip Safety
 All XD®, XD(M)® and XD-S™ models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.
 *Fail-Safe Disassembly
 The XD-S™ disassembles just like the XD®, however, with the XD-S™, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
 *Secure Grip Texture
 *The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M)® has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S™ with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

This gun has great reviews on many websites and has been issued for duty by the LAPD, NYPD, and other law enforcement agencies.

The 5946 was created for use by law enforcement agencies and is the only model in the 5900 series to be double-action only.  It comes standard with no manual safety.
