Polish it to hard and risk messing it up. It has such a smooth trigger pull like a python is know for. Most engraved pythons bring over $4000 and up.

These are the last complete M24 SWS to be sold by Remington and the last time they will be offered to the general public. These M24's retain the original Soldier/Sniper painted camouflage (if any) ranging from black to a variety of camouflage patterns as imagined by the mind of a U.S. Army sniper. Each rifle has new barrel, new M24 trigger, new bolt, and new M24 action (marked with the original M24 designation and drilled and tapped for the receiver mounted open sights) sight bases included. The other system parts are 100% serviceable surplus (new parts were substituted where needed). This is a tremendous opportunity for the military collector or long range shooting enthusiast. Please look closely at the pictures to see what comes with this rifle. You will get the rifle and kit as pictured.

Sino-Soviet Type 56s were the rifles that were built under Russian supervision when China adopted the SKS as their main service rifle in 1956. These rifles have Russian barrel proofs and very low serial numbers. 140 thousands. There were at least a million of these rifles made per year all the way up until 1980. In 1973, you began to see less material used for these rifles. Pinned barrels, no barrel lugs, spike bayonet, etc. These rifles were built exactly from Russian specs and have Russian proofs. Could be Russian barrels. This rifle is also known as ""ghost 26""'s meaning that they did not stamp with a arsenal code. Very few rifles were like these in the early stages of manufacture. Pretty interesting. 

It has a little cosmoline left in them and have NOT been shot by me. The bore is excellent. Extremely crisp. The stock has typical wear from being in a crate for most of it's life time and there is light pitting in a spot on the receiver but it is only exterior and nothing serious. It is to be expected with military surplus guns. The bluing on it is fantastic. Better than most I have seen come out of this time period.

With the right ammunition, the G-22 can achieve shot groups as small as 0.25 inches (6.4 mm) at 55 yards (50 meters). In places where legal, the G22 is equipped with a threaded barrel, provisioning it for various muzzle devices such as flash hiders and suppressors. From 500 feet away it is still possible to fire accurately (especially when using a telescopic sight). Recoil is minimal, and rate of fire is very quick. Its bullpup design allows the gun to be very short while still maintaining a long barrel in order to maintain muzzle velocity. This makes the gun unevenly weighted towards the stock. However its long front grip allows users of differing body types to become quickly adjusted."

Also comes with a 15 and 30 round mag and 50 soft point and 150 fmj rounds. I took this rifle to a gun store to see what they would give me for it. They offered $450 for just the rifle. To resell at $700. I have over $100 in ammo and accessories. I am asking $550. Not interested in trades"

Most revolvers will be discredited on value, due to holster wear, if its evident. Some folks dont care. Like me. If its fun to shoot, and if youre shooting it, odds are youre looking down the sights. With no concern if the muzzle is hot pink, or flipping you off. Either way, armslist has provided a few holster worn items that i have good times taking to the range. Anyhow, this muzzle worn old beast is displayed in the holster, which is fine, for a shooter grade gun. But shooter grade isnt 4500$ either. And thats not even the funny thing. If Bill Gates decided to pick one ad on armslist, to help make his point, its that one. First of all, its stated that the gun has been in the family for 100 years. So even with cock ass rules trying to steal by in the upcoming election, this guys already loop-holed into owning one! No backround check for spelling bees...oh, and that. There are five misspelled words in the ad. Five! Are you kidding? Im gonna go meet some dude with a 5th grade education and buy a gun from him? Better yet, im gonna have fourTHOUSAND,five hundred dollars in my pocket, and go meet someone who i know nothing about, except that theyre not very smart, and buy that holster worn family heirloom!

many companies won't sell just one, they'll make you buy one, and the ones that do sell one, will charge you around a grand ($1,000)  and not all of them come with everything that i have.  i even have the canteen adaptor that most places sell for almost 60.00$  it allows you to hydrate without compromising your breathing situation and exposing yourself to noxious gasses etc, whether it be in a training exercise or a real life situation.  if you've been looking for the best gas mask around, this is your chance to get it.

im open to trades, but cash would come first.  it would have to be a pretty interesting trade.  or something that would really catch my eye.

This one was Manufactured in 1913 so it PRE-DATES Austrian Army Acceptance so it was either a civilian Model OR an ARMY TEST MODEL ! Who Knows? 
       Internally very similar to the COLT 38 Automatic (even the round it shoots is SERIOUSLY SIMILAR to the COLT .38 AUTOMATIC ROUND originally made in 1900!). Ammo is ALWAYS AVAILABLE at Gun Shows as the Spanish LOVED this Cartridge & apparently used it for their Military & Police until the late 1980s LOTS of it around !! They made MILLIONS & MILLIONS of Rounds that are still on the Market !!! Many LLAMA 1911s are Chambered for the 9mm Largo.

 The gun CAN be CONVERTED to 9MM LUGER simply by CHANGING THE BARRELL !! The Germans conscripted  these during WW 2 (as Handguns were in short supply)  and re-Barrelled them in 9MM . The AUSTRIANS just used them as is in WW 2 or so I am told 
 I had thought about  Changing it but the 9MM LARGO Ammo is so CHEAP & AVAILABLE I did NOT!
 The Gun SHOOTS GOOD and is FUN TO SHOOT!. Finish is as you would expect an old gun to be with some pitting here & there and a couple of places where I was told the JEWISH IMPORTER ground off the NAZI MARKINGS that were lightly  stamped  into the Slide . That's UNDERSTANDABLE .  Also One Person suggested that the Scrubb Marks were HUNGARIAN PROOF MARKS that were scrubbed off . WHO KNOWS? The grindings are barely perceptable with your fingers and NOT VERY DEEP! They DON'T hurt the STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY of the GUN!!  It was re-finished after that but it still AIN""T NEW! 


 As I have had several Inquiries about the SERIAL NUMBERS I have added parts of the most Comprehensive email message that I sent. I guess I should have included this info when I posted the Pistole. It took me a LONG TIME to figure out HOW to EDIT the POSTING! 




 UNDERNEATH the Manufacture date of 1913 ( which pre-dates the Austrian Military acceptance ) it also says VEGA  SAC. CA. (ABOVE the MNFR date) and  it says 9MM STEYR  AUSTRIA (underneath the Manufacture Date )which matches the VEGA etc Stamping . The STEYR 1913 is a DEEPER STAMPING and more in line withe the STEYR STAMPINGS that I have seen on other 1912s/1914s is an original Stamping.
 On the Slide's left side under the forward most scrubb mark is stamped Md. 1912 . The serial no. is on the slide is etched in and matches the frame's number . HOWEVER I don't recall WHERE the ORIGINAL Serial No. on the slide is supposed to be,  if there is one at all
  The Barrell's Serial No.  also is etched in and all numbers MATCH. I would suspect that the etched numbers were done to keep the original parts in the same Gun. But of course , I am no expert on the history of what happened to all of these WW1 & WW 2 Guns. I have seen all kinds of things that break all the ""expert's "" rules ,even on guns that the provenance was IMPECCABLE ( as in guns that I KNEW the old men who BROUGHT THEM BACK from EUROPE in BOTH WARS ! ) !
 There is also on the machined smooth boss between the sight and the clip insertion tower ( which I assume is a boss for mounting a long rang adjustable sight or ""VOLLEY SIGHT "" on ) some sort of mark that appears to be a very small circle with possibly a crown  or a couple of initials on itop . the crown or inititals point to the right side and are on top of the circle from about 10:30 to 2 o'clock ( if you regard the RIGHT side of the gun as TOP.) If it is initials then the right hand letter ia a ""W"" . Also it appears that there is either another smaller circle inside the circle or possibly a ""C"" inside the circle . It is SMALL and that boss seems to have not had as much bluing ( or Browning ,the older finishing method ) on it so it is pitted minutely and masks the ""crown"" (?) to my eye , even under a Magnifying Glass. But as my moniker in other Gun Sales sites states I am an "" OldShooter"" so my up close vision sucks.

This was purchased in 2007 and has sat in my closet since other than regular cleanings. This is as close to new as they come as I have never fired it. 
The KR version was a limited run only sold to one company and only sold for 6 months, this is one of the last sold. It has a 12 in barrel with a 4 in flash hider welded on to equal the required atf 16 in. Due to all this I am not actually sure of the value of this rifle, I have tried to find any current pricing but have only been able to find some random forum post dating back a few years of just a few people even owning them. I know a basic WASR 10 runs around 600 and one with this furniture runs around 900 plus magazines. I am asking $2200 but I will also consider any legitimate offer.

So recently, I've been in the market for a small caliber Single Six or an older style revolver. I've recently been to my local shop and they are currently selling a 4.75"" Birdshead (much preferred) Heritage Rough Rider for $220 new, and that comes with a 22 mag cylinder as well. My mother-in-law just acquired a Iver Johnson (38 short I believe) revolver (non top break) Model 1900 with a hexagonal barrel, which is also what I am interested in (size wise). I'm not saying I wouldn't be willing to pay more, but I'd  like to stay under $300 if at all possible. Only interested in small calibers, and nothing longer than 4.75""-5"",since it's just going to be a plinker. Basically anything comparable to the style, size, and caliber as shown in the photos I posted. Photos upon contacting me is a major plus! Let me know what you have, and maybe we can work something out. Willing to meet at an FFL locally preferred."

Harris Engineering has been in the Bipod business, and ONLY in the Bipod business, for MANY, many years -- their name is synonymous with quality.  Each and every Harris bipod is made right here in the USA, and comes with a LIFETIME warranty -- if you EVER have a problem with it, contact Harris, and they will take care of it for you.

For Sale, Series S Model BR, which is a swiveling model Bipod. Series S Bipods ""rotate"" to either side for instant leveling on uneven ground -- the hinged base has a tension adjustment and buffer springs to eliminate tremor or looseness in the crotch area of the Bipod -- they are otherwise very similar to the non-rotating/non-pivoting series 1A2.  This model has friction dial clamps for height adjustments on each leg, as well.  The legs retract by spring action and you can fix the height setting anywhere between 6 and 9 inches using the friction dial.

For prone or bench shooting, this rest is perfect for those of average physical structure.  This Bipod with its improvements has been the varmint hunter’s favorite since 1966.  It extends from 6 to 9 inches.

Harris Bipods are ultralight and lightning quick.  Folding legs have completely adjustable spring-return extensions.  The bipod’s clamp attaches to the sling swivel.  This is a time-proven design and is quality manufactured with heat treated steel and hard alloys.  These bipods have a black anodized finish. 

These bipods are quick detachable and clamp to the Q.D. (quick detach) stud of bolt action rifles of conventional stock design.  They will fit some single shot rifles and pistols and others with proper adapters.  Harris Bipods are not suitable for all firearms.

Quiet, fast and rock solid.  Extends from 6"" to 9"".  Weighs 13 ounces.  This is the LAST bipod you will need for your rifle -- Harris' quality and their lifetime warranty guarantees it."

   Anyone who has chatted with me knows I'm a fan of Bersas, easily one of the best-kept secrets in handguns. This is the .380CC model, a carry friendly version of the classic Bersa Thunder 380 pistol. Featuring low-profile sights, bobbed hammer, slimmer grips & a flat-bottom mag(will still accept the std pinky-extension mags), this blaster is even easier to tuck away than the original .380 Thunder.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.
The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Viking Tactics light mount:
Consistent with the VTAC Mission, the Viking Tactics Light Mount was designed for today’s modern warriors- providing a light-weight and versatile option to mount a flashlight onto any Picatinny rail system. Made of a Modified Acrylic PVC Alloy Thermoplastic with high impact and abrasion resistant qualities which have been proven to withstand the harshest environments, the Viking Tactics Light Mount is designed so that you can mount your light so that it is out of your field of view and easily activated.
This new and improved version of the original VTAC Light Mount Design gives you enormous flexibility. It will allow you to mount most lights with a .80 or 1” diameter and will fit the VTAC-L4 as well as the inexpensive Surefire G2 Nitrolon, Executive Series, and many others. The sleek VTAC design even offers a position in the insert to accommodate the clip on the light. Depending on your mounting preferences, the VTAC can be mounted in such a way that the light can be activated using a tape switch or it can be mounted in such a manner allowing you activate your light using the push button on the back of the light. (Note: Flashlights and firearms not included and must be purchased separately).
The VTAC Light Mount is impervious to most chemicals, solvents and oils and its highly advanced thermoplastics will not shrink. With the high quality and innovative design that you expect from a Viking Tactics product, the VTAC Light Mount will keep you in the light and out of the dark

I am unsure the exact age, but it is old enough that it does not have a serial number so that would be pre-1968. I have not fired this gun, I inherited it and I am selling it in the condition in which I received it. It comes apart fine, the hammer cocks back and releases when you pull the trigger, you can see the firing pin move forward when the hammer hits it, but the trigger seems to be lacking a return spring. I looked it up and the spring can be purchased for $2.90 at Numrich Gun parts (I will include the parts diagram and part number for the spring). It also has an ejector for the shell. Bead front sight. 28"" barrel. Everything appears to be original. Bore is bright and shiny, no pitting or rust inside the barrel.
