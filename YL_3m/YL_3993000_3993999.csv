This is the classic falling block action rifle, and the barrel is marked as .22 Short, Long, or Long Rifle.  Serial number dates the gun between 1914-1915. The gun functions flawlessly, though the original iron sights are missing.  The rifle has been shot over the years, but the rifling is clean and has plenty of life left.  The blueing on the rifle is excellent, and per the late previous owner, had never been re-blued. The gun had been handed down in his family, until he passed away and there were no heirs for the gun.  The small wood forearm is in excellent condition. The buttstock has a noticeable crack at the wrist, as shown in the pics, but the stock is completely stable with no wiggle or felt weakness. It looks worse in the pics than it appears in person.  The original metal buttplate shows some wear, but the Remington UMC stamp is still sharp.  The gun wears a very collectible Redfield 2X 3/4"" scope with the long eye relief, which is in excellent condition."

I traded for this pistol with a friend in mind, but unfortunately he is unable to make a purchase at this time, so, up she goes.

422,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3993422,"For Sale:  Raven Concealmeant Phantom Holster - Commander 1911 4.00"" Barrel","Highlands Ranch, Denver, Colorado",$ 40,"Listed On: Monday, March 9, 2015",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Phantom Modular Holster has become the standard by which all other holsters are judged. Copied by many but equaled by none, the Phantom Modular Holster is the first choice of armed professionals and civilians. The Phantom was designed from the outset to provide the highest possible level of concealment by being adaptable to wear with virtually any style of clothing. What makes the Phantom so unique is its ultra-thin, body-hugging pancake profile. This profile, in conjunction with the Raven Concealment Eclipse Modular Mounting System, allows the Phantom to be worn either on the belt or inside the waistband.
The holster is constructed from thin, high-strength Kydex-T.  The pancake-style design helps to minimize bulk and distribute the weight of the firearm over a wider area on the belt. The “outside” portion of the holster body fully enshrouds the weapon from ejection port to muzzle. The “inside” or “body-side” portion of the holster incorporates a full-length body shield. This enhances comfort and aids in re-holstering, while simultaneously protecting the controls of the pistol.
Holster specifics:
• 4.00"" bbl non rail 
• Belt loop size 1.5” 
• Right handed shooter
• Color Black
• Full body shield
• Standard OWB belt loops

I ordered a new set of reloading dies from a vendor on Amazon the other day. The package came today with this inside--but no dies. I thought either I won this from something I signed up for or just didn't remember ordering it because I was looking at similar products recently. I had no idea what this was. Upon searching for this model online I couldn't believe the price--$425! I certainly wouldn't have spent that on a light/laser. So, I guess someone working at a warehouse somewhere screwed up and I got lucky. I'm selling this because I really don't need it and figure I could use the money. And someone else would probably appreciate it more than I would. It's brand new--not even opened yet. I'd let it go for $300. Thanks."

     I have for sale a BRAND-NEW-IN-BOX Browning X-Bolt Varmint Special Stainless, chambered in .308  I special ordered this rifle from my FFL about 8 months ago.  It's just as I received it - in box, with foam, with manuals and lock, and the Browning sticker is still on the barrel.  Outside of the factory, this gun has only been touched by me, so there's no worries of ""gawker"" dings from being in a gun shop (If you can even find one of these in a gun shop, that is).  

I'd be glad to send actual ""proof of possession"" pictures of my gun to anyone who's serious about buying. 

I'd prefer F2F Bill-Of-Sale transaction, but would consider shipping to an FFL under the right circumstances."

745,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3993745,For Sale:  1861 Colt Contract rifle/musket near mint,"HoodRiver, Portland, Oregon","$ 3,500","Listed On: Tuesday, February 3, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is an exceptional example of a Colt Model 1861 Special Rifle-Musket that was manufactured in 1863. Colt produced these rifle-muskets under Ordnance Department contracts during the Civil War. The Model 1861 Special Rifle-Musket had a distinctive hammer, bolster with no provision for a clean-out screw, two-leaf rear sight graduated to 500 yards, screw-fastened barrel bands and straight shank tulip head ramrod. Most of these features were subsequently incorporated on the Springfield Model 1863 and Model 1864 Rifle-Muskets. The barrel, lock and iron furniture are finished ""National Armory Bright"". The three-leaf rear sight is blue and the trigger is casehardened. The black walnut stock is oil finished. The lock plate is dated ""1863"" behind the hammer and the top of the barrel is dated ""1863"" just ahead of the tang. ""U.S./COLT'S PT F.A. MFG CO/HARTFORD CT"" is roll-stamped on the lock plate in front of the hammer. The face of the nipple bolster is stamped with the Spread Eagle/Shield motif. The upper left barrel flat is stamped with Ordnance ""V/P/Eagle Head"" proof and inspection marks. An ""EF"" Ordnance sub-inspection mark. Single letter Ordnance inspection marks are stamped on all major components. ""U.S."" is stamped on the heel of the buttplate. The left stock flat is stamped with the Ordnance final inspection and sub-inspection marks that consist of two or three script initials surrounded by rectangular borders.
Condition:	Excellent plus. The musket retains virtually all of the original National Armory Bright finish. There is some overall scattered surface rust which is very light. The rear sight has all of the original dull blue finish. The percussion nipple has no flash pitting and there is no firing wear on the bolster or adjacent areas of the barrel lock plate or hammer. All of the markings are extremely sharp. The musket has not been touched and remains in near mint as issued condition. The stock is exceptional as the barrel, lock and furniture. The edges of the flats and barrel channel are very sharp. The grain is raised with no sign of handling wear and no significant storage marks. The Ordnance final inspection and sub-inspection stamps are near perfect. This is an outstanding example of a Colt Model 1861 Special Rifle-Musket that would be extremely difficult to improve upon."
