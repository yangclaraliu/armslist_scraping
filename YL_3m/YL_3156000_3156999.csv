Unfailing  Reliability.
Revolutionary improvements make the GII the most reliable, longest lasting MSR platform on the market. Key to this are: an all new elastomer extractor spring, new extractor material, dual ejectors, and a steel insert feed ramp. These components fundamentally change the way the conventional MSR functions. The result: the most consistent, efficient, and reliable Extraction and ejection pattern of any MSR.The biggest revolution to the GII might just be the smallest. Improved extractor & elastomer Extractor spring. Through countless hours of research, testing, and tens of thousands of fired rounds, DPMS has selected a new extractor material that is nearly impervious to breaking, and a patent pending elastomer extractor spring. We ran tens of thousands of rounds through during testing without fatigue, breakage, failure, and the new materials resisted temperatures from -60˚F to 650˚F+ as well as every gun cleaner, solvent, oil or degreaser we could get our hands on.Dual Ejectors
The dual ejector system reduces the ejector spring fatigue. Through duplicity, the likelihood of a failed ejection is significantly reduced.Steel feed ramp. GII incorporates an inserted steel feed ramp, allowing a lighter, smaller barrel extension and receiver, while improving feeding of more ammunition types. Enlarged ejection port Lengthened port allows for better, more consistent ejection.Smaller. Lighter. Stronger.The rifle simply feels better when you pick it up.The heart of the GII is a matched pair of forged, level III anodized, Teflon* coated 7075 receivers, providing improved strength and durability. With the advancements in the forging, feed ramps and bolt geometry, the GII has a shorter overall receiver length, as well as a reduced receiver diameter.
Forged upper and lower receivers are contoured to be more ergonomic. Compact design is both lightweight and only 1/2” longer than a 5.56 MSR receiver, 5/8” shorter than the current LR-308.Lower receiver incorporates integral trigger guard and accepts any standard MSR pistol grip.Reduced weight, yet lighter recoil.Reduced mass carrier provides smoother, softer recoil impulse than the GEN1 .308.Reduced mass, forged, monolithic bolt carrierwith forward assist. New lightweight, forged, monolithic bolt carrier utilizes an integral gas key tower and removable gas key extension. Beveled mag well. The beveled mag well provides a comfortable grip for those that prefer a mag well hold and also aids in quicker mag changes. Improved bolt & barrel extension.
An all new bolt geometry provides superior lockup and strength. The bolt geometry allows a smaller diameter barrel extension to be used, in turn allowing upper receiver to be smaller, reducing overall material and weight without compromising strength.
Adaptable. Versatile.All the accuracy you’d expect from DPMS.With its adaptability in accepting standard MSR fire control and more .223 two piece handguards than before, the GII core also remains versatile in both tactical and hunting configurations. A true game-changer.Increased .223 platform handguard adaptabilityAccepts more 2 piece MSR handguards than previous LR-308. Newly designed barrel nut allows the use of .223 diameter free float handguard systems.Accepts standard MSR fire controlsDPMS GII rifles accept standard MSR fire controls for even more adaptability.An exceptional tactical rifle. Contoured steel feed ramps, revolutionary redesigned extraction system, and a dual ejector design decrease feeding, extraction and ejection malfunctions.Completely re-designed gas delivery system utilizes a monolithic bolt carrier and optimized gas ring clearances to eliminate the possibility of gas leakage during operation.

I will first start off with what I'd say is the key piece the Vintage German Solingen Matador Deer Foot Hunting Fighting knife. It's in great condition for the age, the blade is intact so is the deers foot, and it also comes with its own sheath. Next is another Vintage German Solingen Matador Hunting Fighting knife with its own sheath. This one is also in decent condition and is all intact. Next are two German Whale Brand knives. The first I surprisingly can't find information on it anywhere but I do know that it is quite large and is a combat fighting fishing knife. The blade is in good condition and same for the grip. Next is the other Whale which is in good condition and is all intact. This one is the Richartz Germany Whale Logo Pocket Knife 3” Folding Fishing Pocketknife. Next is a Made in Germany Camp Knife that I can't find much information on. It is really old and in acceptable condition, all intact. Next is a old Chambers Germany Pearl knife, didn't find much information on it. Says Chambers Germany on both blades. Next is a BR. Wunde Cutlery German Knife that is pearl also and all intact except one of the blades has been disassembled but is still intact with the knife. Next which is the last knife is a Dixon Cutlery Co. Germany knife that is all intact but does have carved into the side L.HWR which I'm guessing is someone's initials. I would buffer and smooth it out but I'm afraid to a true collector that may be even worse for it. Also included in this lot is a Rare The Echo M.Hohner Trade Mark Grand Prix 1926 Made in Germany Hermonica thats in great condition for its age. I'm not particularly looking to sell I'm looking to trade so read the trade category. I can send better pictures of all the knives and harmonica. All together I value this collection around the ballpark of $320 which is under what these knives go for under retail and on ebay.

I inherited this gun. I like the looks of it, it's light, and it feels nice in my hands, but I've already got three other 22lr rifles.

I recently ordered a metal aftermarket magazine (these are $40 each) for this gun. The original plastic mag did not work well. I loaded the new magazine full 3 or 4 times and it functioned without a hitch. Everything I've heard says these metal ones are much better that the original plastic ones.

The old magazine aside, the gun itself always functioned well (it's got a heavy trigger, but it works).

The scope isn't anything special, but it would work fine for plinking or small game hunting.

344,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3156344,"For Trade:  EOtech 551, Magpul CTR stock & Tango Down vertical grip","Greenville, Greenville, South Carolina",Offer,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 10, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"**This is also in another post for sale/trade in a package deal , it is currently mounted on an AR build. See my other post if interested in entire package**. 


The EOTech holographic sight features a heads up design that allows both eyes to be open in order to maintain peripheral vision and depth perception while shooting. It features an sleek and unobtrusive low profile design that points naturally. The reticle is a 65 MOA open circle with a 1 MOA aiming dot in the center, providing fast target acquisition and precise aiming options. The model 551 N is 4"" in overall length and runs for 200 hours on a set of N batteries. The 551 N also includes a toggle switch that immediately lowers the light intensity for use with night vision without any halo effect.

-EOtech 551 w/original box. It's currently mounted on a very nice AR build. I really want to sell the entire package, but will consider trading just the EOtech. If the 551 goes before the rifle.... Then I will be keeping the rifle. The EOtech is in very good condition. The 551 is no longer in production.....if you didn't already know the main difference is the smaller mounting base. It comes in the original box with paperwork. I'm mainly looking for handguns, but all reasonable offers will be considered. Really looking for a Glock 41 or Glock 34. Thanks!

-Also have a like new Magpul CTR butt-stock and Tango Down vertical grip that I can throw in for the right deal. Thanks!"

I have made one modification to the scope. Originally, all the words/logos were gold. But, I (taped off and) shaved the gold off to show the silver beneath. I cant stand gold. It came out great.

Product Information

These non-corrosive, all weather primers deliver fast, dependable ignition under any shooting condition. Primers are constantly and rigorously tested for consistency and sensitivity at temperatures and conditions far beyond the range of normal usage. Winchester guarantees better sensitivity for more positive firing in all guns, carefully-controlled weights of primer mixtures, consistency in size and quality, precise measurements and tolerances for anvil heights and stability in extremes of temperatures and humidity."

Two Kahr extended 8rd mags, nice Don Hume IWB leather holster, Hogue grip wrap (very confortable and fits hand very nicely--way better than stock). Five full boxes of Federal shells and 30 leftovers. 

I'll save you the internet searches: Gun goes on this site searches for between 325 and 375 median amount in the US searches. On the web, budsgunshop, slickguns, and cheaperthandirt are all around the 335 to 346 range. Usually with free shipping to a FFl (with luck you might find one that charges you $20 for the transer). The hogue grip is $10 at the cheapest search I found, and the real Kahr mags were always right around $30 each. I'm sure there are cheap knockoffs out there. The shells are $17 per box of 50 and change the last time I went to Sheels (that's easily $100 in shells with no taxes--I included the 30 loose). Buy everything searching around the net and maybe in a week, you will have it all for 335gun, 20ffl, 60clips, 10hogue, 100shells=$525 with no taxes. Go to sheels and maybe get it all today for $600.

I'll sell all for $425 and even meet a reasonable distance to save on gas. You'll have everything you need except targets. No better deal around. I'm estimating everything low including the shells btw. Just realized that I forgot to include the $30 holster in the above ""525"" figure, so the price is firm.

This is a hard to find complete Smith & Wesson 460ES Emergency Survival Kit. They were not made very long and are now fast-appreciating sought-after collectibles. The kit is comprised of the Smith, a waterproof case, and many survival items. The very powerful Smith and Wesson 460ES was designed on the the larger X-frame. This 5-shot 3 1/2 lb revolver is much more versatile than the .500 S&W Magnum, as it will chamber and fire 45LC, .454 Casull, and the .460 S&W (which propells a 200-grain bullet at a velocity exceeding 2300 fps with over 2400 ft. lb. of energy). It is configured with a 2 3/4"" barrel with a recessed-crown muzzle, adjustable rear site and comfortable rubber grips. The topstrap of the frame is tapped for a scope mount. The case features a rubber O-ring for an airtight seal, a pressure relief valve, and contains the following survival items: an S&W Extreme Ops folding tactical knife, a Coglan’s Magnesium Fire-Starter, a Fox40 Micro Whistle, a Silva Polaris Compass, a combination thermometer, compass and whistle on a lanyard, the Unbelievable Survival Saw, two Space Emergency Blankets, a Rescue Flash Signal Mirror, the book “Bear Attacks of the Century”, and 6 fire-starter blanks. The gun appears to have only been to the range once and is in excellent-plus condition with only a few handling marks. The only one worth pointing out is a small scratch on the right side of the frame right above the trigger, with is light enough that it is visible in pics 10 & 11 (taken in bright natural light), but not visible in pics 27-30 (taken in diffused quartz-light). Please refer to the many digital pics to verify the collectible condition of this rare piece and to view the many accessories. Texas Firearm Sales, a licensed dealership with a current ffl and SOT, has been operating successfully in Houston for over 15 years. References available."

Gun has had about 200 rounds through the barrel, so still in nearly new condition, cleaned thoroughly after every range visit. Upgrades include a new Mainspring housing to eliminate the ILS, an Ed Brown competition mainspring, Wilson Combat Bulletproof sear spring, Wilson Combat A2 Bulletproof sear, an STI Titanium Hammer Strut, a Harrison Design and Consulting long black trigger, and a Wilson Combat full length guide rod and also a set of VZ Operator Grips. Also purchased Wilson Combat ETM Mags for it. None of these upgrades are in the photo below as I haven't gotten a chance to take a new photo yet and will get some this evening when I get home. Can throw in ammo for the right price, have plenty of 9mm to add to a deal.

If you believe my asking price is too high for a used Range Officer, feel free to do the math on all of the additions that are included in that price point and you'll find that I have invested a little over $1,200 easily into this gun. Please keep that in mind if making an offer as well. Thanks."

 One of the greatest self defense guns ever produced., Like new only fired a few times.

 Made for the very serious business of self-preservation the 605 is built to the Taurus Zero Tolerance standard in design, fabrication, fit and performance. Meaning there is simply no tolerance for parts that do not perform as if someone's life depends on them. Using the powerful .357 Magnum ammo this quick-draw revolver has plenty of muscle to back it up. Features include fixed sights, crisp single-double action trigger and a transfer bar for added safety.

I purchased this gun last year, 03/28/2013, for my mother. She has always enjoyed shooting with me and she is a damn good shot. Buying the cute colored .38 was my attempt at convincing her to carry. Well obviously that didn't work. She replied ""If I am going somewhere that I feel so uncomfortable I need to carry a gun then I probably shouldn't go there"".....well played. 

With the purchase of this gun at Don's Guns on Lafayette Don through in a box of rounds. The same day I picked up my mom and we went to Beech Grove Firearms. We both shot it a couple of times. She didn't like it. She preferred her 44. Couldn't blame her could you? The gun has had 39 rounds through it. That was the only time that gun has been shot. It has been regularly cleaned.

977,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3156977,For Sale:  22 ammo,"Denver, Denver, Colorado",FREE,"Listed On: Tuesday, June 10, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Obama-caused bubble in ammunition prices seems ready to bust. Over the last few years gun owners have seen ammunition prices double or even triple. Handgun and rifle ammunition has been hard to find at times and .22 long rifle ammunition tripled in price over the last 18 months. People would line up to buy ammunition at prices two and three times the level that they were just two years ago. But all of that is about to change . . .

Ammunition supply looks as though it is ready to catch up with demand.  Centerfire pistol and rifle cartridges are available on most store shelves. When I walked into a local Wal-Mart this morning, their were over 30 signs on the ammunition case indicating a rollback of prices by 10-15%.

In classic economic fashion, the bubble was fueled by actions of the federal government. Many federal agencies bought enormous quantities of ammunition. The Obama administration’s actions fueled fear of coming shortages, gun bans, registration of ammunition sales, even potential low level warfare. All of this led to the current bubble of ammunition sales.

In response, the economy reacted the way free markets are supposed to work. Ammunition suppliers started running their manufacturing plants day and night, adding additional shifts. Importers scoured the world markets, trying to buy everything they could to satisfy the insatiable demand. Foreign manufacturers bumped up their production to try to fill the desire for more and more ammunition. Ammunition production was at the highest level ever for small arms, short of war.

But unlike during wartime, this ammunition wasn’t being fired in combat. Most of it wasn’t being fired at all. It was being stored against future need. Very little was actually being used.

There are limits to this sort of demand. I gave away a couple of thousand .22 rounds to make a point. A person who only had 37 .22 rounds out of a box of 50 is well justified in wanting a thousand or two, or a case of 5,000 “just because”.  Once they have the 5,000, their desire for more is reduced. Ultimately, demand drops.

In the meantime, manufacturers can’t stop production on a dime. They have orders in the pipeline. They have raw materials coming in that they may have no storage space for. They have employees that they have trained and who they do not want to lay off.  For all these reasons, when demand drops, supply can’t drop as quickly. Just as supply took a while to spin up, production will take a while to spin down.

This means retailers and wholesalers will be saddled with a glut of merchandise that they can’t sell at the current high prices.  They will have to put product on sale. Lower prices bring about the expectation that prices will fall even further. The prices crash.

That’s when a prudent person buys what they want, at very good prices. Demand won’t stay at the artificially low prices of the crash. The new crop of young urban shooters will want to feed their equipment, and overall demand will be higher than it was before the bubble. But it will take a while to settle out.

Metal prices have already fallen from the highs of the bubble. Copper and lead prices are far lower than they were. You will know that the bubble is close to the bottom when you see .22 LR on sale for below four cents per round. At their lowest, we might just see .22 cartridges below $10 for 500 again.
