 Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

Product Description
Weighing in at just 7.3 pounds and only 20"" axle to axle, this bow is no doubt a game changer. It may be lighter and faster than its predecessor, the Ghost 400, but the 410 has maintained some of its most impressive features. Like the 400, the 410 features Barnett's proprietary Carbonlite Riser Technology (CRT), which shifts the balance point away from the riser and back to the shoulder of the shooter. Barnett's unique patent-protected, ultra-light, super-strong Carbonlite riser boasts an incredible 5-to-1 safety factor and provides the perfect balance of weight and speed.

This is a unique gun, only 80 of this model(desert digital) were imported before the HK/ATI Lawsuit that resulted in the GSG-5 turning into the GSG-522, and the subtle changes that went with it. It has installed a Picatinny rail forend that was 1 of 10 that were prototypes designed by a forum member, that were sold by the member when the design was purchased by another company, computer designed specifically for the GSG-5, very tight fit to gun, no wiggle at all like the airsoft versions that people use, solid CNC machined parkerized aluminum, very high quality, cost me $200.

Conservative guess would be 500-1000rds down the tube, but definitely under 1k. I had the intentions to SBR it, but a first child on the way says the lesser used guns gotta go.

Will include the factory furniture, a collapsible A3 style stock, Picatinny rail forend, two FDE ladder rail covers, FDE Magpul RVG, Clamp style picatinny top rail for optics. 3 factory GSG 22rd magazines.

This gun has been used and shows it, but not not abused. Slight marring of the finish where the collapsible stock slides in, a couple of marks on the top rail from a red dot I had on it, and several slight scratches in the forend from the range and moving things in the safe, but nothing that affects function, and its still in good shape.

$500 FTF in NE NC, no trades at this time, so please don't ask.

I'm located in Elizabeth City, and will include enough ammo to fill the mags for a FTF sale."

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

Ok, so I know the Christmas bonuses haven't rolled in yet but I wanted to get this listed. 

What your looking at is a PSL-54c chambered in 7.62x54r. Yup, the same caliber as the beloved Mosin Nagant.This gun is flawless inside and out. Stock has a beautiful reddish accent. Barrel is bright and shiny. Gun comes with 3 magazines ( one is matching serial numbers with the gun), and the LPS 4x6 scope. Glass is mint as well. I can't describe how fun this gun is to shoot. It has the amazing power of a 7.62x54r round and can rattle of rounds as fast as you can pull the trigger.

Not really looking for any trades at this time.

The weapon had little wear that I can attribute to being fired, the finish is about 95% on the slide (a small loss of bluing on the extractor and a small nick on the back of the pistol) and about 75% on the barrel hood (could not seem to get a good pic of it but it looks like surface scratching from lack of lubrication(?) since as I said before the internals don't seem to show wear from firing). 

I did fire the weapon and it is functional. It has gone with me to and from my work for the past 3 months but with Christmas coming up I'm trying to get a little cash for a new car gun (Glock 26 if you're listening Santa!).

Don't sweat the Taurus naysayers, this is a GREAT weapon. I bought it last week so I'm the first owner. First time shooting was today. 100 rds...FLAWLESS. No break-in period necessary, for those (like me) that believe a gun needs breaking in. By contrast I owned a Sig 1911 Desert which had minor feeding issues the first 150 rds before it ran perfectly, and I loved that gun. Anyway the Taurus, if you do your job, is also very accurate. I'm no marksman but at 15-20 yds this thing was nailing it.

So, $350 firm for this basically brand new gun. Selling at a low price because 1) I like to try as many guns as possible and I don't try to get top dollar for whatever I resell...though of course I'd still like to get something out of it :) 2) There's only one magazine, and 3) Christmas is approaching!

It hold 6 plus 1 and standard price of the gun when I bought it was around $500 plus all the parts included where another $500 plus, I have all the original components that came with the stock gun and it can be converted from home defense to hunting shotgun in less than 15 mins, so you can keep in in the home defense setup while at home but if you have an itch to go hunting you can easily swap out the parts and have a hunting gun, only thing is I have 2 shotguns and need a pistol, or a rifle. I'm am willing to do a straight up trade no money involved an I took my shotgun to a local gunshop and they appraised it at $800, so basically that's what they would have given me for it, and you no they are gonna offer less that its worth so if you sold ir at retail price your looking at close to a grand. Its in excelant shape minor wear but thats just from target shooting and it was well talking care of and cleaned after every 25 rounds Shit and or after every trip to the range.

Winchester Model 70 heavy barrel chambered in .243. Bluing is in excellent condition and the wood stock is in very good condition with the exception of a couple small spots. Fitted with a newer Nikon Prostaff BDC (compensates for bullet drop) and that is in excellent condition as well. This rifle is extremely accurate and will make a quarter sized grouping at 200yds with Hornady Interlocks and Winchester Silvertips. Overall a very nice rifle. Serial number dates this rifle to the 1970's.

Similar rifles are going for $700, plus the $250 scope, which is why I think my price is very fair.

Redfield Revenge 2-7x34mm 4-Plex Rifle Scope 115204 is an ideal rifle scope for close to medium range hunting in low light situations. The advanced, fully multi-coated lens systemimage of these Redfield rifle scopes results in a high light transmission rate that gives you high contrast, high clarity images even when the sun is just rising or setting. The highly adaptable accuracy of these riflescopes is achieved with the use of pop-up windage and elevation turrets, both of which can be easily reset to zero. Like many other scopes in the Redfield Revenge series, the Redfield Revenge 2-7x 4Plex Reticle Riflescope features fast focus eyepieces that both improve your target acquisition speed and give you a plentiful field of view so you can see your entire surroundings. Redfield has equipped this scope with the simple but effective 4-Plex reticle, which sports thick crosshairs with a slightly thinner center to increase target visibility. As with all Redfield Revenge rifle scopes, the 2-7x34mm variety is waterproof, shock-proof, and nitrogen filled for state of the art fogproofing. For all your short to medium range hunting needs, you can attain pinpoint accuracy in almost any conditions with the Red Field Revenge 2-7x34 Fast Focus Four Plex Scope."

This is a brand new Taurus PT840 Semi Auto 40sw Double Action Handgun.

BRAND: Taurus

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

This is a brand new Taurus PT845 Semi Auto 45ACP Double Action Handgun. 

BRAND: Taurus

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.
