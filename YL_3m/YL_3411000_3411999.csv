The HK45 pistol series (compact and full-size models) were chosen as the first firearms made at HK's American manufacturing facility so it is only fitting that a modified variant would be adopted as the pistol of a major U.S. special operations unit. The HK45 Compact Tactical (CT) is the closest a civilian can get to that military pistol. The HK45 CT comes standard with a threaded barrel, 10-round magazine with extended floorplate, and replaceable grip panels to adjust the feel and grip circumference of the pistol to suit individual hand size and shooting preferences. The HK45 pistol series were originally developed as candidates for the U.S. military's next generation handgun competition so there is little wonder that the HK45 CT is so well-suited for military, law enforcement, and security use. Each HK45 CT comes standard with an extra backstrap for a custom fit for each shooter's hand. Variant 1 Double action/single action with ""SAFE position. Control lever (manual safety/decoking lever) on left side of frame.

The ""Black Army"" is a collectors designation for mid to late 1918 Colt 1911 production. In order to speed production for the war effort, Colt left off some final polishing steps that produced a dark - almost black finish. From the black finish the pistol became known as the ""Black Army"" almost as if it was a model variation produced by Colt. Black Armies are not uncommon but difficult to find in this condition. 

These came with 3 different types of grips, diamond and checkered (most common), checkered as pictured here and plain.

Info:

The Smith & Wesson Model 500 is a five-shot, single action/double-action large caliberrevolver produced by Smith & Wesson, firing the .500 S&W Magnum cartridge, a .50 caliber bullet.
It is built on S&W's largest frame, the X-Frame, which was developed because none of S&W's existing double-action frame designs could handle the muzzle energy and pressures generated by the .500 S&W cartridge.[2] It is the most powerful production revolver in the world today, and it is being marketed as being ""the world's most powerful handgun"" by the manufacturer.[3] There are a few other larger revolvers like for instance the Pfeifer Zeliska .600 Nitro Express revolver, however none of them are a ""production"" revolver. The Model 500 can fire a bullet weighing 350 gr ( 22.7 g; 0.8 oz) at 1975 feet per second (602 m/s) generating a muzzle energy of over 3,030 foot-pounds force (4.1 kJ).
Articles, statements, and opinions vary widely on this firearm. Any of the available bullet weights can be relied on to take game at a range in excess of 200 yards (183 m), a feat matched by only a handful of other handguns.[citation needed] The advanced design of the firearm helps in counteracting recoil felt by the shooter. This includes the sheer weight of the firearm, use of rubber grips, the forward balance, and the use of a compensator. On certain S&W Performance Center models the compensator is replaced with a full muzzle brake.
Like most big caliber handguns the Model 500 is suitable for sport and hunting applications. The high energy of these rounds make it possible to hunt extremely large African game successfully."

The CZ 2075 RAMI is a sub-compact semi-automatic based on the proven CZ 75 line of pistols. Just like the 75, the RAMI is double action/single action, allowing it to be carried in different conditions depending on the shooter’s preferences. Several safety devices are used including a firing pin block and a manual safety. Incorporating the CZ double-stack magazine design, the little RAMI ships with a 10 round flush-mount magazine and 14 round extended magazine in the 9mm Luger version, or 7 and 9 round magazines in .40 S&W. A low capacity-compliant version of the 9mm is available with two 10 round magazines. With a 3” barrel and an unloaded weight of less than 26 ounces, the black polycoat, alloy-framed RAMI is ideal for concealed carry.

Complete LoPro upper, mount, and Redfield Revenge 3X9X42 scope are still in factory packaging, unfired and unmounted, brand new.

Upper:  The DPMS Lo-Pro AR-15 Upper Receiver Assembly comes fully assembled and ready to install on any standard small pin, mil-spec lower receiver. The Lo-Pro Upper Receiver is constructed of 6066-T6 aircraft aluminum and is of the ""Slickside"" variety, with a sleek profile devoid of protrusions through the elimination of the conventional AR-15 forward assist, case deflector, and dust cover. The result is a clean, minimalist appearance that is both fully functional as well as lightweight. 
The Lo-Pro Upper is equipped with a 16"" Target-Crowned Bull Barrel, a true 5.56x45mm NATO chamber for use with either commercial or mil-spec ammunition, and employs the versatile 1 in 9"" rifling twist rate capable of stabilizing a wide selection of different bullet weights. Additional features include heat resistant GlacierGuard polymer handguards, single rail gas block, charging handle and complete bolt & carrier assembly. Aluminum parts are hard coat anodized to mil-spec, steel parts are manganese phosphate treated (parkerized) matte black.

Mount:  The AR-Stoner 1-Piece Extended Scope Mount is just what you need for your flattop AR. This mount features integral 1"" rings and allows you to mount a scope up to 2"" forward to achieve proper eye relief, and it also places your scope at the proper height for an optimum cheek weld. The AR-Stoner 1-Piece Extended Scope Mount is made in the USA and is only available at MidwayUSA.

Scope:  The Redfield Revenge Rifle Scope series brings you high quality features and durability at an affordable price. The advanced fully multi-coated lens system provides ultimate light gathering capabilities from dusk to dawn and produces unmatched clarity and resolution. The ample field of view makes target acquisition simple in even the brushiest hunting conditions. Other exciting features include pop-up resettable adjustment turrets with a wide adjustment range, easy gripping power selection ring, Fast focus eye piece and a nitrogen purged body for 100% weather proofing. Additionally the Accu-Ranger reticle allows the hunter to determine an accurate distance to the target by bracketing the target in the ranging brackets in the top of the reticle and then simply dialing in to the desired magnification, all without taking your eye off the target. Covered by the Redfield Limited Lifetime Warranty. 

I'm into the whole works just over $600.  Will sell for $325 cash, or will trade @ $500 trade value.  Would ideally like a S&W or Ruger 38/357 revolver or 5.56 ammo, but more than happy to consider any interesting firearm trades."

Handedness: Ambidextrous Caliber: 9 mm/.40 S&W Barrel Length (in.): 4.9 Grip: Plastic Style: Pistol Product Length (in.): 8.5 92A1: Legendary 92 Reliability with Ultra-Modern Tactical Features The ""A1"" class is a specialized tactical branch of the most tested and trusted military and personal defense weapon in history: the 92FS. We started with the super-reliable 92, keeping the engineering characteristics that make it so accurate, safe and dependable; then, we added some features prized by today’s most demanding tactical shooters as well as by those wanting the absolute best for home defense or personal protection. The result is the 92A1, a pistol that is as reliable for its intended use as it is safe and user-friendly even for the novice. Easy Accessorization and Maintenance The most noticeable difference between the classic 92FS and the 92A1 is that this comes with an integral Picatinny rail situated in front of the trigger guard. The rail makes it easy to attach a variety of tactical accessories, including lighting systems and laser aiming devices. Also, the 92A1 has a removable front sight, meaning that you can exchange it in a matter of minutes without any gunsmithing or alteration to the pistol. Maintenance is easy thanks to the tool-free disassembly latch as well as the captive recoil-spring unit. Impressive Firepower, Extra-Durable Magazines Another feature that will impress you about the 92A1 is the type of magazine it comes with. This pistol comes with three 17-round stainless steel magazines designed to deliver remarkable firepower out of the box while being absolutely durable and corrosion resistant. Furthermore, the magazines on the 92A1 feature a “dirt rail” along their length, which helps collect dust and grit out of the magazine while keeping cartridges clear of the magazine walls. The result: enhanced feeding reliability and super-easy magazine maintenance. In addition, the magazine well is aggressively beveled, making it super-fast to change magazines without taking your eyes off the target. Absolutely Reliable, Designed to Last The base design of the 92A1 is the 92FS or M9, the pistol that has served the US military admirably throughout its campaigns in the world’s toughest environments. But even in this respect, Beretta never rests on its laurels. This pistol incorporates an innovative internal frame buffer that greatly reduces component stress under firing (yes, even with hot +P ammo), making it even more durable and smooth-shooting. The best of both worlds, the 92A1 offers discriminating shooters the classic overall look and feel of the 92 (including the more traditional rounded trigger-guard) with today’s most advanced tactical features."

484,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3411484,For Sale:  Standard Pressure Short Barrel Low Flash Heavy .38 Special Ammo - 150 gr. Hard Cast Wad Cutter (850fps/M.E. 241 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 23,"Listed On: Thursday, August 21, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"https://www.extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=111

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

This load is flash suppressed, so firing it in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo in the loadings whenever possible as over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20D utilizes a very hard cast 150gr. WAD CUTTER bullet. The bullet is made hard, so it won't deform or mushroom. It cuts/crushes a ""cookie cutter"", full diameter hole in human flesh just like it does on a paper target. It penetrates deeply (roughly 14 to 16 inches in human tissue) and its full diameter profile maximizes blood loss as it cuts and crushes (not slips or slides) its way through tissue. Although I've never been shot with a full profile wad cutter bullet, I must assume that the initial impact of that wide flat nosed bullet, is crushingly formidable. As a teenager, I took to the woods on a regular basis and killed many a critter with heavily loaded 38SPL wad cutters'. The effect of a full profile wad cutter on small game was obvious and amazing, compared to regular round nosed bullets. That flat nose, literally hammers living things. These bullets are hard and properly lubed and will NOT lead your barrel. Note my velocities from real world ""over the counter"" revolver s- NOT TEST BARRELS!

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this fullsize pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

These entry level gas piston AR15's are the perfect way to get into the world of gas pistons, without the big price tag. These are all manufactured in-house at Adams Arms. The lower receiver is 7075 aluminum, much higher quality than your standard 6062 lower. They are a mid-length gas system, so will cycle more reliably than a carbine-length system. Has a heavy barrel, which will help tremendously with accuracy. The piston system has 4 settings - normal (for just normal shooting), dirty (for extreme conditions or if you don't clean the rifle for many thousand rounds), off (rifle becomes a single shot, and won't eject any brass) and suppressor (for reliable cycling with a silencer).  Comes with box, manual, warranty card and a 30 round magazine. We'll be happy to ship this to your FFL.

I paid $1200 for this brand new at a local dealer, and I'll pass the savings onto you, you'll get everything in the picture, plus one flush seven round magazine that I spent hours tracking down at a gun show. Plus, the lock and keys. 

Shoot, I'll throw in a few rounds for free.

The Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2"" to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

The P239 was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. The slim profile of this single stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent handling characteristics of the P239 are the result of performance engineering, one of the keys to all Sig Sauer pistols.

I have a nice early 80's production Springfield M1A rifle in .308 equipped with a fiberglass stock. It is in great shape and does not look as if it had been fired much in it's life, very little wear. It is equipped as shown with the sling, scope mount, Trijicon tritium front sight and the great Bayonet lug. Not pictured that comes with the Rifle: 4 20 round mags, 2 25 round mags and the Bayonet for the lug."
