6 Shot, 2.75-inch Barrel.  SA/DA
SN: R-384326

As I understand it this gun was Made by Astra in Spain, and imported by Interarms.  The original 6-inch barrel was shortened to 2.75 when it was imported.

I have had this gun for 28 years.  I have shot approx. 200 Rnds through it, it shoots great.

I rate the bluing at 99%, there is some very slight wear at the barrel end, and very slight scratch on the left hand-side of the barrel, like a grain of sand was drawn across it.  No holster wear at all.  A slight wear mark around the cylinder from the normal rotating action of the gun.

Its’ action is tight and it functions 100% correctly.  The pictures are the best i could take, but they do not do justice to the gun.

I love this Gun, and hate to see it go, but my gun addiction needs more feeding.

The Izhmash Saiga IZ109 autoloading shotgun incorporates the Kalashnikov design, providing reliability and simplicity of operation. Outstanding accuracy is achieved by the smooth bore, Lancaster style elliptical barrel, which imparts a spin on projectiles, increasing accuracy and exterior threading to accept chokes. The chrome lined barrel, chamber and gas system resist corrosion, making cleaning easier and extending the life of the shotgun.

A lightweight, impact resistant polymer sporter stock and forend are checkered for comfortable control and include 3/4"" sling mounts. An oversized trigger guard allows use with gloved hands. Included is a detachable five round magazine (two round hunting magazines are also available).

Walmart, Bi-Mart, Sportsman's Warehouse, Dick's, Big-R and all other LEGIT big-box retail stores are not gouging so why play into this crap? Yes they have gone up a few dollars over the years.... no big deal... Bricks are now being sold for $25 when they used to be $12 and even 100 rounds of CCI-Mini-Mags are still sold for $11 at all these big-box retail stores TODAY when they used to be $3-$5 a few years ago. NOT $75-$80 per brick of cheap bulk ammo! NOT $10-$15 per 50 round packs of the better ammo! Are You Kidding Me?!?

Flag The Ammo Gougers! If you don't, They Will Continue to Rip You Off!

/start rant
Since no one has the ballz to say it-- i will:

I can see paying $35 per brick for someone to stand in line for you, but co'mon! REALLY?!?!?!?! 300% markup is friggin insane.... talk about take advantage... and your not helping the situation AT ALL! either by selling at these insane prices, or BUYING at these insane prices and encouraging the gougers.

I dont care if thats what gunbroker.com and gunbot.net and other online retailers have them for sale also at insane prices.... they are gouging people and taking advantage of the situation just like you armslist 'dealers' and 'personal sellers' out there. And you dont even post your ammo in the ammo section - you also post it in the firearms section for people to see! I could also rant about the delusional prices on most of your firearms too (especial charging above-new prices for USED firearms) but ill save that for another day....

I have seen all of you standing in the same lines as me EVERY Thursday at 9am at Sportsman's Warehouse to get my weekly ration given out to the public vultures, and you don't see me listing my crap on here now do you? and if you did... i don't gouge!

So, until i see Walmart, Bi-Mart and the other big-box retail stores start to jack their prices WAY WAY up, then this is WRONG!

.... and I KNOW FOR A FACT your on-line 'dealers' and personal sales gougers out there did not pay $75 per brick! I hope you choke on it.

... and by the way... I have all the bricks of 22lr I need to last thru this bad situation... and i paid avg price of $23 per brick. ... and I waited in the lines just like YOU!

Knife is brand new never used or carried.  $375 cash FTF in Fresno/Clovis/Madera.

Virtually every year since the inception of the Sebenza in 1987 has seen small, incremental developments, improvements and changes. Celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Sebenza in 2012, Chris brought some new concepts to the Sebenza 25. 

• Large Hollow Grind Technology—the first blade to feature this new grind that blends the best of hollow and flat grinds.
• Shaped phosphor bronze washer on the lock side brings additional stability to that side of the blade.
• One-eighth inch ceramic ball acts as the interface between the lock bar and the blade, and doubles to drop into the detent, ensuring the blade stays in place when closed.
• Larger perforations in the washers reduce friction, store more lubricant and offer space for small dirt particles to move away from the blade/washer  interface, helping to prevent blade action from  becoming “sticky”.
• 416 Heat treated stainless steel stop pin.
• Asymmetrical pattern thumb serrations on a curved thumb ramp of the blade give excellent purchase. 
• At 0.140” (3.56mm), the blade is more robust than previous Sebenza models.

This load is a very high performance +P 45 acp load. The 185gr. hollow cavity Barnes all copper bullet mushrooms readily and still penetrates deeply for such a light bullet, while giving the low recoil and high velocity of a light bullet. This helps fast sight acquisition for quick/accurate follow-up shots. Expect roughly 13 to 14 inches of penetration in flesh and bone.

This load utilizes a low flash powder which gives an important tactical advantage to the shooter as most shootings in the US occur in low light when the criminal element is most active. Being blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot, leaves you very vulnerable.

As usual, Buffalo Bore tests and obtains our advertised velocities from real world over-the-counter firearms. We believe that the industry wide established practice of utilizing extra long test barrels to generate advertised velocities is dishonest and creates expectations that cannot be realized in real guns, in the real world, where it matters. With Buffalo Bore ammo, you’ll actually obtain the velocities we advertise.

1193 fps -- Colt Series 90 Gold Cup, 5 inch
1183 fps -- H&K, USP Tactical, 5 inch
1158 fps -- Glock Model 21, 4.6 inch
1159 fps -- Colt series 80 Commander, 4.25 inch
1110 fps -- Glock model 30, 3.5 inch
In one of the above instances, you’ll note that a longer barrel gave velocities lower than one of the shorter barrels, showing that there is more to internal ballistics, than just barrel length.

This load reliably fed and exhibited very good accuracy in all test pistols."

A friend is in the midst of a divorce and asked me to sell this for her.  
I offered to give her the money and keep it for her, but she asked that I sell.

She says it was used on one bird hunting excursion.  It really looks like a new gun.

The only flaw I can find is that it has a Limbsaver pad on the back that could be trimmed for a better fit.  If you look at the photo, you can see that it extends a bit above the wood.
This has a modified choke installed, but others are available from Scheels or Midway."

I sold 17 boxes last week and thought I had got rid of it all to only find 4 more boxes today I'd forgotten were there.
Except for what my wife shoots, I am basically down to 9mm and 45acp and am set up for reloading both now. I am going to clean out some of my stuff I've been sitting on and either trade, or sell it and by more reloading components, or ammo my wife likes to shoot.
I have shot these and they are very accurate and a very fast and powerful caliber that a lot of fun to shoot.
7.62X25 is going for about .40 per round right now and that's if you can find it. I'll sell this for .25 and that's cheaper than you will buy it anywhere. These are factory boxes and are boxed 40 rounds per box. I'd like 10.00 per box on the ammo.
I'll be glad to sell them, or trade them, or trade some and sell the rest to you.
I have 3 full boxes and one over half full box.
the first 35.00 in cash, or trade takes them all.

I'll trade for any other ammo I or my wife can use and will trade up to your advantage. Thus:

It is a model SW1911 but has all the features of a SW1911PD only this gun is stainless steel instead of scandium. I have added the FDE Houge finger mold grips but also have the original stock grips.

The feed ramp and all pins and sliding parts have been polished but no other modifications have been made. This weapon runs very smooth and slick.  I also have a Blackhawk Serpa holster to include that has been painted tan to match the grips.  I love this gun and it is my main carry but I really need something more user friendly for my wife to be able to use also.  I am looking specifically for Smith and Wesson full size M&P in .45 (preferably 4.5 in barrel), Glock 21gen 3 or newer, or FNX .45.  I would prefer any of these in tan if at all possible.  I could possibly include some .45 ammo for a gun that comes with equivalent amount of mags and accessories.

The new design is a fiberglass-composite polymer over a zinc metal insert. Designed to give extra strength in the high-pressure sections, the Omni-Hybrid surpasses military pressure and weight-bearing testing.

This unique manufacturing process produces a lighter weight platform, with the total weight of the Omni-Hybrid stripped lower being 8 ounces, a ½ ounce lighter than a traditional aluminum AR lower.

“The Omni-Hybrid lower has gone through all the pressure and weight-baring testing of a traditional aluminum lower with flawless results,” says Joe Calabro, Director of Marketing for American Tactical. “We feel like this new manufacturing technique will help set the standard for AR lower manufacturing.”

The Omni-Hybrid stripped lower has an MSRP of $49.95, making it one of the most cost-effective multi-caliber lowers on the market today.

$49.95 Plus tax, no trades. Must be 21 or older and Arizona resident to purchase.

Constructed of 100% stainless steel and 360 degree circumferentially welded the Turbodyne produces less noise than a .22LR. The bullet impact can be heard and is the primary source of sound while the lack of concussion allows for hours of comfortable shooting.

The Turbodyne X can be fitted to most semi-auto and bolt action .50 BMG rifles, mounting directly to the current muzzle break threads without modification to the gun.

BARRETT M107A1 !!

The Barrett M107A1 .50 BMG semi-automatic rifle is an exceptional firearm! Here are some of the new upgrades:

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1).

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it.

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant.

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail.

* It has a lightweight, quick detach bipod with modular feet.

* It has a monopod as standard equipment instead of having to pay additional and add as an accessory; this is a big help so you do not have to support the weight of the rear of the rifle with your own strength. It also allows you to dial the elevation of where your aiming up or down with the monopod with even more accuracy so even if you don't want to upgrade you may want to ask about adding a monopod.

*The case it comes with from the factory is an upgrade from a Pelican case to a nicer Storm case. The Storm case is much easier to open and close, and you don’t bust your knuckles on it, and the case features padding inside instead of bare plastic.

Best I can tell it's manufactured between 1919-1932. 
I bought this from my grandfather years ago, but never wanted to shoot it because it's in such perfect condition especially considering the age. The blueing and the stock seem to be the quality you hope for in today's high end rifles. It's a heavy barrel, scoped (I don't know anything about the old scope on it). I hope for this rifle to go to someone who will take care of it and appreciate the quality and craftsmanship. It's a far cry from today's .22 cals.
If anyone has some knowledge to share on these old guns I would be happy to hear what you know.

Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x50 ZeroStop MOAR Riflescope C433
Originally designed for the US military’s extreme long range shooting and hard target interdiction, the Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x50 provides maximum clarity and resolution across the entire magnification range. This advanced field tactical scope has a wide magnification factor that allows precision accuracy at the longest ranges yet is highly effective for shots at close ranges. With four inches of eye relief, 100 MOA of elevation travel and 20 MOA or 10 mils of travel per turret revolution respectively per turret version, no target will be out of range of this scope. Optional Zero stop elevation turret and standard illuminated reticle compliment the side parallax adjustment. These characteristics have proven highly appropriate for the .50 BMG allowing shooters to accurately reach 200 yards and beyond. With it’s 50mm objective, the NXS 5.5-22x50 retains a slim profile and is easily adaptable to wide range of mounting systems. Superb resolution at high magnification opens an entirely new world of extended range for the accomplished marksman.
