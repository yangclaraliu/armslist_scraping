0,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3813000,For Sale:  Rare Remington 14½ carbine in .38-40 – free shipping,"York, Pennsylvania, United States","$ 1,800","Listed On: Friday, December 26, 2014",Rifles,Remington                                                                                ,38-40 Winchester                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a Remington Model 14½ carbine in .38-40 WCF (aka .38-40 Remington). These are much rarer than the Model 14½ rifles. As far as I can tell, it is completely original. Here is a rundown on condition:

Bluing: I would rate the bluing at 80-85%. The receiver and barrel retain most of the original bluing.  There are a few specks of minor rust, pitting, or scratches here and there, but nothing serious.

Fore-end: Perfect condition, no chips or scratches.

Stock: No cracks, but a few dings and gouges. You can also see some yellow paint on the right side. I think this could be removed, but am not certain. The one negative on the stock is that a previous owner carved his name and initials into the bottom of the stock. I have a picture of this that I can provide.

Buttplate: Original, but shows some bluing loss.

Sights: Wheel rear sight and brass bead front sight. Both appear to be original.

Mechanicals: Perfect. The gun locks up tight and functions flawlessly. I test-fired three factory rounds, loading from both the breech and the magazine. All three rounds fed, fired, extracted, and ejected with no problems. (I wish I had more ammo; this gun is a lot of fun to shoot.) There are no buggered screws or hardware.

Bore: The bore is in nice shape, with solid lands and grooves, except for one groove that has significant pitting for about 2/3 of the length of the barrel. However, the pitting does not extend to the muzzle. The pitting doesn’t seem to affect accuracy; I fired three rounds at a distance of 15 – 25 yards offhand, and managed a 1 ½” group at 12 o’clock from a center hold. I have pictures of the bore that I can provide, showing the pitting.

The price includes shipping and insurance to your FFL or C&R in the continental US. Also included are 15 handloaded cartridges that my friend. Each one is marked in magic marker with the recipe. (For example, “Unique 8.0”) 

Payment is by cashier’s check, money order, or Paypal. I’ve only posted a few pictures in the ad. I took a lot of pictures and can provide them for serious inquiries. (Make sure you provide me with an email address.) This is a final sale, so please ask any questions beforehand. No trades.

It consists of an Adams Arms piston system mated with their line of nitrided barrels (VooDoo Industries). 

I have fired around 200 rounds through this upper and have had no trouble. I really like the piston system because it is extremely easy to take down and clean AND it doesn't get anywhere near as dirty as a gas impingement rifle. Another aspect that helps with keeping it clean is the Adams Arms nickel boron bolt carrier--you pretty much just wipe it clean. I am including a bolt that has been HPT & MPI certified, meaning that it meets or exceeds military expectations. 

The Nikon scope is awesome and comes with the original box (just in case you want it). It has a bullet drop compensation reticle and holds zero like a champ. I am selling this because I actually have a second piston driven upper and do not need both. Buying this stuff new separately would cost:

I have around $475 in this kit.  I'm willing to let this go for $300 if I can sell it this week.  If not, I'll keep it.

This is a private sale.  I am not a dealer, but I will require a Montana ID, which I will photocopy.  Cash only.

This is fully loaded ammunition, ready to shoot in your 300 AAC Blackout caliber rifle

1 - 500 round bulk pack of 147gr FMJ ammunition. Comes in bulk pack box and loose packed in plastic bags.

This cartridge should attain a velocity of approximately 1949fps out of a 1/8 twist 16in. barrel with a carbine length gas system and should function properly in all 300AAC chambered rifles.

With great ballistics and a great price, this represents one of the most cost effective 300 Blackout rounds on the market today! Pickup a couple bags for your next trip to the range!

The popularity of the 300 AAC Blackout round is soaring, and for good reason! With more muzzle energy and knock down power than a 5.56 round it has the stopping power that smaller calibers lack. And with the ability to switch quickly from a supersonic high velocity round to a sub sonic suppressed round with the simple change of a magazine, this round provides more versatility than just about any other caliber on the market today! Its one drawback has always been its cost. Rounds can typically cost $2.00 to $3.00 each or even more. Ozark Ordnance HAS changed that! Our new Blackout rounds start at less then $.60 and none are over $1.00 ever. Finally a way to break into 300 Blackout without breaking the bank. 

Our 300 Blackout rounds are manufactured with new projectiles and re-manufactured mil brass, built to the highest quality, hand inspected and tested, guaranteed to exceed your expectations.

This is fully loaded ammunition, ready to shoot in your 300 AAC Blackout caliber rifle

1 - 500 round bulk pack of 147gr FMJ ammunition. Comes in bulk pack box and loose packed in plastic bags.

This cartridge should attain a velocity of approximately 1949fps out of a 1/8 twist 16in. barrel with a carbine length gas system and should function properly in all 300AAC chambered rifles.

With great ballistics and a great price, this represents one of the most cost effective 300 Blackout rounds on the market today! Pickup a couple bags for your next trip to the range!

The popularity of the 300 AAC Blackout round is soaring, and for good reason! With more muzzle energy and knock down power than a 5.56 round it has the stopping power that smaller calibers lack. And with the ability to switch quickly from a supersonic high velocity round to a sub sonic suppressed round with the simple change of a magazine, this round provides more versatility than just about any other caliber on the market today! Its one drawback has always been its cost. Rounds can typically cost $2.00 to $3.00 each or even more. Ozark Ordnance HAS changed that! Our new Blackout rounds start at less then $.60 and none are over $1.00 ever. Finally a way to break into 300 Blackout without breaking the bank. 

Our 300 Blackout rounds are manufactured with new projectiles and re-manufactured mil brass, built to the highest quality, hand inspected and tested, guaranteed to exceed your expectations.

This is fully loaded ammunition, ready to shoot in your 300 AAC Blackout caliber rifle

1 - 500 round bulk pack of 147gr FMJ ammunition. Comes in bulk pack box and loose packed in plastic bags.

This cartridge should attain a velocity of approximately 1949fps out of a 1/8 twist 16in. barrel with a carbine length gas system and should function properly in all 300AAC chambered rifles.

With great ballistics and a great price, this represents one of the most cost effective 300 Blackout rounds on the market today! Pickup a couple bags for your next trip to the range!

The popularity of the 300 AAC Blackout round is soaring, and for good reason! With more muzzle energy and knock down power than a 5.56 round it has the stopping power that smaller calibers lack. And with the ability to switch quickly from a supersonic high velocity round to a sub sonic suppressed round with the simple change of a magazine, this round provides more versatility than just about any other caliber on the market today! Its one drawback has always been its cost. Rounds can typically cost $2.00 to $3.00 each or even more. Ozark Ordnance HAS changed that! Our new Blackout rounds start at less then $.60 and none are over $1.00 ever. Finally a way to break into 300 Blackout without breaking the bank. 

Our 300 Blackout rounds are manufactured with new projectiles and re-manufactured mil brass, built to the highest quality, hand inspected and tested, guaranteed to exceed your expectations.

When I went to visit him, we pulled the rifle out, the stock was broken clear through and dinged up badly so I put a new R9 Deluxe stock on the rifle and since it was shooting weak, I took it to Pomona Airguns and had him replace the spring and piston seal, replaced the barrel pivot washers and barrel breech seal. This was about 4 months ago. It is shooting strong and accurate. The sale is for the rifle as you see it with the scope (a Simmons 22 MAG 4x32 RF scope) and includes the open sights.
