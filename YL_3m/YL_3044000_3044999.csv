A very fun pistol that gets a lot of attention onn the range!

The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army.  The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG).  The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42.  The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43.  This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946).  The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied.  This historical firearm has been re-designed to shoot from a closed bolt position.  The safety is located at the front of the trigger guard.  The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel.  The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type.  The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake.  This firearm is an ATF approved pistol.  The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position."

This is a new firearm.  I am using a stock photo from Davidson's.

From the Ruger website:

""The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitride finish. 

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.""

I will travel to surrounding states to buy large enough amounts.

I buy reloading brass, I clean it up and re-sell on-line what I don't keep for my own use. So I am not looking to buy 'Scrap Brass', you know broken, bent, crushed junk that can't be worked.

I pay $2.50 per pound, CASH right here in South Dakota. You don't have to pay to ship it somewhere, and hope I send you a check, someday. CASH, TODAY.

I do not buy: Rimfire, Aluminum, or Steel cases. A few mixed in isn't going to kill me. And as mentioned, no bench rejects that you couldn't reload your self. 

I am looking to get reloadable brass. All calibers, mixed, dirty, whatever.

We have been in business for over 53 years under the same ownership. We are receiving up to 50 e-mails daily. All buyers are taken on a strict first come-first served basis depending on the date and time we receive their e-mail. We strive to describe all of our sale items accurately and fully and include professional quality photos of each item. We do our best to point out negatives (if any) regarding a sale item. Although we offer a 3-day, no questions asked, return policy it has rarely been used.

The first potential buyer who states that he definitely wants an item gets it. Those having questions who do not commit to purchase in their first inquiry will have their questions answered but may lose the sale if another buyer e-mails after they do and commits to purchase before we can get back to the first inquirer to answer their questions. This happens almost daily and disappoints a lot of people. If you see something you want- commit to buy it. You will not be disappointed."

 The popular Bobtail Commander is now available in the Valor series. Both the original Valor and the new V-Bob are available in our black duty finish over stainless steel, or a matte stainless finish.

 These guns are the realization of all of their desires in a defensive style 1911. They offer everything you need and nothing you don’t.

 The Valor series features a forged frame with 25 LPI checkering front and back and undercut trigger guard, Heinie Ledge Straight Eight night sights and slim line G10 grips as well as billet alloy steel fire controls and all the other premium small parts you have come to expect from Dan Wesson. While the components are the best available, the components alone do not make the gun. We believe the Valor series is the best built production 1911 on the market.

Walther 2796091 PPQ M2 DAO 9mm 5"" 15+1 Black Poly Grip/Frame Black

The PPQ M2 is a true breakthrough in ergonomics for self-defense handguns.
The styling is elegant and trim with a sculpted grip that meshes smoothly
into the hand. The PPQ M2 has a reversible mag release button and an
ambidextrous slide stop. The 'Quick Defense' trigger works in conjunction
with a fully pre-loaded striker assembly. The trigger pull of 5.6 lbs
remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker.
The PPQ M2 has two drop safeties and a firing pin block for safe carry.
Because the firearm is in a constant cocked state, the striker does not
protrude from the back of the slide. The polymer frame has interchangeable
backstraps and an integral Picatinny Mil-Spec rail. It has low profile,
3-dot sights with a windage adjustable rear. The PPQ M2 is available with a
4"" or 5"" Tenifer-coated slide and standard barrel or the 9mm Navy model
with a 4.6"" threaded barrel.

 The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.-KELTEC
