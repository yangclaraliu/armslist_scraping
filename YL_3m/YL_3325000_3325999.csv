I have an early model Czech VZ.24 Mauser. This gun is truly loaded with history (search google to find out). It is also revered by many (including Nazi soldiers of WWII, who used them in Stalingrad after capturing Czechoslovakian factories and also sent them to their Romanian allies) to be better than their own Mauser K98. As it was made in 1924, it is generally believed to have inspired the German design of the Karabiner 98k. These rifles appear to be moderately rare and few are around today as compared to the K98. To make it more rare, it is a Bolivian Contract rifle with the Condor bird marking. Only 101,000 of these were ever contracted, caliber 7.65 (7.65 x 53), to be used in the Chaco War. This rifle has NO IMPORT MARKINGs, and as Bolivia has not released these rifles for import, it is likely a vet bring-back. It also has numerous markings indicating that it was made by the Czechs and also accepted into their army (Z within a circle; ""E"" in front of a rampant lion) before being contracted out. I have been told by numerous experts that this gun features many components of a very early VZ24.
It is a great rifle in better condition than most (nearly any) I have seen. The action is smooth and cycles rounds beautifully. It functions and shoots just fine, if you're not into just letting it sit. This is one of the best bolt actions I have ever seen. The only reason I am even considering selling it is because I have always wanted an M1 Garand, and this will help me buy one.

Make an offer -- but please no lowballers! This is a quality Mauser worth much more than a Mosin Nagant (I know, I own one). It's hard to get a quality VZ24 anymore.

Thank you very much for looking!

187,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3325187,For Sale:  Russian Saiga AK47 (converted & Parkerized),"Harris County/North Columbus, Columbus, GA, Georgia","$ 1,000","Listed On: Sunday, July 27, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"This is a Russian-made Saiga AK, that has been Parkerized, and converted to legally use standard high-capacity magazines, several years ago by Mike Hill over at Bullseye Bluing.
The conversion included the installation of Dinzags bullet guide, and the G2 trigger group.
The Saigas are manufactured in Russia at the same factory that produces Russia's military AK47's, and are widely acknowledged as among the highest quality AK variants there are.
 This rifle is still virtually brand new, has only been fired a handful of times, and has been flawlessly reliable (as always, I have no problems with a test fire, if you have someplace safe and convenient to shoot).
In case you haven't heard, as of July 16,2014, El Presidente has banned the importation of all Russian-made weapons, including the Saigas, in retalition for Russia's aggression in the Ukraine.
Predictably, prices are rising rapidly, and existing supplies are drying up fast, with most vendors completely sold out (or about to). The likelyhood of this ban ever being rescinded is unlikely in the extreme, and Saigas will very possibly go the same route as other banned AK's, like the Chinese Polytechs, that now run $1800+.
Included are two 30-round magazines, and a couple boxes of ammo (both magazines and ammo are still widely available and fairly inexpensive).
Asking $1000. Cash preferred, but trades considered, specifically a quality 1911, or CZ75. 
The photo shows the rifle with a Choate one-piece stock (which is the most functional, ergonomic AK stock I've ever used), or I can switch it to the standard buttstock and pistol grip that's seen in the photo. Pick one.
Also, I'm the original owner of the rifle, and have my Georgia carry permit, so everything's good on my end.

The conversion included the installation of Dinzags bullet guide, and the G2 trigger group.
The Saigas are manufactured in Russia at the same factory that produces Russia's military AK47's, and are widely acknowledged as among the highest quality AK variants there are.
 This rifle is still virtually brand new, has only been fired a handful of times, and has been flawlessly reliable (as always, I have no problems with a test fire, if you have someplace safe and convenient to shoot).
In case you haven't heard, as of July 16,2014, El Presidente has banned the importation of all Russian-made weapons, including the Saigas, in retalition for Russia's aggression in the Ukraine.
Predictably, prices are rising rapidly, and existing supplies are drying up fast, with most vendors completely sold out (or about to). The likelyhood of this ban ever being rescinded is unlikely in the extreme, and Saigas will very possibly go the same route as other banned AK's, like the Chinese Polytechs, that now run $1800+.
Included are two 30-round magazines, and a couple boxes of ammo (both magazines and ammo are still widely available and fairly inexpensive).
Asking $1000. Cash preferred, but trades considered, specifically a quality 1911, or CZ75. 
The photo shows the rifle with a Choate one-piece stock (which is the most functional,ergonomic AK stock I've ever used), or I can switch it to the standard buttstock and pistol grip that's seen in the photo. Pick one.
Also, I'm the original owner of the rifle, and have my Georgia carry permit, so everything's good on my end.

Reasons why people won't pay your retarded prices:

1) MAK-90 and all other Norinco/PolyTech firearms were banned, you realize this yes? Well, you will have a hard time selling a MAK-90 for over $750 without sitting on it a while, sometimes you can sell the PolyTech legends and the other ""collector"" models fast, but most of the time you sit on those for a while, too. 

2) The Saiga rifles aren't that much better than any other AK and for most people, they just want an AK and won't succumb to the stupidity that you posess to overpay for a unconverted Saiga when they can get an AK for 1/3 the price and be happier.

676,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3325676,For Sale:  wheat penny,"Westminster, Colorado, United States",$ 1,"Listed On: Monday, July 28, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The 1922 ""plain"" or ""no d"" can be produced from four different die pairs. Die Pairs #1, #3 and #4 produce either 
a ""weak D"" or a ""No D"". Die Pair #2, which is the most desirable of the four die pairs, always produces a ""No D"". 

In 1922 only the Denver Mint was responsible for producing Lincoln Cents. Both Mints were busy producing 
millions of Silver Dollars. No nickels, dimes, quarters, or half dollars were produced in 1922. The creation of all 
four die pairs was the result of the Denver Mint running out of usable dies with thousands of cents needed to be 
struck to fill their quota. 

Die Pairs #1, #3 and #4 were the result of ""mint grease"", which is a combination of dirt, metal, and oil, filling the 
area of the mintmark. Mint grease would fill the mintmark gradually, resulting in different levels of ""weakness"". It 
is believed that the mint grease would fall out, then refill creating a cycle of normal D's, broken D's, weak D's, and 
no D's. When looking at circulated examples of 1922 D's, keep in mind that the mintmark could have simply be 
worn from use. Die Pairs #1, #3 and #4 have ""weak reverses"" because they were struck with worn reverse dies. 

Die Pair #2 is not believed to be the result of ""mint grease"". A pair of dies that were creating 1922 D's clashed 
together. The clash resulted in damage to both the obverse and reverse die. The reverse die was badly 
damaged, and replaced with a newer less worn die. The obverse die was reworked by a mint employee who 
erased all traces of the D mintmark while repairing and polishing the die. The result is a worn obverse die with no 
trace of a mintmark and a strong reverse die. 

All 1922 weak D or No D coins fall into one of 7 categories:
1. Die Pair #1 Weak D (Weak Reverse)
2. Die Pair #1 No D (Weak Reverse)
3. Die Pair #2 No D (Strong Reverse) also called 1922 Plain **************************
4. Die Pair #3 Weak D (Weak Reverse)
5. Die Pair #3 No D (Weak Reverse)
6. Die Pair #4 Weak D (Weak Reverse)
7. Die Pair #4 No D (Weak Reverse)

That said here is what I have.
 This is a stainless Taurus Circuit Judge. It is chambered for 45 colt or 3"" 410 shells. It will come with the rail for mounting optics, the key for locking the action, and two chokes, one for shot the other for slugs. This is a discontinued Taurus, not a more common Rossi. I have shown it to a couple friends who work in  retail gun stores and they tell me they have never seen one with the taurus logo on the frame as this does. I'm not claiming it to be rare but it's certainly not common. 
 I will sell for $500 cash, a little higher in trade. I will also consider partial trade and cash or multi gun trades. I can be pretty picky with trades so don't get all bent out of shape if I decline to accept your offer. I will not travel due to the fakes setting up no shows, you must come to Danville to make a deal. I am not interested in your opinion of it's value. If you think you can get it cheaper somewhere else why would your waste time telling me about it, go get it there.
 I am actually a pretty easy guy to deal with if you conduct yourself like a well mannered adult. Unfortunately that is not normally what I get from listing on this site and the reason for my bluntness writing this ad."

The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with Adams Arms salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating quad rail was manufactured by Samson Manufacturing and is a 10"" rail that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you more rail space for whatever you want to mount to your upper. 
I've put about 400 rounds through it. So, it's barely broken in. I'm selling it because I'm planning to go a different route with my build.

The rifle shoots very nicely with sub-moa accuracy, minimal recoil or muzzle rise, and a high speed lightweight trigger that allows for lightening fast follow-on shots or rapid fire. 
The rifle is almost new with less than 300 rounds fired (primarily to test fire the rifle at various ranges). The contrast of Black and Flat Dark-Earth looks very nice and the rifle's competition muzzle brake coupled with a 4 lb. single stage trigger with a light hammer allows the shooter to maintain accuracy while firing multiple rounds in rapid fire or follow-on shots. The rifle's high quality compensator keeps muzzle rise to a minimum while the heavy 5 oz. buffer weight all but eliminates the rifle's recoil.

The specific parts are listed below:
 -Thor 14.5"" linear fluted barrel
 -JP Competition Muzzle Brake/Compensator
 -Yankee Hill Low Profile Gas Block
 -Yankee Hill Mid-Length Gas Tube
