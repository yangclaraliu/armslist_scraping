We talked about the problem of people and their buddies buying .22 and other ammo then reselling it...I made a suggestion that he thought was a great idea and is going to work on setting it up.I would suggest that we all talk to store managers of where we live.........He's going to start a simple list of people wanting to buy .22 ammo and limit the amount purchased. The list will consist of name and phone number, must have id, and as ammo comes in they will contact you. You can then place your name on the bottom of the list for more. That way anyone that wants ammo can buy it and the resellers will be cut out of the loop. Just a suggestion..................................................................."

I have owned it for about a year and have been shooting trap and sporting clays with it.  It is a great gun but doesn’t quite fit me so I am selling it to buy a semi-auto with adjustable stock (would consider trade).   

This gun features unique checkering, adjustable trigger and right hand palm swell as well as A TRUGLO® TRU-BEAD® competition front sight with fiber-optic inserts and a mid-bead.  In addition the barrels are back-bored .742” diameter and use Invector-Plus Choke tubes.  

A little history on this gun, I purchased this gun new last year though they ended production in 2007.  It arrived still sealed in its protective layer of grease.  I purchased it from a gun dealer who bought the remaining stock.  They were discontinued when Winchester changed their name back to the M101 and did some modifications to the design.  It still shares the same action design as the current 101 as well as the same choke standard which is good for when you are buying accessories.  

One note of wear and tear, it has a small nick on the stock which is only noticeable in certain light, otherwise it is better than new with all the original grease cleaned off and the action broken in with a thousand rounds.  (Sporting Clays guns are good for 10s of thousands of rounds).

•	WE TEST OUR SOLUTION AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE VIDEO FEEDBACK TO AID BUYERS
•	Cheaper options are available on ebay but please be aware that they may use inferior material and in some cases leftover scrap
•	When comparing Spall Armor to others look at the difference in weight to tell the quality of the product and STOPPING POWER!
•	We intentionally made Spall Armor in the shape of a square vs shooter cut specifically to allow the buyer to ""wrap"" the corners around whatever shooter cut steel configuration they may own
•	We believe this simple concept is important, allowing for better trapping of the spall and ultimately better protection for our clients!


Description:
•	Price is for ONE PAIR of Spall Armor inserts.  Please note steel plates are not included
•	High ballistic velocity reduction performance
•	Approximately 20% more cost-effective compared to other fabric or bed-liner solutions
•	Stronger warp-knitted structure
•	Outstanding “spall/frag trapping effect” protection
•	These inserts are designed to go in FRONT of  your steel plates to eliminate/reduce spall or ricochet
•	All steel plates are prone to this problem, and rubber coatings (RhinoLining & Line-X) are possibly ineffective after 1-3 shots
•	We also sell ""Liner"" coated plates and actual promote Spall Armor to be used in conjunction with coated steel for maximum protection and spall/frag mitigation
•	Soft, flexible and weighing only 4.4oz each
•	Spall Armor is made up of multiple layers of kevlar woven fabric which is considered 10 times stronger than steel
•	To be most effective Spall Armor needs to be in affixed to the steel plates
•	We suggest duct tape; lots of duct tape
•	Please remember nothing will stop all spall/ricochet (NOT to be used by themselves for protection)

This barel normally costs 289.00 from the website, I will sell it for 280.00. This will save you a bit of money on taxes and shipping costs. 

Per Daniel Defence website:

Cold Hammer Forging of barrels has been known for decades to produce the most accurate, longest lasting rifle barrels obtainable. The Cold Hammer Forging of barrels is accomplished through intense hydraulic pressure applied at opposing angles by carbide steel hammers. During the hammering process, a mandrel is inserted into the bore while the carbide steel hammers shape the barrel around the mandrel creating the chamber, the lands, and the grooves. In addition to the aforementioned benefits, the Cold Hammer Forging process creates a defect free bore and the most consistent chamber possible.




All Daniel Defense cold hammer forged barrels are made from start to finish in our state-of-the-art facility located in Black Creek, GA. In keeping with our heritage of not cutting corners, all cold hammer forged barrels feature a forged chamber and heavy phosphate exterior coating. They are all MP tested on-site and are available in multiple configurations which includes barrel only (stripped); barrel with front sight base; and barrel with low profile gas block. These barrels will prove themselves to be more accurate and last longer than a barrel that has cut or button rifling."

Fits AK style side mounts.  

POSP 3-9x42 Zoom Rifle Scope w/ 7.62x39 BDC 400 Meter Rangefinder, AK Version. The POSP series is world famous for its quality and is current military issue for the Red Army. It is built battlefield-tough from magnesium alloy and has fully multi-coated optics. A great assault weapon scope with a choice of 400m Simonov or 1000m Dragunov marked metering grids, these illuminated reticule scopes allow you to determine kill distance as well as to track and observe game in the field. The military reticles have an extremely effective and useful height-based rangefinder for dual use, with graduated scales for both standing and prone figure estimation. The 400 meter Simonov height based gradient (choke style) rangefinder has holdover aiming marks for quick reaction shooting at 100, 200, and 300 meters, when used with 7.62x39mm. Once the primary inverted chevron aiming mark is adjusted for zero at 100 meters, the next two lower chevrons are bullet drop compensated for shots at 200 and 300 meters automatically. The 1000 meter Dragunov height based gradient (choke style) rangefinder has extended distance inverted chevrons providing aiming points for 1000, 1100, and 1200 meters when used with the 7.62x54R caliber. Since the range calibrations for both the AK and SVD versions on both the 1000 meter Dragunov and 400 meter Simonov models are measured in equal amounts of MOA, all versions of the POSP can be used effectively with any caliber of weapon. They are particularly effective for .308 caliber weapons which require longer range reticles to make full use of their capabilities. The POSP features a red illuminated reticle which allows you to make perfect kill shots in dusk conditions. Illumination is provided by a simple diode; check our Accessories section for a variety of replacement diodes in various colors. Models with the D designation feature a fine focus diopiter ring, VariPOSP models have five brightness settings for greater flexibility in dawn, dusk and dark and the key upgrade in the PRO line is the finer MOA increments giving you much greater precision when zeroing. Laser-equipped models come with a professional tactical laser sight (red, 650 nm) which significantly increases aiming accuracy and target acquisition. The laser dot is 1.2 MOA (35 mm) at 50 meters. All POSP's feature professionally ground, crystal clear optics, nitrogen filling to prevent lens fogging, and larger diameter tubes for improved light gathering under the most severe conditions. Probably the best scope, dollar for dollar, in the world, it is waterproof and can be used in any climate condition. It comes with a high quality mil-spec finish, and with everything shown in the picture: rubber lens cap, eye piece, and nylon carrying case. If you want the look and performance of a true POSP and place a premium on shooting comfort, this is your best choice. The AK V clamp can easily be mounted to any of these rifles with the standard side rail: AK-47, AKM, AK-74, Vepr, Saiga, K-var, KBI, Hesse, Century and Arsenal USA copies, Romak1/2, SLR-93, SLR-95, SLR-101, MK-11, SAR, WUM, SA85M, WASR (check for installed rail), Maddi, Norinco and Poly-Tech copies. The SVD/SKS clamp will fit any of these rifles with the standard side rail: SVD, SKS, NDM-96, Russian Tigr, Romak-3, SSG-97 and PSL rifles. The POSP series uses standard, readily available watch batteries. Side rails, replacement mount bottoms and batteries can be found in our Accessories section."

Up for your consideration is a Glock 22 .40cal RTF2 model. What this means is that it is a limited production Glock. In between Gen 3 and Gen 4 Glock was trying different frames and also the addition of ""Fish Gill"" slide serrations. Ultimately, Gaston Glock decided to not use the RTF2 frame as the basis for the Gen 4 Glocks, this fact in itself was a mistake. This Glock is incredible! It is simply the BEST grip on a Glock that I have ever had the pleasure of shooting. Due to the previously stated fact that these were a ""Trial run"" there was only 25,000 of these EVER made on the model 22 frame so they are EXTREMELY rare considering that there are over 5 million Glock pistols worldwide. You can look them up on the internet and see that at any one time there is not more than a handful for sale. As much as it pains me to offer it up, I am in need of funds for my wedding in September so my loss is your gain. I am not looking to simply sell it, see below for details. Glock comes with Punisher backplate (I do not have original), stainless steel recoil spring/guide rod, extended magazine release. VERY LOW ROUND COUNT"

Both are stamped DDR 1 German captures which is not unheard of but definitely uncommon.  Both are great shooters and function flawlessly.  In fact, the rifle with the darker stock is the smoothest 91/30 action I've ever encountered from a basic, non-sniper model.

I'm putting these up for the low price of $130 each.  Both come with bayonet, oil bottle, and tool kit.  If you decide one is not enough, $250 gets you both of them and I will throw in an ammunition pouch with 6 stripper clips and 90 rounds of Bulgarian silver tip."

The Rifling twist is 1 turn in 15 inches. The weight of this weapon is 30.4 pounds without the tripod mount and scope. The overall length of this weapon is 45.5 inches. This weapon can be purchased from LAR chambered in either Match Grade or Field Grade Rounds.[4]

Films[edit]
The LAR Grizzly Big-Boar can be seen in the following movies:

Tremors 2: Aftershocks (1996): Used by Burt Gummer (played by Michael Gross) to take out a single shrieker, a concrete wall, wooden beams, several oil barrels, an outhouse, and their escape vehicle, in a single shot. He states in the movie that it uses a ""World War I Anti-Tank cartridge"".[5]
Tremors 3: Back to Perfection (2001): It is briefly seen several times until it meets its demise when Burt Gummer (played by Michael Gross) has to put an ammo can on his truck's gas pedal, propelling it off a cliff, so he and his friends can get away from a Graboid.
The Rock (1996): Seen briefly when Private McCoy's (played by Steve Harris) M60E3 runs out of ammo. He is knocked off the roof of the building he was on before he is able to use it. It has the muzzle break removed.
Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997): The LAR Grizzly Big-Boar is used as the tranqulizer guns.[6]
Legality[edit]
Owning a rifle that uses .50 BMG rounds is legal in some U.S. states, and some places allow the use of these weapons for hunting."

I have a Mauser K98, Mod 98, 8mm. This gun is still in cosmoline, basically new/old gun...I believe it is 1943, but not a mauser expert...But here is what I do know about it....

Yugo M-44 Mauser, 
This is NOT a Yugoslavian rifle, They BECAME Yugoslav rifles!!!

 What they actually are is GERMAN Kar98k rifles captured as the German army retreated and units surrendered at the end of WWII, the Yugo's arsenaled them, repaired them where necessary, buffed off the German markings on the receiver rings and stamped them with a Yugoslav crest instead and placed them in war reserve for over 60 years.  ""Preduce 44"" stamped on them to tell them apart from Yugoslavian produced Mausers, and shoot extremely well. They aren't really a Yugoslav Mauser, they are German Mauser wearing Yugoslav markings.

Also the marking on stock ""1.TRZ""
Yugoslavian 1.TRZ
1 Tehnicki Remontni Zavod
 ""1"" stands for Cacak, Serbia
 ""TRZ"" translates to ""technical repair facility""
