Please Text 479 four four 5 zero 361
This gun has less than 50 rds run thru it and is in excellent condition.
The MSRP with only 2 mags is $509.
This Cougar has several beneficial features, such as its barrel and recoil system. A departure from the prevalent tilt-style system that dominates most semi-autos today, the 8045 F sports something different under its sleek, Bruniton-coated hide. A quick field strip reveals a locked-breech system utilizing a rotating barrel. The rotating design keeps the bore axis better aligned with the target, providing greater accuracy. What’s more, the mechanism reduces felt recoil and muzzle flip.
In addition to its compact size, all the edges on the Cougar’s non-glare steel slide are beveled to get rid of any sharp edges, which promote a snag-free draw while also preventing the pistol from shredding a shooter’s clothing, carry gear or hands with feline-like fury.
The Cougar feels good in hand due to the grip indent and being well balanced and points extremely well. The frame also contains a heavy-duty dust cover with an integral rail for mounting lights or lasers.
The Cougar 8045F has ambidextrous decocking/safety levers, making weak hand shooting easier."

There is no ammo shortage. Only douche bags, oddly all over the north state, buying six boxes before anyone else gets to the stores to buy what they want to shoot with their kids to sell it to you for twice the price.

If you keep buying from these douche bags the price will never correct because the douche bags will keep running to Academy Sports and WalMart and buying it up from their buddies behind the counter.

The Aimpoint 3XMag Magnifying Module is specially designed for compatibility with Aimpoint red dot sights and for maximum flexibility and increased performance in the field. The Aimpoint 3XMag Handheld Monocular is a revolutionary tool for military personnel, law enforcement, sport shooters and hunters. When combined with the patented Aimpoint TwistMount, the Aimpoint 3XMag Magnifier gives the user something never before possible - the ability to switch in a split second from CQB (Close Quarters Battle) to semi-sniping and vice versa. Hunters can rapidly switch from non-magnifying to magnifying while still being able to keep their scopes on their firearm. The versatile Aimpoint 3X Mag Magnifier Monocular also can be used as a handheld magnifying glass monocular for discrete observation and identification. The recommended mount for the Aimpoint 3XMag Handheld Magnifying Module is the Aimpoint Twist Mount, which allows for quick attachment & detachmen, and fits any MIL-Std 1913 Picatinny Rail.

Here are the details:

Condition: Used but good (LEO trade-in)
Make: Remington Arms
Model: 11-87 Police
Action: Semi-automatic
Gauge: 12
Capacity: 6 + 1
Barrel: 18""
Chamber: 2 3/4"" or 3""
Finish: Parkerized
Stock/Forend: Black synthetic
Sights: Rifle sights
Extras: Vang Comp Systems dome safety, great 2-point tactical sling (make unknown), sling plate, brand new Limbsaver recoil pad, TacStar 6-round side saddle, 50 rds Federal XM127 2 3/4"" 00 Buck (2 boxes)

Some cosmetic wear in a few spots:
- Magazine extension coupling looks like it was removed with pliers at one point because the finish is partially scratched off (not a big deal, you can reorder part #F99833 for $16.48 + shipping from Remington if it's important to you that it look new)
- Barrel clamp has a scuff on it from being taken on and off
- Couple minor scuffs on the barrel from handling/use
- Butt stock is informally ""engraved"" with ""#5"" (presumably from original LEO duty use)
- TacStar side saddle is missing 1 of 6 screws (not an issue...it is still rock solid with the other 5 screws)

Other than the cosmetic wear I just noted, this gun is in great condition internally. Both the gas system collars and the gas O-ring were replaced in the last couple years.

These 11-87s are built to last, reliable, accurate, and ready for action. I can't tell you the round count from the previous owner, but most LEO long guns don't get fired much, and the internal wear looks minimal. I've only fired 42 rds of 2 3/4"" 00 Buck through it to test function. It performed flawlessly, and the rifle sights are dead on.

This shotgun retails for $900+ brand new with no extras. This gun is used, but it has a few nice extras and comes with 50 rds of quality ammo, so I think $700 is a fair price and I'm firm on it. You are welcome to test fire it before purchasing if you have a suitable place to do that. I can take you to an indoor range as long as you pick up your range fee. Email me for more pictures.

The Springfield Armory XD-S combines an ultra-slim profile (0.9"" wide) with enhanced point-and-shoot performance, allowing for more accuracy and greater control without having to adjust the wrist. This pistol features a single-position Picatinny rail, low-profile rear and fiber optic front sights, two interchangeable backstraps, and a deep-penetrating Melonite finish that protects against corrosion. The XD-S also boasts multiple safety features, including the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, a loaded chamber indicator, and a grip safety. The disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol, and when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol. These features come together to create a superior slim pistol, and the XD-S comes with a durable rugged case and two stainless steel magazines.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

The P7M13 is a 9mm pistol similar to the P7M8 except it has a double-stack Magazine that holds 13 rounds. This gives it a wider grip similar to the P7M10. 





Further manufacture of the 13 round magazines is banned in the USA. The P7M10 magazine is still legal to manufacture and is almost identical. It can be used in the P7M13 filled with 13 rounds of 9mm vs. the 10 rounds of .40 SW it is designed for. 

The M13 debuted in 1982 with prototype serial numbers from 001 to 059. Production serial numbers as of January, 1993 run from 71101 M13 to 89600 M13. The P7M13 is still in production as of 3/00, but US sales are limited to law enforcement only due to the magazine capacity. 

The P7M13 has a gas-retarded action and a polygon bore barrel.

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY This listing is for ONE magazine; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price with no additional shipping charges. Note that some of Triple K’s magazines do not always come packaged, as the photos show. Please read this ad carefully and study the photos to see whether your Star M43 pistol is a single stack or double stack magazine variant. This magazine will protrude past the butt of the grip frame, as our photos show. Triple K magazines work, but they will require some slapping and repeated insertion, ejection, and slide cycling, about 20 times right off the bat in most cases. Most of us who’ve been in the firearms business for any length of time came to know Triple K Manufacturing through their excellent leather gear. Triple K has been in business since 1946. Of all the manufacturers, Triple K is the only source left for magazines to fit many discontinued firearms. Photos show specimens of the Triple K #1343M, their blue steel magazine to fit the Star Model M43 Firestar Compact pistols chambered in 9mm Parabellum. These magazines only fit the M43 Firestar Compact. They are straight stack magazines as the photos show. They will not fit a Star BM9, will not fit M43 Firestar Plus variants that have double staggered magazines and magazine wells; will not fit the power take off lever of a New Holland Tractor. They only fit the M43 Compact. Triple K is the last man standing for Star Magazines since the demise of both Interarms and Star Echeverria in 1998. Construction is all steel, from the bottom of the contoured steel floorplate to the top of the stepped steel follower. This magazine holds 7 rounds of 9mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm caliber. Like new Star factory magazines, these can be broken in by slapping them in, ejecting, and by working the slide about 20 times apiece. The 1988 Spanish Israeli Police Star M43 in some of our photos is not included, of course, and we are not offering it for sale on this listing. We’re offering these brand new Triple K magazines each for only $ 39.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

LaRue Tactical 7.0"" Handguard LT15-7
7.0 inch free-floating handguard with LaRue Locking System. 

Ideal for a replacement for carbine-length rifles using standard front sight bases. The 7.0's length stops just short of a carbine-length gas block, providing true free-float. Our two-pin proprietary barrel nut system with its locking anti-slip plate, sets LaRue handguards apart from the competition. Once properly installed, there is no chance of movement whatsoever. The side and bottom rails are tucked closer to the barrel, keeping the profile narrower and more streamlined. LaRue handguards also include integral QD sling-swivel sockets at the base of each side for convenient mounting 2-point slings. Additionally, our Free-float Rail system provides an excellent heat-sinking feature that pulls throat-damaging heat away from the chamber area. Another heat-sinking benefit is the elimination of pressure-spikes, which some feel is the cause of a large part of pre-mature bolt failures.

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY This listing is for ONE magazine; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price with no additional shipping charges. Most of us who’ve been in the firearms business for any length of time came to know Triple K Manufacturing through their excellent leather gear. Triple K has been in business since 1946. Of all the manufacturers, Triple K is the only source left for magazines to fit many discontinued firearms. Photos show specimens of the Triple K #957M, their blue steel magazine to fit the Star Model PD Compact pistols chambered in .45 ACP caliber, 45 Automatic. This California company is the last man standing for Star Magazines since the demise of both Interarms and Star Echeverria in 1998. Construction is all steel body, springs, and hard polymer floorplate. Cartridge follower is stepped steel. This magazine holds 6 rounds of .45 ACP ammunition, 45 Automatic caliber. This magazine fits only the Model PD Compact Star pistols. It will not work in any of the Firestars or other models, only the PD. We’re offering these brand new Triple K magazines each for only $ 39.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

This series still boasts nearly indestructible polymer frames that are stronger than steel. Tenifer-coating on slides and barrels makes them as impervious to the elements as their predecessors. And Safe-Action-Pistol integrated safety features are still standard. Upgrades includes Rough-Textured Frames (RTF) to make them even easier to handle in extreme conditions. RTF improves Glock's all-weather performance when shooting with or without gloves. Each Gen 4 includes three interchangeable backstraps, so shooters can adjust the grips for a custom fit. Magazine-release buttons are larger and reversible to make them easier to operate for both right- and left-handed shooters. Dual recoil spring assemblies increase durability and reduce recoil and muzzle flip.

I bet you cant find or buy one of these. They are only sold to Elite Military Forces on military letterheads only. No sales to the public or even law enforcement. This laser came from Afghanistan by a close friend who is a SFO. This thing will light a match and is the brightest laser you have ever seen. You can follow the beam even during the day and after dark it looks like something from STAR WARS. yes it will get you put under the jail if they catch you with it!

All parts on the rifle were purchased new. The rifle is in burnt bronze, cerakoted parts include the Upper, Lower, and Handguard. The barrel is stainless steel in black teflon finish headspaced to the matching bolt at the factory by JP Precision. The bolt carrier is QPQ hardcoat processed. I also installed a JP Silent Captured Spring for smooth operation and reduced recoil and eliminating the need for a separate buffer and spring. The rifle has been fired less than 300 rounds.

The prices (total of 2,799.85) below does not include shipping fees and taxes that I paid. 

1. Seekins Precision Upper, Lower, and Handguard
$899 in Cerakoted Burnt Bronze done by X-Werks

IRMT-R Upper
Seekins Precision’s Integrated Rail Mounting technology (iRMT) uppers integrate the rail mounting points into the upper retaining the stiffness of a true monolithic upper while allowing the rails to be completely modular. This new upper design is considerably thicker in the most critical area and will aid in squeezing all of the potential accuracy out of your rifle. Instead of a standard barrel nut our iRMT system uses an externally threaded, Titanium barrel nut with 1-1/8” wrench flats on it for simple installation. No special proprietary wrenches needed.
SP iRMT-R upper is compatible with Seekins Precision’s BAR rail and MCSR rails

SP 223 Billet Lower
The SP 223 Billet lower feature a unique design geared towards the serious tactical shooter. The oversized winter trigger guard, quick access mag release, beveled mag well, ambi bolt drop and user friendly features make this lower the best on the market. To ease assembly Seekins Precision eliminated the use of roll pins, hammers, punches and replaced them with custom screw in dowel pins. We installed an upper tensioning set screw, a set screw for trigger reset, relocated and retained the rear take down pin detent under the grip. Our ambidextrous bolt control allows the shooter to quickly drop the bolt or from either side of the firearm. The unique magwell design allows positive mag changes and allows the use of most all mags including Magpul P-mag and Surefire high capacity mags.

MCSR V2 Mod Rail Handguard
Extremely lightweight, suppressor compatible and infinitely adaptable because of the Key Mod attachment system, the Modular Combat Suppressor Rail V2 (MCSR V2) is perfect for tactical and competition use. Precision machined from 6061-T6 aluminum, it features a seamless top Picatinny rail and Key Mod slots at 3, 6 and 9 O’clock positions for solid mounting of accessories where needed.

2. Seekins Precision ATC Muzzle Brake
$130
The ATC (Advanced Tactical Compensator) was wngineered using CFD analysis software to design the best compensator available. The unique side port design minimizes recoil as well as muzzle rise. Instead of allowing the first port to do the majority of the work our proprietary front facing ports spread out the load minimizing felt recoil and reducing muzzle flash.
3. JP Supermatch™ Barrel and JP Enhanced Bolt
$530 Black Teflon finish

Manufactured to our exacting specifications and used in all of our rifles, JP Supermatch™ barrels are turned from 416R stainless steel, lead lapped, air-gauged and cryogenically treated for cold bore shot predictability, minimum thermal drift, outstanding accuracy and extended barrel life.

$235
The HIPERTOUCH® 24C is the competition version of high precision fire-control drop-ins for installation in AR-15® and AR-10® type rifles. The HIPERTOUCH® name is short for HIgh PERformance TOUCH, 24 for user adjustable trigger weights and C for competition marksmen like 3-Gunners. It installs and functions just like the HIPERTOUCH® 24 but with half the pre-travel and a faster reset.
7. ERGO Stock, Grip, Steel Strike Plate and Recoil Pad

The SKS is a great shooter, I have put probably 110 rounds through it with no problems. 
I also have a 6 shot 38 special revolver. The model is #10, and the full title of the gun is a Smith & Wesson Military & Policy 1905 4th change. The model number off the gun is 553256 and the grips are the originals that came with the gun (which I've heard significantly raises the collector value). You might notice in the pictures that there are a few scratches that I've tried to touch up with a bluing pen a little. I don't think this is terribly difficult to fix them completely with some fine grain sand paper and a bluing pen, I just haven't done it yet. I've put probably 50 rounds through and it shoots better than some brand new revolvers I've shot.
 The SKS comes with 460 rounds of ammo and the revolver comes with about 81-91 rounds.
 I'm looking for about $500 for each but I would prefer trades. I have listed some of the things I'm interested in, but honestly I'll consider almost anything. So if you're interested and have a gun to trade just shoot me an email. Worst I can say is no.

I would like to add that I've researched about how much each of these go for, SKS's such as mine seem to go for about $400 these days and I'm throwing in $150 worth of ammo so I beleive $500 is fair. The revolver I see go for as much as 600-650 on gunbroker (can't find on armslist) so since it's a little scratched I think $500 is fair.  so $1000 cash or relatively close value in trade."

Up for sale is a Yugo 59/66 SKS, and a T/C Venture 30-06 with scope.

This is an all matching SKS. The SKS was bought last year as a cosmetically unissued Yugo with the extras that come with any SKS.  I have done nothing to it other than clean it really well and get rid of the cosmaline.  I have taken it out a few times and have 75 rounds through it.  
It fires fantastic and still looks unfired. I cleaned it very well after each use.  It shoots very well, and looks great.
I can throw in about 75 rounds of 30-06, and 75 rounds of 7.62 ammo as well.

Also included are two batteries, battery charger, computer cable, neck strap, manual, and Dashpoint 20 case.  All items are in very good condition.

The E-P5 gives you a lot of freedom and manual control (if desired), but shoots great in auto mode as well.  The images you'll get are simply amazing - on par with a DSLR at half the weight and size.  You can choose from a selection of hundreds of lenses in the micro four-thirds (m4/3) family to fit your needs.  Plus, with adapters you can make use of nearly any other family of lenses (including those for old 35mm film cameras).

The 20mm/f1.7 Panasonic lens complements the E-P5 nicely - it's fast, bright, and crisp under a plethora of conditions.  It makes a great walkabout, landscape, portrait, or night lens and produces excellent image quality.

I've had this for about two years now and I was never a great shot with it. It has a near perfect bore, which is quite shiny, and improved action. The action was improved to help cycle rounds better, and for most ammo I've used, it's quite smooth. There are some rounds that it doesn't like, but I've mostly used silver tip Bulgarian surplus (I've cleaned the rifle thoroughly after shooting to prevent corrosion). There are a few parts of the stock that were messed up from shipping, but if you wish to refinish the stock it would be easy. The rifle is a 1943 Izhevsk with the scope serial number matching the secondary serial number on the side of the receiver. The scope is in fantastic shape despite being almost as old as the rifle. It is Soviet made scope from Omsk plant 325 ""progress"", it has refubish mark on it and I think the mount is a reproduction. This is one of the earlier rifles imported from the Molot factory into the USA. Overall, the rifle is in fantastic shape and needs somebody to appreciate it more than I do. I will throw in a soft case and 20 rounds of Bulgarian surplus ammo. I will send additional photos upon request.
