These classics were made between 1946-1955 and are collectors. This gun has feeding issues and I am pretty sure it just needs a new magazine. I am not positive that is the issue but wanted to be upfront. It will fire a few rounds without a problem but then it won't feed. I picked the gun up in a trade and haven't shot it very much. I know you can buy aftermarket magazines for around $50. The gun is in great shape cosmetically and I would rate it between 90-95 percent. It is in really good shape for a gun made 60 plus years ago. There is no pitting or rusting of any kind. The gun comes with one magazine and a nice holster. I am asking $460 OBO due to the feeding issues. I know these guns are climbing in value and going for $700 plus on Gunbroker. I maybe interested in trades for other semi auto handguns or revolvers. I am located in Lewisville.

Its brand new in the box and has a new TRIJICON TRI POWER sitting on top of a new LARUE TACTICAL LT150 quick release mount. The chevron co witness the front post perfectly. The weapon light is a ELZETTA C  CHARLIE 900 lumens light sitting in a new ELZETTA ZSM Mount with optional side rail. This is the brightest weapon mounted light you have ever seen. ELZETTA calls it the scorcher. It will totally blind you at night for at least 20min. The best part of this awesome rifle is the AIMSHOT LS8300 green laser. This is no cheap laser that everyone else sells. Its only sold to SOCOM AND OTHER SOF around the world and its no longer sold to LE AGENCYS. You can check this out by calling Jeff at AIMSHOT in Atlanta. You have never seen a laser this bright. You can follow the beam even before dark and after dark the beam and dot look like something from STAR WARS. Yes it will light a match. Comes with zero tool and two tail caps one pressure and the other a click.  Would rather trade than sell. Thanks so much for looking and have a great weekend.

168,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3201168,For Sale:  Well G96 Sniper Rifle Airsoft AICS G96-D with Scope & Bipod Excellent Condition,"Henrietta, Rochester, New York",$ 150,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 16, 2014",Paintball/Airsoft,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a Well G96 airsoft rifle.

I bought this last week with the plans on modding the stock for a Savage rimfire rifle, but once I rec'd it, I realize it really isn't my cup of tea (google ""well g96 savage"" to see what I'm talking about).

I'm not an airsoft guy, so I really can't comment much on the gun itself. Two issues I was told about when I bought the gun is that the bolt catch is broken/missing (see pic), and the magazine leaks. Both seem to be fairly common issues with this gun, and easily fixable (in fact I found a youtube video on repairing the magazine by replacing o-rings). But then again, you only need the stock if you're doing the build like I had planned, and that is in great shape.

Comes with scope, mount, bipod, ect. What you see is what you get.

This is the original description the individual I bought it from gave:

""Features:

    * Gas Powered
    * Full Metal Construction
    * Durable Plastic Receiver
    * Adjustable Hop Up
    * Gas Bolt Action
    * 20Round cap Magazine
    * 3-9x40mm Sniper scope with specialized L96 type ring mount
    * Full metal bipod and bipod tri rail adapter quick detachable
    * Foldable Stock for easy storage
    * Adjustable Rubberized butt stock and cheek rest
    * Adjustable Retactable Monopod
    * AWS Full Metal Flash Hider

Includes:

    * Gas G96
    * 20r G96 Magazine
    * Full Metal Bipod
    * 3-9x40mm Sniper Scope

FPS:
    *515fps


This is a gas G96 L96 Sniper rifle, it is very heavy compare to the spring version, the magazine is very durable and holds a lot of gas for 4 reloads or more depending on temperature. The upper barrel assembly is made from solid metal, adds extra weight to the rifle. The stock has every feature a sniper desires. Sling mounts are located at the front of the hand guard and at the stock. The magazine placement is at the right location, a very well made replica of the Ares G96. There are a a few loose paint located at the handguard and at the grip, I have field this 3 times and has gotten many heads with .40 bbs, but I was using a 50mm scope, this included scope would require zeroing in.

The sniper rifle is currently missing the bolt catch to function, a small part located near the bolt and can be replaced easily. The magazine also has leaking issues. All sales are final, selling this item as is.""

Only one week left to register for this amazing event guys and gals!  Are you bored with the typical range session? Standing still and shooting paper no longer interest you? We have the solution! A couple buddies and I sat down one day and decided to change the way we shoot. We all had the tacticool rifles and pistols. We had a pile of ammo suitable for a Zombie invasion. We had vests, holsters, and other gear. But we never put all this stuff to use the way it was intended. We started up a club and named it RAC FRAG, or Responsible Armed Citizens, Fun Run And Gun. We made custom steel targets. We made shooting stations. We set up a course that involves running from station to station and shooting the steel targets at various ranges. We transition from long range rifle targets to close range pistol targets, and back again. You can't help but smile when you hear that BANG on the steel plates. Every gunner gets videoed and timed on their run so it puts a touch of stress into the mix. This course teaches you how to set up your gear, make quick mag changes, shoot while on the move, and shoot while shaking and out of breath. We found a fantastic piece of land near Madison Lake MN that we leased to hold our events. Here is a link to my worst run of the day during our last event to show you we are not super tactical operators and you have nothing to be intimidated by: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG9hslsjdRw We are all having an absolutely fantastic time doing this. If you don't have guns and you want to run with us, we have plenty of guns for you to borrow at no cost as long as you pay for the ammo.  Even if you have never shot a gun before and have always wanted to, this is a great place to get started!  Our next big shoot is this coming weekend, Saturday, June 28, and we are also going to camp out and shoot all day Sunday too for anybody that might want to join us. Cost is $75 per person, or $120 to camp overnight and have another day of shooting fun. We have a generator on site, a portable toilet, and a grill for whatever you want to bring to cook.  We are looking for more people to add to our club so if this sounds like something you might be interested in, respond to this ad or call/text me and lets chat! REDACTED Please let me know if you have any questions or if you want more info. Check out our website for more pics and videos: http://rac-frag.weebly.com/ Feel free to register on our home page for our June 28 shoot to hold your spot. If you register, you will also be placed on our mailing list for regular FRAG updates. Thanks!! Cody"

Revolver is all original (including grips) and comes with a spare set of rubber target grips. 

Adjustable rear target sight, excellent lock up and timing. Absolute DREAM to shoot and every bit as accurate as a full size Colt revolver should be.

It's in great shape but does have some light scratches and what not from over the decades. 

Interested in trading for a S&W 66, 686, 629 .44 or similar. Nothing with a barrel longer than 4"" and no ultralights. Also interested in HK and Sig full size pistols. No interest whatsoever in 1911s. Any retired revolvers or pistols from the Oakland County Sheriff's Office, Troy Police Department or Michigan State Police are at the top of my list! Also VERY interested in any revolver that utilizes moon clips... especially a S&W 625 or R8!

I also have ammo and a variety of holsters and accessories available for sale/trade with it. It also comes with a letter from the Colt Historical Society detailing its origins.

All I have done for restoration was a light Flitzing and then sealed the entire revolver (obviously not the bore or interior of the cylinder) and grips with Renaissance Wax to preserve it."

The DPMS LR-308 Semi Auto Sniper System (SASS) was born of military necessity. US Military Snipers and marksmen overseas found themselves rapidly switching from scenarios involving precision long range shooting one moment, to close, violent encounters where they were at a disadvantage due to the low ammunition capacity and slow rate of fire of their bolt action rifles. The Government sought a solution to this problem.  The DPMS SASS is the answer. With an 18” fluted bull barrel, free floating 4 rail hand-guards, and JP adjustable Trigger, it is capable of sub-MOA accuracy at long range, fulfilling its role as a precision rifle. The 10 + 1 ammunition capacity and semi auto fire control group ensure the shooter is never outgunned, and allows for faster follow up shots. The Magpul PRS stock, Magpul Front and Rear back up sights, Panther Flash hider and A3 receiver, complete the package.

For Sale – NEW unfired Egyptian Maadi AKM– ARM.  Imported by ACC/Intrac of Knoxville, TN. – one of the best quality AK’s next to the Steyr (used in 1980’s Red Dawn)
Note:  this is NOT a CAI MISR, or PARs nor is it a MAK-90.   

***This is not a low entry Romy AK (not knocking WASR's).  If you are interested in a CAI WASR, this is not for you***

Online Source:  AKM rifles were manufactured at the “Factory 54,” the Maadi Company for Engineering Industries in Cairo. Key Egyptian personnel were trained in the Soviet Union, and the plant was supervised by Russians prior to their abrupt expulsion from Egypt at the hands of Anwar Sadat in 1972. Designated as the “ARM” (Automatic Rifle Misr), a semiautomatic-only version of the Egyptian AKM was introduced to the American public in 1982 by the U.S. division of Steyr-Daimler-Punch in Steyr, Austria. For all intents and purposes this is as close as most of us will ever come to a Russian AKM.

New in the box, unfired Maadi AKM.  This variant of the AK47 is made in Cairo Factory 54, on Soviet tooling.  As close to the Soviet AKM you will get.  

Includes:
2 Factory Mags; 10rd & 5rd.
Original Sling
Owner Manual
Original Maadi Certificate
Original Box

Additional Notes:
This rifle was going to be used for a Russian AKM clone project, with a battle field pick up finish.  However, I need to sell it.  The tac’d barrel crown has been removed, and the barrel is threaded.  There is a small nick on a thread however this does NOT impact function or use of a muzzle break nor is it visable.  Rifle comes with 922r compliant slat muzzle break.  I have a Soviet 1960’s AKM stock kit from a captured PLO AK that was going to be used on this project for sale as well, if needed.  Soviet stock set not included in this sale.

O.C.G.A. § 16-11-132
Possession of a handgun by a person under the age of 18 years

Georgia law only covers possession of handguns by those 
""Under"" the age of 18 with varying circumstances, as well as those 21+. That means a person 18-20 can legally ""posses"" a handgun.


O.C.G.A. § 16-11-101.1
Furnishing pistol or revolver to person under the age of 18 years

This law relates to the sale of handguns in Georgia through a private party (you and I) sale. Once again, it only refers to those ""under"" the age of 18. The rest of the laws that apply to the sale of handguns and handgun ammunition in Georgia are federal laws which only apply to an FFL or manufacturer. (http://www.nraila.org/gun-laws/articles/2004/citizen%60s-guide-to-federal-firearms-law.aspx> 

O.C.G.A. § 16-11-126
Having or carrying handguns, long guns, or other weapons; license requirement; exceptions for homes, motor vehicles, and other locations and conditions; penalties for violations

A person of age 18-20 is treated as an adult who does not have a Georgia Weapons Carry License, and must abide by those same rules. Those rules, in short, mean that the handgun may not leave the confines of my home (property of said home included), motor vehicle, and/or place of business"

It has a 1000-yard BDC and a 3000-yard range finder built-in. The custom designed mounting ring of ATN riflescopes, which incorporates the BDC, insures easy and precise adjustments. An 10 position illuminated reticle prevents you from losing sight of your reticle even in the darkest of conditions. The 80mm lens is one of the largest objective lenses available giving you the brightest image possible. ATN Rifle scope Professional 12-36x80 has an electronic reticle. There is 10 degrees of illumination. The rheostat is the knob located at the back of the scope. It is labeled with numbers 0 through 10. When the rheostat is set at 0 you will see a black etched reticle. The reticle will light up red electronically as you rotate the rheostat through the numbers, 10 being the brightest. The rangefinder reticle in ATN Riflescope Professional was designed to assist you in determining the range of your target. These distances are based on a 6' target, if a 6' target fits between the numbered baseline (the seven short horizontal lines) and the post of the reticle above the baseline determines your distance. If a 6' target fits between the horizontal post of the reticle and 2 the target is 200 yards away. If the same target fits between the 4 and the horizontal post of the reticle the target is 400 yards away. The same is with the 6, 8, 10, 20 and 30. The target would be either 600, 800, 1000, 2000 or 3000 yards away.

Still researching but I think I have it narrowed down.  Case is a match with gun and all serial #'s both internally and externally match.  The 2 magazines that you have are not the original as they both have different serial numbers--however they are authentic. It appears that this gun was one of the more available guns---produced 100,000 of them, but still probably in the neighborhood of $1400 minimum. But again I still have more research with the proof marks.

2) Stevens 5100 Ranger 101.6 Double barrel 20 gauge w/case 

Side by Side.  Manufacturer was for low end retail sales.  Not much information.  I could try to get $100 to $150 at best.  Just a shooting gun.

3) Remington Model #722 Bolt Action Centerfire Rifle w/case 

.300 Savage calibre which is a deduction from value.  Barrel exterior has severe rust---at 70% of finish, Blue Book is $225 but with the severe rust--probably $150 at best.


4) Mossberg  Model 183T 410 Gauge Rifle w/case


Manufactured between 1948-1985.  100% is $175.00  90% is $70.  Probably don't list on Gunbroker.  Use ArmsList.


5) 12 Gauge Single Shot  (No Name????) 


No name no serial number.  Exterior of barrel has extreme pitting and rust. Butt stock broken at receiver.  This would be a wall hangar for decoration as it is unsafe to fire. You could give it to someone or list it on ArmsList for $25 - $50 for parts.


6) Browning 12 Gauge Automatic w/case 


This is the Browning A-5 Model.  1930-1958.  Based on Serial # this is 1952. This is the standard weight version vs the lightweight--with plain barrel  90%--$375  95% --$450.


7) Stevens Model #56 22 Caliber Rifle w/case 

Manufactured 1933-1945--approximately 97,500 were made. Not very rare----$100


8) Winchester  Model #1890 22 W.R.F. w/case 

Still Researching this one---  Manufactured around 1900-- this one could be more valuable than the Luger.  The serial number seems to be a ""tweener""--meaning Winchester records going back that far are very unreliable .  To nail this one down--I would need to write to The Cody Firearms Museum at The Buffalo Bill Historical Center. This appears to be a 2nd Model with case hardened receiver. This gun could be $1600 to $5000---but looking at Gunbroker--prices are all over the place and the condition of this gun is fairly good for it's age.I'm not sure how the scope being screwed on to the frame will affect the value.  It will be worth spending more time on this one.




9) Savage Model #775A 12 Gauge w/case 

90% is $155 Stock is missing endplate--Barrel has exterior Rust-----Maybe$100 at best--but probably more like $80 to $100.

10) Stevens Model 410 Model #38B Rifel w/case 

Mass Manufactured from 1936 to 1945 for various retail stores ( Sears, JC Penney,etc)  Finish is fair to poor. The clip is missing----I wouldn't expect more than $50 to $75 on this one.

11) Ithaca 22 Rifle (No Case) 

Very poor condition on the finish.  Lever action single shot Model 49 Saddle gun---manufactured 1961-1970.  Maybe $40 to $50.

12) Air Gun Model #J802842 


This is a Chinese made pump pellet model B3-2.  You Can buy these on Amazon for $39.00.  I have also include a link to a You tube video with many comments.  It's an exact match to your gun---guy paid $20 for it.


13) Marlin Golden 22 Model #39A w/case 

Lever Action manufactured 1950's to 1987  At 90% maybe $250  %70 is 175.  Strap is nice leather which would support a $200 price."
