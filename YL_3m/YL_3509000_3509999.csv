1897 Winchester 12 Gauge Pump action Shotgun.

This Shotgun came out of the closet recently after my father’s death and has not been restored or reworked meaning it is in original condition with no attempt at restoration. This Shotgun was recently disassembled, inspected, and cleaned by a local gunsmith that included a test firing. The gun shows honest wear in the middle of the gun that is the results of carrying the gun during use. The wood has a natural finish. The mechanics are tight and the finish is good. The barrel is 30 inches with full choke and a shiny bore. This shotgun retains the “Cowboy action” that some collectors prize.

The history:

Winchester Firearms Manufacturing uses Serial Numbers to date the Winchester 1897 production years from 1866 through the early 1990.

This Winchester model 1897 has matching serial number L 654XX placing the age of the shotgun from 1917- L 646124 to 1918- L 668383 indicating the gun was made 97 years ago.

I have only 50 rounds thru it. ( 1 range trip at time of purchase ).  At the time, I wanted to put the usual tactical trigger system in it that I have in my Glock 21.  Anyway....all my competition parts came in today from the "" Glock Store,"" and then I decided to put one of the new parts in, the ( Titanium trigger safety plunger and spring ), and then put the stock part back in the box as backup if I ever needed it. So that's already been installed.  I also have the double diamond 3.5 trigger connector and competition trigger spring, which are still in their packages, and they haven't even been installed yet.  The pistol was $ 569.00, and I bought 2 extra mags, for a total of four mags.  So you get all the original stock and competition parts to install if you want to modify it, four mags, holster, box, paperwork, speedloader, cleaning brush, and I even ordered an extra trigger housing w/ejector, and 2 extra spring/guiderod assemblies, which also come with all of the extras, as well.  I have so many extras for this thing, I'll have to put some of them in another box when I sell it.  It's a steal, guys.  So, basically I put about $160.00 into this pistol to modify it, plus the purchase price of $ 569.00.  I could easily ask for $ 675.00, but only looking for $500.00.  Things just came up financially a little while ago, so I have to make the hard decision, but it's worth it because I know that it will get a good home.  I have a ton of Glocks, anyway, but look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks, guys.

The result is a top-quality series of pistols that combines maximum safety with perfect functionality. With a striking design and refined details. Besides its renowned reliability, the P30 is especially notable for the completely new design of its grip ergonomics. The easily exchangeable grip shells (right/left) are the only ones of their kind in the world. In combination with the exchangeable back strap the pistol provides maximum adaptability to any hand size – for both men and women. What is more, the standardized MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail at the front of the P30 frame provides maximum flexibility with regard to equipment with additional tactical accessories. The P30L is a variant of the P30 with a lengthened slide/barrel.

This P380 is constructed of a black polymer frame, matte stainless slide, and textured polymer grips. The pistol has both Front/Rear Drift adjustable 3-dot Trijicon Night Sites and a Crimson Trace Laser Guard. The gun comes with all the original manuals, case, a De Santis pocket holster, 2 6rd mags, 1 7rd mag and well over 375 rounds of .380 ammunition. With the exception of a 50 rd box of PMU FMJ rounds the ammunition is mix of hollow point self-defense oriented ammo which includes Hornady Critical Defense, Speer Gold Dot, Federal Hydroshok, Federal Premium Low Recoil, 50 rounds of Remington Ultimate Home Defense,  Cor-Bon,  and 24 rounds of a mix of high velocity fragibles. This pistol has a bit over 100 rounds down the pipe to break it in. I have found the trigger pull on this pistol amazing and it is very accurate. There is well over $1100 in value here.

The P380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, Kahr's six patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. These features result in a micro-compact pistol in a fighting caliber with very little felt recoil and quick follow-up shots. The P380 also boasts ""real"" sights, featuring drift adjustable with tritium night sights available. The .75"" slide is machined from solid 416R stainless bar stock and locks back on the last round. In addition, the P380 utilizes an all metal magazine catch in the polymer frame to mate with the stainless steel magazine. The magazines are USA made and are plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs, and feature Wolff Gunsprings. Its light weight and small size, combined with Kahr's reputation for reliability, makes it the perfect pocket pistol. The P380 model is also a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement. The easy to use sights are just an added bonus to this already desired pistol."

It has a clean bore with strong rifling and a beautiful stock. Comes with bayonet, oil/cleaning can and toolkit as well as 880 rounds of ammo !! 880 rounds in UNOPENED, still sealed spam cans (avg. price is over $99 per can, plus shipping!!)

This rifle is a blast to shoot, inexpensive to buy ammo for an one of the most fun rifles I've ever owned. That being said, I have to pick a couple guns to exit the closet so I can get the handgun my wife's been wanting.. Glock 26 Gen4. 

 My original plan, after buying the Mosin, and shooting it, was to never sell it... I was then going to buy a Vepr (semi auto in same caliber) to augment this Mosin. But, wife wants a rifle or handgun that's easier for her to shoot and the Mosin is a bit in the heavy/long side for her.. ugh. 

 So, now I'm shifting gears to find a small 9mm handgun (Glock 26 Gen4, or DA/SA, Striker Fired, etc.) or a smaller semi-auto in 7.62x39 (AK variant, RPK that I can cut down) or even a pistol caliber carbine that she will enjoy shooting

995,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3509995,For Sale:  Saiga 12ga 922(r) - Get it before it's banned!,"Anywhere, Denver, Colorado","$ 1,500","Listed On: Thursday, September 18, 2014",Shotguns,Saiga                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Shotgun,"Versatility was the primary objective in modifying this 922r-compliant Saiga 12 shotgun; the project was conceived as an answer to the question of what kind of weapon would be ideal in a ""Walking Dead"" world. It would need to be something with proven track record for reliability with plenty of replacement parts. A ""zombie apocalypse"" weapon would need to be quick and easy to reload, with a minimum amount of time between shots, so semiautomatic and magazine-fed. It would also need to be adaptable to hunting, defense, breaching and assault situations, which means support for a variety of loads and projectile types. 

A shotgun is capable of these things far more effectively than a rifle or a handgun. And Kalashnikov action weapons are known the world over for their resilience against the elements, with the AK-47 being the most widely-proliferated firearm in the world. Hence, the Saiga 12ga - a semiautomatic, magazine-fed Kalashnikov action shotgun based on the AK-47 platform - was an ideal candidate.

The shotgun pictured has been modified with a US-made fire control group, an upgraded V-plug from MD Arms (to allow fine-grained control of the weapon's behavior with different loads), as well as coming equipped with a high-quality, milled aluminum quad rail, ergonomic pistol grip and folding, extendable stock. This configuration expands the versatility of the weapon by providing a secure platform for scopes, lasers, flashlights, red dot sights, and more. All of these parts were made in the USA and are of the highest quality. 

Additionally, the stock finish from IZHMASH (the manufacturer of the Saiga 12) is a cheap paint that easily scratches and can be rubbed off by a paper towel. To protect against the elements, this shotgun has been sandblasted and professionally treated with Norrell's Moly Resin, which provides excellent rust and corrosion protection. This self-lubricating finish also meets Mil-spec for: 60-day seawater immersion; immersion in acids, powder solvents, paint removers, bore cleaners; and accelerated salt spray tests equivalent to 30 years marine environment. It is flat black in appearance, to match the furniture attached.

And if that's not enough to entice you into stocking up for facing hordes of the undead, I'll even throw in 5 ""Dragon's Breath"" shells (where legally permissible). These specially-designed shells spew a 70ft fireball of blazing hot magnesium pellets, so you can engage the walkers with an AK-47 flamethrowing assault shotgun in style. 

** GET IT BEFORE IT'S BANNED **
This summer, the Obama Administration banned import of Russian firearms as part of a sanctions package in response to the invasion of the Ukraine. As a result, Kalashnikov Concern (formerly Izhmash), maker of the Saiga 12ga, and similar Kalashnikov-action firearms, can no longer be imported by dealers in the United States. Private ownership and transfer is legal... for now. This rifle represents one of the last lots legally imported into the U.S. for conversion into a tactical configuration. Grab it before it's too late!
