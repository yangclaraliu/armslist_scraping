Because you requested it, Buffalo Bore is now producing two full power 357 Sig. loads. These loads are full power 357 Sig. Not the watered down stuff that other factories are already producing. Why is it that a new cartridge gets developed with touted ballistics in the media, only to have the ammo manufacturers ""water"" it down after a few years on the market? (The same thing happened with the original 10MM) The 357 Sig. was designed to blast a 125gr. bullet at 1,425 FPS out of a four inch carry gun barrel. (Not a much longer test barrel) So, that is what both our loadings do.

We use flash suppressed powder so that you wont be blinded by your own gun fire should you be required to drop the hammer in low light. Since over 90% of civilian shootings in America happen in low light, flash suppressed ammunition is a huge tactical advantage.

Item 25A utilizes the 125gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet. It is designed to open radically and penetrate roughly 12 to 14 inches in human tissue. Note my velocities from my real world pistol, (not a test barrel) below.

a. Sig. Mod. 229, 4 inch barrel - 1,430 fps (567 ft. lbs.)

Item 25B utilizes a 124gr. FMJ flat nose bullet at 1,425 fps. This bullet will smash through typical stick frame walls, car doors and a bears skull or shoulder bones. It is designed for those who need deep penetration. It should penetrate 24+ inches in human tissue. If I were carrying a 357 Sig. for defense, I would carry my pistol with our 125gr. JHC (jacketed hollow cavity) loaded in the chamber and the top 4 or 5 rounds in the magazine. The remaining rounds in the magazine would be these FMJ flat nose loads. Why? After the first few rounds are fired in a fight, most opponents will be dead or behind cover. The FMJ flat nose loads will penetrate many types of cover that would stop a hollow nose bullet. Note my velocities, from my real world pistol, (not a test barrel) below.

I bought this trigger before my wife and I welcomed our daughter into the world, and seeing that diapers and wipes cost money, I thought I could help out some by selling this awesome trigger, that right now, I have no use for.

After I installed it in my PSA lower, my trigger scale routinely broke at 2.5 lbs.  Geissele did ship an additonal spring for it, which is supposed to increase the trigger pull another 1 lb.  With it installed, the trigger should break at 3.5 lbs, though I have not tried it.

There was complete joy on my face the one time I did take the rifle out to test the trigger.  It is fast.  Enough said about that.

Here is the info about the trigger from the Geissele web site......

The Geissele Super 3 Gun (S3G) trigger is a semi-automatic-only derivative of the two-stage Super Select-Fire (SSF) combat trigger that Geissele Automatics produces for customers in the U.S. Special Operations Community.

Note: The S3G trigger has a very short, light pull and reset. We do not recommend it for duty use, bench rest, accuracy work or shooting small groups. It is designed for close course competition use where rapid target engagement with quick follow up shots are required.

Would prefer to do a cash deal, but can accept USPS or bank money order.  Can ship for an additional charge of $5.00 in a padded envelope.

These triggers retail for 250.00

Would also consider a trade and cash to make up the difference for a Streamlight TLR-1 or  InForce APL pistol weapon light.

The rail system is UTG and is one-piece that comes off easily and is made for a mini, as itslides rigth over the front of the barrel/stock.

The serial numbers start with 186-630xxx indicating that this is the model run from 1991-1999 I believe and this gun was made in 97/98.

Take off the stock and the true ""mini"" is in incredible shape. The last two pics show the internal front and back of the chamber and I couldn't get my camera to take a decent pic of the inside of the barrel but it is bright, shiny and the rifling is great. The gun shoots perfectly. The action is smooth and crisp. The magazine go in tight and crisp and snaps right into place, where I've had other minis that you fought with the darn thing to get it in there.

The barrel and top of the gun are very very clean and the only blemishes on the thing are a couple nicks on the suppressor and the stock has use marks.

This would be a perfect gun to throw an optic on and use as it is or to take off the stock and rails, sell them, and build whatever you want. I'd put a tactical folding stock on it from tapco or some other brand and just use a regular scope mount with a 3-9x30 myself. Or one could just put a nice red dot on the upper rail of this setup and go.

Anyhow, I hope this better explains the gun. I wish I had the original stock for it, but I don't. The nice thing about these mini's is that there are hundreds of cheap things that can be done to customize them on ebay, amazon and all over. Or if someone wanted a cheap really light mini, take off the rails in about 5 minutes and use the peep sights and go spray some lead at the coyotes.

$500 and thanks for looking.

 This U.S. Army M16A2 has never been fired, and is still new in its case! Our nation's main battle rifle is the M16A2, made by Colt. But, at some point in the future, the Pentagon plans to replace it, through Force XXI (Project ""Star Wars Trooper"") with a battery-powered, caseless ammunition ""weapons system"", called OCIR, from the ""Space Age"". This will no longer look or fire like a ""rifle"", nor will it require traditional marksmanship training. Before the M16 A2 is replaced, The American Historical Foundation is proud to bring you the opportunity to own a very special, museum-quality version of the Colt M16A2. NEVER BEEN FIRED.



 Display Case is included to safely display and protect your investment, a custom-built American Walnut Display Case, with a locking acrylic-glass lid. Easily wall mounted or displayed flat, it features form-fitted green velvet lining in the color of the U.S. Army honored, 44""x13""x4"". Finish on case is wearing thin."

You must be 21 yrs old, or older and a Kentucky resident, and must have a valid ID (CCDW preferred) to trade this gun. No shipping out of state. Thanks for looking.

The Winchester® Model 94® is the world’s most popular lever-action and today’s rifles utilize the latest manufacturing technology to bring you the most accurate models ever produced. The new Model 94 Carbine is perfect for hunting in thick brush for deer, bear, wild hogs and other fast-moving game. Pick your Model 94 and pick out your target.
This rifle became the Model 94 Winchester. It was the ultimate iteration of Winchester levers and, although coming at the end of westward expansion, is often called ""The Gun that Won the West.""

There are a number of good reasons that the Model 94 Winchester is still a solid choice for big game hunting. It is true that many hunters over the years have moved to bolt actions for longer range hunting --  like out in the West for example, where cross canyon shots are common. That is well and good. But even in the 21st century, the most hunted big game animal in North America -- the Whitetail -- is in brushier, nastier, tighter conditions than ever. In fact the urbanization of the Whitetail is one of the most studied topics by wildlife biologist these days. If you are whitetail hunter you are likely goign to be hunting in these kinds of condistions. And being able to get on target and make a good shot is something the Model 94 has been proven to do for over 110 years."

The Rossi Matched Pair has set the standard for 2-barrel guns. This combination long gun package is unequalled, having been recognized as the best 'youth-size' gun and a top notch 'full-size' backpack take-along. We start with one of our popular single shot rifles, then hand fit a shotgun barrel to create the Matched Pair. The result is a highly reliable rifle with adjustable sights and a button rifled barrel for enhanced accuracy, which quickly swaps barrels to become your favorite shotgun. This makes the Matched Pair the perfect gun for hunting or a fun day at the range. Available combinations are listed below. Change Barrels Faster Than You Can Change Your Mind To change barrels, make sure the firearm is unloaded. Loosen the front swivel and remove the forend and swivel. Open the action and insert the barrel, replace forend, tighten the swivel and you are done and ready to shoot. One screw, one minute, no tool, no kidding!

The Century Arms Yugo M70AB2 rifle is a 7.62x39mm semi-automatic rifle with a long-stroke gas-piston operation, a rotating bolt and a detachable, 30-round box magazine. This particular model comes standard with an underfolding metal stock and a synthetic pistol grip and handguard. Since the M70 was designed to be able to fire rifle grenades, it needed the ability to withstand a good deal of pressure. The rifle’s stamped-steel receiver is actually based on an RPK receiver, and being that it is thicker than the standard AK’s, it has a distinctly bulged front trunion. Another distinct feature of the M70AB2 is the elongated handguard with three, instead of two, cooling slots.These rifles are extremely well-built and very solid. They come standard with a Tapco G2 trigger group which prevents trigger slap."

The P22 has a conventional double-action/single-action (DA/SA) trigger, meaning that the first shot may be fired with the hammer uncocked – the double-action trigger will first cock the hammer. The trigger pull in the double-action mode is approximately 12 lbs., and in the single-action mode is approximately 5 lbs.

 This handgun is equipped with a magazine disconnect and will not fire unless a magazine is properly seated into the weapon."

899,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3826899,For Sale:  MINI 14. Better pics/description.,"West, Des Moines, Iowa",$ 500,"Listed On: Thursday, December 18, 2014",Rifles,Ruger                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Has one-piece pistol grip stock. The rail system is UTG and is one-piece that comes off easily and is made for a mini, as it slides rigth over the front of the barrel/stock.

The serial numbers start with 186-630xxx indicating that this is the model run from 1991-1999 I believe and this gun was made in 97/98.

Take off the stock and the true ""mini"" is in incredible shape. The last two pics show the internal front and back of the chamber and I couldn't get my camera to take a decent pic of the inside of the barrel but it is bright, shiny and the rifling is great. The gun shoots perfectly. The action is smooth and crisp. The magazine goes in tight and crisp and snaps right into place, where I've had other minis that you fought with the darn thing to get it in there.

The barrel and top of the gun are very very clean and the only blemishes on the thing are a couple nicks on the suppressor and the stock has use marks.

This would be a perfect gun to throw an optic on and use as it is or to take off the stock and rails, sell them, and build whatever you want. I'd put a tactical folding stock on it from tapco or some other brand and just use a regular scope mount with a 3-9x30 myself. Or one could just put a nice red dot on the upper rail of this setup and go.

Anyhow, I hope this better explains the gun. I wish I had the original stock for it, but I don't. The nice thing about these mini's is that there are hundreds of cheap things that can be done to customize them on ebay, amazon and all over. Or if someone wanted a cheap really light mini, take off the rails in about 5 minutes and use the peep sights and go spray some lead at the coyotes.

$500 and thanks for looking.
