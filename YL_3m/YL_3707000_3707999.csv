This is the one with the bull barrel and Hogue stock. I’ve had it a year and took 3 deer with it last year during my annual hunt in Texas (160yds, 240yds, 290 yds). I broke it in properly with 20rds of shoot/clean, etc… and it’s now got about 150rds total through it. The first 20rds were PMC bronze, and the rest have all been handloads.

With 165gr Gameking handloads using Nosler brass, it shot .8” groups w/ 42grs of IMR4895 and Winchester standard large rifle primers. I never tuned those loads past the initial batch because they worked so well I never felt the need to mess with them. I never even adjusted the trigger from it’s factory settings. The gun has way more in it for accuracy, but for my use, it’s been fantastic out of the box. It’s lived in a Pelican case and is in excellent condition.

It’s got a Weaver 20moa rail, Weaver tactical rings, and a Bushnell Trophy XLT 4-12x40 (DOA 600 reticle).

GUN w/scope: $725
GUN w/rail, scope, rings, and Harris Bipod: $800

I’m in VaBch just off the Northampton Blvd exit. If you are honest and honorable, it would be a pleasure to hear your offer and see what we can come up with

There was plenty of interet at the Gunshow this past weekend... just could come together on a few trades.

BERETTA PISTOL MODEL 8045F CALIBER 45

The ancestory of this Italian company dates back to 1526. The Beretta family began in the firearms business as barrel makers. Soon after, they began manufacturing their own sporting shoulder arms. The first Beretta pistols were made in 1915, and by the end of the 20th century Beretta had become one of the world's major premier handgun manufacturers. 

In 1977 Beretta-USA was established, with a manufacturing facility located in Accokeek, Maryland. In 1985 the US armed forces adopted Beretta's Model 92 pistol as their standard sidearm.

I built this as a fun project over the last year.  I have receipts and documentation for everything.  The intention was to use it out to 600 yards but I built up a .308 bolt rifle at the same time.  This rifle is just sitting in my safe now and I am ready to start working on the next project.  Every component was picked for specific reasons with function and form in mind.  I only have approx. 50 rounds though the barrel for function tests and sighting in the scope.  Feel free to email me with questions.  Thanks!  I would consider a trade for a Walther PPK in .380 or a Glock 19/34 +cash, a SIG 226 +cash, or a long barreled M1A."

The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR15/M16 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock for rifles with A1/A2 fixed stocks. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions.

Description:  The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price.

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

Beretta 92FS (1989) – a minor modification of the Model 92F, with an enlarged hammer pin head which prevents the slide from flying back in the case of breakage. Presently, all US M9 pistols are modified to 92FS standard.
The FS has an enlarged hammer pin that fits into a groove on the underside of the slide. The main purpose is to stop the slide from flying off the frame to the rear if it cracks. This was in response to reported defective slides during U.S. Military testing.

And then we have this other extremely cool western looking holster made by Texas shoe maker & son. This holster seems to be very nice and high quality. I got it in a trade. Not my thing haha so yeah it's going to who ever buys this Vedder and from then on you can try to sell it which seems impossible, use it or set it on fire! Thanks"

PX4 Storm Double/Single-Action Semiauto

The Certified Beretta Px4 Storm double/single-action semiauto is the culmination Beretta’s experience in engineering pistols for military and law enforcement.
Ultra-Durable, Ultra-Safe for Concealed Carry and Home Defense

Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of demanding government agencies and organizations are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable--the PX4 just keeps delivering.

It was restocked (ugh!),  and also someone changed the front and rear site (double ugh!).
The rifle still fires and I've included close ups of all the stamping.  Please contact me for questions and/or additional photos.  Below is a better explanation of this rifle:

The Mannlicher Gew.98/40 German Infantry Rifle was known by the Germans as the Infanterie Gewehre G98/40.

These German contract guns were made from 1941 to 1944 by Fémáru Fegyver és Gépgyár, Budapest, (German Ordnance code “jhv”), with some or all of the work possibly subcontracted to Danuvia Gépgyár, Budapest (German Ordnance code “jua”). 

{Note added by Claven2: During the war, the German’s referred to Fémáru Fegyver és Gépgyár, Budapest as Metallwaren-Waffen und Maschinenfabrik, Budapest (HU). After the war, the arms maker became known commonly as “FEG”. A full list of codes, including jhv, and most WaA's can be referenced in the following Milsurps Knowledge Library entry: ""Das Heereswaffenamt"" (Detailed Listing of German WaA Markings and Codes)}

The Hungarian-made G98/40 is not a mauser, and shares nothing significant with the G98, rather it is a mannlicher-based receiver design patterned after the Hungarian 35M, the only firearm ever purpose-built for the 8x56R cartridge. The G98/40 was contracted as a war-expedient, to exploit the existing 35M tooling. They were issued primarily to the Luftwaffe.

Distinguishing features of the G98/40 include:

- mannlicher-based receiver design with all steel parts blued;
- two-piece bolt with detachable bolt-heads, and bolt handle positonned ahead of the receiver bridge;
- chambered in 8x57;
- two-piece stock system (similar to that found on the Lee Enfield). Early stocks were walnut, later laminate; and
- mauser sling, bayonet and staggered row magazine designs, allowing the use of the K98 sling, bayonet and stripper clips.

In 1943, the Hungarian Government, adopted a variation of the G98/40 known as the 43M, which differs slightly in sling and bayonet arrangements, but is otherwise identical to the G98/40."

In 2007, Springfield Armory shook the polymer pistol market with the introduction of the new XD(M)®. The XD(M) series forever changed the handgun landscape, and set new and higher standards for ergonomic comfort, ease of operation, features and performance.

The XD(M) offers the best ergonomic experience possible in a polymer platform. With multiple interchangeable back straps, the XD(M) can be perfectly tailored to fit your hand. As it shares the same perfect grip angle as the standard XD(M) and the 1911, the XD(M) points effortlessly and naturally. Aggressive mega-lock frame texturing and major grasp slide serrations keep the XD(M) in your hand and operational under any conditions. The slide and frame feature aesthetically pleasing contours that make it a more concealable pistol.

PREMIUM 30-06 SUPERCHARGED Ammo - 150 gr. SPTZ @ 3000 fps - 20 Round Box     

This Super Charged 30-06 load was designed to be the premier deer load for 30-06, providing devastating, one shot terminal destruction of deer “clockwork”. The 150gr. Spitzer is traveling at around 3,000 fps from typical 30-06 rifles and the bullet will mushroom violently at these impact velocities. It may even fragment, depending on bullet placement and impact speed. For big game up to 350 lbs, tremendous penetration is not needed, so this bullet mushrooms radically and might even break up. (Much like our Deer Grenade 44 Mag. Item # 4F) When high speed bullets act this way terminally, the effect is devastating and they absolutely “dump” deer sized game animals in their tracks. This bullet does not give ample penetration for super big game like Yukon moose and we have designed other 30-06 loads for that type of task, but this load will collapse deer sized game unlike any other 30-06 load. This load is designed for any game weighing less than 350 lbs, such as medium sized black bear, hogs, antelope, deer, etc.

Note our below real world velocities, shot from real world rifles. We do not use extra long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings.

 Awesome conceal carry pistol. Sig smoothed and rounded over everything in their custom shop and treated the stainless slide to be anti-snag.
 Easily pocket carried. Fits same pocket holster as an LCP.
 Slightly heavier than the LCP and slide is about 3/4 inch longer. Other than that, it's the same overall size as an LCP, but hits a lot harder. Plus, it reliably cycles with a full 6 round magazine+1 in the chamber, something an LCP struggles with. The P938 has nice sights and is very accurate. Can be carried cocked and locked.
 Very good condition. Slight holster mark on side of slide nose, but hardly noticeable.
 Comes with 1 6-round magazine and box for a 938, but it's not the original box.
 Functions flawlessly and looks great.
 Has factory siglight night sights that are very bright.

Comfortable to carry & easy to use, the TASER X26 offers private security, executive protection, fugitive recovery agents, and concerned individuals in the private sector the same trusted take-down power on duty with thousands of police officers every day. Designed for easy deployment during high-stress situations, the TASER X26 combines a quick-flip safety, laser sight and dual LED lights for quick & effective threat response. The TASER X26 delivers an electrical pulse designed to override the sensory and motor functions of the nervous system that can stop even the most aggressive individuals, including those under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.

The TASER X26 uses replaceable air cartridges containing compressed nitrogen to fire two barbed probes attached to conductive wires. These probes must connect with the target and create a circuit. Electrical pulses are then cycled over the wires and into the body, jamming sensory and motor functions and inhibiting muscular control. This effect will continue as long as the TASER device is activated. TASER brand devices can also be used in direct contact stun mode, with or without the air cartridge installed. The TASER X26 is safer and more effective than many other less-lethal defense options (such as pepper spray, impact weapons & stun guns) which require close proximity to an attacker, and often prove to be ineffective on individuals under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.
This awesome device Features:
Lightweight, compact, and concealable
Simple & easy to use - ideal for those not comfortable with firearms
Ambidextrous trigger arming switch protects against accidental activations
Integrated LED light & laser for illumination, visual deterrent, and target aquisition
Replaceable cartridge with 0-35' range - safely stop attackers
Drive-stun (direct contact) capable without removing the cartridge from the firing bay
Digital power magazine delivers 150+ 10 second cycles
30-second cycle allows time to escape a dangerous situation
Powerful shaped pulse - same technology utilized by law enforcement
Lifetime replacement guarantee is standing by Taser so apparently if its lost or damaged protecting yourself if you do a police report apparently Taser will send you a new one. I honor no such warranty thats what i read.

Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0” – 1.2” in diameter.

The 4 Inch XD combines safety with quality and ease of use.
With the new Ultra Safety Assurance (U.S.A.) action trigger system, this polymer framed pistol is as comfortable as it is safe.
The XD''s frame is made from a proprietary polymer material that has produced a pistol that is extremely durable, reliable and lighter than popular competitive models.
The frame is checkered in front and rear for a more positive grip, even with wet or sweaty hands. The XD''s also have a slide release, ambidextrous magazine release button, and a quick turn disassembly lever, allowing for amazingly fast and simple field-stripping.

SIG-SAUER PISTOL MODEL P226 CALIBER 9MM WITH RUBBER GRIP

The SIG SAUER P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the U.S. Navy SEALs, Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Available in either 9mm, .357 SIG or .40 S&W, its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy.

Durability and dead-on accuracy have made Troy Industries Folding BattleSights the hands-down choice of Special Ops and tactical users worldwide. Easy to install and to deploy, with no levers or springs to fumble with, these sights position apertures at exact factory height.

A push of a button folds the sights securely out of the way until you need them again (they fold to a profile of just 0.460). Troy BattleSights feature a zero-canting attachment system for use on all military and aftermarket receivers.

The Knight’s Armament Company SR-15 line represents the pinnacle of firearms based upon the Eugene Stoner designed operating system. The Mod 2’s 16” chrome lined, 5.56mm NATO barrel is manufactured to military specifications, and features a proprietary mid-length gas system that increases reliability and durability while also reducing felt recoil. An improved E3 round-lug bolt design both enhances function and increases bolt life far beyond the industry standard. An ambidextrous bolt release, selector, and magazine release offer left-handed users the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15-based controls, as well as giving right-handed users alternative methods of manipulation to increase efficiency of movement. The drop-in two-stage trigger serves double duty as an aid to long range precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range. The Mod 2 update introduces several notable features to the SR15 IWS line: a URX4 handguard with Keymod accessory mounting points for-ancillary device attachments increases cooling characteristics and reduces weight and bulk compared with standard 1913 rail attachment methods. A Mod 2 gas system with a proprietary design minimizes leakage and ensures more consistent operation in harsh conditions. A gas block secured with a locking ring instead of taper pins increases barrel rigidity and eliminates the need to custom fit the gas block to the barrel. Included parts and features, such as the two-sided receiver end plate QD sling swivel mounting point, collapsible six-position SOPMOD stock, hybrid ambidextrous selector lever, and folding 200-600 meter sights, round out the package to deliver a cutting-edge carbine right out of the case.

Helps to mitigate recoil and control firearm
All mounting hardware included
Made in the U.S.A.


The AFG-2 from Magpul is a slim line design that is shorter in overall length and width compared to the original AFG. Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.



Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG-2 (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG-2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots."
