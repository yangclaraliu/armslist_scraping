It provides the color and figure of Claro, but with a strong, dense grain that takes carving and checkering well.

The forearm is 18 inches long and 2 1/2 inches at the narrow end and 3 1/2 inches on the wide end and two inches thick. It's large enough for two matching forearms if you have a two barrel set.

This is a rare piece of wood at a very fair price and will make an outstanding
stock with lots of WOW! factor."

 KNIFE FEATURES:
•Fixed-Blade - There are no surprises with a fixed-blade. Simply put, a fixed-blade is a solid piece of steel, anchored to the handle without any folding mechanisms. It’s durable and holds up well against the elements. So it’s ideal for tough jobs like field dressing and camping chores. This is a knife you can trust.
•Drop-Point - This blade has a gentle, sloping convex curve to the point versus the concave curve of the clip blade. Being thicker, this blade point is stronger for heavier tasks. It stands up to abuse well, but isn’t as effective for easy penetration.
•S30V - This is the absolute best blade steel available and it's made in America. S30V contains carbon as well as high amounts of chromium, molybdenum and vanadium. Double-tempered – it can be hardened to a Rockwell hardness of RC 59.5-61.
•Wood - Beautifully grained natural woods. These woods are treated with an environmentally sound resin to protect their natural beauty.
•Thick Leather Sheath

NOTE: THIS WAS ONE OF THE LAST EVER CUSTOM ALPHA HUNTERS MADE BY BUCK KNIVES. I HAVE OWNED OTHER CKS ALPHA HUNTERS BEFORE BUT THIS ONE BY FAR IS THE BEST LOOKING AND DURABLE ONE IN S30V STEEL. THIS IS THE BEST SHAPED HUNTING KNIFE EVER DEVELOPED AND THE ALPHA HUNTERS ARE PERFECTLY FUNCTIONAL AND FIELD DRESS LARGE GAME BETTER THAN ANY OTHER KNIFE AVAILABLE."

Offering true 2 eyes open shooting, a transversly mounted lithium 123 battery, and 7 mm raised base offering iron sight access, the new Extreme-XPS (EXPS) features easy to adjust side buttons and an adjustable, locking, quick detach lever for easy attachment and removal.

-Single transverse 123 battery to reduce sight length
-Shortened base only requires at most 2 3/4 inch of rail space compared to the 4 inch N battery sights
-Battery cap and latch are eliminated and replaced with a simple O-ring, tethered cap; better sealing is achieved
-Battery compartment is now separated from the base to allow it to hover over the delta ring of the rifle
-Average battery life at brightness level 12 is roughly 500-600 hours, 3X battery life of N cell sights

Asking $620, cash in person or PayPal Gift with actual shipping.  Will consider trade for new Aimpoint T1.

I have never received a single call or email from a client that said the ATF rejected their NFA Trust or their Forms prepared by me. I will walk you through every step of the process and answer all your questions so that this unnecessarily complex process is easy and painless.

What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property.

As a Texas lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!

This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.

Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.


What the Trust includes:

- The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (14 pages)
- Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms)
- Appointment of Trustee (1 Page)
- Trustee resignation (1 Page)

I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.

Call anytime. Free consultation: ***Attention: Due to the announcement from the White House that they are actively pursuing to close the ""loophole"" and possibly end the benefits of a Trust (the privacy, the security, and even requiring the beneficiaries to obtain fingerprints, background checks, and CLEO approval) though it is speculative, I believe time is of the essence and if you have been thinking about a Trust, please do not wait to contact my office for information***"

Call anytime. Free consultation: ***Attention: Due to the announcement from the White House that they are actively pursuing to close the ""loophole"" and possibly end the benefits of a Trust (the privacy, the security, and even requiring the beneficiaries to obtain fingerprints, background checks, and CLEO approval) though it is speculative, I believe time is of the essence and if you have been thinking about a Trust, please do not wait to contact my office for information***"

I love it but I am scheduled to go Active Duty in the Air Force soon and would rather have the money for when I move to my base. The gun has less that 400 rounds through it. The xi model is the multi caliber convertible version of the Sig 556. It has ambi charging handle and safety, and a polymer for-end. Barrel is a 16 inch 1/7 twist, chambered in 556. Has the Adjustable Gas Piston for normal, adverse and suppressed.  I have seven mags, 6 are P Mags. It has original flip up irons as well as a set of canted iron sights and single point harness. Comes with original folding side stock as well as a double diamonds stock adapter with a magpul CTR installed (Setup cost me $175.00). Have all original packaging. I also have a nice case and two different optics I would be willing to part with for extra money. These rifles are very difficult to come by, in October there was a 6 month waiting period for availability from Sig, it was luck that I found it in a small town gun shop in Southern Missouri and that was why I bought it.

Cabela's offered $960 for it and they told me they only pay 60% of their value. That gives this a value of $1600 - which they would probably put for sale at $1700+. A quick search online shows nice condition ones sell for$1600-$2200. I don't have a license to ship so I wanted to sell to someone locally private party.

This was manufactured in 1942 so it's right in the heart of WWII - very rare in this condition. Barrel has perfect rifling, and shows almost zero wear around the muzzle. Careful when comparing to others as in 80% or less they are only worth about $400-$500

All metal has nearly perfect bluing, all wood is in beautiful condition. Original Winchester bakelite buttplate.

This is collector quality - check out this one at Cabelas for $1399 and its not nearly as nice as the one I have listed!

Its superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and astonishing capacity combine to put more into a concealable pistol than you will find anywhere else.

The XD® 3″ Sub-Compact has all the same features found in the standard XD® line, but in a smaller package. The barrel is 3” and the frame is a short, compact size that will let the pistol nearly disappear when you carry it. Like other XD® pistols, the XD® 3” Sub-Compact gives you great versatility when it’s used with X-Tension™ magazines. Enjoy 13+1 rounds of 9mm with standard flush-fitting magazines. Or throw in an X-Tension™ magazine and enjoy the feel of a full size frame and 16+1 rounds of 9mm. You’ll find everything on the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that make Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that you’re used to with every other XD®.

If you’re looking for a concealable pistol, but don’t want to sacrifice capacity, reach for an XD® 3” Sub-Compact. It’s an excellent choice for concealed carry, and it is equally in its element at the range.

I have 3 - 13 round flush clips and 2 - 16 round extended clips also this gun has only been used for the 30 rounds that were needed to pass the conceal carry class and that's it. I also modified the sights to the Tru-Glo sights on it for night time visibility worth $150 installed. The gun came with 2 clips and I got 3 extra clips worth about $100.
