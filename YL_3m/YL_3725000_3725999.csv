I picked this up last year, and it had a couple of spots of pitting on the trigger guard, and a holster mark on the barrel. Refinishing in factory blue would still show the pitting, do I decided to have it bead blasted and Cerrokote it instead.  I'm quite pleased with the result, an all weather Big Bore hunter.   There's not a mark on it - and with the cerrokoting, there probably won't ever be either.

It Includes both the standard wood grips and the rare, hard to find, Pachmeyr rubber grips that sell used on eBay for $75 to $100 a set. Also included is a new in box set of Redfield scope mounts and a small box of Hornady ammunition. (gun has NOT been drilled for the scope mount.) Good shooting gun that is heavy enough that 44 magnum rounds have reasonable recoil and 44 specials have recoil no worse than a 9mm.It just doesn't get shot much due to me having several other pistols, including another 44 magnum.

XD-S® Single Stack Series

Can a pistol small enough to carry every day have all the features, performance and power you would find in a full size handgun? Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?

The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.

The XD-S® is the first and only single-stack XD® from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 or 4.0 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it, and pretty soon you’ll forget it’s even there.

The XD-S® Single Stack consistently astonishes and delights shooters on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The trigger on the XD-S® Single Stack feels more like it belongs on a target pistol than a carry piece. Shooters who are used to difficult, heavy triggers on deep concealment pistols will be astounded at the smooth, crisp XD-S® Single Stack trigger.

Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™."

I have an H&K USP 40 for sale or trade.

Pistol has 900 flawless rounds through it. Comes with original case & manual plus extra mags - 4 mags total.

Will also come with many hundred of range brass and two boxes of Magtech 180 FMJ.

As far as possible trades, I'd be interested in the following:
H&K 9mm's?
Ruger SR9 or SR9c + cash on your end.
CZ 75 or 85 + cash on your end.
Ruger SR 1911 CMD

or possible other 9mm pistol with slimmer grips. So, not glock or sig. 

I am will to listen to trade offers other than what I have listed, worst I can say is no thanks. Really interested in a 9mm with slim grip for the wifey. My USP 40 is a bit much for her smaller hands.

Also willing to sell this pistol for 600, which, with extra mags & ammo & brass, is a pretty darn good deal IMHO.

Feel free to email, text or  call with any questions.

The GLOCK 19 is ideal for versatile use through reduced dimensions compared with the standard pistol size. With the proven caliber of 9x19, it has found worldwide distribution in security services. In addition to being used as a conventional service weapon, it is suitable for concealed carry or as a backup weapon.

This optic features a 7mm raised base for better iron sight access, and an adjustable quick-detach lever for easy and repeatable attachment and removal. The more compact design only requires 2.75"" of rail space!

The compact design used by the XPS and EXPS models was created by separating the battery compartment from the base and mounting it transversely. This not only dramatically decreases the over-all size of the optic, but allows the battery compartment to easily clear the delta ring on M4/M16 platform carbines and rifles.

The A65/1 2-Dot reticle features a 65MOA circle for fast target acquisition in CQB scenarios with (2) 1MOA aiming dots (1 center, 1 ranging).

Transmission holography allows for a parallax free optic with unlimited eye relief
Highly versatile reticle allows for fast CQC work and precise fire out to medium ranges.

The only issue, as you can see in the pictures, is a nick in the mag release. This in no way impacts functionality, just something I'd like to blame the wife for... but I did it. The gun has performed flawlessly what little it has been shot. 108 rounds to be exact.
