The previous owner had done extensive cleaning to it, and broke off the top screw that holds the flint, as it was not by the looks of it the one that belonged in there. I have the top jaw. The lock functions fine, strong main spring, half cock works good. Barrel was honed by the guy as well, and it looks alright but there is rust in there as I have not done any cleaning of it in several years. I can do a thorough cleaning of it if some one wants to know the true condition. Outside is pitted.There is a Allen head screw holding the frizzen on. Barrel length right now is 37 1/2 inches total. total length of the musket overall is 52 1/2 inches. Barrel is marked with JS or partial US and GF P. Lock is stamped small abbreviated Philadelphia, all else is obscured. There is no date on the barrel as is common with these muskets. 
I think this musket could, with a little work be a decent hunting gun with a bit of history to it. Asking $275 plus shipping. If you need more pictures you can email me directly at REDACTED"

I wanted a folding gun that would fit in a gym bag that I could keep in the car without having to go through the hassle of filing an SBR. 

This PAP has the M4 adapter so that it can use normal AK magazines with no problems, and it puts the mag release in the familiar place for AR users. It has a Midwest Industries rail made especially for this gun that is a rock solid mounting surface. I did not like the AK brace, and I wanted it to fold so I got a US Machine Gun Folding Stock adapter for AK's and fitted an Sig Brace to it. This is a great folding system, and is all metal and very solid.  It also has a Tapco double hook trigger and trigger retaining place so a nice smooth pull and no trigger slap.  To top it off it has a Hogue grip and a Krinkov style flash suppressor.

This gun shoots great, eats anything and is a ton of fun. Most everyone at the range things it is an SBR Krink clone. It has about 200 rounds through it so far. If you built it yourself, you would be in for about 1k, so I think I am asking a fair price. F2F with VA resident non-felons only. Will meet within about 45-60 minutes of Charlottesville.

At first glance you would think that the Colt 901 is just a .308 Win./7.62 NATO version of a standard AR-15, much like any other .308 AR out there, but it is a lot more than that. The Colt LE901-16S is a “Modular Carbine,” which means it can be adapted to any AR-15 platform upper. This isn’t a new concept, because there are of course a whole bunch of different caliber uppers for ARs. The difference is in all the other ones, they have adapted a standard size AR magazine to boutique calibers and cartridge designs. The Colt 901 is different. It can be adapted from .308/7.62, using standard P-Mags, to .223/5.56, using standard AR mags, and back again, in literally seconds. The design uses one proprietary part, and you have to swap out the recoil system. It is that simple, and it works fantastic.

Exceptional accuracy is assured by its full floated, 16.1” chrome lined barrel and one-piece monolithic upper receiver, suitable for mounting your optic of choice. The fact that most of the operating controls are ambidextrous, including the magazine release and bolt catch makes for versatility and ease of use. You can depend on the new Colt LE901-16S to take the shot of your lifetime!

With the exception of an ambidextrous manual safety and rubber grips, the stainless version is functionally identical to the CZ 75 B. The only difference is an improvement in corrosion resistance, though many will argue that there is an improvement in appearance as well. CZ 75 B is used by more governments, militaries, police and security agencies than any other pistol in the world. The CZ 75 is quite possibly the perfect pistol. • All steel construction • High capacity double column magazines • Hammer forged barrels • Ergonomic grip and controls • Unparallel accuracy • Slide-in-frame design for better recoil control • 3 dot sighting system • Smooth double action and crisp single action • Extended service life due to advanced design and superior materials • Firing pin block safety Designed in 1975, the CZ 75 is the flagship model of the CZ handgun line with over one million produced. An entire family of pistols is available based on the basic CZ 75 design: compacts, decockers, single action only, ambidextrous, alloy frames as well as competition pistols.

This rifle has only had 80 rounds down the pipe and comes with a 50 round and 30 round magazine. I have also attached and sighted in a Simmons Red Dot sight for the rifle and will include 120 rounds with the weapon. The 5.7x28mm round is extremely light recoiling and very fun to shoot and the rifle is completely ambidextrous. Both the charging handle and safety is available from either side and the cases eject from straight down. The Federal ammo for this rifle only costs $23 for a box of 50, so it costs about the same as a .45 acp pistol to shoot. The gun itself is a dream to shoot as it can easily stay on target for all 50 rounds with minimal adjustment since it recoils like a 22lr. Standing and firing rapidly (2-3 shots per second) at 25 yards you can easily make a grouping of less than 2 inches. The trigger also suffers from none of the common bullpup issues and gives most other triggers a run for their money. All original papers, box, and lock will come with this rifle as well. The weapon also breaks down in less than a minute and is very easy to clean and maintain. I can be reached by the contact seller button or by text (preferred) or phone at REDACTED.

Are you looking to build an SBR? Maybe you're purchasing your first suppressor? A gun trust offers you a great deal of convenience when you own these items.

Hanna Law P.C. is a different kind of law firm, specializing in firearms trusts. We do not operate on a normal business week schedule, but can accommodate your needs on your schedule. We are available during the day and in the evening as well as weekends.

We understand that buying an NFA item can be a lengthy process, so we strive to offer great service with a short turnaround.

We offer two levels of trust:
Basic Gun Trust $225 - fast and easy, convenient for those who do not wish to speak at great lengths with the attorney. If you e-mail your info and give us a call, everything can be handled in person very quickly. Notary services provided at time of delivery.

Comprehensive Gun Trust $500 - Also fast, however, the attorney will meet with you and discuss all the provisions of the trust. If you do not like specific provisions, need clarification on certain provisions, or would like to add or remove provisions, this is the level for you. Generally it takes 1.5-2 hours of face time with the attorney to go over the entire document. Notary services provided during meeting. This is a good option for those who are unfamiliar with firearms trusts, and demand extensive clarification. Some people are a bit nervous when starting their NFA item collection, and face-time with an informed attorney can put some of these concerns to rest.

For various reasons, you may wish to also put your Title I (regular) firearms into your trust as well. We also offer this service.

We wish you the best on your journey into the land of SBR's, AOW's, SBS's, and suppressors. They can be great home defense weapons, and sure are a whole lot of fun to shoot at the range. We hope to hear from you soon. Feel free to call at 720-568-0564. Leave us a voicemail with your number and a good time to return your call, and we will get back to you promptly.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

If your unfamiliar, bump keys are a simple, effective, low cost, and easy to learn way to open locks you do not have the keys for.

There is SO much emphasis on I-594, but there is NO discussion on I-591. WHY? 594 is an obvious attempt to violate the 2nd amendment by infringing on our rights to obtain or even transfer firearms. The bill is totally ludicrous. But I-591 is a Trojan horse. IT does prevent the confiscation of guns without due process, but the second part opens us to onslaught by Mike Bloomberg & Co. The second part of 591 no background checks can be required of recipients “UNLESS A UNIFORM NATIONAL STANDARD IS REQUIRED.” It does not specify which entity would be the responsible for enacting such a standard. It's possible that any organization can develop and enact a standard and we would be required by voter approval of I-591 to submit to background checks in order to be a recipient of a gun. Any org., such as ATF, EPA, DOE, AMA, FDA, IRS, can enact a standard and we would have by default, voted FOR the background check. UNACCEPTABLE. This initiative has a great first half, but an unacceptable second half. We must get the discussion going on I-591 ASAP. IT has the capability to be as detrimental to our 2nd amendment rights as I-594. And don’t fool yourselves that it won’t happen. If 591 gets approved, the Bloomberg & Co. will stop at nothing to get a standard enacted, and we would be STUCK with it, BASED ON OUR OWN VOTING ACTIONS! Please, get the conversations going on this. It’s not too late. The sample ballot is available on County Auditor's sites. They have been sent to the military. Get the word to them. And get the discussion going on 591. IT is a Trojan horse that will have the background-demanding army swarming all over our state."

I had to list it under the rifle category because you cant pick 308 under the pistol category. It is in excellent condition, has barely ever been shot, and everything is working properly. The ejector even shoots the empty (or loaded if you dont shoot a round you loaded) case a couple feet into the air, which seems to be the most common thing that doesnt work. Im trading it because I dont hunt and I mainly just shoot pistols at the range, at short distances. This gun is very uncommon. It comes with a $300 bushnell elite 3200 2-6x pistol scope. This thing is a tack driver. The amazing brake on it makes the recoil similar to shooting a 45acp, which is barely believable since this is a 308 in a pistol."

Age-appropriate Weaver K4 Model 60-B (Steel-tube made in El Paso TX) 4 power scope with crosshair reticle. Weaver base and rings. Two clips. This is a classic Vermont deer rifle. I shot thirty rounds through it over last weekend at the range. Very sweet trigger, unlike many semiautos. It shoots 2 1/2"" groups at 100 yards with 150gr bullets. That's not bad for a 4x scope and my old eyes! The wood rates 7.5 to 8 on a 10-point grading scale. Over the years someone must have cleaned the receiver and barrel with too harsh a cleaner, because it has lost almost all of its bluing. Great candidate for a DuraCoat or Cerakote refinish.

This is one of those that has as many good things as bad things.
It has a quiet, non smoking LT1
SUPER HIGH MILEAGE  336K, BUT, it runs strong, engine is quiet, doesn't smoke.
But, it idles rough.  It starts easily, shifts great, accelerates great, but it idles rough and low. Sometimes it stalls at an idle. Usually it starts right back up, except ONCE, it didn't want to restart, just cranked. About 5 minutes later it fired right up.  I don't want to mess with it.
 Has headers, MSD distributor
Interior is in nice shape, gauges work, power everything works BUT the front passenger window and rear drivers window go down crooked.  Needs wipers BUT new wipers come with it. 
 Heat works but AC doesn't.  The car looks great from a distance but up close you can see the chips and scratches, the cracks in the bumper, the places on the quarters where emblems used to be, worn out window tint. BUT, there are no dents, the glass and lights are all good and there is MINIMAL rust, and the bumpers are fiberglass and the cracks would be easy to repair.  there's a little rust at the bottom of the quarter panels and some bubbles in the passenger side wheel arch.  There is a crack in the tail gate.
 There is a squeak from the front left brake and occasionally the ABS light comes on.  No other trouble lights are on.
  Has a non gm reproduction impala ss grille as well as the original chrome caprice grille.  Back glass struts hold the glass  open, hood struts do NOT hold the hood open.  Aftermarket electric sunroof, looks like its supposed to be there. Doesn't leak.
Lots of work, but Lots of potential.  Doesn't idle well but it runs and drives strong.  
Could be a great car, comfortable, the power is nice, but I'm just not feeling it.
Would consider trades or partial trades"

The original, award-winning Zero Tolerance 0777 is a very limited-run knife.  Yet interest in it is high among blade aficionados. That's why Zero Tolerance is happy to announce a new version of that award-winning knife—one that will be much more generally available. The 0770CF-M390 offers the style and performance of the award-winning 0777, but in a slightly smaller, streamlined version.

For ZT performance, the blade is M390 stainless steel, which provides the ability to take a razor edge, excellent edge retention, strength, and toughness. A stonewashed finish on the blade hides hard-use scratches and makes maintenance easier. The sweeping lines of the original 0777 are preserved in the lightweight carbon-fiber handle that fits securely in the hand. An inset liner lock secures the blade.

The 0770CF-M390 opens quickly and easily thanks to SpeedSafe® assisted opening and the built-in flipper. Includes deep-carry pocketclip. For a final touch of class, ZT adds a handsome oversized pivot."

From Daniel Defense website on their barrels:


Daniel Defense is a leading manufacturer of barrels for the AR15/M4 platform. Daniel Defense currently offers barrels that are manufactured by either a button swage process or cold hammer forged. These processes are both very precise but very different all at the same time. All Daniel Defense barrels are HP and MPI tested, chrome lined, and heavy phosphate coated. Barrels chambered in 5.56mm have a threaded muzzle with 1/2x28 TPI while 6.8 SPC Barrels have a threaded muzzle with 5/8x24 TPI.

Daniel Defense has been constantly evolving the barrel identification markings, or Roll Marks, on these barrel to make them easier to identify. Below you will find a list and images of the roll marks that identify our button swage barrels and cold hammer forged barrels.

	The original, award-winning Zero Tolerance 0777 was a very limited-run knife. Yet interest in it is high among blade aficionados. That's why Zero Tolerance is happy to announce a newer version of that award-winning knife-one that will be much more generally available. The 0770CF offers the style and performance of the award-winning 0777, but in a slightly smaller, streamlined version. For ZT performance, the blade is ELMAX powdered steel, which provides the ability to take a razor edge, excellent edge retention, strength and toughness. A stonewashed finish on the blade hides hard-use scratches and makes maintenance easier. The sweeping lines of the original 0777 are preserved in the lightweight carbon-fiber handle that fits securely in the hand. An inset liner lock secures the blade. The 0770CF opens quickly and easily thanks to SpeedSafe assisted opening and the built-in flipper. Includes deep-carry pocketclip. For a final touch of class, ZT adds a handsome oversized pivot. Made in the USA. Assisted opening; Inset liner lock; Reversible deep-carry clip (left/right); Steel: ELMAX, stonewashed finish; Handle: Carbon fiber; Blade Length: 3.25 in. (8.3 cm); Closed Length: 4.3 in. (10.9 in.); Overall Length: 7.5 in. (19.2 cm); Weight: 3 oz. (85 g)."

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

I have a Remington 742 Woodsmaster semi-auto 30-06 rifle for sale/trade. It has been extremely well taken care of, is in excellent condition, and runs as smooth as butter. Cleaned after every time shooting, then oiled and stored. Even wiped off the wood and blueing after being handled. Yes, I am one of those meticulous people. That's why if I trade, what I get in return needs to be in really good shape too. 

It comes with two scopes: a cheap but good Barksa 3x9x40 that came on it when I bought it and a very nice Bushell 3x9x40 with finger click adjustments and glass in par with a Leupold VX2. This is one of those bushnells that was made and sold on browning combos a while back. The scope is like new.
It also comes with a very nice padded leather sling, see through scope mounts that allow for use of the premium white accent iron sights, a stock shell holder, and a box of Winchester Silvertip Ballistic tip ammo.

The lock functions fine, strong main spring, half cock works good. Barrel was honed by the guy as well, and it looks alright but there is rust in there as I have not done any cleaning of it in several years. I can do a thorough cleaning of it if some one wants to know the true condition. Outside is pitted.There is a Allen head screw holding the frizzen on.

For sale is a 6 digit ""Ghost SKS"".  I didn't make up the term ""ghost sks"" but if you want to learn more about them then it is a handy term to use as a search tool.  The term is dubbed for the earliest Chinese SKS rifles before any distinguishing markings were put on the Chinese SKS's.  From what I've read the ""ghost SKS"" was produced in 1956.  This has all numbers matching including the stock.  Would make a great collectable, shooter, or project gun.  Has a like new mirror bore.  I have already cleaned all the cosmoline off and fired it.  It functioned perfectly with the cheap wolf ammo that I have.  
I have a ton of pictures from before and after I cleaned it.  This is a real military SKS, not a commercial rifle.  This was produced by China during the years of increasing tension in Vietnam before America became formally involved in the Vietnam War.  These were some of the first SKS's China produced for its military.
