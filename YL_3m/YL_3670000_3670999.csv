The only reason that I’m selling it, is because I need funds to get a carry pistol and pay some bills.  I bought this gun in December of 2012 just before the gun panic started, and I’m of the opinion that the ARs Bushmaster was selling before the panic had slightly better finishes than the ones that were produced during and afterwards. I estimate that there have only been 600 or so rounds put through the rifle, and in that time (no exaggeration) I have not had even one jam or malfunction.  The upgraded parts on the rifle include:

1. aluminum Magpul trigger guard.  (That was a pain to drive the roll pins into, and the only bit of cosmetic damage on the firearm is a scratch near the trigger guard for that reason.)
2. Diamondhead VRS rail system
3. Magpul AFG 2
4. Magpul Miad Grip
5. BMC Gunfighter charging handle 
6. Magpul MS3 sling
7. Magpul MBUS front and rear sights

I will also include the Bushmaster brand 30 round aluminum magazine.

Brand new, the XM-15 ORC costs ~750 (plus NICS background check fee), and I’m selling mine with the few hundred dollars worth of parts for 850.  If you want to purchase it, I will need you to provide a valid OR drivers license or CHL, affirmation that you may legally own the rifle, and fill out a bill of sale.  Cash only and I am not interested in trades, no lowballs please.  

If interested or have questions please text me at REDACTED and ask for A.J.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truly unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish.

Barrel:  A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 6.8 SPCII, with a 1/11 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a Mid-length gas system.   Lighter profile barrel has an A2 profile under the handguards and just enough material removed after the FSB.  Barrel is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected, and finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and a an A2 flash hider.  The 14.7"" barrel allows for an A2 length flash hider to be permanently pinned to bring the barrel to minimum legal length, instead of more expensive, extra long length flash hiders. The flash hider is pinned and welded.
Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer.
Bolt Carrier Group: For AR15 and M16 rifles and carbines.  Made by a mil-spec contractor, these feature a Carpenter 158 Bolt, and a full profile chrome lined carrier. Bolt is made of shot-peened, Mil-spec Carpenter 158® steel. Gas key is secured with grade 8 fasteners and staked. Bolt carrier is parkerized outside and chrome lined inside.

Trijicon RMR
Developed to improve precision and accuracy with any style or caliber of weapon, the Trijicon RMR (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) is designed to be as durable as the legendary ACOG. The RM06 is an LED sight powered by a standard CR2032 battery. Housed in rugged forged aluminum, the RMR is extremely tough yet lightweight. New easy-to-use adjusters with audible clicks allow for quick windage and elevation adjustments. 

With eight available brightness settings, the reticle can be manually adjusted by pressing the plus or minus buttons on either side of the unit. To switch to auto adjust mode simply press both buttons simultaneously and release. To save battery life turn the optic off by pressing both buttons simultaneously and holding for 3 seconds.

The Trijicon RMR is tougher than any alternative and suitable for military, law enforcement and hunting applications.

Included with the CZ is a hard carry case, two 18 round magazines, lock, cleaning brush, and all factory literature. 

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

The camo is factory, you can check out DPMS's website and check it out for yourself.

The way I have this gun priced is the bare bones gun, and 1 DPMS metal factory magazine, the scope (Burris Fullfield II 3x9 ballistic plex) and a Magpul MS3 sling. I can adjust the price by taking things off, I got other mags I can throw in as well.

How accurate is it? Im shooting quarters at 100 yards, so its pretty decent. I have a few targets that I kept to prove it.

Now how was the gun treated? I did a barrel break in procedure on the gun. I'm a slow shooter, I believe in practicing the cold bore shot, because that is the only shot that matters, the first 1. I maybe ran 20 rounds a day through it everytime I went to the range. Probably about 300 rounds through it over the course of 2 years. I've shot everything through this gun, and it has NEVER jammed.

Why am I selling it? I love Savage model 99's. I want to sell this one and add onto my savage collection. I can't own every gun ever made, so I might as well just get rid of what I'm not using.

If you have any question or want to see the gun, feel free to e-mail me, or call / text Mike at 920 217 9712. If I don't answer your call, leave a message and Ill get back to you as soon as I can. I work odd hours and often time loose service going out into the woods. I travel to Green Bay for work during the week, and all over the place up north on weekends, so if you would like I might be able to bring the gun to you.

Thanks for looking!

I'd like to trade it for a Ruger LC9s (NOT interested in a standard LC9) or SR9c/SR40c, M&P Shield 9/40 , or possibly similar 9mm pocket sized guns. Would also be interested in a Glock 42, but that's the only .380 I would consider. No Kel Tecs or Tauruses please, and not interested in rifles or shotguns, if the right deal doesn't come along I'll keep it.
For the right deal or ammo I can include 50 rounds of 158 grn hollow point .38 special.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

Thanks!"

I've replaced the stock slide release with an enhanced slide release for easier reloads. The pistol comes with 3 magazines total, one of which has an arrendando magazine extension (+6). The raven concealment holster was built for the glock 17, but can accommodate a glock 22 and 31. Also note, the holster was fabricated around a Surefire X300 Ultra weapon light, the holster will also hold a weapon with an X300 attached to it. The holster comes with standard outside the waist band belt loops along with a set of inside the waist band loops for concealment purposes. A Uncle Mike's retention holster will also come in the package.The original slide stop and magazine floor plate will be included if you decide you would like to change the pistol and magazine back to their original state. An extra magazine spring and arrendando magazine release clamp also come with the package, as I have no use for these parts without the glock itself. The Arrendando magazine extension was $38 from the glock store, the extended slide release was $15 from a local gun shop, the Raven Concealment holster was $100 from RCS.com, and the glock itself was $550 from a local gun shop. I'm not trying to compensate for all the parts, but I will tell you that $500 is a very fair price for the entire package WHICH I WILL NOT SEPARATE!!!! Also, no trades, jut cash.If you have an offer that you'd like to discuss, feel free to email me via this website."

This is a very unique and uncommon caliber for a bolt action rifle, yet it provides for some of the most inexpensive centerfire shooting a person can do. The quality of the workmanship is top notch and beautifully done! The mini mauser action is smooth and locks up tight. The monte carlo stock has a nice smooth finish and the rubber recoil is nice and thick. Internal magazine capacity is 5 rounds. Below is more information about the rifle copied from the Zastava website. 

Sporting rifle M85 is based on traditional concept of locking system that Zastava uses for bolt-action rifles. Mini MAUSER is commonly accepted name for sporting rifles that use lower energy ammunition, but which kept fundamental principles of operation of army rifle from 1898. Zastava is a pioneer in forming of this concept; by constantly addressing the aesthetical and ergonomics requests of the customers, Zastava constantly dictates the trends in development and marketing.

-Barrel is made of chrome-vanadium steel, by cold forging. During several decades of being used, this rifle kept primacy in steady accuracy and durability of the barrel, so the method used for the production of barrels is justified, although it demands robust special equipment with long manufacturing process.
-Stock is made of high-quality selected walnut. The user can choose between two types of stock:  Pig Back and Monte Carlo. Recoil pad is made of rubber, and grip cap is made of walnut.
-Sporting rifle LK M85 is a safe gun; trigger mechanism is blocked by a lever-type safety. 
-Metal swivels provide secure assembly of the sling.
-Receiver of the sorting rifle has threads for connection with optical devices bases (which are mounted optionally).
-Sporting rifle has iron sights.
-Standard finish of metal parts is blue, while the wooden parts are oiled and polished.

Not in collectors condition at all hence the unbeatable price. Perfect condition guns are selling on gunbroker and other sites for 1300-2000. Im asking 750 as this has a few dents and dings nothing major but enough to give you a great deal. Sad to let this one go as it's one of the most asked for firearms my friends ask me to bring when we go to the range. Need the cash for an unexpected trip to New Jersey I have to make soon. Great pistol great piece of American history. It was refurbished before WW2 but still has the original property stamped barrel making it a little more unique than most of the refurbished models. I have some left over rounds of 45 I'd throw in a little less than half a box left so you can go strait to the range and try out your new pistol. I am in KC MO a few times a week and in Sedalia on Fridays. Can meet anywhere along US 50 from KC to Sedalia.

My load development showed tight grouping of about 5 rounds .55 moa using 168gr prvi partisan bthp and 40gr Benchmark powder and CCI primers.  I didnt notice any appreciable difference between hornady and lake city brass. when validating my load.  I honestly expect that if I changed to Varget I could probably drop my groupings down to .45 to .40 moa.  Some of the difficulty is with the shooter (me) as I am still learning to be a more consistent rifleman.

I am selling this as I have decided that the 308 round isnt really right for me and am moving to another round.  This rifle is a shooter and the accu-trigger is absolutely amazing.

I am selling everything together for $850.  If purchased separately, the rifle would be $675, and the Scope would be $225."

Civil War era European Pinfire 16 guage double barrel shotgun, Breechloading Pinfire Double Barrel Shotgun made by French manufacturer and inventor LaFauncheux. Stock is cracked in front foregrip although still very firm. Overall still mechanically sound. Aquired from a family member of a former WW1 Veteran who later became a U.S. Secret Police Intelligence Officer for the U.S. Army who spent time over in France durring World War One. Other than the stock being cracked at the front foregrip it is in pretty good condition. Please ask any questions before bidding. More pictures available upon request. 

Very Rare PinFire Shotgun is listed in ""Civil War Guns"" by William B. Edwards. The Double Barrels are approximately 30 inches long. Bore is good and should clean up without any problem; overall length of this rare PinFire is approximately 46 inches. This nice gun has lower and upper sling swivels all original, as well as everything else. It has an ""Under Lever"" that pushes to one side for the gun to break-open for loading. As well, it has another ""Under Lever"" when pushed to the side, allows the barrels to be removed from the Stock and Hammer Section. 

((( Lefaucheux developed a copper based shotshell cartridge in 1836 of rolled paper. ))) Inside the base was a common percussion cap at right angles to the line of bore, and entering the cap thru paper and the base was a copper pin which protruded from the side of the shell about a quarter inch. 

((( Lefaucheux devised the break-open shotgun or rifle ))) with a lever extending forward under the forearm beneath the barrels pushed to one side, disengaging the barrel group and permitting it to move down exposing the breech. The side hammers had flat ends that slammed the cartridge pins in, detonating the cap and the charge. The hammers have to be set on half cock before the barrels will open; the fired shells are then extracted by one's fingers. 

Schuyler, Hartley and Graham sold these guns, and were the major supplier to Civil War Troops. Most of these were used in the South, in and around the Louisiana area. Numerous Lefaucheux shotguns were actually made by Lefaucheux in Paris. Operates as it should in half and full cock, both triggers will bring the hammer down with sufficient force. This is a rare one and will enhance any Civil War, or, any collection. 

Lefaucheux with his manufacturing address engraved on the top middle of the barrell was the original inventor of the Pinfire firearms which later developed in todays rim fire ammunition. This was an original made by his shop before many were made by other manufacturers.

Compact Colt - Ideal for Personal Protection
The new Colt .380 Mustang Pocketlite and Mustang XSP are small, lightweight and boast enhanced durability, reliability and accuracy, making either an ideal handgun for personal protection. The precise machining process, use of high quality materials and improvements in design make Colt’s new .380 Mustang Pocketlite and Mustang XSP two of the most consistent and reliable firearms on the market. The stainless steel slide and barrel are CNC machined from solid bar stock for precise tolerances. With loaded magazines, each of these handguns weighs less than one pound. They both measure 5.5 inches long and have a 2.75-inch barrel. The minimal weight and length of these guns, combined with the short single action trigger, grip designs, frame designs and firing pin safety block make these firearms ideal for personal protection.

This is a neat rifle. Single shot, break open double bbl. rifle with a 22 LR Barrel on top and .410 Shotgun bbl on the bottom. Lightweight at just a tad over 6 lbs, it is the perfect truck gun. Great for all kinds of varmints and critters. Great for Home Defense, Hornady makes some great Critical Defense rounds for this caliber and the light recoil makes it ideal for someone smaller. 

Synthetic black stock takes bumps and bruises much better than a wood one. 

Great build quality. 

The recoil from a  410 is very low making this idea for many women or young person 



Comes with the Original Box and the inner plastic bag. (If you care, the orig box is NOT perfect)
