The PPK is a really nice carry option if you're used to the 380 ACP and like the shootability of an all-steel gun. This gun is very new--purchased just last weekend. I have taken it to the range twice this week and shot a total of 200 rounds. I'm just not sure I like it as much as the 32 ACP and will sell it if the offer it right, as there are other firearms I want.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

I bought this gun brand new from 5280 Armory a little over one year ago for the primary purpose of concealed carry. Being new to Sig's I was very impressed with the quality of this firearm, shoots great, feels solid in the hand, and you will be hard pressed to find any plastic on this gun. After carrying it off/on for a year, I have come to the conclusion that it is just too large for me to conceal comfortably with the clothing I wear on a daily basis. I am selling this gun to purchase another Sig, the P938 Scorprion which seems to be a better fit for my concealed carry needs. This gun isn't even broken in yet, I have only put through around 600 rounds to date. Feel free to ask any questions, the pictures should cover every aspect of the gun. Buyer will need to meet at a local dealer to run through a background check and fulfill the personal transfer requirements. Asking $800 OBO.

Serial No. N760xxx.

This shotgun is in very good condition.  The metal / bluing has a few scratches on the receiver and the trigger guard, but overall it is very clean and rust free.  Inside of the barrel is shiny and clean. The walnut stock has minor marks, plus a scratch on the left side of the butt stock and a small dent on the bottom side of the forend. 

My boys thought my 12 gauge kicked to much, so I picked up this 20 gauge used.  I can't say how much it has been shot before I got it.  We didn't hunt with it, just shot cans and pop bottles.   We probably shot it less than 200 rounds.

It is apparently intended more as a field gun, the field shells always cycled perfectly.  The 7/8 oz target loads didn't seem to have enough kick to complete the cycle reliably.

One of them(the M16A1 version) was a Phillipine Army training rifle. You can tell by the traces of blue paint on the front sight. The other is the XM16E1 version with chrome bolt and duckbill type flash hider and correct type safety. These rifles break down like an M16/AR15. Pull the pin,they break in half at the pivot and the bolt/carrier and op rod handle slide out for cleaning. Both have a brand new after market magazine. They are a little tight so they don't drop free yet. Some use and they will. Both rifles function perfectly. They have some scratches and use marks on them for sure. The XM16E1 type model especially,but that makes it look the part.  I want $500.00 firm for both rifles and accessories, OR $275 for each rifle. First buyer gets the manual.

This is the carbine with the collapseable/ foldable stock. Carbine is all steel construction. This is a copy for the world famous uzi. It has all the things that the original uzis have. This is a semi auto carbine with a 16 inch barrel. It has the straight blowback operation and fires from the closed bolt. The overall length is 31.5"" and weighs in at 9 pounds. Its one of the best cqb weapons in my opinion. However, I havent had a chance to shoot it much. To be on the safe side, Ill say that it has less than 100 rounds down range (i know its way less than that). It does have the normal minimal wear marks, nothing serious though. Mostly being moved around in the safe. Its just time to move on with it and let her go to another home where someone can give her the one on one time she needs. It'll come with two 32 round steel mags. I attached a stock photo from tombstone tactical to give the basic idea of it but also have some pics of the one I have. MSRP is at 899 and the sale price from tombstone is 726.28 before tax. Even though shes not hardly used, I know its still a ""used"" gun so ill start the price at 700 and work from there. But no lowballers or your emails will be ignored. Sorry but just dont have the time for that."

NIB.  Never fired, and only handled to check serial number.  Included are 2 5 rd factory mags, and I also have the following 922r parts:  Grip, op rod, puck, trigger, 12 rd SGM mag (used once.  12 rds of 12 ga whoop ass as fast as you can pull the trigger)and flash hider.  

All the extra parts are not installed, your new shotgun is as virgin as when it left the factory.  The extra parts will allow you to legally cut the spot weld on the folding stock keeping it open.  Its a silly Uncle Sam law called 922r.  But then it will look like the picture.  The one in the picture is my keeper, not the one you will get.  I bought my keeper used and love it.  I just used the pictures to show you what your new gun will look like.

The serial number starts with 582XXX. This is the thicker barreled version. 
This Mini 14 comes with 4 Ruger magazines, three 20rd mags and one 30rd mag. 
I installed a custom Trushot-Technologies barrel stabilizer which helps enhance accuracy and eliminate shot stringing. I also installed a front sling stud for bipod mounting or sling. Original front sling mount was removed, but reinstalled for selling. Also included is the picatinny rail shown in the photo, and two sets of Ruger steel scope rings,(1” and 30MM) which can be used with picatinny rail removed. The tuned trigger is amazing! I doubt you will ever find a mini 14 trigger like this one. It has a light but definite first stage, and light crisp second stage, it has a very short take up and reset. In side by side comparison, this trigger is very similar to Geissle SSA-E trigger which really helps with accuracy on the bench and offhand shooting. The action and trigger on this Mini is the absolute smoothest I have ever felt on any Mini 14, and accuracy (with the work done to this rifle) is better than what you can get off the shelf. Group in picture was shot was at 100yds. 
The rifle is used, but only to the extent to test the upgrades. I am confident that the owner of this Mini will not be disappointment.
ALL items mentioned included. NO TRADES PLEASE! CASH ONLY.
This item is for sale ONLY to those who currently are legally allowed to purchase firearms in the state of Oregon. I will want a copy of your currently active ODL for my records and signed bill of sale. If you are not allowed to legally own firearms in the state of Oregon please do not respond to this offer.

Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to its high-velocity caliber offerings, including the hot new 17 Remington Fireball. Plus, the ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation.

The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight."

Bought it new earlier this week, and its only had 50 rounds through it.  These are solid steel CZ75 clones if you aren't familiar with them, uses CZ pattern mags and can be carried cocked and locked or hammer down.  The .40 caliber C-100 is hard to find here in the states and was only released here recently.  Functions well but it didn't work as well for me as I was hoping.

I'd be interested in trading it for a different mid sized .40 or one of the police trade in Glock 22's that have flooded the market lately.  I just bought an engagement ring for my girlfriend so I have no cash to add to a trade, so looking for an even trade only.  Really only interested in .40's and not interested in rifles or shotguns at this time, but I might make an exception for a nice .357 revolver.

597,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3736597,For Trade:  Honady 9mm HAP Bullets 115gr  .355 Diameter,"Conyers, Atlanta, Georgia",Offer,"Listed On: Sunday, January 4, 2015",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"These are excellent bullets for competition shooting and personal defense.  In fact, its the most accurate bullet I ever shot. (see below).

Hornady Action Pistol Bullets (HAP) are engineered with the competitive shooter in mind. Hornady began with a bullet legendary in its accuracy - the Hornady  XTP - and redesigned it as the perfect competition projectile. While the XTP uses folds and a cannelure to aid in expansion and increase terminal performance, expansion is meaningless in competition. So, the folds and cannelure are gone from the HAP bullet. 

 Because jamming can cost a competitive shooter the match, Hornady placed the HAP's pure lead core inside a copper jacket that protects the nose, ensuring smooth feeding. And like the XTP, the core of the HAP bullet is cold swaged from pure lead to give it amazing consistency, balance and stability in flight.

This is a beautiful AR15 built with top notch parts.  It functions perfectly and has only had 30 rounds put through it .  Specs/parts as follows:

Barrel: .223/5.56 spiral fluted 416 stainless steel H Bar 16” match barrel with 1:9 twist rate, .223 Wylde chamber and M4 feed ramps.

Flash suppressor/compensator:  Titan JP Michlek style stainless steel muzzle break and carbine length gas system.  Hardly any barrel lift or kick back.  It stays right on target for your next shot.

Syrac Arms Gen II adjustable gas block .750 diameter.  This is a self locking “notched” adjuster type gas block and the newest one on the market.  No separate detent to hold down, no thread locking sealant required to keep it in position and only one hand needed to adjust it from the front.  It also reduces kick back and keeps you on target for your next shot.  The AR15 platform is known for being overgassed and this allows you to reduce the amount of pressure going to your bolt carrier if you choose to. 

CTS carbon fiber free float fore end/quad rail 9 ½” long

Anderson 7075 lower with colored pictograms and manufacturer highlights as well as an Anderson lower parts kit.

Nickel Teflon treated upper with dust cover door and forward assist.  This is some of the newest technology out for these black rifles.  Per the manufacturer this needs no lube and is good for 40,000 – 50,000 rounds without lubrication.  I lube it anyway…it can’t hurt.  It makes it real easy to clean too compared to anodized uppers.

Nickel boron bolt carrier assembly.  Again…the newest technology parts.  Combined with the nickel Teflon treated upper it is a no lubrication needed assembly if you do not like to deal with lubricants.  Carbon cleans off it easily compared to anodized bolts. 

6 position adjustable stock and one Magpul 30 round windowed magazine included. 
Optics available at extra cost.

Located in Macomb Township near M59 and I94."

I am the second owner. The original owner purchased this new from Noveske and replaced the NSR rail with a tan VTAC Alpha Battle Rail. Original owner claims he put a mag through it to test functionality and I have put approximately 20 rounds through it. The barrel flat out shoots with a red dot, consistently popping 1"" roof cap nails from 50 yards. Everything is factory Noveske except the VTAC rail. Let me know if you want additional pics. Know your laws, this becomes a NFA item when attached to a lower. Also comes with three picatinny rail pieces for the rail which are not shown.  For those who know, this is a steal for a Noveske.  I can send additional pics upon request.

I'm impressed by the functionality of the open sights, this rifle is excellent for quick target acquisition making it a nice brush hunter and 30-30 alternative.

This rifle was purchased used but only lightly as shown in the pictures.

I am needing to finance another purchase so this one needs to go.  I purchased this new from a local firearms dealer and I have never shot it.  It has one modification which is the Magpul enhanced trigger guard (the good aluminum one - not the cheap polymer one).  You can see this in attached pics.   Model is 90391 (XM15-E2S) ORC Carbine with Telestock (6 position collapsible stock.)  It is the 16 inch barrel Optics Ready Carbine (it has metal upper and lower receivers - not the cheaper composite material).  It has the M4 profile barrel and the chamber and bore are chrome lined.  It has the A2 birdcage suppressor.  This will fire .223 and 5.56 ammo.

It comes with the factory magazine and a sling with the original box.  I am also throwing in 3 - 30 round mags and 100 rounds of ammo.  Remember, since this will be a private sale, you don't have to pay tax on this - that will save you around $50.

Thanks,

Require signed bill of sale, copy of DL and CCW.  May be interested in trades in my favor.

The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

I am the original owner; the rifle was purchased brand new several months ago and has had only 216 rounds through it since new. The rifle is in excellent condition with no visible detractions. This rifle has the NM walnut stock with the 22"" parkerized carbon steel barrel.

The National Match incorporates an array of upgrades from Springfield Armory to insure this rifle will outshoot any standard M1A. Those upgrades include the NM medium weight barrel, the NM walnut stock which has been epoxy bedded to the barreled action, NM trigger group (measured at 4.5lbs), NM full hooded rear sight, NM front sight, as well as the NM gas system (unitized). This particular rifle shoots Federal Gold Medal Match very well and I am sure the avid reloader could develop a load to shoot even better. The rifle has always been  meticulously maintained with the proper care given (using a bore guide and chamber port). The rifle did wear a scope mount previously which mandated the removal of the stripper clip guide; the stripper clip guide has been reinstalled however the roll pin securing it in place has not been installed due to the next owners potential desire to remove it (if a scope mount is again desired). If the next owner chooses to remove the stripper clip guide all that is needed is a soft-tipped hammer to tap it out. 

Included with the rifle is the original hard case, all original paperwork, and (1) 10 round magazine."
