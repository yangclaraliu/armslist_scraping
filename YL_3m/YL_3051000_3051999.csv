The world's first truly dual field of view combat optical sight that combines the best of close and precision fire ranged combat features. The SpecterDR switches instantly from 4x magnified sight to a 1x CQB sight at the throw of a lever. Unlike zoom sights, the SpecterDR offers an optimized optical path and identical eye relief in both 4x and 1x modes. Depending on the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the entire crosshair or just a 1.5 MOA dot in the center. In 1x mode, the SpecterDR has an extremely large field of view. In 4x mode the SpecterDR offers a generous field of view, long eye relief, and ELCAN's legendary crystal clear image. Situational awareness in both magnifications is improved with ultra-wide viewing angles and unmatched viewing in low light conditions. The SpecterDR has half the weight and twice the capability of carrying two scopes, without compromise to mission effectiveness or reliability. The SpecterDR from ELCAN offers the best single solution for both CQB and long range engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use."

A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery. The Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic's front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on AR15/M16/M4 Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machine guns. The QRP2 mount for the PRO Optic also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the PRO Optic's front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches and fingerprints."

It's brand new and has never been mounted or shot. I started building it, but decided to move on to other projects, so it has the takedown pins (which are not in the picture), mag release and bolt catch assembly installed, but everything else requires installation (fire control group, safety selector, and grip) of aftermarket parts. Most people buy aftermarket parts for this stuff anyway, so I decided to take these off for a future build, and pass the savings to you. 

This is a very unique lower, in that the hole for the rear takedown detent, and the hole for the bolt catch roll pin have both been threaded by the factory to accept 4-40 allen screws (which are included). This makes it much easier to install or change the stock in the future. 

I am asking 250 for local shipping with bill of sale, but it would be extra if shipping out of state. I also have 3 pmags for this build, which I am willing to sell for $25/each, or $70 for all three. I'd much rather have cash, but might be open to the right trade. 

If you really want the other parts installed, I guess I can do that…just pay for the lower parts kit, and assembly will be free.

pt840 description from taurus:

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

The QD4600 handle, with the L872 ratcheting head is a beast at approximately 3 1/2 foot overall. While mine is not new, at $400 trade value, it is about half price and will save you about $400. It is used, and it does not have a calibration sticker/date on it, but appears to work just fine. I would trade for guns - like Mossberg home defense or hunting (no model 88s), snub nose .357/.38s or lever action rifles.  I have lots of other tools as well.

 It is a Torque Wrench, Adj. Click Type, Fixed-Ratchet, 120-600 ft. lb. range, 3/4"" drive."

So I sent it to TJcustomgunworks. There they did a whole package of reduced recoil spring, shortening the ejector, custom hammer spring, reduced weight, deburred the slide and made it smooth as can possible be to rack the slide. Also polished and deburred the feed ramp. Total cost of work done on the gun with parts close to another 1000. Only 600 rounds shot. Price is firm and no trades will be considered at all. Price is set at $1000. Thanks. Ccw holders will have priority in sale. Available this evening and tomorrow.

It has a 16"" chrome lined barrel with a 1:9 twist rate. I have seen them in stores for an average of right around $1000 or a little more. I added a Magpul handguard and a Magpul MVG to the front of the rifle, and a Blackhawk Ergo pistol grip. It has a nice winter trigger guard, and the Magpul MBUS flip up rear sight. It will come with one 30 round magazine, as well as the owners manual, lock, etc. that came with the rifle. This is a nice rifle, and comes with the Core15 warranty which is pretty awesome. The warranty reads:

“The rifle you have just purchased has the simplest, most plainly written warranty you will ever read. This is no fine print. There are no exceptions. This CORE15 rifle has been manufactured and assembled with painstaking care and precision by proud US Veterans, trained by the best there is. If anything is not up to your standard, accuracy included, if anything goes wrong, gets bent, broken, cracked, misaligned, tweaked, snapped or otherwise, simply contact one of our professionals and we will work to make it right. If you are the 5th owner and the rifle has seen 40k+ rounds, it simply….doesn’t….matter. We stand behind our products and we take care of our customers. That is our promise and your assurance.”

That is the Core Difference. See. Shoot. Believe.

I think that pretty well speaks for the quality of rifles that this company produces. I am looking to sell the rifle for $950 cash, which I think is a very fair deal considering that is less than these go for in the stores (plus there is no tax, even more savings!), and I have added the sight, handguard, vertical grip, and the pistol grip.

The price is for the gun, two 10rd magazines, and the case that it came with it. I was getting tired of all the misfeeding issues, and had the feed ramp ground and polished. It feeds beautifully now, and has absolutely no problems feeding now. 

Im lowering the price from 320 to 300 to accomodate out of state FFL transfers, which are already expensive enough as it is. I also have some Remington Thunderbolt Ammo, which Ill sell for $5 per 50rds. I will not go lower than $300 so dont even ask. 

The price listed is for local FTF sale; for a out of state transfer, the price will have to go up due to FFL. Requires bill of sale for FTF. If you're interested text 703-8six7-56five2 or email. I also have more pictures if youre interested."
