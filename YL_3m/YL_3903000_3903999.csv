AR500 Armor® Urban Go Plate Carrier Package with Level III Body Armor - MSRP- $300.00
http://www.ar500armor.com/urban-go-plate-carrier-w-armor-and-pouches-black.html#.VLHHpVqtYZM

The Urban Go Plate Carrier is the most cost effective complete and ready to go plate carrier package on the market that offers rifle threat protection. Our Urban Go package includes (2) AR500 Armor® Level III patent pending Advanced Shooters Cut 10” x 12” body armor plates. We put our survivalist mentality to work and came up with the essentials required for scenarios that require quick rifle threat protection, creating an armor system that is ready to go at a moment's notice.
The Urban Go Carrier Package is ideal for home protection and emergency situations where rifle threat protection may be necessary. The open side design with a quick release buckles unfastened allows the Urban Go Plate Carrier to be quickly tossed over a single shoulder and worn over any existing gear or body armor. Front access shoulder mounted quick release buckles allow rapid removal compared to plate carriers that utilize a cummerbund. Fast into action, fast out of action. Due to a cummerbund-less design the Urban Go Carrier is not intended to be used with side body armor plates.
We think everyone should be able to afford body armor and took that into consideration when building this package. In addition to being functional and effective, we aimed for high value and our Urban Go Plate Carrier package delivers.

Someone once said to beware of the man with a single shot rifle as he is likely to know how to shoot it.

This New In Box Uberti copy of the famous Winchester High Wall is outstanding in every detail. It's a handsome, no-nonsense rifle with beautiful casehardened colors on the receiver and lever, perfect bluing of the barrel, perfect wood, Winchester style rifle sights, and a wonderfully sweet trigger pull.  And the .45-70 chambering will allow you to hunt anything in North America, and most everything in Africa, too.  

These Ubertis are also known for their fine long range accuracy with either factory ammo or good handloads. This short-rifle style corresponds to the Sharps Business Rifle having a 28-inch round tapered barrel which makes it shorter, lighter, and handier than the standard High Wall rifles. It also carries a cleaning kit hidden behind the trapdoor in its shotgun buttplate. 

This configuration in .45-70 is extremely hard to find. This rifle is unfired, brand New In the Box and ready for the upcoming Spring shooting season. 

May consider a trade for Ruger No 1.

Comes with original box and paperwork plus the extra third mag plus the parts for a manual safety or de-cocker, (currently installed). I bought this back during the recent craziness when I couldn't find threaded barrels for my other 9mm pistols. It has less than 50 rounds through it and now that I have some threaded barrels for my other pistols I'd rather get something else I need. This pistol has a great trigger that really aids in your ability to shoot it accurately. 

Not really interested in a lot of gun trades except for a G17 GEN3 or 4 in FDE. I would also trade for factory ammo in the following calibers, 5.56x45, 5.45x39, 7.62x39 and 9mm or a combination of CA$H plus ammo.


OSPREY CAN NOT INCLUDED

This CZ USA P-07 Duty has been set up to accept a sound suppressor. The 1/2x28 threaded muzzle accepts most suppressors made for the US market. The sights on this variation are higher than normal. They will clear 1” diameter suppressors and provide a good sight picture with larger diameters when shooting with both eyes open.

The CZ P-07 Duty is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Duty features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with a totally new trigger system. The Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. In addition, it allows users to choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever(installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design of the Duty and a sleek slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice."

AR500 Armor® Urban Go Plate Carrier Package with Level III Body Armor - MSRP- $300.00
http://www.ar500armor.com/urban-go-plate-carrier-w-armor-and-pouches-black.html#.VLHHpVqtYZM

The Urban Go Plate Carrier is the most cost effective complete and ready to go plate carrier package on the market that offers rifle threat protection. Our Urban Go package includes (2) AR500 Armor® Level III patent pending Advanced Shooters Cut 10” x 12” body armor plates. We put our survivalist mentality to work and came up with the essentials required for scenarios that require quick rifle threat protection, creating an armor system that is ready to go at a moment's notice.
The Urban Go Carrier Package is ideal for home protection and emergency situations where rifle threat protection may be necessary. The open side design with a quick release buckles unfastened allows the Urban Go Plate Carrier to be quickly tossed over a single shoulder and worn over any existing gear or body armor. Front access shoulder mounted quick release buckles allow rapid removal compared to plate carriers that utilize a cummerbund. Fast into action, fast out of action. Due to a cummerbund-less design the Urban Go Carrier is not intended to be used with side body armor plates.
We think everyone should be able to afford body armor and took that into consideration when building this package. In addition to being functional and effective, we aimed for high value and our Urban Go Plate Carrier package delivers.
Urban Go Plate Carrier Specs:
Weight: 1.5lb (unloaded)
Size: Fully adjustable shoulder straps and girth, Medium – XXL (up to a 54” Chest)
Colors: Black and Coyote

Overall condition is very good, with some minor wear marks on the metal and furniture but this rifle was bought brand new and has only around 300 rounds put through it since purchase.

This rifle is no longer produced and already the value of the firearm is going up, so whether you want a fantastic shooter or a investment, this is the rifle for you. The price for the whole kit is $650 firm (this truly is my bottom dollar, ive been offered 625 a couple of times already), and this rifle will be listed on other sites and within the week will also be listed on gunbroker, so if you are interested please contact me asap.

695,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3903695,For Sale:  223 Rem - Dillon Carbide Rifle Dies (Three-Die Set),"Castle Rock, Denver, Colorado",$ 125,"Listed On: Saturday, January 10, 2015",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Excellent Condition. Very lightly used. 

Dillon Three-Die Rifle Die Sets include a sizing/depriming die, a bullet seating die and a taper crimp die.

Sizing/Depriming Die
The sizing/depriming die is full-length, to minimum tolerances, sizing cases down to function in semi- and full-automatic firearms. We strongly suggest that a headspace case gage be used to correctly adjust the size die. 
For high volume users, such as commercial reloaders, law enforcement agencies, and high power or service rifle competitors, we also offer .223 and .308 die sets with a full-length carbide sizing die. Lubrication is still required, but the increased scratch resistance and die longevity of carbide are of great benefit to these groups of users. 
The depriming assembly includes a carbide expander ball for ""squeak-free,"" effortless neck expansion. This expander ball is located in the middle of the depriming stem to take advantage of superior initial leverage for easier extraction. 
In the event of a stuck case, the design of the depriming assembly allows it to function as a stuck case remover. 

Bullet Seating Die 
Our bullet seating die is internally designed to keep the bullet straight throughout the seating process. Once properly adjusted, the only measurable runout will be that which is inherent in the bullet. 

Taper Crimp Die 
The taper crimp die is also specially configured to center both the case neck and the case body, thereby aligning the entire cartridge for a more uniform crimp. Dillon Rifle Dies are designed to meet the more rigid requirements for both accuracy and precision demanded by today's marksman. 

A taper crimp die is preferred for loading ammunition intended to be used in semiautomatic firearms with detachable box magazines, and in lever-action firearms with tubular magazines."

I've contacted Sig and they verified this gun was manufactured in May 2011.  Included with the sale is the original case and manual, Sig OWB paddle retension holster, and three magazines. The gun has bright night sights and the gun comes with the SRT (short reset trigger) installed. The slim Sig P220 grips are installed, but Hogue wrap around rubber grips with finger grooves and Hogue Fancy Hardwood Grips are included with the gun.

I'm the second owner. The round count  of the .45cal P220 is less than 500 rounds.

Included with the purchase is the Sig P220 22lr. Conversion kit with a 10 rounds mag. I never used this kit when I purchased the set and it looks like it's never been used.

I'm asking for $800 for everything OBO. For everything that's included, $800 is a steal. I'd be willing to trade for the following of equal came ( and cash if needed) Sig P226 in .40 cal, Sig P226 SAO, or 1911 in 9mm........make me an offer, won't hurt anything!!!

If you want to see more pictures, just ask.  I'd prefer to sell locally and meet face to face at a local FFL to perform the transfer.  If you're out of state, I'll be willing to send to your preferred FFL. All transfer fees are your responsibility.

I'll accept cash, cashier's check, or postal money order. If the gun is being shipped to a FFL, I'll ship once the payment has cleared. 

Please feel free to contact me with any questions!!!  Trade offers will be heard but right now I'm primarily not looking to trade weapons.....but I'll never turn down a deal I can't refuse!!!!!!"

I am also looking to sell as part of a package a gorgeous custom leather holster for it, and as much .38 and or .357 you might want to go with it. I might even have some speed loaders available. Accessories and extra ammunition, including self defense grade .357 and .38+P (see: golden sabers) available. Basically, you can walk out the door with a complete conceal carry package for about 300.
