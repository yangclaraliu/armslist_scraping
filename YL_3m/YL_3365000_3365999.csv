Game master 760 very rare chambering,"Ollala, Seattle, Washington","$ 2,000","Listed On: Friday, August 8, 2014",Rifles,Remington                                                                                ,6mm Remington                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"As you may know, Remington introduced the .244 in 1955 (the same year Winchester introduced the .243). Remington misread the market and introduced their .244 caliber with a 1:12 twist designed to stabilize light varmint bullets whereas Winchester introduced their .243 with a 1:9 twist which proved more suitable for stabilizing the larger dual purpose (deer/varmint) bullets. The .243 dominated the market but Remington quickly learned from their mistake and began rebarreling in a slower twist as of 1958. By then, however, the damage had been done and sales of the .244 continued to suffer. In 1963 they pulled the rifle and reintroduced it as the 6mm Remington and the rest is history. 
I expect that it will have extra value to collectors due to the chambering.  .244 Remington is the same as 6mm Remington.  Remington first called the caliber 6mm, but sales were poor.  They changed the name to .244 in hopes of improving sales, but it had the opposite effect.  The name was changed back to 6mm but never gained a good enough market for the caliber.

Add 10% for .300 Savage or .35 Rem. cal. 
The Model 760 seems to have regional pricing differences in the rare calibers. Values in the Eastern U.S. seem to be quite a bit higher than prices encountered in the Midwest and West. Hence, values on the .222 Rem., .223 Rem., and .257 Roberts cals. reflect a nationalized average rather than one region's high or another's low. A few Model 760s were also mfg. in .244 cal. (before going to 6mm Rem.) - VERY RARE WITH PRICING UNPREDICTABLE.""

Note the last line saying that it is very rare.  Your rifle is likely worth upwards of $2000-2500"

Due to customer demand, we've developed this defensive 38SPL ammo. Our customers wanted some devastating 38SPL loads that would fill the following criteria. 

1. It won't hurt older/fragile/alloy revolvers. (Non +P)
2. Is effective as a ""fight stopper"" through the use of proper bullets. 
3. Is more powerful than typical/standard, weak 38SPL ammo.
4. Generate much less recoil than our +P 38SPL ammo.
5. Is flash suppressed.

Buffalo Bore is introducing these three different heavy, yet standard pressure loadings for 38 SPL. These offerings are loaded at standard pressure, but they are much more powerful than normal 38SPL ammo. These loads will not harm older more fragile revolvers. So, these loads are safe for use in ANY 38 SPL revolver, provided it is in normal working condition. As stated above, the ""POWER"" level of these loads is really closer to a typical +P power level, but the pressure is standard. We are able to develop these powerful standard pressure loads with modern non-canister powders. Again, these loads recoil far less than our +P 38 SPL ammo. 

All three of these loads are flash suppressed, so firing them in the dark wont blind you. We use flash suppressed powder in our defensive ammo, in the loadings we can, because over 90% of all civilian shootings in America, occur in low light, when the criminal element is at work. We don't want you blinded by your own gunfire after the first shot. 

Item 20C utilizes the same 158gr. very soft lead cast, SWC-HC gas checked bullet, we load in our +P 38 SPL ammo. It is designed to expand and then penetrate quite deep. (Approx. 14 inches in human tissue) This bullet is gas checked and will NOT lead your barrel. Note the below velocities that I recorded out of my personal revolvers- NOT TEST BARRELS!

1. S&W mod. 60, 2 inch barrel - 854 fps (256 ft. lbs.)
2. S&W mod. 66, 2.5 inch barrel - 871 fps (266 ft. lbs.)

Warnings out of the way, I've inspected and tested the trigger by simulating drops. ( not damaging the rifle in any ways, still Like new).

343,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3365343,"For Sale:  Hammerli 208 S (S model, not 208 International)","Far NE IL, Illinois, United States","$ 2,200","Listed On: Wednesday, March 25, 2015",Handguns,no type,22 Long Rifle                                                                                ,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"For Sale: Hammerli 208 S, with Morini Grip that has been modified very slightly on the R slab.  

Personally, I don't particularly favor the S models over the 208, but for those who want a two stage trigger or need the adjustable trigger shoe as on the 208S or 215S S, this is the last 208S under $3000 that I'll be releasing after testing and evaluation, for quite a while to come.

This is a special edition gun, with Hammerli in gold, and an unusually well polished finish for a 208 S (usually, these are rather matte or dull).  In that sense, it is NOT a typical 208S, but is equally funtional and equally accurate.  The RH side of the grip has been recut slightly, to improve the hand fit.  This is significantly better than the factory new Morini grip (which is not designed for a perfect fit, but for custom recutting).

The last image shows the left handed grip that can be provided with this gun if desired.  It is imaged on a different gun, but the fit is identical.  Price with this grip is $200 higher.

The gun also can be provided in ""211"" configuration with a 212 grip.

This gun is one of several target and ""other use"" pistols available, which are NOT listed on Armslist.  For a complete list and EXPERT'S SELECTION GUIDE to these guns, please email.  The guide and list are free.  The guide also lists some 208 that are available.  

The Morini grip (original to the gun) fits hand sizes up to about 8.7cm span, and a bit more.  An extra 0.7 cm of size can be added to that easily by additional cutting to the bottom shelf.  The Morini grips are designed for longer fingers than the OEM Hammerli grips, but this one has been recut for easier use with ""typical"" length fingers.

For those with Annie Oakley or Hobbitoid hands, an OEM Hammerli small grip is available, but does not have an adjustable lower shelf. 

FFL transfer only.

Additional magazines available, either extended or short base, 8 or 10 rd capacity.  However, the magazines are available only with purchase of a Hammerli 2xx series gun from me.  The 8 rd is required in some states, and is preferred for 5-shot competitions due to better feed.

Price includes an 80 gm weight. Price reduction with no weight. 200 and 240 gm weights also available, extra cost.  This is NOT a SigArms import, and does not have their upper section safety.

Hammerli-SIG P240 in all calibers incl 22lr, 208, and 212 also available, and other 208S. The other S models are basically similar to this one, except for one with gold Hammerli lettering, at higher price.

For those who have not used these are are just starting, the 208 and 208S parallel the S&W41 as a child of the Walther Olympia pistol and other derivative .22 guns. These, in their own way, likely are derivatives of the Reising Target pistol of the 1920s.

The 208 S offers a 2 stage trigger with a fair range of adjustments, including trigger position. The predecessor 208 uses a single stage trigger, with no significant adjustment for trigger position possible. Some internal changes for springing and adjustment also were made from the earlier 208 models, also incorporated in the 215 and later 208 models with wide trigger shoes.

In general, these guns are not as accurate as the SAKO TriAce and do not have the range of internal adjustment which that gun offers, but the clearances are not as tight, and they are less fussy or sensitive to ammunition. The 208 S has never ""beaten"" the scores of the 208 in competion, but has gained preference at this time over the 208 for many.

The barrel weight serves both to change the feel of the gun, and to serve as a precision barrel tuner, similar to the micrometer tuners used on some rifles. With a 240 gm weight, the feel of the gun ""approximates"" that of the GSP, but the grip of the 208 is similar to the S&W 41 or the Colt 1911. On the SIG 240, and GSP, it is sloped.

Scope or optical sight rails are available from a number of sources for this gun. Most of them also can be used on the 208, and a few on the 212 as well.

The gun accuracy is in the 0.15 MOA range (yes 0.15, not 1.5) with precise barrel weight tuning.  Without that but with optimized ammunition, accuracy is about 0.9 MOA.  For comparison, the best S&W41 generally are at about 1.2-1.4 MOA, but do not offer the adjustable trigger or ability to change the barrel weight easily.

If you are interested in a Hammerli 208 and the S model is too expensive or a single stage trigger is desired, I do have several 208 (non-S) available.  Price is about half that of this gun, and comparable to a better quality S&W41."

Benelli Montefeltro with Ducks Unlimited trim.  Semi Automatic.  Chambered for 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells for maximum usability.  
AAA grade walnut furniture (most of the banquet guns have AA grade but this one is special.)  Hard case, 5 chokes, tool, oil, and lock etc are all included (Everything you see in picture).  28"" barrel.

Shoots and feeds smoother than any shotty I've ever fired.  You can't go buy this gun at a store.  DU only makes so many to give away at their Ducks Unlimited banquets.  Very rare gun!  I bought it from the guy who won it in a banquet raffle a few years back.  It has only had a few boxes of shells put through it.  The gun is practically brand new.  The DU version of the Montefeltro has gold ducks in a marsh and ornate designs inlaid on the receiver on both sides.  It's a beautiful firearm.  Although rare it would still serve ALL of your hunting needs.  With five choke options you can adjust for any kind of hunt.  In my opinion Benelli is the Ferrari of shotguns.  Italian, fast, and powerful.  This gun is sure to impress your pals and get the job done simultaneously!  As accurate as they come.  

Benelli’s Montefeltro shotgun features a slim, graceful forend, which, combined with an anodized, lightweight receiver, keeps the weight minimal and the swing quick."

Sig 516 Upper and Viper Defense Lower with Magpul MOE hardware as described below...

Upper Assembly:

The SIG516 Upper contains the SIG SAUER® advanced short-stroke pushrod system. This advanced operating system reduces carbon fouling, excessive heat and unburned powder in the action, ensuring reliability and function that is unmatched. A standard 5.56mm NATO chrome-lined chamber and bore ensure reliable function in any environment.  It also features a free-floating, aluminum, M1913 quad rail and 1:7 RH twist bore configuration.

An adjustable 4-position gas valve allows operators to increase the flow of gas when using lower pressure ammunition or when adverse conditions require additional energy. Reduced flow and the off-position enhance the use of suppressors. Barrels feature an A2 flash suppressor and are threaded ½x28 TPI, allowing the SIG516 to adapt to a number of aftermarket accessories and suppressor mounts. 

Lower:

Viper Defense is a new local Firearms Manufacturer in Eugene.  We are going to produce custom AR 15 and AR 10 Rifles for the general market very soon but are limited to Lower Receivers for both at this time.  Our AR 15 Lower Receiver is CNC machined from a Billet of 7075-T6 Aluminum to mil-specs and then hard-coat Anodized Black.  We've also included the MagPul MOE Pistol Grip and Stock for style and comfort.

Since we machine our Lowers to a tighter tolerance than most Firearms Manufacturers, and Sig Sauer of course, does the same, the Upper and Lower of this Rifle mate snugly without the need for any tensioning devices.

I have exactly 42 rounds through the gun.  It was broken in with Final Finish Ammo for ease of cleaning with 20 rounds and then have put 22 Federal GMM 168 through it.  From a bipod with rear bag I was able to get several 3 shot groups between .4-.65 inches at 100 yards.  Needless to say the gun is more accurate than I am.  Excellent rifle that will shoot all day long with guns costing several hundred dollars more.  I am selling it because I have decided I want to try out a .308 AR and need some additional funding to pick one up.  I don't have the box anymore but I have everything that came with the gun.

Heckler & Koch M700009-A5 VP9 9mm Pistol, Striker Fired, 4.09 Inch Barrel, 15 Rd, Night Sights

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitor’s. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

VP9 pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

Ruger 0318 Blackhawk Convertible Revolver, .357 Remington Mag/ 9mm, 6.5 in Barrel, Black Grip, Blued Finish, 6 Rds

Ruger Blackhawk is the most advanced single action revolvers ever made. While retaining the solid frame, feel and comfortable grip of the classic single actions, they feature Ruger’s patented transfer bar ignition system with loading gate interlock and reverse indexing pawl, together with an all coil spring mechanism, adjustable sights, and frame mounted firing grip. Factor in the Ruger reliability and they are the best value on the market.

Convertible models come equipped with an extra cylinder and are popular with shooters who appreciate the classic single-action revolver but opt for the versatility of being able to use more than one caliber in their handgun. With its interchangeable cylinder, Convertible models can be easily converted from one caliber to another without the use of tools. This versatility allows avid shooters of autoloading pistols to enjoy shooting a classic American single-action sidearm with their favorite pistol cartridge.

Ted Williams model 200 is basically a Winchester 1200 made by Sears and Roebuck. The variable choke is more of an old school choke but it is very useful because you don't have to carry around or change chokes. No matter what type of shells you're shooting the choke can be adjusted for it by simply spinning the dial.  This shotgun shoots amazing and is made to last forever. The only negative is that there is a small amount of surface rust on the exterior of the barrel. Other than that it everything is very clean and smooth.
