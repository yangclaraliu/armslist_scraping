The holster included is a Zorn custom made holster with adjustable retention and IWB/OWB capabilities.

Serial # 107140 Manufactured 1944. Compatible and interchangeable with all standard Short, Long and Long Rifle .22 Caliber cartridges. The Model 62 (pre-War & 62A (Post War) Visible Hammer was manufactured from 1932 to 1958. The Model 61 Hammerless from 1932 to 1963. Sadly, but good for collectors, at the end of 1963 Model 61 Production both of these classic Winchester Slide Action rifles had been permanently discontinued when the company went from almost purely handmade firearms to almost completely automated production beginning in 1964. The Winchester Model 62 was a rifle that most men who are my age now owned as a prized possession as teenagers. (Ah, the good old days). When I first acquired this Model 62 I enjoyed shooting it and reliving those good old days a bit but eventually it was cleaned and stored away. This gun is strong in every aspect. It has what I would call a nice light patina of use. Extremely nice but not to the point of a mint example you would not want to shoot. And, it is far, far from just shooter quality. The bluing is outstanding over the entire rifle with only a few barrel freckles and some light scratches on the receiver. The stock is in excellent condition with a few light dings and the butt plate is excellent. Very importantly the action is tight and the bore is superb. The gun is easily 97 percent. Since Winchester discontinued manufacturing their very fine and very popular line of Model 61 Hammerless and Model 62 Exposed Hammer rifles in 1963 values have steadily increased. But they have particularly begun escalating sharply in recent years and no doubt will continue a steady upward march. Any casual or serious Winchester collector cannot go wrong acquiring a Winchester Slide Action .22, especially if it is very good condition and maintained that way. They are a guaranteed quality collectible firearm investment. It is now time for me to pass this one along to another appreciative collector to enjoy and preserve. Will trade for stainless BERETTA 92FS + Nano. God Bless"

This little gun shoots dead on and like any other 22lr rifles there is no recoil what so ever so you can easily and quickly place all 25 rounds in a very tight grouping.

I am selling my Keltec PF-9.  This gun was purchased fairly recently (end of June) brand new through a local FFL.  It features the upgraded parkerized finish (instead of the blued or cerakote finishes).  It comes with two magazines (one is the extended 8 round which sells for $40) and a springfield belt clip holster.  The 8 round extended magazine is great because it gives this gun a more full size grip allowing better control and accuracy.  

I like the firearm but have decided to upgrade to a Sig Sauer; as such I'm letting this one go.   It is one of the flattest and thinnest 9s on the market and great for ccw!  This gun has only been fired about 100 times.  Also, it does include the original carrying case and an allen wrench for adjusting the rear sight.  Thanks for looking!"

It took two rounds from another pistol and finally stopped working, but upon sending the destroyed weapon back to SCCY, they repaired it fully at no cost. I have only put 50 rounds down the pipe in range sessions as this used to be my backup pistol. This particular pistol is unique in the fact that it has a 9mm double stack magazine allowing you to have 10+1 rounds at your fingertips instead of 5-7 that most pistols in it's size offer. This deal contains all original packaging in great condition along with factory papers, trigger lock and keys, and flat magazine baseplates incase you to not like the pinky extensions to give you a little more gripping area.

Benelli’s SuperNova Tactical embodies a modular design concept in a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun sight. At the heart of this new pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the SuperNova Tactical super-light, super-strong and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova Tactical isn’t just tough on the outside. Dual-action bars and a two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel to steel inside the barrel ensures that the SuperNova Tactical is rock solid to the core and capable of handling everything from light loads to 3-1/2"" Magnums.

The SuperNova Tactical comes with either rifle sights or newly designed, military-style ghost-ring sights. The rear sight is click-adjustable for both windage and elevation. Optional three-dot tritium inserts can be easily installed. A magazine cut-off on the forearm allows for safe carry with a full magazine and empty chamber. The top of the SuperNova’s receiver is drilled and tapped to accommodate easy attachment of military-style optics."

This is an older scope, I've had it since the mid 1990s and it had been around a while before that. It has been used; has some scuff marks and ring marks on it but it functions perfectly. Best of all, the glass is perfect and amazing, especially in low light. The scope is marked ""Made in West Germany."" I've had it on a couple different ARs and a little 243 bolt gun over the years and it has always been a terrific scope. If you're looking for a very high quality scope at an affordable price and aren't afraid of a few scuffs on the outside, this one is for you.

Century International Arms, M-1 Garand (not USGI / not C&R), comes with 3 clips (en blocs), and cleaning supply stored in the butt stock.

This CIA M-1 is well kept. First serie that CIA built with All Springfiled parts (non-matching USGI parts), mostly in 1945. Stock and Parkerizing look very good and I was able to hit metal targets out to 600 yards (at Angeles) with iron sights. I do not know the throat and muzzle measurements because I do not have any gauges. Perhaps an M-1 Garand gunsmith will be best suited for purchasing this rifle and get it up to it’s original specifications as intended by John Garand."

What would be ideal would be adding a pistol buffer with the SigTac SB15 AR-15 Arm Brace as you see in the picture below. Since it is like the AR-15 it should not require a tax stamp due to ATF rules but I DO NOT KNOW THIS INFORMATION. What you do with the stock adapter is on you and only you. I am merely just selling the adapter that I was going to use but did not end up having a chance to. I ended up needing my stock for the AR Pistol that I built this week.

Compatibility: Glock 17,22,24,31,34,35,18. Also confirmed for the Glock 20,21. I was able to make it fit on my Glock 23 by adding another hole a little higher up on the insert. The Glocks listed above should function perfectly.

Condition: Perfect Condition and unused. The reviews were great on this. The feel is impressive and very sturdy.

The Heckler and Koch 416 Pistol is a handgun version of the H&K 416, chambered in .22LR. This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the .22 416 rifle. Like the other .22 LR firearms offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22. The barrel measures 9 inches in length and its rails are machined. The 416’s pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 pistol are the same as the .22LR 416 rifles. They are made of high-strength polymer and designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. The estimated retail price for the 416 pistol is $459.

Operation

A blowback system operates the .22 caliber HK 416 Pistol. The dust cover functions and the bolt remains open when the magazine empties. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation and its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’."

This is manufactured in the Czech Republic, with an original Czech made receiver and cold hammer forged chrome-lined barrel. I bought this direct from the importer who brought the rifles over from the Czech Republic, Tennessee Guns International (TGI).

Excellent condition Czech-made VZ 58 rifle. Czechoslovakia was the only Warsaw Pact country that never adopted the AK as their service rifle. When the Soviet Union mandated that all members adopt the 7.62x39mm round as their standard ammunition in 1956, Czechoslovakia designed the VZ 58 to replace the VZ 52 (which fired a 7.62x45mm round that only the Czechs used) as their service rifle.

The VZ 58 has a milled receiver, but weighs a pound less than an AK with a stamped sheet metal receiver. It uses a 30-round aluminum magazine, which is NOT interchangeable with AK magazines. You can order magazines online, and Van's Sporting Goods has a few in stock as well.

This is the more rare Military Classic version. It has hardwood stock, pistol grip and handguards, which only the early VZ 58s used. The Czechs later switched to a reddish colored resin-impregnated wood chip material for the VZ 58's furniture. One magazine is included, and a matching Czech bayonet with hardwood handles is included as well. Please note, the rifle does NOT have a bayonet lug; they were imported from the Czech Republic without one.

Selling for $1,075. Price is firm. Local pickup, cash only. You must show proof of MS residency, and I will complete a bill of sale at the time of sale."

Target Crown

The muzzle of the barrel is specially machined to protect the rifling, therefore preserving and protecting accuracy. This is a critical feature on any barrel. If riflings are damaged in any way, especially at the muzzle, accuracy suffers and it is often difficult to determine the cause.

60° Bolt

Browning X-Bolt and A-Bolt rifles have a short 60° bolt lift. Many competitors' rifles incorporate a 90° bolt lift that is not only slower and cumbersome but places the bolt near or on the rifle's scope, making the bolt more difficult to operate."

For $150 additional, I will leave the Nikon ProHunter 3x9x40 w/BDC reticle mounted.  This rifle drives tacks at 200, and shoots sub 6"" at 500.  Standard floating barrel with excellent factory rings.  Blued.  The pic is of my .25-06, same model, same optics but with a larger bore.  I love this rifle, but am wanting to build a 20-24"" AR and cant justify have two .223 paper punchers.  Price listed is for rifle only.  Scope is additional."

891,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3414891,For Sale:  .308 Projectiles - Accutec Special Forces Non-toxic Extremely Rare,"Barrington (NW Suburbs), Chicago, Illinois",$ 680,"Listed On: Monday, December 8, 2014",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is the only legal civilian supply of accutec projectiles anywhere in North America. Before they signed agreements with gov't agencies they did sell their projectiles to non-government only distributors. These projectiles come in a 1700 round case and weigh over 200gr each. They can be used in a regular configuration or can be loaded subsonic for use with a moderator where legal. 

The projectiles are completely lead-free and would be excellent for use in locations that prohibit lead. 

These projectiles are used by SEAL teams and other agencies because they do not present the same ricochet hazards as copper jacketed lead core ammunition and because they transfer tremendous energy. 

I believe when new the projectiles were over $0.80 a piece before they were loaded up by Lake City and Federal (loaded ammo was about $3.00 each). So MSRP on a case of 1700 projectiles in .308 was over $1360.00 MSRP.

I'll sell the case of 1700 sealed Accutec .308 projectiles for $680, or $0.40 per projectile. These projectiles are used in .300 AAC, .300 Blackout, .308 Winchester / 7.62x51 NATO, .30-06, .300 win mag and a host of other calibers. 

I also have over 40,000 accutec projectiles available in 9mm,  .38, .40, .45, and 5.56mm/.223. 

You will NEVER see these for sale again. This is the only inventory of these that is ever going to lawfully be available to the civilian marketplace since accutec only sells to government agencies now to prevent reverse engineering of their formulation. 

Pickup in person. Shipping is a massive additional charge due to weight. Payment via cash in person or you may mail a cashiers check or money order. Each caliber of projectile comes in a different quantity per case so contact me for pricing by the case on other calibers. 

Ballistics gel info here: http://www.accutecusa.com/

If you want to buy me out, all 37 cases in all assorted calibers (about $35,000 in inventory) you can have it all for $13,200 cash and carry.

Even though Illinois law doesn't demand a FOID card for purchase of projectiles, I want to see yours if you're an Illinois resident because I'm not comfortable selling to someone that lives in this state that wants to buy this stuff and doesn't have one. Non-Illinois residents only need to present valid government ID."

Unique direct gas operating system eliminates the conventional operating rod and results in fewer and ligher components.  Accommodates the full range of 5.56mm ammunition, including the NATO M855/SS109 and U.S. M193, utilizing a rifling twist of 1 turn in 7"".  Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire.  4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations.  Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications.  Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures.  Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud.  Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance.  Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories.  Front barrel lug allows for easy mounting of a variety of accessories.   Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation.

Straight-line construction disperses recoil straight back to the shoulder, increasing handling capabilities, especially during repeated fire. 4-position sliding buttstock allows the weapon to adapt to users of different sizes and physical characteristics as well as various firing positions and clothing variations. Cartridge case deflector allows easy operation in both right and left handed shooting positions for increased tactical applications. Muzzle compensator further reduces muzzle climb and helps eliminate flash and dust signatures. Ejection port cover protects the chamber from dust and mud. Field strips easily without special tools for simple field user maintenance. Flat top receiver allows for removable carrying handle and easy mounting of accessories. Front barrel lug allows for easy mounting of a variety of accessories. Target style rear sight features dual apertures (0-200m, 300-600m) and adjusts for both windage and elevation.
