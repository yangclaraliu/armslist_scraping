This was manufactured by B.F.I. Windham ME. In my opinion this is when they were one of the best AR-15 platforms on the market, prior to selling out. Many prefer this over Colt or other higher priced AR's. This was prior to moving operations to New York - and prior to Walmart beating the quality down.

Once again this is not the newer, cheaper $750 Walmart Bushmaster or the carbon/carbine version. This is the sought after and more desirable weapon back when they built them tight and heavier in Windham, ME. If you are not familiar, do some research and you will quickly gain an appreciation for this weapon and why they are desirable."

Here is a pre-owned revolver in good condition, shows minor wear from use. I made the mistake of polishing this gun w/ a stainless brush, so it shows some light discoloration in the metal, but may be worked out w/ some light buffing. I purchased this gun in 2006 & has since had about 300 rounds shot through it. I only used the magnum cylinder just a few times. The grips are in mint condition, showing no scratches, dents, dings, abrasions, etc. This gun comes with both cylinders, original box, manual, lock, original receipt, etc. I live in Opp, Alabama. If interested contact Davy Ham at 334 - 764 -3482. Thanks."

The Caldwell XLA Bipods provide a stable shooting support that conveniently attaches to almost any firearm with a sling swivel stud. XLA bipods solidly clamp to the swivel stud of the firearm and remain firmly in place without swiveling or twisting while shooting. The lightweight aluminum design adds minimal weight and deploys quickly, with legs that instantly spring out to the shooting position with the touch of a button.

The legs are notched for easy indexing to a specific height. There is a connection point for sling attachment and multi section legs that collapses forward allowing for convenient carry of the firearm. Soft rubber feet provide enhanced stability, while the padded bipod base protects the firearm's forend.

Note: Pivoting Models - In the real world of hunting, the chances of the ideal shot opportunity occurring while on a level ground are slim-to-none. A pivoting bipod will allow the shooter to compensate for ground that is unlevel by up to 20°. The lower portion of the bipod pivots independently from the upper stock mount, allowing the firearm to be quickly leveled on uneven ground. The tension knob can be adjusted to control the resistance of the pivoting motion."

Never fired Remington 700 SPS Tactical chambered in .308.  It has a 20” heavy barrel, an overmolded hogue stock, X-Mark Pro adjustable trigger, and 4+1 capacity.

I bought this rifle about a year ago before I deployed and set it all up.  I bought a Remington 700P when I got back, so I am selling this one.   I never got around to bringing this out to the range.

The scope has been mounted using the scope and ring/mount manufacturer’s specifications for torque and locked into place with lock-tite.  The scope has been leveled before and after installation to ensure 100% crosshair level.  I have boresighted the scope to 50m for initial zeroing (and barrel break-in if you so choose).

This rifle is completely ready to bring out to the range and zero with minor adjustments.  This rifle has the Remington X-Mark Pro adjustable trigger.   If you do your part, this rifle will shoot sub-MOA groups.

It was removed with steel wool, so it is no longer an issue. There is no rust anywhere else on the gun, internally or externally; I inspected it thoroughly to insure this. The steel wool had the effect of marginally lightening the blueing on the barrel, though it is only noticeable if you're looking for it. Otherwise, this gun is flawless.

The GLOCK 23 combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight, despite its large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, the G23 pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. That's why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.

Price is $450 Shipped. 

Noveske's Stainless Steel AR-15 Match Barrels  in  300 AAC Blackout  are perfect for wringing the most accuracy and performance out of this unique new cartridge. Composed of 416R stainless steel that's hardened to 30 RC, the barrel has a medium contour, bead-blasted satin finish, M4 extended feed ramps, and is threaded at the muzzle for the addition of flash hiders, muzzle brakes and/or sound suppressors. Each barrel is shipped with a pinned, low profile gas block, gas tube and barrel extension. 

 The barrel's pistol length gas system provides optimal reliability with subsonic ammunition while suppressed, and supersonic ammunition while unsuppressed. While supersonic ammunition may also function with a sound suppressor installed, subsonic ammunition fired without a sound suppressor may cause cycling problems.

To the gentlemen that was interested in it a week or so ago, sorry but had a family emergency out of state and had to leave town. ALL Illinois laws will be followed. Valid FOID card, Foid check and validity approval number threw ISP website, sign bill of sale and 72 hour wait."

I have an Alexander Arms 6.5 Grendel M4 carbine that has been test fired with 20 rounds of Hornady 123grn AMAX. The carbine has a 14.5 barrel (made by Sabre Defense) with a welded and pinned 1.5inch flash hider to bring this to the legal minimum limit of 16 inches.  Alexander Arms has discontinued the production of this type of upper and barrel length. The value of the carbine is $1499.00 approximately as they no longer offer this barrel length. The carbine comes with a silicon cleaning cloth, instruction manual, (1) ten round magazine, brand new rear Troy Back Up Iron Sight, and KNS anti-rotation pins. If you are concerned about ammo or magazines. I have two boxes of 123 grain Hornady AMAX and four Alexander Arms branded magazines that would be added to the offer. If you live in Colorado then I can only supply the ten round magazine. Same thing for those of you behind enemy lines in other draconian states (New York-Mass, Ect). The ammo is still in the case it was shipped in and is valued at $24.00 per box of twenty and the magazines are worth $20.00 each. I have several of this model if you want more than one. If you decide that this offer is something you would like to move forward with then I will ship the carbines through my FFL to your FFL once payment has been made. I do have multiple photos to be emailed to you if you are interested.
 I want to thank you for taking the time to read and consider this, if you have any questions please email or text me and let me know.  Rodney REDACTED.

Greetings,

This is a SOCOM 16. I have the original fiber stock if you wish to have it. I modified the gun by adding a VLTOR stock. I bought this gun used from a Border Patrol Agent in Yuma, AZ. He sighted the rifle with 10 rounds and I have fired another 30 rounds through it. This comes with 3 twenty round magazines and 3 ten round magazines.

Barrels are 2.5"", 4"", 6"" and 8"".  I can't tell for sure but the longer barrels look unfired.  The shorter one on the receiver is slightly used.  I have owned the gun for six years but I think the  last owner may have used another barrel when shooting.  Theses barrels look super.  The Monson, MA production frame has been used but looks very clean.  It was never holstered.  How could you own this and not try it out.  Looks to have run 38 special ammo verses the 357.  This is real pretty gun with the only sings of wear being on the inside; the recoil shield and the lock up engagement points only. The exterior is awesome with no evidence of carbon burn on the front of the cylinder and the forcing cone is tidy as well.

A couple guys on GB love to buy these and piece them out.  It's a shame but what can you do?  I love this kit but don't have room for it in my safe.  I have never shot it but I know my other DW's are fine pieces to own and use.  No longer made with this quality.

Up for sale is my AK-74 (not AK-47) chambered in 5.45 x 39 (not 7.62x39). It is a Bulgarian M74. Read reviews about this rifle...everyone who owns one, loves it.

This weapon is dream to shoot and a head-turner at any range. I have made multiple upgrades to this weapon and am including 2,400 rounds of ammunition. Less than 300 rounds of military surplus ammo put through the weapon. Very accurate; I was shooting apple-sized groups at 100 yards with surplus ammo. Thoroughly cleaned after each trip to the range. The mags fit snugly into the magazine well and the iron sights are spot-on.

If I can find the original furniture (stock, pistol grip, and forend), I will include those as well.

I got this gun from the original owner that promised he only ran a couple full cylinder through it.  I believe it was 44 mag load because there is a lite ghosting around the firing pin on the shield.  Forcing cone and inside bridge look great as well as the front of the cylinder.  

Comes in a display box but no blue box.  Has tools but, to my dismay, no papers (but I am looking).  Have never fired it and owned it for seven years and as I said it came from the original owner.  Blue flocking on foam is off but foam in excellent shape and can be re-done.  

I thought this one was in perfect condition but while cleaning it, I noticed some pin tip spots of roughness on the sight rail of the barrel on the side it sits in the case.  I don't ever recall this but I will have it looked at.  It is wrapped in S&W paper at all times.  Not trying to hide anything.

The Smith & Wesson Model 422, discontinued in 1996, was the company's well designed and built entry into the lucrative mid-priced rimfire pistol market. This niche was, at the time, dominated by Sturm Ruger's well thought of Mk I and Mk II series of pistols and was a market position S&W had neglected since 1966, when the model 46 was dropped from their catalog. The model 422 was introduced with a 12 round detachable box magazine.

A very unique design feature of the 422 was the fact that the barrel, which was non-moving and was fixed to the frame, resided in a low position in the frame just above the trigger guard. The barrel came threaded from the factory, with a protective ""barrel nut"" fitted.

The bolt assembly, which comprised the top rearward portion of the pistol, moved behind as well as above the axis of the barrel and resembled an L shape. The recoil spring was contained in the portion above the bolt, which also housed the firing pin. Above the barrel was a large frame lug, which gave the gun a pleasing look of constant width and depth from the trigger guard forward to the muzzle, while also serving as a solid block for the bolt to hit against when the recoil spring returned the bolt to battery.
