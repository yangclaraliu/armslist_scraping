The Sig Sauer P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(sub-compact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

The GLOCK 27 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to this small, light, accurate, and powerful pistol that so many law enforcement agencies have issued as their offical backup weapon. The Modular Back Strap design of the G27 Gen4 .40 Caliber lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible enlarged magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators.

Chinese Dragunov in 7.62x51, the only exact copy of the original Russian design. Rifle is wearing the current issue military polymer stockset. This makes the rifle more accurate as wood can expand or contract depending on the weather, changing the accuracy of the rifle. The polymer set does not do this, and is what's currently in use with the military. These rifles have been banned from import into the United States since the early 1990's and will likely remain so. The website SniperCentral lists the officially adopted sniper rifles of 61 countries, and the Dragunov represents 23 of them. The next most popular rifle (SSG-69) has only been adopted by 5 nations. Coming into service in 1963 the Russian rifle has become famous. This rugged and absolutely reliable system boasts a heavy-duty milled receiver that won't stop. The reliability of the system, combined with the semi-automatic rate of fire which allows quick follow-up shots if you miss your target the first time, and the hard-hitting 7.62 caliber round all make the Dragunov the ideal sniper rifle. A communist sniper issued a Dragunov rifle in the Afghan war stated that he felt confident hitting people out to 800 yds with one shot, and vehicles up to 1000 yds. The Chinese are the only ones who made a direct clone of the Russian Dragunovs and were helped by the Russians during production. Some Chinese rifles have even been found to be re-stamped Russian rifles. The 7.62x51 version is the most accurate of them all and was only made by the Chinese. It combines the durability of the Russian Dragunov with the accuracy of the American 7.62x51(.308) bullet. These rifles can outshoot the stock M14/M1A and AR10 rifles, and the only reason they are not in any U.S. arsenals currently is because it wasn't designed by an American. With the .308 chambering and the military furniture, this is the absolute most accurate Dragunov rifle you can buy. With no more coming into the country, these are undoubtedly good investments that you can take out and enjoy.

Another beauty from my personal collection…an excellent condition COLT MKIV/SERIES 70 GOVERNMENT MODEL pistol chambered in .45ACP. Manufactured in 1982. The MKIV / SERIES 70 GOVERNMENT MODEL is the most sought-after version of the 1911-type pistols. From 1911 until 1970 there were virtually no significant changes to the basic design, but the year 1971 saw the first mechanical improvement to the 1911. Colt redesigned the barrel bushing from a solid cylindrical type to a spring-steel, ""finger collet"" bushing that gripped the end of the barrel, which had also been slightly redesigned with a slight belled end to accommodate the collet bushing. The new ""Accurizor"" barrel and bushing was intended to improve the intrinsic accuracy of the new Colt Government Model pistols"

Leupold mounts are every bit as rugged and dependable as the Leupold optics they're intended to secure. With a huge variety of mounting systems, for nearly every type of firearm under the sun, you're sure to find the perfect match for you firearm, and your style of shooting. The Leupold Integral Mounting Systems (IMS) family quickly and easily eliminates the two most common issues faced when mounting standard rifle scopes to AR-style rifles; scope height and eye relief. Each aluminum IMS cantilever design mounts directly to the firearm's Mil-Spec 1913/Picatinny to raise the scope and push it forward, eliminating the need for risers or specialized optics with shortened eye relief. The Mark 6 Mount comes with integral rings and is designed specifically for the Leupold Mark 6 Tactical Rifle Scope. All Leupold IMS products are tested to endure the rigors of the field and are covered by the Leupold Full Lifetime Guarantee."

I'm sure your questions will be answered if you read through, if not, by all means drop me a line.


For sale I have a complete AK-74 package.

Rifle shoots excellent and functions flawlessly (as AK's are known to do) The only reason I'm selling is I'm looking to get a M1A and I already have a Couple of AR's that will fill the same role as this rifle.

Breakdown of whats included.

AK-74 built by Waffen Werks purchased last year and has 180 rounds through it.

From The Website:

These high quality AK-74 rifles are built from all matching Bulgarian AK-74 parts sets. Rifles are built to exacting standards on a new U.S. made Waffen Werks receiver. Each rifle features a brand new chrome lined U.S. made barrel properly chambered for the 5.45x39 round. They have been extremely accurate.

Rifle features a Tapco G-2 trigger set and a U.S. grip and is fully 922r compliant with all AK-74 mags regardless of country of origin. Rifles also incorporate a side rail for easy installation of scope rails or accessories.

New $619.

AK-74 Accessory package, 4 30rnd parts kits, mag pouch, bayonet and oil bottle. $169

2 Tapco 30rnd parts kits $24

900rnds 7n6 ""banned"" ammo. Full case $240 Since its a partial case I'll value it at $200

AK ergo grip, so you can actually hold the rifle. $20

Kvar O.D. green ""NATO"" length stock, A inch longer to fit us decadent capitalist pigs in the West. I have both the original stock and grip that will go with it. $47

""Venezuelan"" PK-A red dot. A excellent red dot that was built for the Venuzualian Army by the Russians. The great thing about this particular sight it that it uses a regular AA battery and it sits low enough to co-witness the stock AK sights. It also allows a proper cheek weld on the rifle a huge plus. $400

Total price if bought separate $1479

My price $1200. Non negotiable!

No Trades unless your looking to trade a M1A Loaded with a stainless barrel.

I will not break up the package it's all or nothing, sorry I just don't want to deal with all the hassle. I'm in no hurry to sell, I really have no need to sell just trying to diversify my collection so the price is the price. Don't bother contacting me saying ""I found all this stuff at the gun store for $30."" If you did, great, buy it. Don't bother telling me.

You want to do the Dealer thing you line it up, and cover the fees.

I wont travel out of the Denver Metro area so I hope your local or willing to travel.

Sorry to come off like a dick, but I think we all know how this site can be sometimes."

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel  and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

I do know that the  Glock barre for THIS gun is $200 and the stainless is $300 and the ported Glock barrel runs anywhere from $250-$200 new. I am NOT asking new prices. I have found people asking $200 just for the barrels used. The gun alone is worth about $625. To give you perspective on how I price Glocks, the 29 in the picture if I were selling it..I would ask $480. This is a total package that I will not break up. Factory Glock mags are $25. Again, you get the gun, 3 barrels, 6 mags, comp holster, 4 comp mag holders, Glock comp carry bag"

The receiver is grooved to take clamp on scope mounts. Scope attached is a Tasco 4x15, perfect for sighting varmints and small game. 

Stock Configuration & Condition: The one piece stock is solid WALNUT (not a laminate or picture of walnut ), with impressed checkering on the pistol grip and the forearm areas. The comb of the butt stock is Monte Carlo style and there is a Marlin hard black plastic butt plate with white spacer. The stock is fitted with sling swivels, sling is attached, and has the traditional Marlin ""Bullseye"". The LOP measures 13 ¾"" from the front of the trigger to the rear of the butt stock. The stock has no chips or cracks and no marks. The stocks rate in about EXCELLENT PLUS overall condition.

Overall Condition: This rifle retains about 99% of its metal finish. The balance of the finish shows wear at the sharp edge of the scope mounts. The Screw heads are sharp. The markings are clear. Overall, this rifle rates in EXCELLENT PLUS condition. 

Mechanics: The action functions correctly. Rifle has been fired about 50 rounds each year, for 37 years, and will hit a dime, dead center, at 100 yards. Cleaned and oiled every 6 months and after each years test fire for 37 years.

There is also one unmarked black magazine which functions correctly. Also comes with a Weather Shield tan leather carry case, model # 1291, Made in the U.S.A., also in EXCELLENT condition. 

Assessment: This Marlin looks as if it may never have been fired, but since it was, I can not sell it as new. Stored it very carefully in a humidity controlled display case in Michigan with other collectables. This rifle appears ""like new"". Chambered in .22 W.M.R. this rifle is an excellent gun for pests or small varmint control, particularly when out fitted with a scope. This rifle will make a fine present for a young man learning to shoot with the best rifle he will ever own, or for a collection piece of Marlin Rifle history. The price can be adjusted for the right buyer (Vietnam Veteran ""ARMY"")"

Beretta USA JMP8D25 Pico 380 ACP 2.7"" 6+1 Black Poly Frame/Inox Slide

Super thin, ultra conceable, and easy to configure, the Beretta Pico sets a
new standard for the micro compact carry pistol. The Pico is the thinnest
.380 auto made by a millimeter. The Pico's snag-free slide and frame is a
true 18 mm at the widest point. The grip frame, sights, and caliber are all
simple to modify. (It can go from a .380 to a .32ACP by changing the
barrel.) Extremely soft shooting with a double action trigger, the Pico is
easy to control with its smooth, tip-to-parallel, straight line action. The
removable, serialized sub-chassis and modular frame feature simple
disassembly for easy cleaning and customizing. The  dovetail quick-change
sights can be adjusted or replaced by the user. Light, durable, and easy to
draw from concealment, the Pico brings all the reliability and quality of a
Beretta to bear on its standing as the leader of a new generation of
concealed carry firearms.

I'll start at $1,100 in all cash or $1,200 in trade and see where it goes.

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  Not in need or really looking for anything on trades, but I will consider trading only if the deal makes sense on my end, otherwise, I want cash at this time.

Below are trades I might consider, many of these would serve as back-ups, but I like having multiples that use the same mags and parts.  I will consider other trade offers of course, just let me know the deal.

FN SCAR 16 and 17 or nice AR uppers in 5.56, .450 Bushmaster, maybe .50 Beowulf

Beretta CX4 9mm 92FS mag model preferred, but I can do the mag conversion cheap, so will consider the PX4 model also, maybe the .45ACP model too.

Kel-Tec PMR  

AK-47 rifles and pistols, all makes and models will be considered, depending on the value you put on it.  On the AK pistols, I prefer the PAP M92 and C39 as both models are over 10"" barrels, but again, I might consider shorter barrel models, depending.

Semi-auto rifles, SKS (Norinco & Russian, maybe Yugo), all caliber Saiga rifles and shotguns(converted or not), PSL, FAL, AR-10, AR-15 and variants.

Semi-auto pistols and revolvers, again, will consider all makes and models, depending on the value you place on it.

May consider shotguns and bolt-actions.

Quality higher power range scopes, quality red dots and magnifiers maybe.  Sig arm brace for AK pistol, maybe for AR pistol.

Ammo in the popular calibers to help make a deal happen, but I have plenty already, 308/7.62x51, 7.62x39, 7.62x54, 5.45x39, .223/5.56, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 Mag, .44 Mag and .22lr.

Ftf in or around Garland area, but I do make trips to Arlington and Lewisville area on occasion.  Must be legal to own a firearm in TX.  Will ship if needed."
