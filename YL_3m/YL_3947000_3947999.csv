there is some flat black paint on various parts of the plastic from when I was young and dumb when a group of us kids were attempting some camo on our .22's.  I did not try to take it off as I didn't want to risk dulling the original nylon stock underneath.  there are 3 small scratches in the buttstock as seen in the pics.  
this is a 50 year old rifle that has been back and forth over most of this country over the years.
this rifle will come with over 1300 rounds of Federal and Remington .22 ammunition.
note:  approximately 150 rounds are .22 short, which WILL NOT cycle in this rifle.

This gun was definitely used a lot.

Authentic Colt, wood grips.

Bore is ""dark"". Not sure if it's corrosion, buildup or pitting. But the gun shoots great either way.

Has an upgraded Wolff recoil spring. Will also come with original spring (it was bent).

Here are some of the new upgrades: 

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1). 

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design. 

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it. 

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant. 

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail. 

* It has a lightweight, quick detach bipod with modular feet. 

* It has a monopod as standard equipment instead of having to pay additional and add as an accessory; this is a big help so you do not have to support the weight of the rear of the rifle with your own strength. It also allows you to dial the elevation of where your aiming up or down with the monopod with even more accuracy so even if you don't want to upgrade you may want to ask about adding a monopod. 

*The case it comes with from the factory is an upgrade from a Pelican case to a nicer Storm case. The Storm case is much easier to open and close, and you don’t bust your knuckles on it, and the case features padding inside instead of bare plastic. 

Features: 

Suppressor-ready muzzle brake. Lightweight quick-detach bipod with modular feet. Accepts M1913 accessory rails. Thermal cheek guard. Modular hand-grip mounted on M1913 rail. Model:M107A1 Caliber:.50 BMG Operation:Semi-Automatic Rifling Twist:1 turn in 15” (38.1 cm) Magazine Capacity:10 Rounds"

These are early model Chinese that were manufactured on Russian tooling and are all milled.  This one is all matching, including stock.  The bluing has worn above much of the wood line, but there are no corrosion issues or rust.  This is probably due to the rifles being military stored in heavy cosmoline.  This Type 56 has had a thorough cleaning to remove all grease and has been appropriately oiled upon reassembly.  The stock shows some obvious character.  Some people choose to refinish stocks.  I, on the other hand, believe every nick tells a story and do not.  As the new owner, will you leave it with that ""been there, done that"" battle look?  Or will you refinish in a beautiful blood red?  The bore is pristine and mirror.  Carried a lot, and shot little.  I purchased two of these and have decided to let one go in order to make a little space.  This one has functioned 100% and is a blast to shoot.

Hand Guard: Troy 9"" VTAC Battle Alpha Rail (free floating)
Scope: Bushnell AR Optics 223 Reticle 1-4x 24mm

The total cost of the rifle came to just over $2000. I have fired about 500 rounds through it, and it functions flawlessly. I took it to a gunsmith to have the chamber headspace checked, and it passed. The magazine release is the CA compliant ""bullet button"".

I am also including (2) 10-round Magpul mags, 100 rounds of CBC 62gr FMJ (not green tip), a Magvault AR lock, a Fenix flashlight with remote switch, and some cleaning supplies.

I am asking for an even $2000 cash, and buyer pays for the transfer. Feel free to email me with any questions."

Wear includes blueing worn off the tip of the barrel and typical marks from basic use. The wood, including the checkering, is in good shape. The only ""issue"" with the gun is that a previous owner obviously added a coat of polyurethane to the wood and never fully refinished it so you can see some brush strokes in the stock if you hold it right. I tried to get a pic of this but most of the time it looks just like the grain of the wood. The problem is just cosmetic and is fixable with a little effort. Overall the gun still looks good, the wood is dark with nice character and it shoots great.

This 597 is the HB edition which stands for Heavy Barrel. It has a shorter but thicker barrel and a green composite stock.

I also purchased and installed (as well as sighted in) a red dot sight/reflex sight.
The rifle shoots spot on and was sighted in at about 25 yards. It's a very fun rifle to shoot, and doesn't jam. I've fired maybe 150 rounds through it without a problem.

I regularly cleaned the rifle after shooting it, and it has always been stored in a gun cabinet. Overall I would say the condition of the rifle is ""like new"".

Uncle Sam took control of the S&W factory to speed up production of the 1917's under US contract, stamping logos was cut to save time and money and not reintroduced until control was given back to S&W.

To be almost 98 years old, the overall condition is very nice. You can see rubs on the cylinder from being shot many times, but thats what this model was made to do. The grips are possibly original (correct medallions) to the gun but have been modified/altered by a prior owner.

The Millennium Pro pistols offer many improvements over the standard models, but were introduced as enhancements to the originals, not to supplant them. Pro counterparts have now been released for nearly all of the original models. Some features of the Pro line include optional increased magazine capacities, larger and easier to operate controls, a single-action/double-action trigger mechanism on some models with reduced trigger travel and an improved smoother and lighter trigger pull, an enhanced frame, and an improved more ergonometric grip design. Other Pro improvements include the contrast enhanced Heinie ‘Straight-8’ sighting system, as well as optional night sights, a loaded chamber indicator which can be felt as well as seen, and a feature labeled 'posi-traction' which consists of an alteration to the number and layout of the slide serrations resulting in an improved gripping surface.

Features a lightweight polymer frame, the Millennium Pro weighs in at only 22 ounces. The thin profile makes it easy to carry every day, and the ramped 3.2"" barrel is capable of great accuracy. The newly designed Millennium Pro may be the ideal concealed carry handgun. The Millennium Pro also showcases high-profile sight and an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges provide added comfort and easy concealment.

The Millennium Pro also features many intuitive safety devices. Complete with a loaded chamber indicator, manual safety, Taurus Internal Security System, and an automatic trigger safety.

Reason for selling my baby AR is to buy my 16 year old baby daughter her first car without using credit. I will also throw in the following items so that way you can be ready for the Zombie Apocalypse or any other Apocalypse.
