This model has a 4"" barrel and adjustable sights.  This model is also fitted with a wide target hammer and a wide serrated target trigger and rosewood grips.  This seems to be a fairly old model 19.  The condition is mediocre, there is light surface rust over some of the frame and cylinder.  The chambers also have a coating of surface rust.  The bore is dirty but free of rust, and the grips are worn but undamaged.  The real shining point of this gun however is the smooth action.  The trigger pull is smooth and light with a crisp break, and the cylinder locks up tight.  If you are looking for a revolver to shoot, not a safe queen, this is an excellent choice.  With a little TLC and a rebluing job this could be a great competition revolver or range gun.  The price includes a 50rd box of Winchester 158 grain JHP.

The Colt Mustang was manufactured from 1986-1997 (10-12 years). The nickel finish was discontinued in 1994 (only 9 years).

My gun was made in 1992. This particular gun rates very high on my list of collectibles! I've always been partial to nickel plating because I live in the deep south where the humidity can be 80% (not good for blued guns).

The .380 Colt Mustang is ideal for concealment due to it's size and design.

Many states that issue pistol permits today, require that the handgun be concealed. Concealed Carry Weapons (CCW) by necessity are generally smaller in size and lighter in weight.
What's my opinion on minimum caliber? The number one (really the only) qualifying factor is environment. I have a .32 semi-auto and a .32 revolver, both of which I feel very comfortable carrying in my environment. The follow-up question that always arises when talking about minimum caliber is, ""which is more important, caliber or shot placement""? Given the opportunity for optimal shot placement at very close range, a .22 or .25 caliber can be as deadly as a .45. Again, I think the environment rules.

In all honesty, I can imagine a lot of environmental situations where anything less than a .357 or .45 would be uncomfortable.

In order to make this gun even lighter, Colt installed a plastic guide rod. I purchased an after-market steel guide rod and put it up.

Although this gun has never been fired (except the test fire at the factory), I have carried it daily for the last 10 or 12 years. This gun is 21 years old. I paid $750 plus $25 shipping and $25 transfer fee for a total of $800 in 2001. I wouldn't sell this particular gun less than $1550, because I've yet to see another nickel finish, unfired gun in the box with real mother of pearl grips from the factory, for sale on any of the online auctions that I monitor. The grips alone are worth $500 on the market."

The Knights Armament SR15 MOD 1 rifles are hands down the hottest selling Knights rifles to date. There is nothing that needs upgrading on these fine rifles.

SR-15E3 IWS CARBINE MOD1

The latest evolution of our SR15 16” Carbine now features an improved URX 3.1 with a longer overall length to allow for better muzzle stabilization. This alteration allows for reduced weight by removing the commonly unused rail section of the system. It also allow shooters who prefer a thinner rail diameter the ability to still mount accessories on the front end of the weapon while providing a comfortable grip. 

E3 Enhanced Bolt

The E3 Enhanced Bolt from Knight’s Armament features a number of components designed to make this bolt the most durable and reliable bolt available. It is a proprietary bolt specifically designed for our SR15 and 16 models. The E3 Bolt boasts several features that add to the its overall performance such as the enlarged bolt face, rounded lugs, reduced cam pin, and proprietary extractor and firing pin designs.

This E3 Bolt is manufactured with an enlarged bolt face that provides more positive engagement in the chamber and lugs which are rounded to help to reduce chipping, cracking and snapping. This strengthened design helps to increase the life of the bolt and ensure a proper seating each time the weapon cycles.

The E3 Bolt’s extractor design is also a unique achievement that helps to provide an extremely reliable component. It’s shaped like a rounded ‘T’ and sometimes referred to as a ‘butterfly’ shape. The pivot point of the extractor is shifted forward to help balance out the extractor and apply constant pressure on the shell which reduces cases of extraction failures. Another strong feature of the unique design of this extractor is the use of two full size extractor springs, as opposed to the standard micro spring. This allows for a reduction of relative compression while the extractor is in motion and provides a failsafe in case one spring fails. The bolt will continue to function properly and afford a user the opportunity to continue with their mission or firing schedule.

The E3 Bolt is designed with a thinner Cam Pin and Firing Pin whose overall size has been reduced. The thinner Cam Pin allows for a thicker bolt web which is a common failure point in normal bolts. The reduction of the Firing Pin size is to accommodate the thinner Cam Pin.

The full capabilities of the E3 Bolt are realized when exposed to full auto or extremely high cyclic firing rates yet the bolt performs gracefully under casual firing conditions. This component was designed to be exposed to the most stressful and unrelenting conditions and exceed expectations for durability and service life."

Physically, it has a shorter grain size, therefore, the designation SC or short cut.

With the smoother flow characteristics comes more uniform charge weights, while the individual grains orient more compactly, creating better loading density.

I believe it was an LEO gun but has little wear on it inside or out, so it probably was carried a little and shot even less.  Has new Trijicon night sights and comes with 2 sig 12-round mags and 1 13-round which I think is a Mec-Gar. I stippled the center of the back strap for a better grip but you could easily smooth it back out or replace the grip. It's a great gun, highly accurate even in my hands and I hesitate to get rid of it but I just don't use it much. 

Looking to see what trade offers might be available.   Interested only in pistols, primarily 9mm, .40, or .357 Sig. Would be especially interested in CZs, Walther PPQ, Glock 17L or 34, or possibly other. Would also consider something like a Ruger LCR in .357.   I also have some .40 ammo I could work in for the right trade. 

FTF in Nashville area only. Thanks for looking."

This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its intermediate-length trapdoor buttstock to its removable four-port muzzle brake, every component of the SLR-101S is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SLR-101S rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver:

Each SLR-101S receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability.

SLR-101S Features:
100% new-production parts and components.
Bulgarian hot-die hammer forged receiver, bolt, bolt carrier and double-hook trigger.
Cold hammer-forged 16.3” barrel from Arsenal’s Bulgarian factory, built on Steyr manufacturing technology.
Hard-chrome plated bore and chamber.
Removable 4-port muzzle brake with 14x1mm left-hand threads.
AK scope rail.
Intermediate length US-made 10” trapdoor buttstock. (Total length of pull 13.4”.)
922(r) compliant with US or imported magazines.
Substantially extended service life over other types of assemblies.
The rifle has been lightly used.  Low round count... under 500.   Its comes with OD green furniture, Hogue pistol grip, 1) 30rd  magazine, OD green canvas Arsenal Bulgarian sling, and for additional cost a Circle 10 Bulgarian bayonet with scabbard.

THIS RIFLE COMES WITH AN EXTRA LOW MASS BOLT, PELICAN CASE, EXTRA SPRINGS.

The LRP-07™ was designed as a .308 platform to cure the shortcomings of existing rifles and still handle like an AR-15. Machined from billet with all the attention to cosmetic perfection that appears in our CTR/SCR design, this rifle utilizes a self-folding, left-side charging handle that affords additional leverage and makes it unnecessary to dismount the rifle to charge or clear it. The felt recoil impulse on the LRP-07™ is also nothing short of amazing as it was designed from the magazine well up to use our Low Mass Operating System (LMOS™). Equipped with the JP Modular Hand Guard System, the LRP utilizes our standard 2"" diameter tube (rather than the larger tubes common to .308 platforms) surrounding a JP Supermatch™ barrel available in lengths from 16"" to 22"". Once in your hands, you will find the LRP-07™ to be the best rifle in its class—just what you’ve come to expect from JP.

These are perfect for a multi purpose AR rifle, It can do it all, and do it all well. The MRP platform is the most flexible AR on the market, loosen two bolts, remove one and slip in another rifle caliber, if the new caliber takes another bolt face size just change the bolt carrier group (BCG) re-tighten and go shooting. This process requires less than four minutes and no gunsmith knowledge. We started with the MRP upper and added the 16"" SS barrel with a Mid-Length gas system for accuracy and portability, The rifle length upper allows the use of a day optic combined with a night vision or thermal sight without running out of rail. This makes it a great tactical rifle for LE or hunting varmints. We then chose to have an ambi safety for full control and the two stage trigger that will allow for precision shots on target. A true LMT SOPMOD stock with waterproof battery storage and buffer extension with drain holes even make this rifle suited for waterborne operation. The rifle includes backup iron sights (BUIS), Torque Wrench for quick barrel changes, Sling, Mag and rail covers. This rifle is also great for 3 gun or any tactical rifle competitions."

Olympic Arms began as Schuetzen Gun Works (SGW) in 1956, manufacturing barrels in Colorado Springs, CO. In 1975 the company moved to Olympia, WA. In 1982, SGW changed its name to Olympic Arms. In 1987 Olympic Arms acquired Safari Arms of Phoenix, AZ. As of 2004 the Safari Arms product name was discontinued.

This pistol is becoming hard to find and will only go up in value."

Only possible trades would be a Ruger LCP or Kel Tec P3AT with added cash.  !! Please read full details below !!

As this sits, it is a 9mm, equivalent to a model 17.  In actuality, its a model 22(.40) which has the stainless, threaded 40-9 conversion barrel from Lone Wolf.  Works great as a 9, but if you pick up a factory .40 barrel, you can have a two caliber gun.

Gun is clean, not shot often.  Only area of note would be a small, well done cutout mod below the last finger notch on the frontstrap (see pic).  This was for an aftermarket, extended magwell.

Lone Wolf barrel is slightly extended and threaded for a compensator.  A thread cap is included.  This is a stainless 40-9 barrel, which allows the 40cal to accept a drop-in barrel without changing the ejector.  This allows the gun to go back to a .40, simply by switching the barrel.(old barrel not included).

Will include 600 rounds of Remington UMC 115gr Jacketed Ammo and a 25 round box of Hornady XTP HPs.  Also, a Midway tactical pistol case, with mag pouches on the outside and a roll of 25, full sized B-27 Silhouette targets.

It is chambered for the .38 Special cartridge and is fitted with a 4-inch (100 mm) barrel,The Model 15 is an incredibly accurate revolver. It can easily hit a paper plate at 50 yds with little practice, and 2-3"" groups at 25 yds. With a moderate amount of practice, you may be able to hit a plate out as far as 100 yds. It's certainly not unheard of. The revolver was built around the 158 grain bullet weight, and that's most common in .38 Special ammunition. You can safely shoot any +P rated ammunition you find. It'll increase the wear on your pistol, but for most of us we'll never shoot enough ammo to notice the additional wear. The 4"" barrel is perfect for carrying and especially comfortable in an outside the belt holster. This revolver is well suited for a home defense pistol with jacketed hollow point bullets too.
