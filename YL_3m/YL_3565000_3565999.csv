Only flaw on gun is a few small nicks along left side of barrel and magazine tube with faint patina (browning of blueing)--not rust.  I found out from previous owner this was done by one of those clamp-on sling swivel mounts often used on these type rifles.  This gun is exceptional looking otherwise and is enviably accurate.  Beautiful black walnut original stock has perch belly forend and has only the most minor marks (2-3) on the entire stockworks.  Also have one full box of Win. 170 grain bullet ammo from the late 80s mint, and 50 fresh reloads from never yet fired virgin Win. brass with Speer 170 bullets, and 16 sized, primed twice fired, ready to load Win. cases.  Those are the 16 cases I used to test load and find a super accurate one.  This rifle has a clean and shiny apparently pristine bore and is a rarity.  It is in impressive cosmetic condition, and is as accurate or more so than any Marlin out there.  Ballard rifling was simply the best in these guns.  Will also sell like new Lyman dies for the rifle and the ammo supplies mentioned.  Also mounted on see-thru mounts is a mint Leupold 2-7x33mm VariX-I scope that includes original box, cards, etc.  $675 for gun Wide-View scope mounts and scope.   This is an awesome setup.  Reason for parting?  I'm reduced to small game hunting due to arthritis issues."

I have for sale a basically brand new Kriss Vector Carbine with 2 magazines. The rifle has less than 100 rounds through it and needs a new home.

It comes with a brand new Aimpoint Pro optic (400 brand new) and a discrete covert 511 backpack so you can move it around in public without people freaking out (125).

Vector- 1950.00
Aimpoint- 400.00
511 Covert- 125.00
Official Kriss hand grip- 65.00

I have only fired about 20-25 shells through it but the patern/accuracy with buck/slugs seemed to be just fine from close range out to 25yrds or so.

I purchased this Glock 22 NEW on Mar 12 2014, test casing is dated 12/10/2013.

I bought it to jump on the Glock bandwagon & I've come to find out that it's just not for me. It's a fantastic weapon & the customization options are just about endless but the rectangular grip is HORRENDOUS. As much as I want to keep this weapon, I've chosen to let it go because I can never get a comfortable grip on the pistol. Just doesn't mesh well into my hands. Feels like the Glock is trying to take a bite out of my palm every time I fire the weapon. Since owning the Glock I've bought a S&W M&P .40 & that weapon is a dream to shoot!

New Owner will get:
-Original Glock Box
-9mm Ported Stormlake Barrel
-.22LR Advantage Arms Conversion Kit
-9 Magazines in total (2 .40 mags, 3 .22LR mags, 3 9mm mags, & 1 357 mag

.40 rounds fit & feed just fine in the 357 mag. Never had an issue running the 357 mag in the Glock 22.

I've only taken the Glock out to the range about 5 times. Shot about 250 rounds of .40, 300 rounds of 9mm through the Stormlake barrel, & less than 500 rounds of .22LR through the advantage arms conversion.

The Advantage Arms conversion kit works great with CCI Mini Mag, Remington Golden Bullet, Remington Thunderbolts, & Winchester 525. Blazer .22 can be hit & miss but if you want to work on clearing malfunctions all day then I'd recommend American Eagle .22

AMMO NOT INCLUDED, images posted show ammunition because I always keep all my mags loaded."

I have a few 80% polymer lowers (reinforced around the critical areas, such as the buffer tube) with the jigs (guides that clamp on over the lower to show you exactly where to drill your holes) and screws needed. These are the G150 model (2nd gen) and normally run $100 plus shipping. They do not include any drill bits (I can include one new set of the drill bits and mill bit for an extra $30).

These are perfectly legal to transform at home into an AR-15 rifle or pistol lower without needing to get the manufacturing stamp from the ATF. No serial numbers, which is why they're sometimes called ""ghost"" guns because there's no way to track them. It only requires a drill or Dremel (drill press is easiest, or you can use a mill), and being polymer it's a lot faster and easier to drill and hollow out the requisite spaces than aluminum to make a lightweight gun to add to your collection. All you have to do is drill/cut out the red part in the fire control pocket and drill the holes as indicated on the jig and you'll have a stripped lower for your project.

Because the .22 LR round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time, it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue, .22 silencers must be disassembled for cleaning and regular maintenance.

Until Silencerco introduced the Sparrow 22, the only .22 silencers that could be disassembled for cleaning required a cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds. However, often the components of those silencers would be fused together and unable to come apart. Competitor products on the market have baffles in their .22 silencers that must be removed by twisting the outer tube around the baffles and/or sliding the outer tube off of the baffles. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the outer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the outer tube, there is simply too much buildup of fouling and lead to remove the outer tube in that manner.

Rifle is in good condition for its age and shows some use of being an honest hunting rifle. Someone at some point left cleaner on it or something and it removed some bluing from the receiver. There are a couple of other spots where the blue is wearing thin as well. This has the microgroove barrel and the bore looks great on it. Some light scratches here and there on the stock.

1989 Browning Hi Power Mark III Standard (9MM) with adjustable sights.  As you can see by the pics, this pistol has the Pachmayr grips-- I have the walnut grips to go with it as well.  I do not have to let this gun go, I have three BHP pistols and can afford to trade for what I want or just keep it.  It is not a safe queen, but it has been well taken care of.  Cleaned after each firing and new recoil spring each year.  I'm estimating about 500 rounds through it.  Will come with two 13 round mags.

Magazine disconnect has been removed.  If you want it you can have it, but I will not reinstall.

If you know your firearms, you know what this gun is worth and how fine the craftsmanship is.  This model has the FORGED frame, and with all BHP pistols it is a natural pointer.  NOTHING feels like a Browning Hi Power in the hand."

Ammo shown NOT included.***  Reasonable offer may be accepted on a very uncommon, clean, nice little late 60s-70s Star ""Hi-cap"" SM Super with 3 magazines.  Great little, accurate pistol.  Like a mini 1911 Colt but flatter and much easier takedown--one flip of a lever on the right side.  Very smooth trigger.  The gun was parkerized and then black nitride coated years ago.  Has the pop up red loaded chamber indicator, 2 extra magazines - 3 total (one still in unopened package), walnut grips (one stained slightly lighter than the other, adjutable rear sight, bore is bright/shiny no flaws.  One oddity is that with the pistol cocked and locked, pulling the trigger acts like a decocker dropping the hammer to half cock.  Otherwise the pistol functions fine, is reliable and quite accurate.  It is about the best flat small pistol feeling in your hand that I've ever felt.  Many people seem to agree with that and it's ""Hi-cap"" designation years ago (8+1) made it very popular.  I believe any buyer would really enjoy this pistol.  May consider a trade (cash adjustment depending on your item) for a 20, 28, or 410 shotgun??"

Hogue Wraparound Rubber Grips are the perfect choice for the shooter that is looking for a sleek grip that is both attractive as well as functional. This grip is manufactured from a soft durable rubber and features a lightweight, synthetic skeleton making the rigid interior of the grip. The synthetic insert is chemically bonded to the exterior rubber grip insuring that the grip won't delaminate or come apart. Hogue uses a cobblestone (stippled) surface on this grip instead of traditional checkering for a modern feel and excellent grip control in any condition. The finger grooves on the front of the grip are an affordable alternative to frontstrap checkering and are preferred by many competition shooters for rapid, accurate shooting. The material is solvent and oil resistant which means it will not deteriorate or dissolve due to cleaning your firearm."

Inline Fabrication offers several upgrades for your Hornady Lock-N-Load AP progressive press that make your reloading more enjoyable. One of the most popular upgrades is Inline's Ergo Roller Lever with its unique design it makes loading easier on the operator. The secret to the Ergo Roller Lever is its series of bends and the ball bearing roller grip. The first bend in the lever design orients the shaft so it runs parallel with the rest of the press linkages, the 2nd bend opens up access to the right side of the shellplate at rest position, the 3rd bend creates a downward action for ultra-smooth priming operation. When the lever is in the down position, bends 2 and 3 bring the roller handle up from the factory position so you don’t have to lean over or drop your shoulder to get the full upstroke of the press. The levers are lathe cut & threaded, then black powder coated. The roller bearing handle is very comfortable diameter to grip and a dream to use."

This rifle has only had 80 rounds down the pipe and comes with a 50 round and 30 round magazine. I have also attached and sighted in a Simmons Red Dot sight for the rifle and will come with 120 rounds. The 5.7x28mm round is extremely light recoiling and very fun to shoot and the rifle is completely ambidextrous. Both the charging handle and safety is available from either side and the cases eject from straight down. The Federal ammo for this rifle only costs $23 for a box of 50, so it costs about the same as a .45 acp pistol to shoot. The gun itself is a dream to shoot as it can easily stay on target for all 50 rounds with minimal adjustment since it recoils like a 22lr. Standing and firing rapidly (2-3 shots per second) at 25 yards you can easily make a grouping of less than 2 inches. The trigger also suffers from none of the common bullpup issues and gives most other triggers a run for their money. All original papers, box, and lock will come with this rifle as well. The weapon also breaks down in less than a minute and is very easy to clean and maintain. I can be reached by the contact seller button or by text (preferred) or phone at REDACTED.

This is a Para Factory Show Gun & traveled to vendors. Although show guns are typically New in Box(Unfired) I cannot verify that. All indications are that it has NOT been fired. Comes with everything as new from the factory except for only 1 mag, including original Para box, lock & manual. I can probably dig up another mag. I bought this stainless one & a black nitride and decided to keep the black. Original MSRP(Suggested List) is $919. Here is how Para describes it: IF DECIMATED TARGETS ARE THE ONLY FRILLS YOU NEED... Everyone should be able to own a PARA 1911. Case closed. With that in mind, we offer up our Expert Series. True to the PARA way, all are hand tuned on a bench and test fired. And each features match-grade barrels, crisp triggers and loads of firepower. They’re built to the highest standards of our craft, with a few less features to keep costs down. Standard Features: 5” Match-Grade Barrel, Green Fiber Optic Front, Double-Stack Stainless Steel Frame, Oversized, Flared Ejection Port, Beavertail Grip Safety, Skeletonized Match-Grade Trigger, Stainless steel, Polymer Grips, One 14-Round Magazine. ***Factory LIFETIME Warranty** Para's are commonly used in competition shooting. You cannot beat Para's reliability and accuracy. I have personally shot hundreds and hundreds of rounds through Para's and NEVER had any kind of failure. Always amazed at the accuracy. A TRUE tack shooter.
**I am open to trades BUT it must be fair, no BS. Also, I will need a few pics, very good description of what you have and what your offer is specifically.
MUST ship to your FFL, no exceptions, unless local.

Beautiful wood, floated barrel, trigger tuned and set to 4 pounds, and as good a shooter as you'll ever find. Bought the gun while my Uncle was alive and had his gun shop. It was a present for myself after a long deployment at sea. Bought some cheap Super X ammo to break in the barrel and cleaned after each shot for the first 10 then shot 3. The first 2 touched and the third was about a 1/4 away from the first 2 at 100 yards. Cleaned the barrel again and fired 3 more. Same results but the group actually tightened up a bit. Zeroed the scope with 2 more shots that both touched and haven't fired it since. Hunted 2 or 3 times that year with it then it found a home in the back of a safe where it has been since that season ended after a thorough cleaning. My 2011 Blue Book of Gun Values shows the value at 900$ back in 2011, page 2156. I paid right around 800$ a couple years before that ( I got it at dealers cost). The scope ran about 250$ with the Leupold bases and rings around 50$. Probably shoots premium ammo even better than the Super X but I never fooled with it because a 3/4"" gun with off the shelf ammo is about as good as it will ever get, regardless of all the BS you read and hear about. Fact is, I'm just a little too old to hunt as much as I used to, a litte too busy to hunt as much as I want, and collected way too many guns over the years and I'm just reducing the entire inventory to one safe. I'll keep a couple favorites but I'm letting the rest go. Fact is, the gun looks new, the scope is flawless with a lifetime guarantee, the wood is beautiful, the bluing is deep and rich as a deluxe model should be but I just don't need it. Life is too short to hunt with an ugly gun. Hunt with a beautiful American crafted work of art today and leave your son, daughter, or grandchildren with an heirloom they will be proud to own and show, whether they hunt or not. It is doubtful that you will ever again find a gun of this quality, for this price, that functions this well. And I have never, ever, seen a Winchester gun go down in value and Model 70's will be collectors items from now until we are both long gone from here. The price is firm for obvious reasons and I can't hold it. First 900$ cash takes home a gun you'll love forever."
