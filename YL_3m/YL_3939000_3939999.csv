Realtree APG pattern stock with ComforTech.  I have 2 additional 3-round magazines (3 total), and I added the Extra-High comb (cheek rest) to the butt-stock.  I have the one that came with it also.  ARGO gas system reduces recoil tremendously and this one has a Crio Treated barrel.  With factory ammunition (180g Federal Trophy Copper), this gun holds sub-MOA groups at 200yds (1.84"" avg).  With hand loads, Avg group size has been 1.15"", close to 1/2 MOA.  Took this rifle to British Columbia for Elk Hunting.  Selling it because I built a lighter weight hunting rifle.  I can provide hand-load information (bullet, case, primer, powder, MEPLAT measurement, COL, etc.) that worked well with this rifle on request, but will not include any hand-loads for liability sake.  I will, however, provide 2 full boxes of Federal Trophy Copper 180g (I think I have another half box that will also come with it).

Currently Mounted is a 6-24x50 Illuminated Reticle 2nd Generation Sniper Scope. 30mm tube, Mil-Dot reticle with external knob 1/8 MOA click adjustments.

Excerpt from Benelli's R1 Brochure online: ""Benelli’s R1 big game rifle features simplicity, strength, and ingenious design. It’s built around the patented Auto-Regulating Gas-Operated (A.R.G.O.) piston-driven system.  A.R.G.O. piston-driven system provides significant recoil reduction.  ComforTech stock works with A.R.G.O. to take the sting out of magnum loads. [Recoil similar to my .243 bolt action] Picatinny rail mounted for optics.""

A.R.G.O. Auto-Regulating Gas-Operated
This piston-driven Auto-Regulating Gas-Operated (A.R.G.O.) system was designed for and approved by the U.S. Marine Corps.

Crio Treated Barrel: Cryogenically treating a barrel relieves stresses caused by hammer forging, creating a smoother and more uniform surface. Benelli Crio® barrels pattern better and they stay cleaner longer.  The Crio® System takes a barrel to -300° F.  

Specs from Benelli:
Product # 11775 ; 24″ barrel Realtree APG®, ComforTech®	46″ overall length,  7.3 lbs.	$1,249 MSRP

Asking $1100 which is less than I paid for the rifle alone...I will leave optics in place, 2 full boxes (and a half?) of ammo at $55 a box, 2 extra magazines ($70 a piece), and Extra High cheek comb ($75 additional, and original included also).  I will put more pictures up tonight when I get home, but I will give as many pictures from whatever angle requested by serious inquiries.

This rifle retails for $2300.00 SR-15 IWS E3 CARBINE MOD 2 The Knight’s Armament Company SR-15 line represents the pinnacle of firearms based upon the Eugene Stoner designed operating system. The Mod 2’s 16” chrome lined, 5.56mm NATO barrel is manufactured to military specifications, and features a proprietary mid-length gas system that increases reliability and durability while also reducing felt recoil. An improved E3 round-lug bolt design both enhances function and increases bolt life far beyond the industry standard. An ambidextrous bolt release, selector, and magazine release offer left-handed users the ergonomic advantages inherent to AR15-based controls, as well as giving right-handed users alternative methods of manipulation to increase efficiency of movement. The drop-in two-stage trigger serves double duty as an aid to long range precision marksmanship while enabling surgical speed shooting at close range. The Mod 2 update introduces several notable features to the SR15 IWS line: a URX4 handguard with Keymod accessory mounting points for-ancillary device attachments increases cooling characteristics and reduces weight and bulk compared with standard 1913 rail attachment methods. A Mod 2 gas system with a proprietary design minimizes leakage and ensures more consistent operation in harsh conditions. A gas block secured with a locking ring instead of taper pins increases barrel rigidity and eliminates the need to custom fit the gas block to the barrel. Included parts and features, such as the two-sided receiver end plate QD sling swivel mounting point, collapsible six-position SOPMOD stock, hybrid ambidextrous selector lever, and folding 200-600 meter sights, round out the package to deliver a cutting-edge carbine right out of the case."

Early Eastern Bloc AK-47 Bayonet and Scabbard new unissued condition.   These were some of the first AK-47 Bayonets issued for Russian, Bulgarian, Polish, Romanian, etc.

The AK47 Bayonet

The AK47 assault rifle was introduced during a period where the bayonet's future was in debate. In the decade following the outbreak of the Second World War, most of the major powers produced an infantry rifle without the ability to mount a bayonet. Without a single exception, every one was redesigned to accept a bayonet or or replaced with a rifle that did within a few years of its introduction. The AK47 was Russia's entry in the bayonet debate, being designed without a bayonet lug. Rather than add a bayonet lug, the Russians opted for a bayonet that did not require one. The AK47 hilt design borrows heavily from the Swedish M1914 bayonet, another example where the bayonet was an afterthought. The blade was patterned after the the Russian M1940 bayonet for the 7.62 mm. Tokarev SVT–40 self–loading rifle. Although adequate as a bayonet, the dual muzzle-ring arrangement made the AK47 bayonet awkward, at best, for any other uses. The scabbard is a smaller version of the later type used with the Russian M1940 bayonet.

Those buttstocks are Romanian manufacture. They look like the PSL/Romak but are for AK style receivers.. The buttplate is spring loaded. You need to use a c-clamp to compress the metal buttplate to the wooden buttstock. Place the clamp next to the pin that holds the sling swivel. You can then work out the swivel which holds the buttplate onto the stock. You will find springs inside the buttplate. Here is one on my Maadi 20 inch barrel rifle. Have fun!

From Kel-Tec website: ""The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge.The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters.""

Lightly used Daniel Defense MK18 10.5 Factory Complete Upper Receiver with DD Bolt Carrier Group, Noveske KX3 Flash Hider, original DD Flash Hider, Magpul BUIS Front and Rear as well as the original box. Originally purchased for an AR pistol build that I wanted to eventually register and convert to an SBR, however due to the fact my wife is making me sell excess toys for an upcoming Home Purchase, my dreams of a sweet MK18 clone are now essentially dead. This upper has only been on an AR pistol lower with less than 100 rounds down the barrel. 

-About The Law-

Very important section regarding legalities: ALL NFA RULES APPLY. That's it. It is your responsibility to know the law, and to follow the law because in all seriousness I am not a lawyer, I do not play one on TV, and I certainly will not play one in real life on the internet. Research and make a responsible decision to follow the law.

If you don't know what the NFA is, you are probably new here, in which case - welcome, we have all been waiting for you. Allow me to be the one man welcoming committee tasked with the ever important job of keeping you safe from the very real risk of becoming a very bad person. The NFA protects us all from devices known as Short Barreled Rifles (SBR's), Machine Guns, Destructive Devices, ""Silencers"", Any Other Weapons (AOW's) and pretty much any other cool thing that lowly civilians such as ourselves could never possibly be trusted with..... That is, unless of course, you happen to have $200 that you could make payable in the form of a check to the ATF,  a pen to fill out an ATF Form 4/1, and the patience to wait 9-14 months for the return of your approved Form 4/1, because if you did - congratulations, my new friend, you have joined an elite super group of citizens deemed worthy enough to have one of the aforementioned cool things I just listed out for you. 

However, (this is the most important part) IF YOU DID NOT DO ALL OF THOSE THINGS, you cannot have/build or posses components with the intent to manufacture those cool devices I told you about. If you do, you do it at your own, very significant risk and you are probably an idiot. The ATF does not mess around, and neither do I, so please read and understand the law. This will get you started.

-About The Transaction-   

With all that said, I am Asking $900.00, Photo ID and your signature on a piece of paper that basically says you understand the NFA and that you are purchasing this upper. Before you freak out, I am not the NSA, and I have read 1984. I am doing this because lawyers exist and because I prefer to cover my ass when I sell things. 

Why all the other stuff? Because I want to be sure this item is sold with the full understanding that depending on your intent, this item could get you in trouble. 

Will I ship to other states you ask? No.

 I will entertain realistic and/or respectable offers. (Read: I don't want your mother's second ex husband's old Mosin Nagant, I certainly would not like that $50 Gift card to Applebee's with the Christmas tree on it you got from that awkward guy at the office that you don't really like who keeps giving you things in the hopes you'll add him on linkedin, or, whatever, and I don't need handyman services, because really I don't.) 

The ARMSLIST regulars know what I am talking about there. 

-About the Lister-

Don't let my listing fool you, I'm like Mr. Rogers, except nicer. I sell stuff on here occasionally when my wife tells me to (because she's just hot as hell and cooks better than I do so I kinda have a lot to lose in that department) and the people on here can be pretty ridiculous when it comes to offers. I care about you. Buy my stuff."

Both pieces are in excellent condition. Here is the description of the Night Brake from Manticore's website....

Machined from 8620 steel with a black oxide finish and heat treated for a life of hard use, the Manticore Arms Yugo M92 NightBrake muzzle compensator is designed specifically for the 26x1.5 left hand thread found on the muzzle of the Yugoslavian M92 and M85 Krinkov rifles and PAP series of pistols.

The NightBrake is designed to reduce felt recoil and virtually eliminate muzzle rise, and can safely pass any projectile up to 0.311"" (0.30 caliber) in diameter, making it a universal muzzle device fro both the M85 and M92.

A total of eighteen ports distributed around the uppper 270 arc of the device help stabilize and reduce exiting gas pressure.  There are no ports facing directly upwards to minimize flash in the line of sight, and the lower 90 degree arc has no ports to precent a dust signature when fired.

The Yugo M92 NightBrake flash hider is 2.125"" inches long, adding only 1.125"" to the overall length of the rifle- it is over an inch shorter than the standard M92 muzzle booster! In addition the weight is only 3.0 ounces and is marked ""MANTICORE"" to denote a U.S. made part that counts towards 922r compliance."

Very well cared for.
-True wood grips with para-chord wrap. 
-2 mags. A Bulgarian 30 rnd and Hungarian 20 rnd. 
-AMD65Tech riser has been added to the folding stem stock. This provides a positive cheek weld where there was none before allowing concentrated aiming to make a more shootable rifle. 
-Rear Tech-sights have been added changing from traditional open irons to a rear adjustable(windage and elevation) peep sight. This increases the sight radius on the rifle allowing more accurate aiming. Works extremely well in conjunction with the riser.
-A Balarius side mount with picatinny rail allows the operator to mount a modern optic. The mount does not interfere with iron sights as the peep sight looks through the valley of the rail. Difficult to accomplish on this platform. This way a primary optic can be used. However if the optic were to go down for any reason, can be removed in favor of iron sights with no further adjustment.
-K&S front cross hair sight(adjustable elevation).
-AMD65Tech loop mount for a single or two point sling.
-Troy Industries single point sling, Desert Tan
-UTG Carry Bag 
-160 rounds of ammo. (1 box Winchester, 1 box American Eagle, 2 boxes of Silver Bear, 4 boxes of Golden Bear)"

The wood has very nice figure and color thru out the stock and 0nly minor handling marks. The bluing on the gun is mint with just a minor rub on the floor plate. I know for a fact the gun has been fired less than 50 times. The rifling is perfect with very sharp lands. The rifle has been well cared for to have been made in 64.

Also comes with a Browning vintage model 1915 fitted safari case that was purchased from the same place along with a hand tooled Torel Cape Buffalo sling The case and the sling are in like new condition.

If you don't know anything about Daniel Defense 
I have the original A2 pistol grip that I can include but I sold the original stock and replaced it a tan Magpul CTR. Right now I have a magpul MIAD pistol grip on it, and also a magpul angled foregrip.

I don't know yet if I want to sell the Troy sights, the Surefire weapon light and VTAC sling...maybe if you give me a good offer. But right now I am just selling the rifle itself.

Details
The Ambush Firearms 5.56 hunting rifle features an 18” S2W® profile, Cold Hammer Forged barrel.  The chamber and rifling are created at the same time for the most precise alignment of the chamber to bore possible.  Cold Hammer Forging alters the steel at a molecular level creating the most accurate, longest lasting barrels available.  The barrels are Salt Bath Nitride treated, giving the steel the corrosion and abrasion resistance to stand up season after season.  The Ambush Firearms 5.56mm features a threaded muzzle allowing the installation of a sound suppressor or other muzzle device. 

Protecting the barrel is the free-floating MFR 12.0 (Modular Float Rail) with adjustable shotgun-inspired hand grip which is exclusive to Ambush Firearms.  The top of the handgaurd features a continuous picatinny rail for attaching optics and sights.  Included are three 3-Inch modular rail sections for mounting accessories.  These modular rail sections can be easily moved anywhere on the hanguard or removed completely.

Every sportsman has a duty to make clean shots on their game and a crisp 2-Stage Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA®) Trigger, gives the shooter an advantage delivering precise fire to the target.

This wear doesnt reduce the efficiency of the tool though. The tool still has multiple lifetimes of use in it. I will attempt to show the bit of damage to the tool in the pictures. Im getting rid of it because it gets loaned out to other people way more than I use it. The tool retails for about $680 new from major online retailers. Considering the wear and tear on the tool I think $230 is fair."
