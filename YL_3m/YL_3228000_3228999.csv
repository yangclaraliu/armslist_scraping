It's in very good plus condition with at least 85% of its original blued metal finish. There is absolutely no rust, other corrosion, or pitting on the metal anywhere. 

Wood is in nice shape too without any cracks or splits. The walnut is nicely figured making it attractive. 

Numbers match and the original ""US FLAMING BOMB"" proof-marks are intact. 

Perhaps the best feature of this rifle is the excellent condition of it's bore. There is no pitting or rust at all, and rifling is strong. Many P17's have issues with their bores because of the corrosive ammo that was used during the time these rifles saw service. I feel quite certain the barrel is original to this rifle as the Flaming Bomb proof mark and date of manufacture (5-18) is stamped on top of it just behind the front sights.

There is also an original US P17 Bayonet included complete with leather scabbard. The Bayonet is in good condition and has the all the appropriate proof marks.

Finally there's an assortment of 30-06 military ammo that goes with the rifle: 

(5) 20 round boxes of FMJ Ball ammo by FN loaded on stripper clips.

(2) 20 round boxes of Red Tracer 

(2) 10 round boxes of M64 practice ammo with plastic bullets. This is quite rare and collectible. 

I'm asking $850 for everything. Rifle is local sale only to a Florida resident, and buyer must be at least 18 to purchase.

The reason it is considered ideal is due to its completely unique safety system, namely the ""squeezecocker"" control surface built into the front of the grip. When the operator picks up the firearm, the main shooting hand instinctually squeezes the panel rearward, and this action cocks the striker rearward while unlocking the sear for use. The panel is spring-loaded, which means when pressure is reduced, it snaps forward, decocking the striker and locking the trigger. This system is also designed to release the slide when it is locked rearward. This design eliminates the need for a decocker, external safety lever or slide stop lever, making the sides of the firearm completely flush and reducing overall width. The barrel is fixed (does not cant upwards) which means despite the firearm's compact size, it is capable of printing groups of 2 inches or less at 25 yards. This accuracy is easily comparable to many high-end automatic pistols in production. It has classic three white-dot sights dovetailed into the slide. I purchased it New in 1996 and have fired approximately 400 rounds through it without a single jam.Will include extra mags and nice holster.OREGON Residents ONLY"

This would be a sweet deal at $350, I am letting mine go for $300 with holster and spare mag.  Why buy a used .380 for more money that is of a lesser quaility with no spare and no holster when you can have a better made, totally reliable crafted weapon with spare mag and holster for less. These pistols are known for accuracy and reliable service. Will feed Russian ammo with no issues.  Easy break down for cleaning.

Barnett Ghost 410 CRT Mossy Oak Camo-Sling, Quiver, Scope

Weighing in at just 7.3 pounds and only 19 7/8"" Axle to Axle, this bow is no doubt a game changer. It may be lighter and faster than its predecessor, the Ghost 400, but the 410 has maintained some of its most impressive features. Like the 400, the 410 features Barnett's proprietary Carbonlite Riser Technology (CRT), which shifts the balance point away from the riser and back to the shoulder of the shooter. Barnett's unique patent-protected, ultra-light, super-strong Carbonlite riser boasts an incredible 5-to-1 safety factor and provides the perfect balance of weight and speed.

Features:

- 43% Lighter Riser with our Patented Carbon Riser Technology
- Finger Reminders and Pass-Through Foregrip
- CNC Machined Aluminum Flight Track
- CNC Machined 7/8” Picatinny Rail

This scam has been posted many times and flagged and shut down many times.  Ask the supposed ""seller"" to provide a picture of the serial # on the scope and their original proof of purchase to prove ownership-they won't because they have neither as they stole the picture from another website and they cannot take a picture of something they do not actually have.  

The criminal is using the e-mail address ""REDACTED"" and their user name is ""Dan Dupre"", but judging from their numerous spelling errors and syntax mistakes, they are not a native English speaker.  For example, he asked me for a copy of my FFL to buy the scope...uhm, you don't need an FFL for a scope. He also balked when I requested a picture of the serial number on the scope itself and his proof of orginal purchase.  He could not provide either because - wait for it- he does not actually have the scope.

Ask them for their residence mailing address, e-mail address and phone number and ensure they all match and are consistent with one another.  You can file a local criminal case with the police if they scam you and have the police subpoena the phone company and the internet provider to determine their exact physical location (i.e. their residence) which will lead to their actual identity for prosecution.

Also, ask them for their paypal account for a money transfer as paypal protects you against fraud and acts as an escrow service.  Or, use safefunds.com, an established third party escrow service which protects both the seller and the buyer. But let me guess, the ""seller"" will insist on using a money order (don't ever do it) or wire transfer to a bank account (don't do it).  However, do post whatever information they give you here on Armslist to help prevent further criminal activity which undermines the purpose of this website and the mainly honest patrons who use it."

The Tavor SAR Rifle is lightweight, compact and ergonomically designed to become a natural component of the soldier. The Tavor is the most modern weapon technologically wise, based on a complete and manipulative platform which highly increases the performance capabilities of the soldier.

The weapon is ambidextrous and can be easily adapted to right or left handed shooters. The weapon has an ergonomic structure and is made of composite material; therefore, it is very light. The Tavor SAR rifle was developed in close collaboration with Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The Tavor has been chosen the weapon of service in the IDF infantry troops and Special Forces as well in many countries around the world. The constant use of IWI’s weapons enables the company to design its products accordingly, optimizing its features to face the modern way of combat.
