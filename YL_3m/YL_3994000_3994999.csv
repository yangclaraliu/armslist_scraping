17,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3994017,For Sale:  50 BMG Ammo APIT & API,"Off the Mt Rose Hwy, Reno, Nevada",$ 179,"Listed On: Saturday, January 30, 2016",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"These are non-corrosive, boxer primed reloads that I bought to shoot through my Browning M2HB Machinegun but I'm selling it too.  I have both APIT & API (armor piercing incendiary tracer).  These were demilled and reconstructed by TNW and they did a fairly sloppy job.  Some of the rounds wobble when rolled on a table as the bullet may not be centered properly. Though clean and sure-fire, I wouldn't use them in a single shot or semiauto rifle.  They run great in a machinegun (looser chamber tolerances) and are labeled ""for machinegun use only"".

I think for now, I'd like to sell these for pickup here in Reno as I don't know how other states restrict API/APIT ammo.  I know they're a felony in California.  In Nevada, it is unlawful to shoot tracer or incendiary ammo over vegetation, so they suggest the Black Rock Desert as the closest place to shoot near Reno.  You may want to avoid the Burning Man festival out there every Summer unless you have permission.  Due to the extreme fire danger, you must impress me that you have a responsible use for these or I'll refuse the sale.

27,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3994027,For Sale:  Vector V51P 7.62x51 HK clone,"Carnesville, Georgia, United States","$ 1,000","Listed On: Wednesday, February 4, 2015",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,Pistol,"Full disclosure. I've had this gun for over a year, and it has never worked right for me. My local gunsmith has tinkered with it constantly. Between him troubleshooting, and me test firing and providing feedback, we never could figure it out.  The most recent tests yielded less than one failure per mag of 20rds. So, she's at 95%. I expect that's as good as it's going to get in his hands, and i am not paying him to do any more work with it.  As you can see in the images, the rollers would attempt to protrude and lock, when the bolt is on its recoil path. This caused several dimples along the length of the rails. As with a lot of Vector guns, the receiver pressing is not in spec. The rails are not squared, as they should be. I don't believe this to be the sole issue, as I have seen Vectors with the same incorrect pressings have no problems. So, if you fancy yourself a Vector/HK expert, you may be able to resurrect this guy.

It's got a FAB Defense rail on it. The original handguard will be included. The front sling attachment loop had to be removed, for the FAB rail to fit.

The trigger housing is a PTR unit. The trigger pack is the same one i received with the V51, when i purchased it.

The rubber on the charging handle is tearing slightly. Other than that, the overall finish on the gun is good.

I had this gun as an SBR. It has since been removed from the registry, and is a pistol.

I have a G3 collapsible stock for it, if you wish to make an SBR out of it. The stock is missing a snap ring, which will need to be replaced for proper function. I would recommend a solid stock, actually. Collapsible stock = PAIN.

Well, here's hoping someone can provide a good home. Asking $1,000.00 for the gun. $1,150.00 if you want the stock too."

 Smith & Wesson did a trigger job, and it's really smooth.

 I broke my right hand and wrist in a motorcycle accident, and discovered that I can't shoot it even with 44 Special ammo without a lot of pain where the breaks were. My hand is too busted up, so I can't use it.

 AJI has a used one, exactly like this one for $850 Plus Tax. Yes, this one has the lock you either love or hate.

 This one only has six total rounds through it. I will sell it with the rest of the box of Hornady ammo I bought with it along with the box and everything that comes in it for $850 or best reasonable offer and no tax.

 I live in San Tan Valley, and I can meet you at Hunt Hwy and Bella Vista.

 No trades please. I already bought a 9mm pistol that I can actually shoot with my band hand and not want to cry like a little girl.

This I copied off the internet - your search may turn up more info:
“There are about 250 truly un-issued/new M59/66A1's that made it to our shores and survived.  About 500 of these new manufacture M59/66A1's came in with a shipment imported by I/O.  Workers at I/O have informed me about half were sold before the fed's realized they were not surplus military. The half that was unsold was cut up and sold to Numrich as parts. The half sold was grandfathered but technically are not C&R as surplus M59/66A1's are.
These ""new"" Yugo's can be recognized in the following ways. 
Only the receiver and stock have a serial number.  All other parts are un-numbered. 
The serial will look like 10001A through 10600A stamped in large numbers and letter.

The ""P"" proof mark is located near the magazine release and on top of the slide, in front of the rear sight. Cross cannons ordnance mark on the right rear of the frame, to the right of the hammer pin.

This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1942 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped in May of 1942. It is stamped with WB inside a Box for Colonel Waldemar S. Broberg, Hartford/Springfield Ordnance District, Army Inspector of Ordnance: July 1, 1941 - June 16, 1942. The WB inspected pistols are a little more rare for that time frame.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. But not all pistols back then were stamped with ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted national match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by the military, as the barrel has been re-stamped. This gun is in its original time frame finish (parkerized). All Proof markings to fit era. Bore is excellent and looks shinning.

This pistol is a shooter. It is amazingly tight and special fitted for accuracy. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection.

It has a little chips in the paint on the front bezel but other then that it is a little beast and throws an extremely tight light pattern in front of the gun with a little light spillage so you don't get that huge shadow from the end of your barrel.

I only have the paddle holster left but they sell the attachments for the molle gear and other holsters.

The connector is coyote brown and the holster is black in case matching is a deal breaker. IF you just want the holster and not the locking mechanism you can easily remove it and the holster will just be a BLACKHAWK Serpa holster again in all black.

You can throw this rifle in the mud and youd lose it. Or in the woods. ( I've done it while training)  it has a cold hammer forged barrel which means itll last for 10's of thousands of rounds.

Frog lube after heating it up on the gun parts (bcg, etc) bond to the metal on a molecular level after consistent use and can essentially end up being dry fired while not having mechanical issues. I have shot 40 rounds thru it. Also the camo can be removed with nail polish if wanted. Or it will come off with handling. The military does the same thing. They paint per enviroment.

This one has the Power Custom hammer/sear kit and extractor kit.  Also fixed the bolt release so it doesn't suck.  I was originally going to go crazy on this one as a build project, but it turned out to be such a nice shooter that I didn't want to ruin it and left is like it was.

There have been just under 300 rounds through this one.  That's not the typical B.S. number either, I'm anal and keep a spreadsheet with round counts for every gun.  Price includes the rifle, the parts listed above (about $60 worth), a 10-round magazines and the red dot/reflex sight, which I think is a Sightmark brand.  If you don't want the sight, I'll knock off $30.  If you need ammo, I'd toss in 250 rounds for another $20.

Must be willing to meet at a public place in the Green Bay area and show a drivers license.  No felons or under-age folks, please.  Cash only, no trades.  My schedule is a little crazy, but should be able to work something out.  

I figure you'd be at about $400 to buy this stuff new, after taxes, transfer fees and all that.  More like $900 if you shop at Gander Mountain.  So buying this is like putting a $150 bill in your pocket.  You can't afford to not buy this!"

Just shoulder the 935 and you immediately appreciate the seamless integration of stock and forearm to receiver. Built to handle the hardest hitting 3"" and 3-1/2"" payloads, this is a shotgun that doesn't hold back on features either. A self-regulating gas system vents excess gasses to aid in recoil reduction while eliminating stress on critical operating systems. Features include over-bored barrels, an ambidextrous thumb-operated safety, custom stock spacers, a Uni-line stock and receiver, a quick empty magazine button, a cocking indicator, and a wide ventilated rib.

The pistol comes with the box and papers (in German), and 1 magazine.

From wikipedia:
The only difference between the P6 and P225—the P225 (which was adopted by US civilian law enforcement) has a lighter trigger pull, whereas the P6's trigger pull is heavier. The P225 has tritium fixed sights; P6s had fixed sights only. Genuine P225s manufactured for the West German Police will have a ""P6"" stamp on the right side of the slide. A new police standard was adopted in Germany in 1995, and the P225 is in the process of being replaced. German police pistols can be identified by the hammer, which has small ""ear"" or ""hook"". According to section 7.7 of the German manual, the cutout is the Deformationssporn, which means “deformation spur”. This was a requirement of the West German Police for all their P6 pistols, to alert police armorers if the pistol was dropped on its hammer. Many of these surplus German police pistols have been imported into the U.S. recently. Because of its compact size, the P225/P6 is quite readily usable for concealed carry. In U.S. states where standard capacity magazines were prohibited, the P6/P225 was usually in high demand."

Buffalo Bore Ammo - PREMIUM 35 WHELEN SUPERCHARGED 225 gr. SPTZ-BT (2800 fps) - 20 Round Box







Again, as per customer request, Buffalo Bore has developed two new 35 Whelen loads. Item 42A features a Sierra 225gr. SPTZ-BT bullet @ 2705 fps out of my Remington 700. (24 inch bbl)  At the expected impact velocities, this bullet will mushroom readily, but hold together on large game like bull elk. We recommend this load for use on smallish big game (like whitetail deer) through Yukon Moose and Bison. However, on very tough (other than broadside) angling shots on large big game, we recommend the use of our item 42B, which features a 225gr. Barnes TSX bullet @ 2654 fps out of the same rifle. The TSX load is a bit slower than the Sierra load because the long-for-weight all copper TSX uses up more case/powder capacity than the shorter Sierra bullet of the same weight.

If you desire the deepest possible penetration from an expanding bullet in 35 Whelen, the 225gr.TSX bullet delivers. It will out penetrate a 250gr. typical premium partition bullet, but gives the advantage of higher velocity, flatter trajectory and reduced recoil of the lighter 225gr. bullet. You can use this TSX load for bad angle (quartering or going straight away) shots on the largest North American big game.

This ammo is designed to be the highest quality, most powerful/versatile, 35 Whelen ammo, in the world. It exhibits sub MOA accuracy in our test rifle."

It’s the newer style with the eject notch.  Serial no. is a 406 number. I no longer need to load huge amounts of ammo quickly which is what this set up is all about.  I have a lot of extras with this set up so you should be pretty much ready to load most any common caliber when you get it. No dies are included.  Here’s the deal:  I’d rather not fool with shipping. I live in Andalusia and have an office in Montgomery. Pick up in either of these locations is fine. I also travel the state so perhaps other pick up arrangements are possible. This will save me a lot of trouble packing etc, and it will save you from me adding shipping to the cost. I am not really interested in any trades. I prefer cash, certified check or US Postal Money Order. I will not split up the package, its all or none. You can always sell the stuff you don’t want, further reducing your cost. The price is firm and came off of Midway and IN-Line Fab web sites. Midway prices for the press and case feeder are sale prices by the way. You get:

I have an ever expanding collection these days and it's time this gun found a new home.  The gun shoots great, feels good in the hand, and is well balanced.  Again, this is not a collectors item.
