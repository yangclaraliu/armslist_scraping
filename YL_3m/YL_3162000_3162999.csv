The other barrel is a 30"" ribbed hunting/skeet barrel with an adjustable choke.  It has a Blackhawk slide grip and stock.  The stock is pistol grip with an adjustable length stock.  The cool thing about the stock is that it has a recoil dampening system built into it, so it keeps the recoil level instead of the usual barrel rise.  I paid 200 for the barrel, and 150 for the stock, so I think the price is more than fair, but I am open to offers, I just need money more than the shotgun."

Taurus Model 809 Semi Automatic Handgun 9mm 4"" Barrel 17 Rounds Black Checkered Polymer Frame Black Tenifer Finish. The Model 809 was derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going. Lightly used.

First manufactured in 1936, the ""Target Special"" was Daisy's first bb pistol.  It fired a smaller bb than a standard bb gun (.118 caliber as opposed to .177 caliber).  It did not sell well because most dealers didn't want to carry a second size bb.
In 1937 Daisy put the ""Target Special"" in a box that could be used as a target for indoor shooting, but stayed with the .118 caliber bb.  The new box had a wire which was placed between the sides and held 2 metal spinning disks.  The guns that were manufactured between 1937 and 1942 were blued steel and  had fixed rear sights.  They had ""Targeteer"" printed on the box, but the guns were stamped ""Target Special"".
As with all of their metal gun models, production was halted during World War II due to government regulation, but after the war they resumed production of the set.  On the postwar version, the target spinners were blued instead of painted red.  The graphics on the box appeared the same, but the style of the box was slightly different.  It had a flip top instead of removable top.
In 1948, Daisy chrome-plated some fixed-sight Target Specials and presented them to factory guests to celebrate Daisy's 60th Anniversary.  Today, these limited edition guns are very rare.  Also in 1948, they added an adjustable rear sight and completely changed the appearance of the box (graphics, box color, etc.).  The guns were blued and were still marked ""Target Special"".  The box still said ""Targeteer"".  In 1949 they began manufacturing a nickel plated ""Targeteer"" set with a red plastic ""Targette"" which had white playing card symbols as spinners.  Daisy continued making both the blued version, now also called the ""Targeteer"", and the nickel / chrome plated ""Targeteer"" versions until 1952.  In 1953 they made a painted version.  Some of the 1953 models were stamped ""Target Special"" and others were stamped ""Targeteer"".  After 1953 production was halted on all of the ""Targeteer"" and ""Target Special"" models which used the .118 caliber bb.  Instead, Daisy started manufacturing a ""Target Special"" which used a .177 caliber (standard size) bb."

With 16"" extended pinned barrel/permanently attached muzzle device (as per BATFE Rule if you install a full stock, or folding stock so won't be a Class 3/SBR gun).

Overall, the barrel and all is 16 1/2"". With a U.S. Machinegun brand stock adaptor installed (pictured). The wood stock set (upper & lower handguards, and pistol grip - is a copy of the famous Yugo ""fat"" wood pistol grip) are finished with amber shellac stain. In addition, I installed U.S. made compliance parts; which includes extended barrel, Tapco trigger/fire control group (hammer, trigger, sear, hammer spring, and has a G2 Tapco trigger), and wood pistol grip. Installed the U.S. made parts for 922r compliance. You must be at least 18 years old, or older and a Kentucky resident with a valid KY driver's license (KY CCWL preferred) to buy/trade this gun.

Lever, New In Package","knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 0,"Listed On: Friday, November 21, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Super easy upgrade to any AR15 pattern rifle, brand new in package Magpul Battery Assist Device (one finger bolt release) lever. No modification to your weapon is made, it just mounts on the existing bolt release paddle and allows you to instantly drop the bolt after a magazine change with just a flick of your trigger finger while maintaining your grip. Will sell for $30 cash or trade for items that interest me, possible trades are listed below  

Developed from the operational experience of the Magpul DynamicsSM team, the B.A.D. Lever (Battery Assist Device) is designed to considerably improve the speed and efficiency of the AR15/M16 bolt catch. The B.A.D. Lever quickly addresses reloading and malfunction clearance shortcomings of AR15/M16 platforms by extending a paddle to the right side of the weapon, allowing manipulation of the bolt stop from the fire control/ready position with the right-hand trigger finger.

Made from milspec-anodized aluminum, the B.A.D. Lever attaches to the standard AR15/M16 bolt release without permanent modification to the weapon. Functional for both left and right-handed shooters, the B.A.D. Lever also allows traditional bolt catch manipulation according to the AR15/M16 manual of arms. All mounting hardware included.
Made in U.S.A."

I have a Kimber Pro Carry II with a custom cerakote finish.  The cerakote was applied by Performance Powdercoating which is located locally here in Columbus.  They did a fantastic job with the fit and finish.  

The frame and slide has a black cerakote finish.  The controls are cerakoted with an aluminum finish.  All internal parts were not touched and re-installed back into the firearm.  The sights were removed prior to cerakote and then installed by a professional gunsmith at Boom Boom Tactical (L.E.P.D Firearms)

This 1911 hasn't been fired since the cerakote was applied.  It looks like a brand new handgun!

The Browning Buck Mark Rifle is one of the most unique rimfires ever produced. This nifty little rifle offers everything you need: dialed-in ergonomics, fast handling and modern styling. Plus, like their namesake, the Buck Mark Rifles provide outstanding accuracy, dependable blowback operation, a crisp single-action trigger pull and magazines that are interchangeable throughout the Buck Mark line. Take a Buck Mark Rifle afield, and you’ll immediately appreciate the lightweight, compact design that comes to the shoulder fast and onto a target even faster. 

Action
The straight blowback design offers enhanced simplicity and reliability.

Frame
Machined to exacting tolerances from a solid billet of 7075-T6 aluminum. The stock structure is a part of the pistol frame, reducing weight and the number of parts.

Slide
Built-in recess and raised side panels for better grip. The convenient manual slide release is easily operated with the shooting or support hand.

Safety
Large manual thumb safety.

Magazine Release
Positioned adjacent to the trigger guard for convenient operation.

Magazine
Magazines are interchangeable with the Buck Mark Pistol. Heat treated magazine body for long-term feeding reliability and long life. Coil spring provides more consistent follower angle than typical Z-spring. 10-round capacity.

Trigger
The trigger is light, crisp and has far less creep before it breaks and far less overtravel after breaking than other rimfires.

Barrel
 features a steel bull barrel. The chambers in every Buck Mark Rifle barrel are hand-reamed and muzzle crowns are recessed to protect them from damage that could degrade accuracy."
