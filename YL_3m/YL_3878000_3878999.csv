Comes as pictured with the 20 round tapco mag and extra stock.  Also has a spike bayonet but does not come with the attachment screw.  I got this in trade for something else and have come across another I like better.  I have everything but the screw to return this to stock condition (my preference on looks as I don't like all the extra aftermarket crap, but this is how I got it).  Purchaser may purchase the wood stock and 10 round metal mag for what I have in them with the purchase of the rifle.  

I haven't shot it yet but the guy I got it from says it shoots great.  He's had a few hundred through it.  I just haven't had a chance with family, the holidays and hunting season.  The purchaser has the option to shoot this at a local ""friendly"" range, you pay for the ammo up to 20 rounds & range fee.  

Has some use, but does not appear abused.  Some rust bloom but no pitting observed.  Rifling good and crisp, bore is not dark, but I can't tell if the bore is chrome lined.  I'm certainly not a SKS expert.  Feel free to ask questions.  I'll do the best I can."

 Been looking for a carbine to go with your favorite Glock .45 ACP handgun but didn't want the hassle of trying to find one of those plastic carbines that isn't selling for 2 or 3 times MSRP? 

 If so...........have you looked at Just Right Carbines? 

 Unlike Kel-Tec's Sub-2000 which is mostly made of plastic and has those cheap sites, Just Right Carbines are made of aluminum plus the pistol grip, stock, buffer tube, and trigger components are all interchangeable with the AR-15 plus you can install any site and/or optics that will install on a picatinny rail! (sight mark open sight included and front forgrip) 

 I'm truly impressed with Just Right Carbines products. I'm the type of guy that pays attention to the little things because I've learned that companies that do so as well usually have pretty good products. Just look at how these guys package their firearms.........they wrap everything in a special corrosion inhibiting bag, place a heavy cardboard tube around the barrel, then encase everything with two layers of foam cushion. 

 The following is taken from Just Right Carbines website: 

 ""The JR Carbine is an ambidextrous, straight blowback-operated, semi-automatic, pistol-caliber carbine with telescoping 6-position collapsible buttstock and free-floating quadrail forend.

I will only meet within Huntersville after hours/weekends or possibly Shelby during business hours for a half case sale.  Full case I'll drive up to 30 mins from Huntersville.  

Please look this ammo up.  I'm selling it because I don't have anything to shoot it as accurately as I'd like.  The only .223s I have are ARs with 1:9 twists or slower.  I've read for bullets of this weight you should use a 1:12 or faster to get best accuracy.  Also, the Superperformance may not cycle ARs with gas systems shorter than rifle very well.  I make no guarantees this will work or group in your AR.  Otherwise it's rated as very good ammo.

It includes a second set of wood grips in worn condition, 2 Wilson Combat magazines (brand new) as well as the original box.  This one has been a favorite of mine for CCW purposes and I am only selling it due to me picking up a CDP II which I prefer.  It has always been well cared for, cleaned after each use and never given me a hassle in any way.  The only wear at all showing on the entire gun is at the leading edge of the barrel and is so minor that I cannot even photograph it.  It would make a wonderful addition to anyone's collection.

Up for sale is an extremely rare ""handgun"" :). Yes, this is a handgun, it's a Bushmaster Arm Pistol (or Gwinn Arm Pistol). If you've ever wondered how Bushmaster got started, your looking at it. This was Bushmasters first firearm that they produced. If you look at the Bushmaster logo that's on most of their AR's and other firearms, you'll see the Bushmaster Arm Pistol in their logo! These are extremely rare to say the least! 

This one is a great example too (with a little bit of wear, but not much at all). I have shot it, all I ever used was brass case which worked perfectly! This is a hand-cannon & flamethrower for sure! What makes this one even more special is the professionally drilled and tapped optics mount that was installed on the firearm. Originally, these had really crude iron sights (which aren't included). As you can see in the pictures, I've mounted a Bushnell TRS-25 sight on the firearm (the sight is not included). I would recommend a small sight like the Bushnell. Takes AR-15 style magazines and grips, the Hogue rubber grip I installed is included, along with the original grip. Really sad to see this one go as it's extremely fun to shoot! These are a lot better than an AR-15 with a Sig-Brace in my opinion!

I've added:
   - TR24-C-200070: AccuPoint® 1-4x24 Riflescope Standard Duplex Crosshair w/ Amber Dot, 30mm Tube. Ideal for big game hunts or anytime you expect to shoot at shorter distances, the Trijicon AccuPoint® with its patented illuminated aiming point will help you get the job done. The scope is illuminated through the use of fiber optics and tritium, providing a vivid aiming point without the need for batteries.
    - 5.56mm QDC MAMS Muzzle Brake Kit:
    The KAC 5.56 MAMS (Multi-Axis Muzzle Stability) Brake has been engineered to increase controllability, to significantly reduce felt recoil, and to help mitigate a rifle's flash signature as compared to traditional muzzle brake designs. The MAMS is a neutral bias brake that combats both muzzle rise and drift upon firing. Depending on the gun's barrel length, it can reduce felt recoil in a 5.56x45mm gun by as much as 67 percent. The 5.56 MAMS is compatible with KAC's Quick Disconnect Coupling (QDC) 5.56mm sound suppressor line, and comes complete with a 7-piece shim kit and installation instructions. 
   - 45 Degree Offset Folding Micro Sight Kit, 300 Meter
  The KAC 45 Degree 300 Meter Offset Folding Sight Kit allows shooters easy access to a set of backup iron sights for close range target engagements without the need to remove their primary optic. The sights attach securely to the 12 o'clock rail position and, once deployed, a quick roll of the rifle is all that's needed to acquire a useable sight picture. When not required the sights fold neatly to the right of the rifle's top rail. This Offset Sight Kit includes a fixed post, 300 Meter Micro Rear Sight and finger adjustable Micro Front Sight assembly. For right hand use only.

Yes, I'm aware the gun new is $325 or so, depending on where you buy it. I gave $340 for mine because I'm in a small town. It would have cost me more in gas than I would have saved. These guns aren't hand crafted. They are put together assembly line style, and sometimes you don't get a great trigger like I like. If I buy a gun to keep, I have it tweaked to MY standards, as in this case. I had a trigger job done on it, they honed the original seers instead of throwing in some crap off eBay. I had the feed ramp polished, a tighter hammer to keep down misfires, and lightened the recoil on it so it could have a bullet racked in just by using the rear sight and my boot one handed. That will keep me in the fight if I get shot in one of the arms. I'm losing money at $395, bit that's the way it goes. If your interested in the gun, email me. If not scroll past and find one that has been shot 10,000 rounds for $50 bucks. This one has been shot less than 25 times. It's not even broke in yet."

The rifle was factory refurbished at some point and all parts have matching serial numbers. Visually the weapon is in excellent condition and mechanically it is about as close to factory new as possible. Notice I did not say ""original"" because if I needed a screw, I would simply upgrade to stainless steel and not worry because it was not the ""original"" part. There are no critical component reproductions used in the rifle because none of them have ever failed and show little to no sign of wear. After every use I disassemble the rifle completely, clean, lube and inspect all parts. I even remove the firing pin and polish it, but not for looks. This is not an SKS for the collector but the one that is to be used and depended on when needed. Comes with the original sling and Strip Clip Ammo Belt. I also have several 30 round magazines, a couple of 10 round and probably 50 or more 10 round strip clips used to load the original factory 10 round magazine. The bayonet, cleaning rod and around 250 rounds of ammo are included. Unfortunately, I lost the cleaning kit that came with the weapon, but fortunately I have one of my own which does a far better job for my needs."
