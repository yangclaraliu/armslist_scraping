The pistol pack includes all the barrels that were available for the gun when they were made. These packs are getting harder and harder to find, especially ones that are in great condition and havent had the barrels shot out. The revolver is in amazing condition, almost new aside from the fact that I shot the gun a couple times. 

The 2.5, 4, 6, and 8 in barrels all included are in beautiful shape, with no scratches, marks, or corrosion of any type. 

The kit includes a spare grip (I believe its aftermarket made by PACHMAYR), the tool for changing the barrel, the original allen key, and the feeler guage (used to make sure the barrel is installed correctly). It also includes all the sights that originally came with it. Yellow, White, and Red. Red ones are installed on the revolver frame, and each of the replacement barrels, making for a total of 5 red barrel sights and 1 red frame sight. There are only 2 sights (1 frame, 1 barrel) for the white and yellow. None are missing, they just came with extra red sights.

Things that were not originally included but I have added are. A bore brush for cleaning, and a thread tap for the revolver frame. Ive never had to use the tap, but because it was a special order item, I ordered it just in case I ever needed it. I didnt want to run into a situation where I needed it, then have to wait a week for one to come in the mail.

Also included are the original Dan Wesson revolver instructions. Everything from a description of the revolver, maintenance and cleaning information, and how to change the barrels are covered. The instructions are in perfect condition as well and I keep them in a little case.

I DO NOT have the belt buckle and or patch that they came with.

Asking 1250. I do not NEED to sell it, so no low ball offers. Also, if your interested, have the cash to spend. Save the both of us the time if your not a serious buyer with cash to spend. I dont want endless emails and text messages just for you to have to ask your wife/husband if they will allow you to buy it. BE SERIOUS

You must be at least 21 and have an ID to purchase this revolver from me. You will also have to sign a bill of sale that includes a copy of your ID. I am not a dealer/vendor, this is only for my personal records and piece of mind. Shipping would be possible from my ffl to yours. Ive never shipped a gun before, but if it makes the deal, id be willing to ship it through my local ffl to yours."

This is one awesome little revolver. One of the most significant changes in revolver design when it was first introduced at the Ruger, New Hampshire Plant. Yes, this is an all American Made small revolver designed with Personal Protection in mind. It is not a Range Toy.
Don't mistake this as just another Small-Frame Snubnose Revolver. It is extremely lightweight at only 13.5 ounces it is easy to conceal and a pleasure to carry. It is basically the same size as the S&W Chief Special and the Taurus Model 85 and fits in the same style and size holster.
They were in fact, the first to create the Polymer Framed Revolver and now others are following suit. If you know Ruger, then you know that they are known for their durability and they did not skimp on this little protective device. There are several versions of this little gem, chambered in .357 magnum, .22LR, and even 9mm. I recently purchased the 9mm Version and that is why I am letting this one go.

Some of the features Include,
* 1-7/8"" Barrel
* .38 Special +P Rated
* Aluminum forged Frame
* Stainless Steel Barrel
* Stainless Steel, Fluted, 5 Shot Cylinder
* Hogue Soft Rubber ""Tamer"" Monogrip
* Double Action Only Shrouded Hammer

It is in great condition with a few minor scuffs from being my main carry piece. What you see in the pictures is what you will get.

For Location Reference, I am about 35 Miles South West of Savannah."

Please Read Description:

This is a PROJECT gun

Up for sale or trade is a Ruger M77 chambered in 7mm Rem Mag. and tang safety (original and current chambering) 
At some point in its life the barrel was replaced with a Remington barrel chambered for the original round. Sadly this was not done correctly, causing the bolt not to close when chambering a round. This could be easily fixed by re-barreling or getting fitting the current barrel (rifling/condition practically brand new) 
The stock has also been repaired for a rather large crack, unlike the barrel though the repair was done somewhat better - pictured below. 
All other aspect of this gun work flawlessly.

It is a standard Receiver, Underwood barrel. It is in very good condition. Bore is great.

Its also got K.A.R.T markings, and from my research ""KART"" was the mark for the Norwegian Coastal Artillery, so it was probably dropped into Norway during the German occupation. Norway then turned around and exported them to Israel, which were then exported back to 'Murrka. that's quite the round-the-world trip...

334,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3848334,For Sale:  Rare 480 Code Walther P.38,"yuma, Yuma, Arizona","$ 2,000","Listed On: Friday, December 26, 2014",Shotguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"When the German Army completed its P.38 testing with the end of the Fourth Variation Zero Series model, the P.38 was officially adopted as the German Army's standard side arm. Following this official adoption of the P.38, Walther produced the first true military P.38 known as the 480 Code P.38. The First Variation of the 480 Code of the P.38, also known as the Fourth Developmental Stage, was the last stage of research and development on this model, even though the weapon had already been officially adopted. The serial number for the First Variation Code of the P.38 begins at number 1 and progressed sequentially up through approximately number 6830, with production dates for these pistols beginning in late July, early August 1940 until late September, early October 1940.This particular 480 Code P.38 is an early serial number 646, with an estimated production date in early August 1940. This P.38 appears to have been a Russian Capture weapon as evidence by the “X,” (crossed rifles) above the serial number on the left side of the slide. From the front left portion of the slide is the nomenclature stamp “P.38.” Just to the right of the P.38 stamp is the “480” Code stamp, with the numerals measuring approximately 2.90mm tall and 6.02mm in length. The top of the number “4” is the correct ""open top"" style as opposed to the serial number “4” which is correctly the ""closed top"" style. The safety lever, which is blued, has the correct eagle over 359 acceptance stamp on the bottom flat below the serrations. The safety lever is the correct narrow type, which measures 4mm in width along the arm. The milled out safety recess area on the left side of the slide shows considerable wear. The “F” stamp retains faded red paint while the “S” retains its white paint that has generally turned yellow. The right side of the slide has the correct eagle over 359 Walther acceptance stamp, followed by the eagle over Swastika proof stamp, followed by another Walther over 359 acceptance stamp. The rear site is the correct thick type, which measures 7.10mm wide."

Melonite Nitriding treatment turns a standard chrome moly steel barrel into a very slick, hard 
and corrosion resistant barrel. Unlike chrome lining, the Melonite process is a treatment done 
to the surface instead of adding a layer of material. This treatment is done to both the inside and 
outside of the barrel. The slick surface will never peel, is thicker than chrome lining, will not 
negatively affect accuracy as chrome lining does and will reduce the amount of friction created. 
Less friction equals less bore surface wear which will extend the barrel life. Another added benefit 
is carbon does not easily adhere to this surface making your cleaning job that much easier.  This 
technology has been used by Glock, Springfield and Heckler & Koch for years and is gaining 
popularity as more companies are offering their products with this treatment."

you cannot find this gun for sale anymore.  there are a coupe fake auction sites out there that say they have sold these for 366.00 but that is 100% not true and they say that about everygun to lure you to the site.  please base prices off of gunbroker.com  that is the only acurate site if you must base off of an auction site.  these sold for $600+ when they were in stores.

the reason they are not sold anymore... gas operated shotguns will cycle through any shell clean.  most semi auto shotguns are inertia based and will only cycle through when enough inertia is made from the load.  gas ones cost too much to make when people didnt know the difference between gas and inertia.  so they decided to make 12g models that werent gas and discontinued the gas ones.  still easy to find parts for online, not that you'll need them."

The Model 66 is a mid-sized, stainless steel, K-frame .357 magnum ( which, of course, will also fire .38 specials).
This is a straight Model 66 ""no dash"", meaning it's the very first series of this model, made between 1970 and 1976.
 The pistol is in very good condition, with a few mild dings or abrasions that you'd expect to see on a 40-year old gun, but nothing horrendous, at all.
I originally acquired the pistol with a set of black rubber Pachmayr's on it, but have since put on a set of S&W walnut target grips (w/ checkering and finger grooves, as seen in the photos).
The cyclinder lock-up is VERY tight, and the flame cutting under the top strap is basically just a surface discoloration, there's virtually no etching that I can tell, indicating that it's been fired very little. The crown is perfect, and the rifling is crisp and clean.
I've fired it two, maybe three times myself, it's a great pistol, through and through, and these older pinned and recessed Smith's are only increasing in value and desirability.
 Thanks for looking......"

This is my last glock, and my last .40 caliber pistol. The gun has under a thousand rounds down the tube. The condition will speak to that, no scratches or knicks. Very clean and handsome gun. I have some aftermarkey grip tape on the handle that feels great and is very functional. Included in this purchase is the original box, the firearm, two magazines, and a box of .40 I will no longer need. The only downside to this firearm  is I do not have the extra back straps. They can be bought off sites like amazon for 25 dollars and that is part of the reason I wish to include the box of ammo as compensation so to speak. Otherwise this is a great gun and I had no issues in the time I owned it

This gun shoots great and would make an excellent firearm to introduce your kids to the fundamentals of shooting. With a single shot limitation this is an additional safety feature I would recommend when doing introductory training. The Limbsaver recoil pad is also a nice touch to help them adjust to recoil. I will only sell/trade this firearm face to face in NW OKC, Edmond. Please let me know if you have any questions. Jason REDACTED"

Shot very little out in my back yard. Spent most of it's life living in the safe. No idiot scratches.
Has factory  tritium sights that are nice and bright. Match Barrel.
If you are familiar with Dan Wesson 1911's , then you know what great triggers these have. The pistol is very accurate !!
I commissioned Sarge at ""The Finer Grain"" to make a pair of Honduran Rosewood Burl Grips that are absolutely stunning !! These are one of a kind. They actually look 3 dimensional, and the appearance changes with the lighting conditions. (These grips were $150)
 If your the kind of person that doesn't want to have that plain-jane look and want the personalized feel to your weapon this is it. Just like a beautiful watch, this is an awesome looking and functioning carry piece that will serve you well for many years.

Also included are the Dan Wesson factory grips, which really are nice pieces. I also have a set of Cocobolo Thin grips with checkering that I am including in the package. Allen head screws for grip panels.

For the utmost in reliability, there are also 2 Wilson mags. This pistol has never had a Failure to feed or eject, and has run absolutely flawless.
I also have a Kimber mag that I have not used in this weapon, but do not have any use for it , so it goes with the package.

Here is a link to Sarge's website who made my grips for me, the bobtails in the link came from the same block as my grip panels;
http://shop.thefinergrain.com/product.sc?productId=3025&categoryId=8

The pistol comes in the original case with 2 original Mag's, all the paperwork, lock, spent case package and bushing wrench. 
Truly a great weapon and investment that will be the envy of your buddies !
The Pistol runs under $1400 and the extra grips and Mags cost $250.
