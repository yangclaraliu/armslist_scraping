It's in good shape for it's age, has a couple of marks and some surface scratches but not bad for being about 50 years old. Grips are excellent, no chips. It comes with two original Hi-Standard marked magazines and two extra barrels, three total. The bull barrel currently on the gun is a 5 1/2"" and has screws on the bottom to accept weights. The other bull barrel is a 5 1/2"" also but it appears to be a smooth bore, a pretty rare barrel in itself. And the third barrel is a 6 3/4"". I can e-mail additional pics.

At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days.

The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters.

Chinese Dragunov in 7.62x51, the only exact copy of the original Russian design. Rifle is wearing the current issue military polymer stockset. This makes the rifle more accurate as wood can expand or contract depending on the weather, changing the accuracy of the rifle. The polymer set does not do this, and is what's currently in use with the military. These rifles have been banned from import into the United States since the early 1990's and will likely remain so. The website SniperCentral lists the officially adopted sniper rifles of 61 countries, and the Dragunov represents 23 of them. The next most popular rifle (SSG-69) has only been adopted by 5 nations. Coming into service in 1963 the Russian rifle has become famous. This rugged and absolutely reliable system boasts a heavy-duty milled receiver that won't stop. The reliability of the system, combined with the semi-automatic rate of fire which allows quick follow-up shots if you miss your target the first time, and the hard-hitting 7.62 caliber round all make the Dragunov the ideal sniper rifle. A communist sniper issued a Dragunov rifle in the Afghan war stated that he felt confident hitting people out to 800 yds with one shot, and vehicles up to 1000 yds. The Chinese are the only ones who made a direct clone of the Russian Dragunovs and were helped by the Russians during production. Some Chinese rifles have even been found to be re-stamped Russian rifles. The 7.62x51 version is the most accurate of them all and was only made by the Chinese. It combines the durability of the Russian Dragunov with the accuracy of the American 7.62x51(.308) bullet. These rifles can outshoot the stock M14/M1A and AR10 rifles, and the only reason they are not in any U.S. arsenals currently is because it wasn't designed by an American. With the .308 chambering and the military furniture, this is the absolute most accurate Dragunov rifle you can buy. With no more coming into the country, these are undoubtedly good investments that you can take out and enjoy. This one is in excellent condition.   I will pull add if I don't get any viable offers or if I trade it."

This is an HK MP5K, same as SP89, manufactured at HK's licensed facility in Turkey - under the MKE brand (Turkish licensed HK SP89/MP5K, built on HK machinery). This is basically an HK MP5K inside and out, but with a turkish manufacture stamp on it. Do your research, these are top quality, no longer imported to the US, and highly desirable over US made clones. This firearm was built on real HK licensed machinery.  

This mp5 is in excellent shape, runs like a top. I am willing to sell it as the pistol and one mag, just like it came from the factory, or as a package with an extra german HK mag, a low profile picatinny claw mount, nc star claw mount red dot optic, in an uncle mikes submachine gun bag, with all original papers, etc.. If you send a trade offer my way, I will be a bit more strict about the price.

Picstures are here: http://s406.photobucket.com/user/andrewschwabe/library/firearms/mke-at94k-mp5k-sp89

Asking price is assuming face to face at an FFL (this is a pistol, so it must be transferred).  I will consider shipping if we agree on a fair price and YOU COVER ALL SHIPPING costs.  

Price for the WHOLE package is $2300, pretty firm.
Price for JUST the MP5 as it came from the factory (incl. one mag, sling, papers): $2100.

The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights.

The .22 rim fire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our center fire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rim fire handguns … and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

From the Nightforce website:
""The U.S. military asked for a scope that is exceptionally fast and applicable to a wide range of targets at various distances. The 3.5-15 x 50 F1 NXS™ is the answer. The reticle is located in the first focal plane, which has distinct advantages in high-stress situations and when the user might encounter targets from up-close to 1000 yards or more. A first focal plane reticle remains in the same visual proportion to the target across the scope’s entire magnification range, making it especially appropriate with rangefinding reticles. Combined with Nightforce highly tactile and intuitive adjustments, it makes for a scope that is extremely quick, accurate, responsive and utterly reliable."""

Most varmint guns are easily recognized by their heavy barrels, bipod mounting studs and long range scopes, but they are far from being equal. The new Winchester Coyote Light is the rifle to take along for varmint and target shooting fun.

Invented in the 1850's by Benjamin Tyler Henry, this lever action rifle's
rapid fire capability and high-capacity tubular magazine stood in amazing
contrast to its single-shot musket counterpart. The Original Henry Rifle is
identical to its history-making forerunner with the exception of caliber.
Henry replaced the obsolete .44 Rimfire cartridge, exchanging it for the
.44-40 caliber. Every other facet remains true to its inventor, and each
gun's serial number begins with the initials BTH in his honor. 
he Original Henry Rifle has a grooved receiver for easy scope mounting. The
hardened brass has the same tensile and yield strength as steel. The
Original Henry Rifle also features a one piece, 24.5"" inch octagonal
barrel/tubular feed; a genuine American fancy walnut buttstock with a
hardened brass buttplate, and a classic folding ladder rear sight paired
with a traditional blade front sight. All Henry Repeating Arms products and
parts are manufactured in the U.S.A.

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns … and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

**USES BERETTA MAGAZINES**
The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price.

Distinguished by its octagon barrel and lever style loader, the 1851 contributed to the expansion of the West and the Civil War. The 1851 Navy is commonly considered to be one of gunfighter ""Wild Bill"" Hickok's favorite handguns. He was shot and killed with two 1851 Navy Colts tucked in his belt. The British government licensed the manufacturing rights and produced what is commonly known as the London Model."

I told myself I was never going to sell it, since someone put a lot of time, love, and skill into building it, but I've decided that I'll be better suited with a .223 for what I'm using the gun for, so I'm going to use this to finance another (I'm sure I'll regret selling it, but a different gun I'll actually use beats one sitting in the corner that I don't).

Savage 110 Left Hand .22-250 Remington Varmint (Intermediate 4.522"" action). 1968 build by proofmark/date code on the barrel. 22"" light varmint contour barrel, measures .585"" @ muzzle, and is basically a straight taper from chamber to muzzle (as far as my eye can tell).

The receiver/barrel/trigger guard/floorplate all wear a matte blued finish, the bolt has been polished throughout.

Period CE Bishop walnut stock with rollover cheekpiece, which has been pillar and glass bedded. I just put a brand new Pachmayr basketweave pad on it to replace the original one which was pretty firm.

Trigger is original three-screw. I've replaced the spring with one .039 dia, trigger breaks @ 1.75lb, and is crisp. I will include the original wire if you like.

I will include a Score-High singleshot follower that I modified to work with this action (their followers aren't really meant for intermediate actions, but I added a spacer to the back and reprofiled it, and it works flawlessly).

Scope (Weaver V-16 Classic), and rings (Burris Signature) are NOT included at this price, but can be made available for additional $

I will include the attached set of Redfield scope bases.

Burned up a 40 count box of Winchester white box playing around with it and sighting it in, best group was just under 1"" (3 shot) @ 100 yard, before I made the trigger better. Word of advise, stay away from the Winchester 40 ct 22-250, they are very inconsistent. Never got around to load development (I do have a recipe given to me from the previous owner you can use as a starting point), but I'm sure just about any shell would be better than what I used.

$550 (plus actual shipping from 14623 if you aren't local).

Happy to take additional pics @ your request.

Please note, I intend to use the funds from this to finance another gun I have my eye on. If the other one sells, or I decide to keep this one, I may pull the ad @ any time, so if you are interested, contact me ASAP."

Brilliant swiss engineering the highly sought straight pull bolt action a great and very accurate range toy with phenomenal fit & finish definitely a few notches above your standard mosin. Do your homework these are great shooters and are revered by the gun community. Getting harder to find and price will only increase.

Hicock45 review : www.youtube.com/watch?v=vme90gayUzc

Each of these rifles was issued to a swiss citizen for training and shooting competitions, they show their character with some wear on the stock and butt plate. barrel is clean with no damage. bluing is slightly worn at back of the action from normal use by its original owner.

All numbers match on bolt, barrel, detachable box mag, inside of the stock, and inside of the upper hand guard. 

Included is 150 rds of PW Arms 7.5x55mm Swiss GP 11 Full Metal Jacket Match Grade, 174 Grain, 2560 FPS ammo (will not separate)

Also included is the original barrel cap w/ swiss emblem, and original sling w/ swiss emblem. Sling shows lots of character and is broken in very nicely. These are typically only included with ""hand picked"" rifles and an extra fee but comes included in the price for this rifle. 

Price is Firm! You really can't do any better for everything you will get. I travel between Cleveland - Akron - Youngstown for work. FTF deals require an OH driver's license and a bill of sale.

For sale or trade, a used Xythos 2mm pinfire revolver. These function like teeny tiny firearms but are classified as a novelty by the ATF. You can however purchase live 2mm lead ball rounds from the same sites that sell the 2mm pinfire blanks and 9mm flares that are actuated by them.  This one was purchased as a set with original case. Chain for key chain is missing but gun functions %100 with included flare launcher attachment. Very neat and a great gift idea. These are no longer made are are quite rare. There is only one on gunbroker with a $150 reserve and one other person on AL sells a similar plain, break barrel version for $200. This is the gold plated version. Asking $200 or best offer or trade for ammunition, guns, etc.  Make me an offer, worst I can say is no. Thanks!"

The frame has been blued nicely and the swamp scenes are visible. The stocks have a nice finish and the butt plate is correct for the model and year. 
The barrels retain a lot of bluing, have a few very small nicks and freckling (no dents). The bores are shiny and clean. The gun shoots.
There is a small chip out of the left front of the butt stock. This will not affect the shootability.
Overall this would make a great piece to take out and have fun with, to say nothing about impressing your friends.

Price is $650.00 picked up from Midtown Houston, or I will ship to your FFL for $35.00.

Total of $731 for dealer priced parts without shipping. I'm looking to sell for $650 Shipped to your FFL (I can ship from an FFL if required by yours). I used this gun for Sportsman's Team challenge and two ruger rimfire matches this year. With a couple practice sessions before the Team Challenge, it probably has about 1000 rounds through it. No dings or any issues with the condition. It is in excellent shape and you wouldn't know that it has actually seen more than a single trip to the range if I wasn't honest that this rifle has been used a little. Clear Ruger magazine is included. Matchdot is not. By contacting me, you assure that you are legally allowed to own this gun. A bill of sale will be filled out for in state residents (Missouri) and out of state residents will need to go through an FFL of their choice. I am in Knob Noster, MO and am willing to meet anywhere from Lone Jack to Tipton Missouri. Eight four seven, nine seven five, seven two six seven is also a good way to contact me.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

I have another 4 - 12rd.(go for $65+ea. new, mine are used) used mags too, but don't mind keeping the threaded barrel and extra mags in case I pic up another USP later when I have money for suppressor and stamp, just can't do it now.

$600 in cash on the USP and 2 mags.

$920 with the threaded barrel and all 6 mags.  

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  Not in need or really looking for anything on trades, but I will consider trading if the deal makes sense on my end, otherwise, I want cash at this time.

Below are trades I might consider.  Many of these would serve as back-ups to what I already have, but I like having multiples that use the same mags, parts etc.  I will consider other trade offers of course, just let me know the deal.

FN SCAR 16 and 17 or quality AR's in 5.56, complete or just uppers(will consider barrels of all lengths) a Noveske 10.5"" or 12.5"" (let me know what gen etc.) would be cool or Daniel Defense, .450 Bushmaster, maybe .50 Beowulf.  Also, will consider quality stripped lowers and Sig pistol brace.

Beretta CX4 9mm 92FS mag model preferred, but I can do the mag conversion pretty cheap, so will consider the PX4 model also, maybe the .45ACP model too.

AK-47 rifles and pistols, all makes and models will be considered, depending on the value you put on it.  On the AK pistols, I prefer the PAP M92 and C39 as both models are over 10"" barrels, but again, I might consider shorter barrel models, depending.  Sig AK pistol braces.

Semi-auto rifles, SKS (Norinco & Russian, maybe Yugo), all caliber Saiga rifles and shotguns(converted or not), PSL, FAL, AR-10, AR-15 and variants, Tavor.

Semi-auto pistols and revolvers, again, will consider all makes and models, depending on the value you place on it.

May consider shotguns and bolt-actions.

Silver Eagles

Quality higher power range scopes, quality red dots and magnifiers maybe.  Sig arm brace for AK pistol, maybe for AR pistol.

Ammo in the popular calibers to help make a deal happen, but I have plenty already 308/7.62x51, 7.62x39, 7.62x54, 5.45x39 (7n6), .223/5.56, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 Mag, .44 Mag and .22lr.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

I have this like new 11 inch AR upper which I purchased only a short time back and it has only been to the range a few times with no more than 50 rounds down the pipe. I am considering parting with it at this time as having other similar options and other guns to shoot, this one mostly sits stored away. Also because there is a strong chance that I will be relocating out of the area, I have been thinking about lightening my load. I can offer it with or without BCG and CH or include them. If you think you have an interest, send over an offer. However, please do not waste your time insulting me with ridiculously low offers as I will not respond. I try to treat people fairly but choose to ignore and disregard anyone who in anyway attempts to disrespects me.

As for possible trades, I doubt that I would consider any at this time as I can not think of anything that I feel I must have, plus it also would defeat the whole purpose of trying to lighten my load for my future move.

Thanks for looking."

I've got over $650 invested in this package not to mention the set up time. If you have any questions about this just let me know. After seeing some other listings out there I thought I might post a few things you might want to think about and price out if you're buying your first multirotor:

How do I charge the batteries? Do I need to buy a special lipo charger? Can I charge all my batteries at once? How much are extra batteries? (you'll always want more than one) How much is it going to cost to repair if I crash? Do I need to buy a transmitter and receiver before I can fly? Will I need to program the flight controller or transmitter? How am I going to transport easily without damaging anything?

In this package it includes EVERYTHING you need and can fly right away. Yes, you can buy other things that fly cheaper than this, but there will be many more expenses down the road and you'll end up spending a lot more."

When picking up the Mod.2™, shooters will find that critical aspects of the design have been fine-tuned. Mod.2™ ergonomics are a next-level experience that you have to feel to believe and understand. The entire interface between the shooter and the gun has been updated, while retaining the Point-and-Shoot characteristics that made it famous. Key features have been tweaked and enhanced to further enable effortless shooting. And you'll find that the overall package is now more concealable as well.

Every time you pick up an XD® Mod.2™ pistol, you’ll enter the GripZone™. And while you’re there, your shooting experience will change in ways you might not notice. Industry leading ergonomics are like that. A tool should be so easy to use that you don’t even think about it until you set it down with the dawning realization that you didn’t have to work against it. 

But what is the GripZone™? Simply put, it’s every surface on the frame that makes contact with your hand. The GripZone™ has been carefully, intentionally designed to combine multiple principles of biomechanics in order to enhance your shooting experience.
