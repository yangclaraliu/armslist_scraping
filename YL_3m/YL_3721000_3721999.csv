This is a CAA Roni conversion stock/pistol chasis for Glock 17/19. This is the Gen. 2 version, NOT Gen. 1. Also, this is the model made for use with a firearm, NOT the Airsoft model. Search Amazon or whichever online marketplace you prefer for pricing on these brand new. This one in particular in NOT in new condition. There is no hard case or accessories, therefor, I am not looking to get new money or trade for it. The chasis itself is in fantastic condition, with no nicks, scrapes, gouges, or damage to the stock. It is cosmetically and functionally in great condition, however, I have never used this conversion stock and have no intention of doing so... Just not my thing. New these run about $499, I took this one in trade for the value of $300 and have never used it. 

Applying a pistol to this chasis falls under NFA regulation, and doing so then requires the proper tax stamp and registration of your firearm as an SBR. This is the law, and it would be YOUR responsibility to do such. These can be legally purchased without said tax stamp but tax stamp must be applied for and received BEFORE pairing with your pistol. Again, it is YOUR responsibility to do so. I am a private party, not a dealer."

Description

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Binary Target Legalities

Q: Are binary explosives subject to regulation under Federal explosives laws?

A: Until the compounds are mixed, they are not classified as explosives and, therefore are not subject to control. However, once mixed, binary explosives are considered to be explosive materials and are subject to all applicable Federal requirements. A person who regularly combines compounds of binary explosives to manufacturer such explosives for the purpose of sale or distribution or for the persons own business use is a ""Manufacturer"" of explosives materials and must be licensed as a manufacturer under the law. [18 U.S.C. 841 (h); 27 CFR 55.11: definition of ""manufacturer.""]

18 U.S.C. Chapter 40- IMPORTATION, MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION AND STORAGE OF EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS Section 841. Definitions

When is a manufacturers license required?

A manufacturers license is needed only by persons ENGAGED in the BUSINESS of MANUFACTURING explosives material for sale, distribution, or for business use. For example; persons ENGAGED in the BUSINESS of providing a blasting service using binaries or explosives of their own manufacture would be required to have a manufacturers license. PERSONS WHO MANUFACTURE EXPLOSIVES FOR THEIR PERSONAL, NON COMMERCIAL USE WOULD NOT NEED A MANUFACTURERS LICENSE. [27 CFR 55:11 definition of a ""Manufacturer"", 55:11]

For instance if you blasted stumps for other people you would need a Federal License. If you were doing it to your own stump on your own property no license is required."

Lightly used Remington 870 without barrel 
I bought this gun a year ago from original owner who bought it new the year before (2012-2013) original owner told me he only shot it five times( it shows) and it looked like brand new when I picked it up I've only shot this gun a handful of times mostly using practice loads/clay pigeon light shot. This gun has a pretty laminate stock with no scuffs or scratches anywhere and no rust to be found 

I bought this gun in a package deal and decided for the $ I paid I could afford to rob the barrel off this gun so I had a combo of barrels for my other 870's
Nothing wrong with this weapon it has shot fine every time , I just don't have a use for it and it's taking up valuable space in my safe 
(Pics show back side of bolt very little wear there, and guide rails on the forearm notice very little wear there as well)

Not interested in what you got to trade, cash is king,low ball offers will be ignored $200 firm
Also not interested in meeting anywhere if you don't want it bad enough to come pick it up you don't want it that bad
( also I live in the country so if you'd like to test fire this gun that would be just fine, I will even supply a few rds for the purpose)


UPDATE: I shot a dozen or two clay's last weekend 3/22/15 that's the most work this gun has done since I've had it maybe even ever."

The Ithaca is the hard to find lever action Model 66 Super Single, built in USA. Very good condition. These aren't seen that often because folks tend to hang on to them but I think it's more of a following than a rarity. Whatever it is the lever break open is hard not to like. It's a unique look and it's the fastest break open there is as you do it without even looking.
 I don't remember the year made at the moment, I'll have to look it up again but I believe these were produced from 1963 to 1978. It has the 30"" barrel. it's very accurate. I've shot trap with this a few times with great scores. I recently bought a dedicated trap/skeet gun and I need to clear some room in the safe. Asking $275 on this one.

The lower is an Anderson with a two stage target trigger. The upper has the keyhole and the barrel says R 5.56. It's a very nice gun but after I learned more I ended up building one that suits my needs and never use this one anymore. The scope and rings are an extra 100.00. The scope is a Nikon 3x AR scope with graduations on the reticle for 400 and yards. The rings are Warne rings. Btw I'm a member of Douglas Ridge Rifle Club if anyone would like to see for themselves the accuracy of this gun. Thank you

I am the second owner of the gun and it comes with competition sights, but I can't remember which brand. The gun functions flawlessly and has a historic and proven past. It comes with two 15rd factory magazines, loaded with WWB 125gr, 2 blackhawk holsters (one FDE with the serpa locking mechanism and one Carbon Fiber CQB non serpa) and a padded pistol case. Can add 3 more Mec Gear magazines ( two 18rd and one 17rd) for a total of $700 for the total package. Granted, I lost my job, but I'm in no rush to sell. Please feel free to email or text me (eighttwoeight - 434-0544) with any questions you may have. Buyer must either have a pistol purchase permit or CCW. I'm pretty firm on the price, I doubt you will be able to find a similar gun for the price. I can meet anywhere in the Fayetteville, Harnett County, Moore County, or Lee County areas."

This sight is NEW sealed in manufacturing package! The BUIS is elevation adjustable to 600 meters. Windage is also adjustable much like a standard rear sight. See pictures for more information. These are the issue sights that come on military rifles, so this isn't a cheap piece. call or text REDACTED Make offer.

Current U.S. Army standard-issue backup rear sight for 5.56 carbines and rifles. The sight flips up at the touch of your thumb. Back Up Iron Sights are just that, back up. But wouldn't you want a back up that functions at the highest level? Thats why the MATECh BIUS is preferable. Designed in conjunction with Picatinny Arsenal engineering staff and rigorously tested at Fort Benning and Aberdeen Proving Ground for durability, ease of use, and effective targeting out to 600 meters. Detent-locking lever lets you quickly range through pre-set ranges: 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550, and 600 meters. Windage can easily be adjusted using the integrated A2-style windage knob and position markers on the back of the sight for repeatability of settings. 

Bright, white, laser etched numbers and markers are clearly visible even in low light. Rugged machined steel construction ensures sight retains zero even under heavy, full-auto fire. Clamps securely to the rearmost slot of MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny flattop receiver via simple but strong locking bar and bolt. Rounded corners and beveled edges further reduce danger of snagging on other gear when sight post is down. Instructions included for adjusting front sight post height to set exact zero. Designed to co-witness with most non-magnifying optical sights.

Springfield Armory XD-S 3.3″ Single Stack .45ACP, Bi-Tone (stainless slide)

Excellent condition.  If you want a concealed carry gun that still packs a heavy punch, this will do it. 

Comes with all of the standard XD gear: 
-Padded hard plastic carry case
-XDs Holster
-Dual Mag holster
-(3) extra extended mag grip extensions
-XD interchangeable grip backstrap (to better fit your hand)
-(2) standard 5 rd. SS mags

EXTRAS:  
- (3) extended 7 rd. SS mags with their own XD grip extensions
-TruGlo night sights with the extra replacement fiber optics, including a red one if you prefer that
- Concealed Carry Holster- IWB Appendix Kydex Carbon Fiber
-approx 125 rds of ammo, mix of target and self defense

It is worth the money, there's $100 worth of extra mags, another $80+ for the night sights, $35 for the extra holster, then the ammo on top of that.  But then again, if I have to spell that out, it probably won't be worth it to you.

Caliber: .45ACP
Recoil System: Dual Spring w/ Full Length Guide Rod
Trigger: 5.5 - 7.7 lbs.
Sights: TruGlo XT TG-H3 night sights

Grip Width: .9""
Frame: Black Polymer

SAFETY:
Like all of models in our XD line, the XD-S has all of the safety features to ensure your safety and the safety of those around you while handling the pistol.

Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Trigger System
The USA Trigger System guards against accidental discharge, from dropping or bumping it, by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied.

Loaded Chamber Indicator
The Loaded Chamber Indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber.
Grip Safety
All XD, XD(M)  and XD-S models allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol.

Fail-Safe Disassembly
The XD-S disassembles just like the XD, however, with the XD-S, the disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol. Additionally, when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.

Secure Grip Texture
The “all-terrain” look of the XD(M) has proven to work so well that the texture has been enhanced for the XD-S with an even more pronounced texture to ensure your grip is always secure.

Melonite® Finish and Carrying Case
To preserve the safety and quality of your pistol, we’ve added a Melonite finish on all XD models for a deep penetrating finish that protects against corrosion. Also, our rugged case is as durable as the XD-S trademark it carries."

Chinese Dragunov in 7.62x51, the only exact copy of the original Russian design. Rifle is wearing the current issue military polymer stockset. This makes the rifle more accurate as wood can expand or contract depending on the weather, changing the accuracy of the rifle. The polymer set does not do this, and is what's currently in use with the military. These rifles have been banned from import into the United States since the early 1990's and will likely remain so. The website SniperCentral lists the officially adopted sniper rifles of 61 countries, and the Dragunov represents 23 of them. The next most popular rifle (SSG-69) has only been adopted by 5 nations. Coming into service in 1963 the Russian rifle has become famous. This rugged and absolutely reliable system boasts a heavy-duty milled receiver that won't stop. The reliability of the system, combined with the semi-automatic rate of fire which allows quick follow-up shots if you miss your target the first time, and the hard-hitting 7.62 caliber round all make the Dragunov the ideal sniper rifle. A communist sniper issued a Dragunov rifle in the Afghan war stated that he felt confident hitting people out to 800 yds with one shot, and vehicles up to 1000 yds. The Chinese are the only ones who made a direct clone of the Russian Dragunovs and were helped by the Russians during production. Some Chinese rifles have even been found to be re-stamped Russian rifles. The 7.62x51 version is the most accurate of them all and was only made by the Chinese. It combines the durability of the Russian Dragunov with the accuracy of the American 7.62x51(.308) bullet. These rifles can outshoot the stock M14/M1A and AR10 rifles, and the only reason they are not in any U.S. arsenals currently is because it wasn't designed by an American. With the .308 chambering and the military furniture, this is the absolute most accurate Dragunov rifle you can buy. With no more coming into the country, these are undoubtedly good investments that you can take out and enjoy. This one is in excellent condition. I will pull add if I don't get any viable offers or if I trade it."

I got this gun after my midtown Memphis house was broken in in 1995. I soon realized that a 28"" barrel wasn't practical for inside home defense so I sawed off the barrel.

After I took the pictures I did some more research and measured down the barrel with the chamber closed at 20"".

This gun has only been fired about ten times. It is a little dirty. There is a little rust around the muzzle where the finish wasn't coated.
