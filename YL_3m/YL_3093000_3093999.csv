Technical/Ballistics Information:

This is INCREDIBLE factory new, high-performance, precision-manufactured, SS109 steel penetrator, lead-core ammunition loaded exactly to NATO specs.

THIS IS AMAZING AMMUNITION - These are nothing like those PMC X-TAC ""light armor piercing"" green tip rounds... these are PENETRATOR rounds and have unbelievable accuracy and destruction.  This same ammo has been manufactured and sold to the U.S. and foreign Governments for use in combat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other foreign theaters of war.

This ammunition is powerful enough to penetrate up to 3mm (0.12 in) of steel at 600 meters & up to 12mm (0.47 in) of RHA steel at 100 meters. 

These rounds are not cheap range fodder.  These are battle rounds that are moisture sealed to military specifications for long term storage.  The ammunition is manufactured in Romania, by Uzina Mecanică Sadu, which is an ISO 9001:2008 (Certificate 154-C) and AQAP 2110 certified manufacturing facility.  They have been manufacturing high quality ammunition for 75 years and have been supplying our armed forces and our allies overseas to this day.

These are NOT reloaded ammunition!  These are 62 grain full metal jacket SS109 5.56NATO rounds that are brand new from the factory, boxer primed, and in a beautifully sealed brass case.  If you reload your ammunition, after you fire off these rounds you will find the brass some of the best you can use for reloading.

One magazine, Bayonet, Cleaning Kit, Oil Bottle, Instruction book. This is one of those rare and crazy rifles that completes anyone’s collection of AK variants. The Bullpup style did not catch on as they planned and only a few of these ever came into the United States. Most report are only 1,000 to 2,000 of these made it to the US. So these are now extremely rare. No collection of AKs is complete without a Norinco Bullpup. This one is numbered under 1000.

This is a new unfired firearm. The box has the matching serial number on the box. On the side of the firearm that is ‘down’ in the box, you can see that the factory finish was not great on these rifles and the black finish looks worn just from time. I have posted pictures of the bad finish spots so you can see them clearly.

This came with a 30-round magazine in the original box. In New York they were sold with ten-rounders instead. We will include both a ten and a thirty-round, Norinco factory magazine as long as your state allow it.

It was originally shipped to G. W. Shroyer and Company, Dayton, Ohio, May 16, ’25, as a blue and case colored .32-20 with 7.5” barrel. It was returned to the Colt plant sometime between then and 1937, when it was changed to a Frontier Six Shooter (.44-40) with 5.5” barrel, ivory grips with medallions, and gold plated, as evidenced by the Colt rework “&” (ampersand) mark on the right rear of the trigger guard. It appears unfired since the factory rework.

As Kopec states in his book (p. 169, 1976 edition), “… in most parts of the world the SA’s hard working days were over, and … a number of its sales after 1923 were intended as gifts, presentations, prizes or just to rekindle memories of the ‘good old days.’…” This Colt typifies guns of that nature, remaining in 95% plus condition, with only the gold having been rubbed off in spots. The nickel finish, where the gold is missing, is almost perfect (gold plated guns had to be nickel plated before the gold would adhere).

This fine Colt has been custom cased in a late 1800’s lap desk, made of hardwoods and intricate inlaid veneers. It comes with the revolver’s accessories as well as antique pen, nibs and brass ink well holders. The case also has its key and locks."

Smith & Wesson's Model 460XVR™ has the highest muzzle velocity of any production revolver on earth. The Model 460XVR™ is so revolutionary that it required an entirely new designation...XVR, X-treme Velocity Revolver.

Performance Center guns originate from standard designs or are created from the ground up. From hand-cutting and fitting to fine tuning for precision, these firearms are top performers. Products from the Performance Center are the ultimate expression of old-world craftsmanship blended with modern technology. 

The revolver has very little use, no gas cutting, or damage. I am a disabled veteran and suffer from CRPS and cannot use this revolver but will trade for others.

Circa early 1960's, second variant. Considered one of the finest true semi-auto air pistols ever made, this is Crosman's masterpiece. Just needs sealed around the valve area from what I can tell.  Completely rebuilt by myself properly, all parts thoroughly cleaned and polished including all trigger internals and the frame itself as you can see.  Brand new custom genuine maple wood target grips ($50) and a brand new custom 8"" heavy barrel ($50).  You won't find too many that look like this. Every part accounted for minus one tiny ball detent in the rear sight, not even necessary for proper function. All OEM Crosman parts minus the custom grips and barrel. Cocks, fires and feeds properly, the cam gear looked perfectly fine when I had it out.  Just isn't holding air currently. Price is FIRM, discounted as far as I'll go. NO TRADES! CASH or paypal ONLY, bills will be inspected.  Any questions just ask, I can tell you anything about the pistol."

Do you want to shoot in a more dynamic setting?

10 student limit.

The Intermediate Pistol Course is all about getting comfortable with your firearm. This course will drive the core marksmanship fundamentals required to master the manipulation of your firearm. This course will take you out of the comfortable static shooting most people do at the local range. Emphasis is taken on instilling safety and proficiency with your firearm.
This course will prepare you to properly, safely and effectively unholster your firearm and present it to a threat if such need should arise. The dynamics of shooting at closer distances will be explained and the hands-on drills will drive home the importance of the core fundamentals.
This course is 25% classroom and 75% hands-on and will have you firing your handgun for approximately 6 hours. Manipulating your firearm under new pressures and timed constraints will prepare you for the unexpected. This course will not only teach you the skills, but will also give you the confidence you need to feel comfortable handling your firearm in worst case scenarios. This course is 1 day of hands-on lecture and hands-on drills.

I am able to sell them for a low cost so I am offering them that way. hurry or miss em.
These would make great truck guns, woods guns, atv guns, tractor guns, boat guns, etc.
They are scratched, and scuffed but 100% perfectly functioning.
They would be great candidates for cerakote, hydro dipping or other coating exercises.
They can be used as is for those occasions when you don't want to get out your pretty gun because you don't want to have it get beat up or scratched.
You can use these guns as extras to loan to someone when they need to borrow one.
Ever had a brother in law show up at the last minute without a gun?
Ever had a kid show up that wants to go along shooting ,but he doesn't have a gun?
Ever have a camping trip where you wanted something to just throw in and go with?
These guns are perfect for that, just use them and don't worry about hurting them. 
The first gun is a Mossberg pump, vent rib, selec-choke with beauty marks. 
It functions fine, cycles smooth, and is the lower cost of the 2 guns.
I am firm on the price, I priced it DIRT CHEAP and I know its worth $147 to someone.
It is worth that much to me to keep and fiddle with if you don't think so.

Do you want to shoot in a more dynamic setting?

10 student limit.

The Intermediate Pistol Course is all about getting comfortable with your firearm. This course will drive the core marksmanship fundamentals required to master the manipulation of your firearm. This course will take you out of the comfortable static shooting most people do at the local range. Emphasis is taken on instilling safety and proficiency with your firearm.
This course will prepare you to properly, safely and effectively unholster your firearm and present it to a threat if such need should arise. The dynamics of shooting at closer distances will be explained and the hands-on drills will drive home the importance of the core fundamentals.
This course is 25% classroom and 75% hands-on and will have you firing your handgun for approximately 6 hours. Manipulating your firearm under new pressures and timed constraints will prepare you for the unexpected. This course will not only teach you the skills, but will also give you the confidence you need to feel comfortable handling your firearm in worst case scenarios. This course is 1 day of hands-on lecture and hands-on drills.

I traded for 2 pump 12 ga shotguns yesterday. I wont have them long at these prices.
I am offering them both at bargain prices to move them out quickly.
This is a Winchester 1300, with vent rib, checkered stocked and forearm and butt pad.
It isn't perfect, I would grade it about 85%. 
Who couldn't use an extra gun to loan to a brother in law, a neighbor , or some kid?
Don't we all need and extra shotgun that we won't cry over if it gets a scuff on it?
This gun is too nice to not enjoy, but I shoot pistols almost exclusively these days.
You can use it as an extra for a truck gun, a camping gun, a float trip gun or whatever.
U might use it an as experiment to try some of the new coating methods out there now.
No need to spend 400+ on a new shotgun when a proven winner will do the trick just fine.

Pretty decent groups now at 20 yards if you know how to properly shoot a springer.  I like this one more than any other chinese springer I've shot.  It has a very deliberate, sharp, solid feeling and sounding shot cycle.  No nasty cheap Gamo ""twang"" to this shooter when it cycles.  The machining and tolerances are very tight and clean compared to other comparable models.  This one has heft to it as a quality springer should.  The synthetic stock is very much a favorite part for me on this rifle, it is nice and chunky out front where it should be and just feels right all around including the texture of it.  The Charlie da Tuna trigger is marvelous and a game changer on this rifle as the stock trigger is horrible on this model.  Made an extremely nice shooter out of this springer.  The clunky junky fiber optic sights are removed and trashed, comes with original manual, box and a free ""spring airguns for dummies"" crash course that will certainly improve your shooting capabilities and your new airgun's life longevity.  No scope comes with this.

Now yes I know that the expiration date on QC Gauze is 6/14, but I called the guys at 
Z-Medica Corporation and they explained that the active ingredient is inorganic and except for it being very hydroscopic is relatively inert. Nothing to age out. Other than the packaging which with prolonged exposure to UV light and or constant molesting could damage it. The contents will last 10 years or better.  The FDA requires an expiration date on ALL medical devices, medicines and supplies. And thinking about it, it also helps the manufacturers bottom line.... Making money.

Walmart, Bi-Mart, Sportsman's Warehouse, Dick's, Big-R and all other LEGIT big-box retail stores are not gouging so why play into this crap? Yes they have gone up a few dollars over the years.... no big deal... Bricks are now being sold for $25 when they used to be $12 and even 100 rounds of CCI-Mini-Mags are still sold for $11 at all these big-box retail stores TODAY when they used to be $3-$5 a few years ago.

Since no one has the ballz to say it-- i will:

I can see paying $35 per brick for someone to stand in line for you, but co'mon! REALLY?!?!?!?! 300% markup is friggin insane.... talk about take advantage... and your not helping the situation AT ALL! either by selling at these insane prices, or BUYING at these insane prices and encouraging the gougers.

I dont care if thats what gunbroker.com and gunbot.net and other online retailers have them for sale also at insane prices.... they are gouging people and taking advantage of the situation just like you armslist 'dealers' and 'personal sellers' out there. And you dont even post your ammo in the ammo section - you also post it in the firearms section for people to see! I could also rant about the delusional prices on most of your firearms too (especial charging above-new prices for USED firearms) but ill save that for another day....

I have seen all of you standing in the same lines as me EVERY Thursday at 9am at Sportsman's Warehouse to get my weekly ration given out to the public vultures, and you don't see me listing my crap on here now do you? and if you did... i don't gouge!

So, until i see Walmart, Bi-Mart and the other big-box retail stores start to jack their prices WAY WAY up, then this is WRONG!

.... and I KNOW FOR A FACT your on-line 'dealers' and personal sales gougers out there did not pay $75 per brick! I hope you choke on it.

... and by the way... I have all the bricks of 22lr I need to last thru this bad situation... and i paid avg price of $23 per brick. ... and I waited in the lines just like YOU!

The blade on the Zatoichi sword has some dark scuff marks as well. There are a couple of spots on the Zatoichi scabbard where the paint has peeled off and a couple of light dings as well. The scabbard of the Shinto Daisho katana has some deep chips in it, but it is still perfectly functional and the blade sits tightly in the sheath. All the ""damage"" to the blades and scabbards are purely cosmetic. All of the fittings are still tight and the blades are ready to cut, though they could use a little sharpening up. I will include the sword cleaning kit. I have used some of the oil, powder and cloths from the kit, but there is still plenty in there.

It comes with a magnesium (not aluminum) Handl Defense lower so it can accept any SR-25 mags (much more common and cheaper. Magpul has a 25rd mag for it). You can easily switch back to the original FN lower if you'd rather use the OEM mags. I prefer the metal one though. It also comes with a Timney trigger installed on the Handl lower(which is the best you can buy). You also get the real (non-knock-off) Grip Pod seen in pics. It comes with the extended and much better charging handle. You also get the Hi-Desert Dog modified Hogue grip with battery storage built in. It comes with a Vltor flashlight mount AND the 500 lumen Surefire Hellfire light (when holding the grip pod your thumb is right there ready to hit the light). Don't forget, you also get the AAC flash hider (of course the original SCAR muzzle is included too). You get 5 FN factory 20rd mags and 1 10rd Magpul SR-25 mag.

The Regent R200S comes equipped with the same quality as the R100, but with a stainless finish, serrated slide, ventilated trigger, and hammer, a beavertail safety, combat 3-dot sight system and an extended thumb safety. It is an affordable semi-automatic 1911 pistol built with a level of quality that you can customize. This reasonably priced, high-quality .45 ACP caliber M1911 is one of only a few guns of its style and quality that retails for around $600.

You use the internet to make a posting, take 2 mins to search the firearm you are selling. I can't count how many people have their used firearms listed for the same price or even higher than msrp. Then they wonder why no one wants to buy it and continually post it over and over.

Sites like slickguns.com will give you the prices that many of the major gun stores and online gun stores charge all in one simple search. You get a list of them all and the price they charge. It also listing shipping charges if someone wants to order online. You can even feel free to add $30 for ffl transfer(what most local shops charge) to that price. Maybe you overpaid because you didn't do any research and bought a firearms from the most expensive place in town, just don't expect hardly anyone to overpay because you got taken by an overpriced store.

$300-350 pistol brand new....and you want $450? Firearms hold their value well, but a used firearm is not worth the same amount or more than it costs brand new(antique and rare firearms excluded).

Maybe you'll get lucky and find some dumb schmuck who has never used the search bar of the internet or walked into a gun store before making a purchase, but chances are you will be laughed at, mocked, and will not make a sale. If someone is willing to pay that overly high asking price, you have to ask yourself why they are willing to pay more for a private sale? Maybe because they can't legally purchase the firearm cheaper at a store? Maybe you shouldn't be selling to them in the first place.

The Vepr MD2 AK74 5.45 X 39 Features Russian Rugged Reliability in a beautiful package. The rifle has upgraded G2 Fire control for a nice 3 pound trigger pull, threaded barrel with removable AK74 style muzzle brake and has the proper bullet guide installed so it can accept normal Hi capacity magazines. With the thicker receiver and heavy barrel we find the Vepr line of rifles to be a bit more accurate at the range. Threaded 16 inch Russian hammer forged chrome lined barrel.

New Vepr Made in Russia in 5.45x39mm caliber. With 50% more HEAVY DUTY 1.5mm receiver. Threaded 16 inch Russian hammer forged chrome lined barrel. A true comparison is with the Russian Tiger Draganov. Having made a reputation for accuracy, this heavy duty barrel not found on most other rifles has chrome lined chamber and bore. This Vepr system along with excellent quality of all parts, to many to list here, has earned a legendary reputation for total dependability from the jungles to Siberia! 

This Vepr Comes with 6 US made 30 round magazines, cleaning rod and sport bag carrying case. 

It has a Primary Arms Red Dot sight mounted on top.  Alternatively a scope rail on left side of receiver can be used for mounting telescopic scopes or holographic sights on a picatiney rails. The rifle will take most in spec HI cap AK74 mags  and does not require special magazines 

Comes with a heavy duty A-Frame stock and folding mechanism that locks in open and closed positions. Innovative design allows for rapid unlocking and folding to open or closed position depending on your requirements.

Veprs’ are built for extreme demands above and beyond all others with extra heavy duty receiver, extra heavy duty reinforcement each side and an extra heavy hammer forged chrome lined target like barrel. The combination of years of proven design with attention to detail has produced legendary dependability and legendary accuracy from the jungles to Siberia!

Bolt of the Vepr models in 5.45x39mm caliber are fitted with two locking lugs. Enhanced against weather and mechanical wear the cartridge chamber, barrel bore, gas cylinder, and bolt support rod are chrome lined. A vepr goes through a thorough inspection process at every part, every step of building and must pass the final thorough examination by a quality control committee before any vepr ever leaves the arsenal.

Why the Vepr is better than the average AK:

Hammer-Forged, Russian Chrome-Lined, Heavy Barrel.  Most durable AK Barrels Made.
Hammer Forging is a process whereby the lands and grooves of the barrel are formed by hammering the barrel material against a mandrel. This process not only creates sharp and well defined lands and grooves but also leaves an excellent surface finish on said surfaces. An additional benefit is that the barrel material becomes work hardened. The chrome plating helps prevent against wear and corrosion. We don't believe you can buy a better barrel on any rifle.

Rifles based on Kalashnikov's operating system have not been known for their exceptional accuracy. The renowned AK47 rifle was designed to function flawlessly in all environments and temperatures. In other words, functionality was more important than accuracy. However, because the VEPR has a stiffer receiver than the AK47, better accuracy can be expected.

Most Accurate.  Consistently better groups than other AKs.

True RPK Receiver.  Stiffer and longer wearing than any other AK receiver.  Made for Soviet Squad Automatic Weapon.

The VEPR costs more for a reason - It is simply the finest Kalashnikov based rifle available in the U.S. market

Will work with most In Spec Hi Capacity AK 74 Mags
