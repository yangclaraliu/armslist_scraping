Yukon's exclusive PULSE IR illuminator extends viewing range 2 to 3 times farther than standard IR illuminators and increases viewing ability on nights when no ambient light is available. The unique pulsating frequency of the PULSE IR prolongs battery life an incredible 30-50 hours using only 2 - AA Batteries while the infrared light will reflect off the pupils of your target up to 75 yards away, making it easier to spot game at night. Perfect for low-light or no-light situations, when using the Tactical 2.5x50 by Yukon yours will not be a trivial pursuit.

The illuminated red-on-green reticle has an adjustable brightness control that can be dimmed for a clear view while scanning for your next opponent or lit for extra brightness when there is little or no ambient light available; be sure to put your game face on.

Here's a Glock 22 Gen3 chambered in .40 up for sale/trade. The gun is in excellent condition, with only minor wear, as seen in the photos. The pistol originally had factory night sights installed, but due to the front sight recently coming loose, a brand new TRU GLO fiber optic/tritium front sight was installed. The package will include the matching rear sight from the package, should you so desire to replace the rear as well. The rear does glow very well still. Also included will be 2 N-Force backstraps, one of which can be seen here installed. It is easily removable with a single pin, should you desire to go back to stock. The package will also include a LoneWolf 9mm conversion barrel, which allows you to fire more inexpensive 9mm ammo as desired. I have put roughly 200 rounds through this barrel with zero issues. You will need a Glock 17 magazine to use with this barrel, and I can provide one at an additional cost if so desired. The buyer will also receive the original Glock case, and a total of 5 magazines. 2 of the 5 magazines are brand new, and Gen4 compatible. I have a significant amount of .40 caliber ammunition available as well, so please inquire if interested. Some may be included.

Asking price is: $600 obo.

Up for sale or trade I have my Astra A-90 .45 ACP pistol. This is a steel frame gun, hammer fired, made when Astra was their own company and before Star purchased them and quality went way down hill. I have two 9 round factory magazines for the weapon, original box, and all original paperwork. One magazine will come fully loaded. The gun fires great and I have only put 50 rounds through it myself. The rifling is still deep and the inside of the barrel is crisp and clean. The outside has a little bit of wear from the slide action which happens, and has just rubbed the bluing off of the barrel in some places on it. This can be easily touched up if you want, but it isn't something that will even be seen unless you have the slide locked back. 

The gun fires very accurately with the hard hitting .45 ACP round. Since this model has an alloy frame, the little extra added weight means that you won't feel the recoil hardly at all. The slide itself sits on a rail that runs the full length of the frame, so it will always be held nice and tight without and wobble. Normally I'd love to keep this gun, but I'm looking to pick up a nice firearm that I don't have yet. This is a must sell and I speak fluent haggle as well, so bring it on. :) Don't think it's a fair price, go ahead and offer me something. As long as it's reasonable then I'll accept.

Please read entire ad, it will answer most o f your questions ......if you have a gun to offer, please tell me info on it in initial email or text with how much cash you would offer please.......thanx

Colt is New Unfired with card board box and one black pmag, manual unopened, lock, papers, warranty card.  Also comes with what is listed below.  

THE CASE AND TAN PMAG ARE NOT INCLUDED AT THIS PRICE!!!!!!


100% Factory Built AR

Gun Selling for $1000-1100 on gunbroker avg pricing stock without upgrades.  The Blackhawk rail ($150), sling adapters ($46),  FDE butt stock ($49), and grip ($27) were factory installed.  The front grip ($38) and Ladders (appx $50) I installed.  You can look those prices up on Black Hawks website.  They are actual without tax. 

This is $1400-1500 worth of gun and add ons without taxes, so don't waste our time low balling me and if you can buy it elsewhere cheaper, then go do it, I dont need to know about it. Please don't email or text me to tell me.



Im Asking $1200 cash price  ..........or $1300 trade price as I'd rather have cash, but love to trade.   

Again, dont waste our time if you dont want to pay this.  I dont need to sell it.

 I really want an AR .308 new or like new and depending on gun, cant add cash, but maybe another gun with it.   Also like DPMS SASS or REPR, SIG 716 and obviously higher end Ar's too.  I can add stuff if you have quality optics on it that work.

Depending on the current market value of your gun, not what they sell for MSRP, I can add one or two, maybe even three of the following guns.

Mossberg 500 tactical setup and ammo with appx $500 +  in it

Smith and Wesson .38 spl revolver stainless steel, used, no original box, selling for $400-500 on gunbroker in same condition

NAA Revolver Convertible 22lr and 22 mag with original box and papers, 5-10 rds thru it 

Also have another Factory built AR if its the right deal on a .308 REPR or similar

Other Trades I would consider are pistols plus cash or multi gun  Glocks (Gen 4 preferably ), Sig P238 or 938, Kimbers, Colts, Springfields, nicer brand 1911's,  possibly other Sigs like P226 in new condition but unless multi guns, possibly revolvers if new or like new condition..........all would need cash on top.  

Don't want any pistols for even trade, would need at least $375  cash on top of one pistol please.  

If your gun is fired, especially sigs, its used, so dont try to tell me its worth MSRP 


If you have two glocks in 9mm,  40 or 45....maybe 357 sig ......Gen 4's or Gen 3's w/ extras or OD, I would do both plus $150 cash...   also interested in Glock 42 but would need another $50 each one

Or Sig P238 and Glock plus $150 cash

Or Sig P238 and P938 plus $100 cash

Or Sig P226 Navy and $450 cash or trade

Regular P226 and Glock plus $100

Nice 1911 and $375 cash if its worth at least $925

Would consider revolvers if .38spl, .357 or .44mag......nothing over $600 and no cowboy guns or specialty guns

If its other than above, you can try me if its just a great deal for me and not too exotic that I couldn't sell it later if need to.

 Im not interested in war relics, collectibles, junkers, hi points, keltecs, shotguns or hunting rifles.

 Thanks for looking.

 Featuring image open field geometry and a distinctive body design, these Trijicon Red Dot Sights provide an extremely wide field of view with no ""tube effect"", thanks to their shorter case length and 28mm aperture. Built for close-quarters tactical maneuvers, the Reflex Sight has only a 1x magnification and a 1.75 MOA LED red dot for precise shooting without any target cover, and its rounded, low profile body won't snag or limit the mounting space on your rifle. The Trijicon SRS Red Dot Sight has ten different brightness settings for its LED illuminated reticle which can operate for at least three years (even on the highest setting) using the reflex sight's dual power sources. A powerful solar cell acts as a primary power source for the Trijicon SRS Red Dot Reflex Gun Sight, but as the day gets darker, the AA battery picks up the slack for nighttime operations. For supreme optical clarity, Trijicon has equipped the SRS with a multi-layer broadband anti-reflective coating, and the 7075-T6 aircraft grade aluminum housing is incredibly durable and waterproof to 165 feet. A distinctive, dependable, and durable red dot sight for any tactical operation, choose the Trijicon SRS 1.75 MOA Tactical Reflex Sight.

It is a remarkable shooter with the 7.5X55 Swiss, a cartridge similar to the .308 Win and commonly available on the surplus market.  This rifle is a straight pull bolt action utilizing only two motions to cycle the action, back and forth, no turning.  It operates from a 6 round detachable magazine.  Metal finish is 90% with only a little wear for a rifle this age, and wood finish is excellent with only minor blemishes and a chip that had been repaired on the hand guard.  Bore is bright and shiny with no pitting.  This is a swiss watch of rifles.  If you are a collector of WW2 era rifles, this is a must have for you collection.

528,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3347528,For Sale:  Marlin 1894 S .41 mag. (-RARE 1983)-reduced,"Nekoosa area, Northern WI, Wisconsin","$ 1,350","Listed On: Friday, August 8, 2014",Rifles,Marlin                                                                                ,no type,Lever Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"I am selling my Marlin 1894S Lever action .41 magnum rifle in 98% condition - one of the very first Marlin 1894S .41 mag made in 1983 for $1,350.00 or best offer-agreeable to me. 
* The wood is perfect, bore as new, the rifle is in suburb condition. An important firearm in 'JM' Marlin's 140 year long history! 
History reports that after Marlin Mfg. observed the overwhelming successes of S&W sales of the Model 58 followed by the Model 57 .41 mag revolvers, Marlin decided in 1983 to test the market by manufacturing only 1,040 1894S in .41 mag.  My Marlin 1894S has a serial number beginning ""17...."" indicating it was made in 1983, very unique!  The historical Marlin serial number records reports state that Marlin made only 1,040 of these rifles between ""1984 and 1985"". This one was clearly one of the very first made, actually made in 1983. It still looks like it just came out of the box. 
Beginning in 1988 Marlin decided to re-introduce the 1894S in .41 mag. and manufactured only 2,573. There are less than 4,000 1894S .41 mag ever made, ""JM"" stamped of course. In 2003 Marlin made a limited run of 1894FG .41 mag lever actiion rifles with a pistol grip stock. 
* The model 1894S, just like mine, is presently posted by Cabelas Gun Library site for $1,899.00 ( Cabelas Library Stock # 8047174. Call nearest Cabelas to confirm ). 

* Also, GunBroker #430737496 which is a 1894FG, the newer less sought after .41 mag., just sold on 8/03 after 13 seperate bidders bid 23 times for $1,325.00. 

Now is the time to open up the gun safe and take a look at the firearms that have been 'collecting dust and NOT having appreciated in value' and getting them sold and put your hard earned money into a firearm like mine that will reep significant future increases in value. The chances of finding a '1983 Marlin 1894S' in mint condition are near to impossible and will become even more unlikely in months & years to follow. (Cabelas 1894S has the original box so if you're inclined to spend $450.00 more for the cardboard box you will want to contact them before that one gets snapped up.) 
I will ship FFL to FFL only after my FFL Dealer Gun Store has received a USPS check or cash for the rifle, plus app. 20.00 shipping with Insurance. (A Marlin scope rail was mounted using the Marlin drilled and tapped standard receiver holes and I have the original Marlin screws that go with the rifle should the buyer decide to remove the scope mount. I never used this rifle with a scope or fired it.  No holes were ever made in any part of this rifle post mfg.
( I needed to chose between my as new 1894FG and the 1894S and decided on keeping the FG version as I intend to use it for white tail deer hunting in combination with my Model 57 S&W revolver.)

The military’s need for a magnified, self-luminous tactical sight that enhances target identification and increases hit probability on extended-range shots has given rise to the new Trijicon ACOG® 6x48.

It also incorporates a bullet drop compensator (BDC) with additional aiming points estimated for trajectory of the 5.56mm M855 out to 800 meters. To further improve target acquisition and hit potential, the new ACOG® 6x48 incorporates Trijicon’s Bindon Aiming Concept™ (BAC) – a revolutionary both-eyes-open method of aiming. Like other members of the Trijicon ACOG® line, the new ACOG® 6x48 is battery free and waterproof to 500 feet.

It is brand new and has never been on the rifle when fired. The color is called ghillie green. This stock will fit Rem 700 short action BDL rifles with heavy/ varmint contour barrels.

Hogue is the go to brand when looking for comfortable, well made stocks and grips. They have been the premier name in the industry and are sought after by military, law enforcement, and concealed carry holders world wide. With a full line of grips and accessories, Hogue has what you need to ""Get a Grip"" on your situation.

Hogue OverMolded stocks are truly revolutionary, no other maker can offer stocks with our superior patented features (U.S.Pat. #6,301,817).

OverMolding provides the ultimate in a comfortable, non-slip, super smooth attractive finish that is durable and extremely quiet. The exclusive Cobblestone texture further enhances all Hogue stocks by providing an efficient non-slip, non irritating stippling pattern.

OverMolded Stocks are constructed by molding a super strong, rigid fiberglass reinforced skeleton or ""insert"" that precisely fits the guns' action. This rigid skeleton is then OverMolded with a durable but soft synthetic elastomer (rubber). During the heat and extreme pressure of injection molding the elastomer adheres chemically as well as mechanically to the skeleton, resulting in a permanent bond between the rubber and the insert. The super strong skeleton gives the stocks their strength, and the precise molded dimensions provide a perfect drop-in fit of your rifle or shotgun. The state of the art elastomer material used on Hogue stocks won't harden with age and is virtually impervious to all oils and solvents found around firearms, providing years of dependable service."

Nice shape Kodiak 22 Magnum Semi-Auto.  Hard to find.  These were made from 1963 - 1966 and I seem to recall that these were the first semi-auto 22 magnum.  I think the tube holds 7 shells.

The bluing is looks pretty good on the barrel and still somewhat dark. 

The receiver of the Kodiak's were painted and the paint looks really nice and dark for the age with the usual few scrapes and spots for painted receivers, but really nice shape.

Plus it is tube fed and bypasses any federal laws for hi capacity weapons that deal with detachable magazines.  Extra bonus IMHO.  Good deal considering I have seen these currently go for more and some not even as nice of condition.

Includes a hard case.

FTF in the Grand Rapids area.  Will not ship at this time but may in a week or so.

NO TRADES PLEASE and please do not ask.

Thanks."

This rifle was originally designed in 1870, as a bolt action, single shot 10.35X47R cartridge, and in 1887 it was converted to a repeating rifle by adding a magazine.  When WW1 came around the Italians couldn't produce enough Carcanos, so they again converted the Vetterli rifles to utilize the Carcano magazine and shoot the 6.5mm Carcano.  This rifle is in good condition considering its age and has 50% blueing, with minimal discoloration and no major rust or pitting.  The stock has handling marks befitting of a 130 year old rifle but is in good overall condition with a minor crack near the bolt.  This rifle is fully functional and could be a shooter although I think is is more befitting of being a collection gun.  All serial numbers match and this is the original 1870 stock converted with an original 10.35mm barrel sleeved to a 6.5mm bore.  If you are interested in owning this curious piece of history call or text Matt at REDACTED."

DESCRIPTION
The Dual Lever series of precision optics mounts features the Patented [US Patent 8,567,105] BLAC™ lever system and are engineered for larger diameter scopes. The base has an extension that allows proper eye relief, even when using a non-monolithic rail. It is designed so that the base allows the use of a folding back up iron sight (BUIS). The structure is designed for maximum strength, and utilizes larger fasteners than our standard lineup. This mount is engineered to handle heavy optics and high recoil forces. It is offered in both 0MOA and 20MOA cant
DESIGN FEATURES
The Precision Optic Mount features the Patented [US Patent 8,567,105] BLAC™ lever system which was designed around the following parameters:
Must be compatible with any 1913 Specification Rail, to include systems that are out of specification (within reason) and this includes Weaver rails.
Must be completely tool and user adjustable free. It needs to be 100% self contained and mate securely to any rail without the user having to tailor the pressure/engagement position.
Must lock with enough pressure to positively attach any device or optical instrument to a rail without movement, static or dynamic forces not withstanding.
The rail must not experience any deformation due to user error. This must include synthetic (plastic/polymer/composite) rail systems.
Auto Index capability. The device must also index parallel to the bore. The unit must always repeat the forward shift (recoil forces direction of influence) not only to maximize zero repeatability, but to take this step of installation out of the users initial mounting sequence. Index must be redundant.
Unit must not shoot loose due to improper mounting or a mechanical bottoming out.
The system must incorporate a safety that prevents the lever from being accidentally opened. The safety must be able to be manipulated in conjunction with the lever rotation, so that only one hand is required to open it.
The unit will utilize constant force to ensure required pressure in all conditions. The force must be substantial to prevent any shift forward/aft left/right.
The pressure must be applied in a linear direction centered in the main body to prevent cocking of the mount.
It must be easy to manipulate by gloved or fatigued hands.
It must be extremely robust, and withstand shock and impact to the system housing.
There were others, but by listing them we would compromise our trade secrets.

Glock 17 Reliability:  Glock’s are famous for their reliability, and I doubt if any single model of Glock has been put through more torture tests than the Glock 17.
