The Russians modernized their model 1891 rifle into what would become one of the most successful military arms the world has ever known! Its simple and robust design, accuracy and awesome reliability served the Soviets well as their main battle rifle of WWII. Under appreciated until recently, the Mosin Nagant is one of the hottest collectibles on the market today!. 

This rifle is nearly all original as far as I can see.  Bolt, trigger group, and barrel all have the same serial number; (butt stock plate has a different number).  Serial number for 1941 (marked the same on barrel).  

Very nice example of an imported Mosin Nagant; imported by CAI.  

Super tight action, and nice clean rifled barrel.  Original barrel length at approximately 26"".

Here is the description of the sight from the mfr:

The M21 Reflex sight provides constant, all-light aiming capability, without batteries. Designed through close collaboration with Israeli Special Forces, the M21 was the first reflex sight in the world designed for close quarter combat.

M Revision - Latest Model available

It is battle proven, reflexive to use, deadly accurate, and totally reliable.

The M21 features a large 30mm diameter lens which allows rapid target acquisition with both eyes open.
Reticle illumination is achieved by a protected fiber optic light collector system during the day, and by a miniature self-powered tritium light source at night. Transition between the two systems is instantaneous and automatic to assure good contrast between the aiming dot and the target area.

The M21 is night vision compatible.

This reflex sight offers shooters the ability to acquire targets accurately at any range, in any situation, with both eyes open. It is also designed to work with a magnifier.

The M21 is the optic of choice for the Israeli Defense Forces."

Brand New Stag Arms AR15 / M16 Complete with 16"" inch Heavy barrel and A3 Upper receiver. Six position adjustable stock with front grip.

T-Marked forged upper receiver
1-9"" twist, 6 grooves, right hand
5.56mm chamber (shoot either 5.56mm or .223)
11595E Barrel steel
Manganese Phosphate finish barrel
F-Marked Front sight base

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports carbine length M4 Magpul handguards with front drop grip and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of heavy-weight (.950 diameter under the handguards, .750 under the front sight base) dimension their full length which alleviates barrel whip and enhances accuracy in semi auto fire and helps dissipate heat. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9""; twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullets.

Brand New Stag Arms AR15 / M16 Complete with 16"" inch Heavy barrel and A3 Upper receiver. Six position adjustable stock with front grip. 

T-Marked forged upper receiver
1-9"" twist, 6 grooves, right hand
5.56mm chamber (shoot either 5.56mm or .223)
11595E Barrel steel
Manganese Phosphate finish barrel
F-Marked Front sight base

This 5.56mm caliber barrel is 16"" long, threaded the standard 1/2 x 28 tpi, and has an A2 flash hider with the correct crush washer. The barrel has a forged A2 front sight base with bayonet lug, not the cheaper cast front sight base which can break. It sports carbine length M4 Magpul handguards with front drop grip and a correctly sized gas port for reliable function. The barrel is machined from chrome-moly, high vanadium steel and hardened to a U.S. government Mil-spec of Rc 26-32. The barrel, and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished IAW 5.3.1.2 of Mil-STD-171, the U. S. government's recommended protective finish for steel. This finish not only looks great, it affords complete corrosion protection. These barrels are of heavy-weight (.950 diameter under the handguards, .750 under the front sight base) dimension their full length which alleviates barrel whip and enhances accuracy in semi auto fire and helps dissipate heat. The barrel is button rifled with 6 grooves, right hand, 1 / 9""; twist. The 1/9"" twist is best because it handles the widest variety of ammunition and bullets.

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability
and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct
lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic
ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The gun is a 1990 model and is in good overall condition but had some marks on the blueing and a couple nicks in the forearm and stock. I repaired some of the blueing as best I could and messed with the stock a little, but overall I didn't feel they needed to be refinished.

It is a FANTASTIC woods gun and a browning you can own/enjoy without feeling bad about shooting it or actually taking it anywhere. That's why it's $100-$300 cheaper than any others on here. 

Comes with Williams sights and a set of scope rings that are see through so you can see the iron sights.

Save yourself tax and shipping! The stats on the scope are as follows:

Features of Leupold VX-3 LR Scope:
Parallax Adjustment
The Xtended Twilight Lens System optimizes the transmission of low-light wavelengths, so you see the details of low-light scenes in greater, brighter detail than with any other riflescope available
DiamondCoat 2 lens coatings on exterior lens surfaces provide the highest level of scratch resistance Leupold has ever offered
The twin bias spring exerts up to 30 percent more holding force on the erector, virtually eliminating erector system backlash and stress on the vital internal workings of the scope, for longer life
Blackened lens edges reduce light diffusion, so more usable light reaches the shooter's eye, for a brighter image with increased contrast
Leupold Ballistics Aiming System for more accurate long-range shooting
Finger-adjustable, cryogenically treated, 1/4 MOA click windage and elevation adjustments with resettable pointer dials marking the zero point
Tactile power indicator also features built-in range estimation functions and graphite O-rings for easy operation
Internally threaded, lockable, extreme fast-focus eyepiece with Alumina rubber eyepiece guard

Overall, I'd say this is a great gun for the gentleman who wants a P7 to carry, and not to coddle in his gun library. With the addition of trijicon sights this would make a truly great carry. Massad Ayoob said that he never saw a P7 malfunction, I too have never had any problems with this gun. 

Comes with five magazines. Two are new in plastic. Two are used but still look new (tiny bit of carbon on plate). One is perfectly serviceable, but not pretty (carbon on plate, worn finish, superficial pitting, dremel mark from when some jerk with my same SSN tried to modify it). 

I'm selling the gun because I'm going to move this year and want to make some room in my safe.

I need your help in locating a stolen Black Rain Ordnance Fallout 10.

I purchased this rifle from Justin at BRO November 14th via Gunbroker. After sending him the money orders, the rifle was shipped UPS Ground to my FFL holder here in Carson City. The rifle was scanned at the UPS hub November 20th and put on the truck for delivery. The UPS driver claims he delivered the rifle that afternoon and left it on the FFLs front porch. The FFL was home at the time the package was declared delivered and he says UPS never even stopped by.

Here's the crappy part to this whole mess. BRO shipped this rifle, a rifle they value at $3,000 WITHOUT insurance OR requiring an adult signature upon delivery; which made it very easy for this rifle to disappear.

I'm attaching pictures of the rifle with hopes that this might help the Carson City sheriff's department and the ATF locate it. If you know anything about this matter, please email me as soon as possible."

Comes originally from the factory with two mags (1-8rd, 1-7rd), factory box, spent casing, security lock, and owner's manual. Plus an extra brand new 8rd factory magazine (cost me $35) that I'm including with the deal. It also has rubber Talon grips installed (two of the mags has matching Talon grips trim on it, pictured). This gun is absolutely brand new, and I like it a lot. But I want something else. Must be at least 21 years old +, and be a Kentucky resident, and have a proper ID to buy this gun. KY CCDW preferred but not required. No out of state sale or shipping. Thanks for looking.

Product Information
Shop more Hornady products
Hornady TAP ammunition is a good choice for personal defense, and is used extensively by law enforcement agencies. This due in part to the fact that the propellants used in the loading of this ammunition were engineered to minimize muzzle flash. This ammunition is new production, non-corrosive, in boxer primed, reloadable brass cases.

Special Note from Hornady Manufacturing:
We are making a running change to the TAP ammunition. This includes changing from Blackened Nickel Cases to Bright Silver Nickel cases. Using the Silver Nickel cases has all the advantages of Blackened Nickel and the added benefit of being able to see the cartridges more clearly in low light conditions as well as when checking for loaded chambers.

If you do not pay as agreed with your bid, I post negative feedback, KEEP ALL FUNDS received, AND the gun or item. Basically, a 100% restocking fee. So, please pay...we don't need any trouble. No need to get my permission to use this option. I ship only after full payment per above and legal FFL is received"

Item Description

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

If you're looking for that hiking, camping, backpacking gun that packs a punch you have it here. Stainless steel makes it tough on drops and easy to clean. Can also hold up to a variance of temperatures. Very nice trigger pull with a clean break in DA. Typical for these old Smiths. Cylinder locks up tight and timing is great. Comes with Pachmayr presentation medallion grips that are in very worn shape on the left side pretty good on the right side. Still work effectively but not pretty to look at. This is a Square Butt revolver so if you want newer grips make sure they are for a Square Butt Smith.

These just came into the US, the incredible Special Duty Pistol (SDP) with factory installed  night sights!  If you are reviewing this listing, you should know all about this gun (otherwise, I suggest you do a google or YouTube search on why these guns are gaining wide recognition for quality, shootability and desirability).  In fact, here is a link to a review:  http://survivalcache.com/survival-gear-review-sphinx-arms-sdp-compact-alpha-9mm-da-sa/

I won't waste time here explaining why this is one of the best upper end pistols.  What you probably didn't know is that the Swiss are now shipping SDP's with factory night sights.  

I already have four custom CZ's (and getting a fifth) and before I decide to shoot the thing, it will sit in the dry safe.  I have a timed listing elsewhere ending March 6th.  It does appear that many folks do not appreciate a good deal on a really great gun!  

If someone does want to buy it here, you will be in possession of one fine piece of workmanship.  Front sight is green fiber optic (night, too), rear are orange night.  NO TRADES, PLEASE.  Since I can easily afford to keep it, please don't bother to offer a lower price, as that will simply annoy me.  Thanks"

Before getting to the guns, let me tell you about myself.
First of all, I take meticulous care of all of my firearms.  I field-strip, thoroughly clean and re-oil every gun within 4 hours of shooting.  So, unless otherwise specified, the firearm will appear and function in like-new condition (if it's not actually BNIB and unfired).  
I'm also a believer in the golden rule, and I always follow through on what I say I'll do.  I expect the same in return.  Please don't bother responding if you don't practice the same traits when dealing with people.
Finally; this forum is NOT ""Down East Dickering"", nor ""American Pickers""...the price I post on my guns is fair - but firm.  Don't ask if I'll take less money.  As far as trades go, don't expect me to give you retail values for yours and then value mine at pawn-shop prices...you won't like the response you'll get. 

Now down to business:  Here is the list of guns I have.  I've listed a ""C"" for my cash price, and a ""T"" for my trade value expectation.

I'm really only looking to trade for a Savage 110BA, chambered in .338 Lapua, or other tactical XLR rifles in .338 Lapua or larger calibers.  NO AR's or AR platforms, please.      

1.  Browning X-Bolt Varmint Special Stainless .22-250 rifle.  10-40x50 NCStar Scope w/ Leupold Rings and a 6-9"" retractable bipod.  All original paperwork included.  Exactly 24 rounds fired using CFE223 Hogdon powder, virgin brass, and Nosler 50gr ballistic tips.  ""C""=$1,400  ""T""=$1,600

2.   Browning X-Bolt Varmint Special Stainless .308 rifle.  Brand New In Box - sticker is still on the barrel.  ""C""=$1,000  ""T""=$1,200

3.   Desert Eagle .50AE  Mark XIX Model (with picatinny rail barrel).  Brushed Chrome finish.  Comes with stock grips, and Hogue finger-groove grips.  Exactly 42 rounds fired using Magnum Research or Hornady factory 325jhp ammo.  Includes case, paperwork, bolt tool, and everything else as if it were new.  **Also, there's documentation of the new barrel being installed by Magnum Research.  When I bought the gun, I spec'd the barrel and found it to be out of reasonable tolerance.  They replaced it for free with a much better toleranced barrel.  ""C""=$1,700  ""T""=$1,900    

4.  Beretta 96.  Blued.  Includes two, 11-round magazines.  Also has Hogue finger-groove grips, and Trijicon tritium night sights installed.  Sights have about 6 years of life remaining, but will still be white 3-dots after the tritium decays.  Approximately 500 rounds fired - all factory loads.  NO +P or +P+ rounds ever fired.  No wear marks on the gun frame or barrel, but does have moderate palm wear on the grips.  Beretta case included, but no paperwork or manual.  ""C""=$575  ""T""=$700

5.  Beretta 96.  Stainless (INOX).  Includes two, 11-round magazines.  Also has Hogue finger-groove grips, and Novak red 3-dot sights installed.  These sights are not illuminated, only red in color.  Exactly 77 rounds fired - all factory loads.  NO +P or +P+ rounds ever fired.  Gun looks 100% like brand new.  Beretta case included, but no paperwork or manual.  ""C""=$575  ""T""=$700

6.  Ruger SR40c Stainless.  BNIB.  10 round, and 15 round mags.  Hard case, loading assist clip, and variable interchangeable base plates.  ""C""=$475 ""T""=$500   

7.  Ruger LCP .380 w/ Crimson Trace Integrated Laser.  Exactly 14 rounds fired.  (7rnds standard FMJ, 7rnds +P JHP).  ""C""=$425  ""T""=$450
