The true test of a firearm is often not the specifications, but the loyalty of its followers. If this is the case, then the Glock 31 .357 pistol passes both tests with flying colors. The official service weapon of multiple law enforcement agencies, including the New Jersey police, the Glock 31 .357 pistol is quite clearly the best of the best. 

The high-performance .357 is characterized by extremely high muzzle velocity and superior precision even at medium range. The GLOCK 31 is the optimum solution for all who are looking for these ballistic advantages in a reliable yet light pistol with large magazine capacity. Many law enforcement agencies, among them the New Jersey police, have already selected the GLOCK 31 as their official service weapon.

I have owned this gun for 20 years. It was purchased from my college room mate who received it from his Uncle when he passed. In that time, I couldn't have shot it more than 3 times. The pictures easily verify this. This particular gun was MFG in 1970 by FN, serial number 70x37466 confirms the date. It comes with a 27 ½” ventilated barrel, marked with they ** indicating a fixed modified choke. The condition is easily 98%. The bluing is outstanding with the only flaw being some minimal discoloration at the barrel tip. The wood on the forearm is like new, as is the stock. The stock has been shortened at one time and a recoil pad was added. No visible wear on the pad. The LOP is 14 ½”. I am asking $1300 obo plus $30 shipping. Paypal is okay, but the buyer will have to pay the 3.5% fees. I will only ship to an FFL. I will entertain shotgun trades."

These lasers are only sold to SOCOM on official letterheads only and other elite SOF groups. You can contact Jeff at AIMSHOT in Atlanta to verify. This is one awesome laser that will light a match and looks like something from STAR WARS.

It hits much harder than the light ball that's currently available, and it penetrates like crazy. It also shoots a good deal more accurately in my rifles. Supplies of this dried up several years ago which is a shame as it's some of the best stuff available to feed your Mosins.

40 rounds East German M39 ammo. This ammo has an all black color 124 grain steel jacketed, steel core bullet. It was originally designed as practice ammo for their machine guns. The concept was that the lighter bullet would travel less far. It is however a full power round and will penetrate 1/4"" steel plate at 100 yards. Recoil is greatly reduced due to the lighter bullet making it perfect for anyone who is sensitive to recoil.   

20 rounds Bulgarian brass case with a 149 grain magnetic bullet loaded on 4 Mosin stripper clips. Ammo is from the mid 50's but looks like it was made yesterday. It's super clean ammo and I've always felt brass cased ammo operated more smoothly than the steel case stuff.

20 rounds Red Tracer loaded on 4 Mosin stripper clips. Trace effect lights around 100 yards and continues another 700 - 800 yards. Visible in daylight but spectacular in low light conditions.

Ammo is being sold as one lot for $125 picked up in the Brandon area. Buyer must be at least 18 years old. I can ship this ammo via UPS ground at buyers expense and cost would be based on the ""ship to"" location.

   The Bersa UC Pro has long been one of my favorite handguns that many people have never even heard of! The newest generation of these venerable pistols has been improved further with smooth, low profile controls, & dovetail sights front and rear. These will accept any aftermarket sights made to fit the Sig P226, etc. My personal EDC is this gun, fitted with Trijicon night sights.

   The UC Pro is especially impressive in the potent .40S&W, a caliber that exhibits a lot of ""snap"" in many guns, is managed with ease here. DA/SA is my personal preference in a carry gun, and this gun brings it all together in a compact package that's easy to carry, accurate, & rock-solid reliable.

Beretta Px4 Storm Compact .40 S&W Pistol JXC4F21

The Beretta Px4 Storm is a semiautomatic pistol designed for concealed carry and personal defense. Borrowing features from predecessors like the Beretta M9 and Beretta 92, it is rapidly proving itself as a suitable option for law enforcement (both on and off duty), private security forces, and responsible citizens. 

The Px4 Storm comes in subcompact, compact, and full frame versions. Checkered grips on all models provide a sure grip in less than optimal conditions, and three backstraps (included with every pistol) can be swapped for comfort and fit. The design is based on that of the M9 and 92, and the Px4 Storm cannot be improperly assembled due to distinctive parts and one-way fit. 

An ambidextrious safety (thumb operated decocking lever) prevents unintentional discharge in the event the gun is dropped. High capacity double stack steel magazines provide enough firepower for self defense and law enforcement. A non-glare coating on the slide resists corrosion and stands up to the abuse expected in the line of duty. 
 •Caliber: .40 S&W
•Weight: 27.7 oz
•Action: Double/Single
•Safety: Ambidextrous Safety/Decocker, spring loaded, positively on or off
•Sights: 3-dot sight system
•Magazines Included: 2
•Magazine Capacity: 12 rounds 
•Grips: interchangeable checkered backstraps
•Slide Finish: bruniton coated steel

The original paperwork and spent rounds

Cleaning and lube sprays

This model sometimes has a problem with some ammo when it's new. Some people recommend shooting a couple thousand rounds to 'wear it in' Others recommend having it modified slightly so that it doesn't suffer from the problems that most of the P22s have out of the box [factory fresh] like failure to feed, failure to fire, improper ejection, etc.

When I got it, it looked almost brand new, but did suffer those woes. So I had the mods done. After it was 'fixed' I have shot maybe 500 rounds Winchester bulk supersonic [1400?] and the like through it without issue."

traditional styling, rock-solid scope platform, fixed barrel, accurate and easy to cock. Just 28 lbs. of cocking effort, but you're still getting magnum hunting power.

Shoot some targets, kill some tin cans, flips some spinners...the list is endless.

Very low round count and absolutely spotless. It comes with a ton of extra magazines - standard and high capacity magazines, brand new and never used, still in their packages. These magazines are not cheap and you will feel the quality of manufacturing Steyr puts into them.

More on the gun itself, it is comparable to a Glock 26 9mm but in my opinion ergonomically far superior. It has a higher tang grip for a much lower bore axis then its counter parts.  Grip angle provides a very natural draw on to target with a very fast target acquisition due to the trapezoid sights on the slide. Groupings are very tight for me and is a wonderful everyday carry.

Recoil is very manageable, it has a dual captive spring. robust design and with its flat wound spring with has an infinitely longer life then conventional coiled springs. The guide rod is made of steel and is machined with precision. place it on the table and you will see how straight it stands in its base. Do the same test with Glocks guide rod and you see the difference. 

The trigger, this is one of my favorite qualities of the gun. It is a short and crisp break in the action. With a very minimal reset, right out of the box. Upon firing it you will notice that the reset is very subtle and to some the thought of that is a negative but I will say the issue is negated by the fact that the reset is so very short with very little slack on the return. By the time you are waiting for the reset to end you are already at the take up to break the shot. its that fast. It breaks like a twig not a carrot as John Geissle would say about his AR triggers. 

I could go on and on about the pistol. The rails in which the slide glides on are 3x more robust then that of its counter parts; springfield, glock, etc. The rails are built within a stand alone chassis within the polymer frame of the gun which is another quality that adds to the accuracy of the gun.  Lastly, the polymer frame is absolutely solid, not a millimeter of bend or sway on any of the extremities of the gun. Especially in the dust cover area, where on the Glock it is notable that its dust cover does not seem to be molded straight. This is due to the dust cover of the Glock being too thin and that the frame is taken out if its mold before it is absolutely cool during the manufacturing process.  The Steyr simply does not have this problem.

I love Glock pistols, I am simply stating the superiority of this product and stand by it. 
Fun fact these series of Steyr pistols were designed by Gaston Glock himself.  It is not too hard to get one of these but also it is rare in Michigan. I was planning on doing a you tube review but you read it here. I am selling it because money is really tight for me at the moment. So it is with great regret that I am letting it go. I took the time to write this review for those who truly care for quality and superior design and is looking for their next great purchase. Those interested will walk away knowing they bought a product from me that was greatly cared for. You can literally do a finger swipe anywhere within the gun and find no dirt or gun powder anywhere. I have owned a lot of striker fired pistols and this has taken the bar pretty high for me. Every round has fired flawlessly and is rated for +P ammo. 

Now I wish I made the youtube video on it. lol

Here is the description from the website

Presenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.

The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.

Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson.  The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish"

This is a Saiga 12 with original Russian wood furniture, forend and pistol grip. This is the furniture that was imported for a short period of time and has been unavailable for a few years. Just this furniture alone sells for around 250-300 by itself on the rare occasion it comes up for sale. I added a Bulgy stock to keep the wood look going. Gun also has a rubber recoil pad to help tame the recoil a bit. This gun has been professionally converted and shoots everything from slugs to cheapo bulk pack without a hiccup. The muzzle device is a Winchoke adapter so you can add different chokes depending on what you are shooting. Gun comes with the following mags: 1 original izzy 5 rounder, 3 keep shooting 5 rounders, 1 10 round SGM stick, 1 12 round stick, 1 10 round pro mag drum and 1 MD Arms 20 round drum with both a clear back and black back cover. What I want in trade is an M1A Socom, a Tavor or maybe even a high end 308 bolt gun like a 16.5 or 20 inch Remington 700 that is all decked out with a quality optic and Timney trigger. No AR rifles in 5.56. Will also sell outright for $1500. Look around and see what others are asking for their unconverted models with little to no extras. Just the conversion will run you $150 or so in parts and another couple hundred from a reliable gunsmith for the conversion unless you can do it yourself. Thanks."

Cycles wonderfully with CCI minimags, and other good quality, HV ammo.  Had some trouble cycling the crappy Rem 22 Thunderbolt ammo (about 90% success rate), but once i got my hands on the minimags again, it worked great. 

Just got the conversion kit for my AR, so I don't really need this one anymore.  I will include a box of 500 Rem 22 Thunderbolt if you don't try to haggle with me, as this is priced well with all the extras.  Keep in mind that this ammo doesn't work as well as minimags with the gun, but I refuse to put it through my S&W, so I no longer need it.

The Henry Big Boy .45 Colt Cowboy edition captures the wild west adventures
of cowboy life on the trail.  The Henry Big Boy .44 Magnum Wildlife Edition
emulates the pulse quickening thrill of a trophy buck leaping into view.
Each genuine American walnut buttstock and forearm are engraved using
techniques which combine todays engraving technologies with hand
craftsmanship passed from  generations past. After engraving, artisans
individually hand paint the buttstock and forearm using multiple acrylic
colors. The original artwork is visually used as a guide, but subtle
detailing makes each unit truly one of a kind.

It is effectively new.  It was mounted only once by NF themselves and displayed on a TRG at their own gun show table. Originally it had no box, but I spoke directly with NF who confirmed the serial, and sent a new box as a replacement. This scope is only about 6 months old, has never been remounted, never seen a round of recoil, and is about as mint as it gets - as evidenced by the pictures where there is even no sign of ring marks. This scope comes with the sunshade, bikini, box, instruction manual, zero reset allen wrench, warranty card, disc, sticker, all the goodies, and a lifetime transferable warranty. 

Please note:  The HVM.5 reticle is designed for higher caliber loads.

A Ruger Charger 10/22 that I traded for... They are not making these anymore, a really cool pistol comes with one 10 round ruger factory mag. I know these retailed for less but they do not make them anymore and are sometimes hard to find in good shape this one is in great shape... but if you want it I would be willing to make trades as well up or down.  It has no scope rail, but includes box and stock bipod.

A solid Ruger 10/22 with a BSA Scope..... not sure exact model... Asking $295 or trade towards an AR pistol, .45 colt pistol, some other ruger products... let me know what you have.

A Springfield Armory XD .45 ACP with 3 mags and accessories.  This pistol has nightsights on it.  I think that is about a 100 dollar extra from the factory? Asking $635 OBO includes leather mag holster (less than year old), leather outsidewaistband (less than wa year old), and kydex/leather insidewaistband holster (6months old).  Will not include accessories unless the price is right!

Let me know what, if anything you are interested in.  Might make a deal for a package of all three, might trade some+ cash for a nice .308 battle rifle.  Think M1a, G3, FNFAL.

Looking for Steyr products, FN products, .308 battle rifles, nice hunting rifles/shotguns.  Also would be willing to trade for the right .357/.38 snub nose (smiths, rugers) personally do not like Tauruses.  Also looking for .45 colt double action revolvers Smith and Wesson Mountain Gun, Ruger Redhawk.  Also looking for Ruger GP100 Wiley Clapp or otherwise.  Would also like a ruger vaquero in .45 colt.

I bought the wrong type for my shotgun, so I am selling this one. Still in the package with wrench and all paperwork. 

Adjustable to nine constriction settings, these heavy-duty chokes allow you to select the proper choke for the type of shotgun shooting you’re doing. Based on the original Poly-Choke design, this new generation is fully adjustable from extra-full, to reverse choke and will handle all shotgun loads including lead slugs, heavy shot, and steel. Uses a unique, rotating method that gives you and audible “click” into place with clearly marked choke settings so finding just the right choke is simple and quick. No more fumbling around with a pocket full of choke tubes.

The 6"" barrel and adjustable rear makes this a very accurate pistol easily capable of 100yrd plus shots. As with all Rugers, the Security Six revolvers were robustly designed with, heavy-duty parts for durability and to allow for the investment casting, Early models like this one (mfg.1979) were issued by US government agencies and were standard issue service weapons of a large number of police departments, Discontinued in 1988, they remain well-liked and respected, as well as highly sought after and are becoming harder and harder to find, especially in this condition.

Mine comes in the box with the original wood grips, as well as a like new set of Pachmayr grips.
