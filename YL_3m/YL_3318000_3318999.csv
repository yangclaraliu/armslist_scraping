The .40's are great for Colorado because the mags hold 14 rounds each so you don't have to worry about going over the max capacity like with the 9's.  Plus the added stopping power is very nice.

I have fired less than 100 rounds through it.  Take a look at the web sight link below for all the specs and stuff

. http://www.px4storm.com/default_us.aspx

 It is an awesome firearm.  Good as a side arm and compact enough to conceal.  The pistol comes with a leather, inside waistband concealment holster, a laser sight and a total of 5 magazines.  It also comes with two additional grip backstraps for customizing the grip to your hand.  I will even throw in a large hard case (in pic).  

All in all a very good set up.  Let me know what you think. Please, no low balling but do make me an offer.  $400 is a very good price as it is. 
I will throw in 50 rounds of hollow points if you act fast.  Rent is due and we really need to raise the cash.

You wont find a better price than this for a near new PX4 STORM and the mags are $35 a piece.  Heck, I would buy it if I wasn't the one needing the money :)

Thanks for looking.

Saiga 20 ga polymer 19″ bbl protective bush (34)
Price: $850
The Izhmash Saiga autoloading shotgun incorporates the Kalashnikov design, providing reliability and simplicity of operation. Outstanding accuracy is achieved by the smooth bore, Lancaster style elliptical barrel, which imparts a spin on projectiles, increasing accuracy and exterior threading to accept chokes. The chrome lined barrel, chamber and gas system resist corrosion, making cleaning easier and extending the life of the shotgun. A lightweight, impact resistant polymer sporter stock and forend are checkered for comfortable control and include 3/4” sling mounts. An oversized trigger guard allows use with gloved hands. Models are available with side optic mounting rails, bead front sight, V notch rear sight or leaf rear sight. Included is a detachable five round magazine (two round hunting magazines are also available)."

108,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3318108,For Sale:  Price Drop:  1926 Spanish Mauser w/ Ammo and Bayonet,"Conyers, Covington, Atlanta, Georgia",$ 200,"Listed On: Friday, July 25, 2014",Rifles,no type,7mm Mauser                                                                                ,Bolt Action                                                                                ,Rifle,"I picked this Model 1916 Spanish Mauser with the intent on restoring it. It has the Oviedo crest, dated 1926, and Serial numbers on barrel and receiver match. The rear sight is the ""roller coast"" style, which was only used on this model for one year, and is thus very rare. This rifle is also in the original 7mm chambering.
  The stock is in really good shape, and was refinished with tung oil. The outside of the barrel and several of the metal parts show some pitting in areas. I cleaned off all the rust (which was so significant in places that the rifle was rust-welded into the stock), and cold-blued the barrel and all stripped parts to give some protection. The receiver was not stripped, and had no rust. The trigger group, receiver, magazine follower, and the bolt are in really good shape, and are all-original.  The rifle functions smoothly and flawlessly, and the trigger pull is extremely smooth and crisp.
  The pitting on the barrel is on the outside, right at the wood line. The pitting does not appear to be deep enough to affect safe operation, and is pretty far from the chamber. Speaking of the chamber, there is some throat wear, but the rifling is very strong.
  I have never fired this rifle, so I can't comment on how it shoots. I have 60 rounds of new production reloadable factory ammunition, as well as 35 factory reloads, which are loaded to standard specs, and were given to me by a licensed ammunition manufacturer. I am also including a nice, long bayonet, which mounts up perfectly. The metal has some serious pitting, and there is a repaired crack in the handle. The bayonet is structurally sound, and looks pretty neat when mounted to the gun.
  There are some minor tooling marks on some of the minor hardware, but not much at all: from what I recall, one of the recoil cross bolts has a notch cut into the head for ease of removal, but that doesn't affect functionality.

  Let me know if you want further info, or have any questions, or want more detailed pictures.  Price was dropped to $200.00 FIRM for the lot, which breaks down as $10.00 for the bayonet (which I think is a Model 1917), $40.00 for the 95 rounds of ammo (all brass-cased, boxer primed, and reloadable), and $150.00 for the rifle.  I will not ship, and all I require for the sale is a peek at your GA license, and a generic bill of sale for my records (name, signature, and date only...no personal information like license number or address of anything). We must meet in the Conyers/Covington area."

Up for sale is my Hornady Lock 'n' Load Auto Progressive Press. I have had this press for approx. 6 months now. Due to me obtaining a job that requires me to travel 3 weeks a month minimum, I have lost the majority of my free time I spent at the range. 

This setup is absolutely everything you need for the ultimate reloading experience. It comes with all the high end accessories such as a dillon case trimmer for trimming long neck cases (such as the .223/5.56) completely automated in one of the 5 stages of the press. you can hook up a shopvac to the trimmer to collect all metal shavings for a mess free experience.

I also include a (guestimate) 250Lb reloading table that is heavily reinforced that i spent approx 200$ building. I actually stood on the table and lightly jumped on it (im 210lbs) and it didnt bow the slightest bit. It will be able to handle all your reloading pressure. It has a raiser made for the press so the lever is ideal arm height when sitting in a normal computer/office chair.

Today I am selling my Springfield Armory M1911 A-1 Fully Loaded Chamberd in .45 ACP, which is Americas handgun since the well of course 1911. It is an all blue finish that looks amazing with a couple of nice upgrades. It has Trijicon Night Sights installed, Skeletonized Trigger & Hammer, 2 peice guide rod for maximum accuracy, Wilson Combat magazines and also VZ Grips which feel awesome and give the gun a great look! This gun is absolutely gorgeous and I have not shot more than 350 rds out of the gun. I mainly bought it just for the sake of having a peice of American history not to carry it or take it to the range all the time. Its been cleaned after every time I have shot it, which includes a full detail strip not just a rub down of the slide. It runs so smooth, handles recoil very well and i can honestly tell you it is a tack driver (Very very accurate) and a blast to shoot!

This gun comes with the original box and accessories which include :
Paddle Holster
Magazine Holster
Original Factory Magazines
And all original parts that were changed out by a professional gunsmith!
I can also throw in an outside the waistband holster or some ammo : both hollowpoints and FMJ's if you are interested as well.

This gun is in mint condition and I really hate to get rid of it but financials are tough around this time and could use the money. Lets make a deal!

I am selling for 500 OBO
It interested please call or text Max - REDACTED

Thanks! Hope to do business with you!"

The installation of the thumb operated mag release does not require alltered mags and the gun will still function flawlessly with factory Mark I or Mark II mags and it makes them drop free which allows for extremely fast mag changes' You will love it but if you dont you can convert it back to the factory mag release in minutes.

The Geissele Super Semi-Automatic Enhanced (SSA-E) Trigger is a finely-tuned semi-automatic-only version of our full-auto, two stage combat trigger presently used in the U.S. Special Operations Community. Built on the chassis of the Geissele SSA, the SSA-E provides enhanced trigger control and weapon accuracy while maintaining the robustness and reliability of our combat-proven two-stage trigger. The SSA-E’s reduced 1st and 2nd stage pull weights result in a trigger with a smooth, light 1st stage take-up and a crisp, candy cane-like 2nd stage break. The SSA-E is ideal for use in precision Squad Designated Marksman type rifles where weapon accuracy and reliability are critical and a non-adjustable drop in trigger is desired."

History Time :-) The reason why it's basically the same gun is because, A large contract for the Beretta 92 was with the Brazilian army, for which Beretta set up a factory in Brazil. This factory was later sold to the Brazilian gun maker Taurus.
So,Taurus can make the PT92 without the need for a license from Beretta since their design is based on the original Beretta 92, whose patents have expired.

Vintage style high rear buckhorn sights and high post front sight like the older guns. Gold engraved on the barrel ""DUKE - ONE OF ONE THOUSAND"". John Wayne's signature is engraved on the tang. A saddle ring is installed on the left side of the receiver. This rifle is presented in a beautiful red velvet lined hardwood case. This rifle must be shipped to an FFL.

High quality gun. Never fired. This shotgun was purchased by my Grandmother and kept in her home for home protection. (I think she forgot she purchased it..) Has a few nicks here and there, but they are hardly noticeable. No case included, but has original letter of sale and a few accessories ie: choke key, plug, and a few Remington decals. Below is description from Remington site-

""This All-American pump gun brings hunters the best of all worlds. Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that you'll find in our legendary Model 870 Wingmaster®, but at a much more affordable price.

Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years1.""

The Beretta 92FS has been setting the standards for best military, police and tactical pistol for over a quarter century. The reason is that it was designed--and has kept evolving--to be and remain the most accurate, durable and reliable semiauto handgun on the market. Easy to use, absolutely safe and delivering impressive firepower, it remains the sidearm of the US military and of allied forces the world over, as well as of countless police and law-enforcement agencies.


Superior Reliability

The 92FS is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92FS still has no match. Period.     


Match-Grade Accuracy out of the Box

Regardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92FS consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of  match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only gives the 92FS its extraordinary accuracy, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple this to the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92FS remains the best pistol in its class.


Packed with Useful Tactical Features

This pistol offers a variety of tactical features that make it equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster of military personnel as well as for home or personal defense. Its reversible magazine release lets you use either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes it flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. Its Bruniton finish is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion, and after shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it a snap to take the pistol apart for cleaning. These and countless other useful features make the 92FS the choice of military and police professionals all over the world, as well as individuals wanting the absolute best for sport or self-protection.     

This one is Italian made and come with 4 mags, 2-17 and 2-15. It has about 50 rounds through the barrel. Comes with all the factory items in the factory case.

The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."
