We have two police trade-in Glock 22 RTF2s for sale. The RTF2 models were made to order by Glock for law enforcement agencies only in 2009. The RTF2 models are Gen3 guns with deep ""fish gill"" slide serrations and a very aggressive grip texture. Most of the LE agencies that purchased the RTF2 models replaced them with Gen4 models that came out in 2010, because the grip texture on the RTF2s was so aggressive that it was destroying officer's uniforms, seatbelts, center consoles and anything else it rubbed against frequently.

These guns come with factory Glock night sights, one 15-round magazine, the plastic box, Glock magazine loader, cable lock, Glock cleaning rod, Glock nylon cleaning brush, manual and fired casings. The fired casings have a collected date of 4/17/09 and 4/22/09. The plastic boxes have the names of the officers they were issued to on them. One has ""Segreto Glock 22"" on the Glock warning sticker and the other has green duct tape with the faded name of the officer it was issued to written in black Sharpie. 

These guns are in 95% condition. These guns have been detail-cleaned and inspected by a certified Glock armorer. You can take these guns directly to the range after you take possession.

Price: $499 for either gun.  The price is FIRM.  The first purchaser gets first choice, but these guns are identical. Illinois residents pay 6.5% sales tax. Price reflects a cash discount of approximately 3.5%. If you pay by any method other than cash, the price is $517.

You can take possession at Metro Armory's licensed premises in LaSalle County or I can ship to an FFL near you for $35 additional.

Note: The pictures of the Glock night sights were taken side-by-side with a Gen4 G19 with <1 year old Glock factory nights sights for comparison. The Gen4 G19 is on the left in both pictures."

It is beautiful in it's simplicity. If you're coming back from the Sandbox and want a weapon EXACTLY like what you likely carried then this is it. 

The upper is an exact M4 clone. Built exactly to spec using 100% authentic parts. The upper is ALL Colt.  

Colt Diemaco M4 flat top upper with feed lips (Canadian Colt factory built HARD HARD HARD to find) 
AUTHENTIC Colt 14.5"" carbine length M4 govt. profile barrel 1/7 with F marked FSP and pinned and welded BCM A2x flash hider. This is not some civilian 16"" barrel at WalMart. This is the real deal. It is 100% legal with the pinned and welded flash hider and makes the length of the weapon a bit shorter and easier to get in and out of cars and move through buildings with.

MagPul FDE sling (the much better older model)

As you can see the whole weapon is painted in FDE but it can come off easily (but why?) 

Anyway, this weapon has MAYBE 400 rds through the barrel and runs FLAWLESSLY. I love it but I don't use it as much because I have essentially the same weapon in an SBRed MK18.

This thing is 100% zeroed. It will hit a lovebug at 200 yards.

I bought a P229R the month after and really put this in the safe and let it sit. The round count is well under 150 as I think it went to the range twice. I carried it a couple times and after getting the P229, I preferred the smaller profile 9mm. It comes with the black Sig case, all paperwork, two magazines, a Galco Summer Carry IWB holster and a Fobus Paddle holster. Also note that it has Sig contrast sights. They have a phosphorescent paint over the white for visibility in low light. I also have the E2 grip kit installed on it. The E2's came out right after this pistol was made, so I got the grip kit ( grips, removal tool, and mainspring) from Sig and installed it. It also comes with the stock grips, mainspring..etc. please do not ask if I will take less, this price is firm as I am pricing it to sell. $550 firm. My travel distance is about 30 miles from Jefferson. At this price I cannot travel far."

This is a 1994 model Seamaster Professional 300 meter Quartz movement dive watch. It is the model 2561.80.00. This is the Mid-Sized ""James Bond"" watch. It has a 36.25mm case width. It includes paperwork, Warranty Card stamped from Gassan Schiphol (official dealer in high end watches and jewelry) in the airport in Amsterdam. I had it serviced at a Rolex dealer and the battery replaced and pressure tested to 300m. It passed with flying colors. The Swiss quartz movement doesn't lose time as bad as my mechanical movement SMP. I never wear this watch anymore and would love to see it go to a great home. It has normal scuffs and such for a watch worn 10-12 days a year. Most of these you will see used are over $1000, even as high as $1700-1900 in the Charlotte area. I am not trying to make my money back, but rather find a good home for a great watch. A must have for a James Bond fan. Please know I am firm on my price of $750 for everything shown in the pictures. Price is firm ! These watches are going for $1200-1900 locally or on eBay.  $750"

The wait list to buy one of his barrels is something like two years long. This barrel is threaded 5/8x24 and is 0.75"" thick at the gas port. The barrel is built on a Stag Arms blank. High-quality craftsmanship and precision is evident by looking at the threading, crown, gas port, etc. The feed ramps have been polished.

I purchased this barrel new in November 2013, used it to build a pistol upper, let the upper sit in my safe for 6 months, and then I disassembled the upper and decided to go with a different length. This barrel is brand new, unfired and hasn't had so much as a round put into the chamber. There is some minor wear on the exterior finish from assembly and disassembly, but nothing major and nothing that won't be covered up by the handguard. $200, cash only, no trades. Price is FIRM.

I have what I believe might be the ultimate 1911 starter kit. Let me describe for you.

Springfield Range Officer chambered in .45 acp. Comes with original box, 2 mag holster, RH OWB holster. 

I orignially bought this to be the base for a custom pistol, but I realize I just don't have the patience, tools, or mechanical aptitude to keep a 1911 running like it should. Plus I shoot this as well as my m&p45's, so i figure I'll standardize on those.

As far as shooting, the gun outshoots me. When I do my part, I can get one ragged hole after 2 mags within 15 yards. This has had a steady diet of 230 gr hardball, 

The gun includes all orignal parts, along with the upgraded parts. Have no fear, I didn't bubba the feedramp or dremel anything; it's easily convertible to orginal factory condition. This wasn't a safe queen, and has some knicks in the park'd finish. Im the original owner, and I've put about 2300 rounds through the factory match barrel. It shoots Gold Dots and Federal HST's well, no issues feeding. Only problem I had early on was using CMC 8 round powermags (strangely no issues with the 10 rounders). The solution for that was not to use them anymore. It runs like a sewing machine with springfield 7 round mags, Wilson ETM's, and 47D's.

I also have the springfield loaded coupon, a great way to get OEM magazines, holsters, and accesories for pretty cheap (unfortunately my daughter drew on it, and I filled out some of the info, but that shouldn't matter)

Upgrades include:

-Harrison night sights, professionally installed ($150)
-Cocobolo wood grips ($40)
-S&A flat, slim one piece MSH/magwell unit ($50)
-10 8 performance flat trigger bow ($30)
-3 additional SA 7 round magazines
-all magazines (4) come with Ed Brown plastic bumper pads
-LH Fobus paddle holster
-RH IWB N82 tactical holster https://www.n82tactical.com/store/holsters/1911-5-inch1

All the extras would run you about $300 if purchased seperately. 

Sale price is $750. That means $750. 

Only trades Im interested in would be a S&W M&P 45 mid-size plus cash on your end, depending on what sort of extras it includes, an HK P30 in 9mm with at least 4 15 round mags. 

M-F I can only meet after 6:30 in area code 22192. On saturdays I can meet in Woodbridge, or anywhere along I95 from Dumfries to Springfield, or the WalMart on Liberia Ave in Manassass.

New in the box, Taurus PT-1911 45ACP Semi-Auto Handgun

Destined to become the standard that all 1911 pistols are compared against, the Taurus 1911 offers you the most accurate and feature-laden model on the market today. Starting with our own hammer-forged -not cast- ordnance grade steel frames, slides and barrels, we machine each and every part to tolerance levels that surpass even today's industry standards. Our skilled pistol smiths hand-fit and tune each gun with the 19 standard features seen below, using quality parts that are built 100% in our state-of-the-art factory. Then they mark the slide, barrel and frame with matching serial numbers. Available in the powerful .45 ACP, this aggressive, rock-solid firearm is ready to go right out of the box. The Taurus 1911 is an unbeatable gun that is also an unbeatable value.

Taurus Security System (TSS)s Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.

The first of the many recent additions to the Heckler & Koch handgun line, the P2000 and incorporate features of the successful HK USP Compact pistol with the latest innovations of HK engineers. A refinement of a design created for several European police agencies, the P2000 is available with a traditional double-action/single-action trigger mode and the LEM/CDA (Law Enforcement Modification, also known as Combat Defense Action) trigger system first introduced in 2001 on the USP Compact ""LEM"" model.

The HK Law Enforcement Modification trigger system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull from first to last round fired) with a double-action hammer system.

Developed especially for a U.S. government agency, the Law Enforcement Modification (or LEM for short), is a unique trigger mechanism created specifically to improve the trigger performance and reduce the weight of the Double-Action Only (DAO) trigger pull on HK pistols.

With this mechanism, HK pistols can be fired like a standard DAO semi-automatic pistol where every round is fired by simply pulling the trigger fully rearward with the hammer starting at the forward rest position. The design of the proprietary HK LEM system allows the weight of the DAO trigger pull to be reduced to a smooth and constant 6.18 - 8.5 pounds (27.5 - 37.8 N) because the two-part hammer is pre-cocked every time the slide moves rearward. Trigger pull on conventional double action pistols is 12 - 15 pounds (53.4 - 66.7N).

The unique LEM pre-cocked hammer system combines the advantages of a cocked striker component (constant level of trigger pull and short trigger travel from first to last round fired) with a double action hammer system. Optional adjustment (by HK certified armorer) can bring the trigger pull into the 5.5 pound (24.5 N) range.

Using such an enhanced trigger system consolidates ease of use and safety into a convenient, innovative trigger operation — one that prevents unintended firing. And in case of an ammunition-related failure to fire, all that is needed is an additional second or third pull of the trigger without the need of first pulling the slide back to re-cock the P2000. The enhanced LEM trigger system combines the reliability of a double action revolver trigger with the crisp, precise trigger of a single action pistol.

A set of simple-to-install modular grip panels allow the P2000 to be custom-fitted to any shooter’s hand. An ambidextrous magazine release and dual slide release levers make handling the P2000 natural and easy for right and left-handed shooters alike.

Industry standard mounting rails allow the widest variety of lights, laser aimers, and accessories to be added to the P2000 by sliding them onto the open rail system. The HK P2000 includes the same recurved, hook trigger guard found on the USP Compact and uses reliable and widely available USP Compact magazines.

A limited edition P2000 German Police Model features a ""closed"" accessory mounting rail system and a tapered trigger guard.

Plus P rated for duty use. This firearm is designed to handle high pressure loads under SAAMI specifications.
Taurus Security System (TSS)rs Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear.

Springfield Armory® XD-S™ Centerfire Pistols

Perfect for compact, concealed carry Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System

Loaded-chamber indicator Single-position Picatinny rail

To create the XD-S Centerfire Pistols, Springfield Armory took the best innovations of the award-winning XD Series and trimmed down the frame to a perfect size for compact, concealed carry. Metal parts on each gun are forged and machined from billet with utmost precision. Fully hammer-forged barrels enhance accuracy. Corrosion-resistant finishes are either super-hard black Melonite® or classic bead-blasted stainless steel. The Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied. Loaded-chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. Grip safety allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. A more pronounced texture on the XD-S ensures your grip is always secure.

A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size with this feature. The XD-S trigger has a short travel along with a short reset, which keeps you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots. The low-profile rear sight is holster friendly. Fiber-optic front sight promotes easier and faster target acquisition. Customize your grip with two interchangeable backstraps. Includes rugged carry case, paddle holster, double magazine pouch, two interchangeable backstraps, cable lock, bore brush and safety manual. from Village Tactical you will receive (2) standard 5 round mags and (1) extended 7 round mag!"

It is a short recoil operated action just like a M1911 which makes it one of very few .380acp guns that shoot without the harshness of the more common blowback design guns. Very low recoil. Shoots well with a clean bore and tight lock-up. A very well made gun and a great size for concealed carry. Would also be a great gun for a lady as the slide is easily manipulated.

Rifle shoots GREAT. The P415 is slightly heavier than other AR's on the market but I personally like it. Shooting from any kind of supported position this thing is a ROCK. Follow up shots are instantaneous and even while shooting offhand muzzle flip or recoil is almost non existent. Shooting some regular cheap off the shelf Federal American eagle I was still easily capable of getting it to shoot 1 MOA at 100 yards. This gun is  a PERFECT rifle to use in the 3 gun circuit. I originally purchased this rifle only 2 WEEKS AGO due to the fact that me and my buddies were going to start shooting 3 gun together. Well as of last week they decided to shoot pistol only so after a week of trying to convince them other wise they didn't want to budge. So here it is. Practically brand new out of the box. Comes with 1 mag, Drago Double Rifle Drag Bag (coyote tan), Original Vortext box with EVERYTHING....manual cleaning cloth, even the cool little vortex pin they throw in."

With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol."

Below I have listed the factory description and specifications for you to look over, if you have any questions feel free to give us a call, shoot us a email, or stop in and check out our large selection of new and used firearms!!

 Description: A direct descendant of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by HK as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm. Using the HK- proprietary gas piston system found on the HK416 and G36, the MR556A1 does not introduce propellant gases and carbon fouling back into the rifle's interior, making it the most reliable of any AR-type firearm. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. This handguard system allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons to be fitted to the MR rifles. The HK rail system can be installed and removed without tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR566A1 is produced in the USA from both American and German-made components. Additionally, subassemblies like the MR556A1's upper receiver will be fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. The MR556A1 uses a barrel produced by HK's famous cold hammer forging process using the highest quality steel to produce a long life barrel that provides superior performance with minimal degradation of accuracy and muzzle velocity after prolonged use.

 Specifications:
•Semi-auto, Proprietary Gas-Piston Operating System employs a piston & solid operating “pusher” rod (in place of the gas tube commonly found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms) to virtually eliminate hot carbon fouling & waste gases from entering the receiver area causing malfunction 
•Match rifle capability 
•Features Picatinny top rail machined into the upper receiver & HK free-floating four quadrant rail system (FFRS) handguard w/(4) MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rails 
•Upper receiver/barrel assembly are fully interchangeable w/other high quality AR-style firearms 
•Cold hammer-forged, heavy contour barrel is moderately “swagged” & constructed of the highest quality steel for superior accuracy & long life 
•Unlined bore for optimum accuracy w/internal profile of 6 lands & grooves 
•1:7"" Twist 
•Enhanced 2-stage trigger 
•7.64 lb. trigger pull 
•Extended latch charging handle 
•Retractable buttstock can be locked in place by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock 
•C.I.P dimensioned chamber allows for a wide variety of 5.56x45mm ammo & also functions reliably w/most quality .223 Rem. ammo 
•OAL: 37.68"" (extended), 33.9"" (retracted)

 The Story: I have owned this gun for 46 years. I bought it from a US Navy shipmate while serving in Viet Nam. Our Destroyer was assigned to Gun Fire Support missions off  the coast  between 1966 and 1968. We would be out to sea for months at a time only to make port for a few days in Yokosuka Japan, Hong Kong or Subic Bay Philippines, then back out to sea. Young Sailors with little liberty would go through money like water. A shipmate of mine desperate for some ""R &R Money"" offered to sell me this gun. I bought and owned it ever since.
The Deal: In Person sale in or near North Carolina or I will ship  My FFL dealer to Your FFL dealer with a full payment in advance. You pay for shipping and one FFL fee, I will pay the FFL fee on my end. Scammers beware, I will be check out potential buyers and Gun shops.

These hand-built revolvers were first introduced in 1955 and produced until mid 2000's, the now discontinued Colt Python is one of the most highly regarded revolvers in the world. Formerly manufactured by Colt's Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut. It is sometimes referred to as a ""Combat Magnum"" or ""Python Magnum"". 

Some firearm collectors and writers such as Jeff Cooper, Ian V. Hogg, Chuck Hawks, Leroy Thompson, Renee Smeets and Martin Dougherty have described the Python as the finest production revolver ever made. 

This model (serial number E50593) was produced in 1972 and features a ""Bright Nickel"" finish and a 4"" vent rib barrel. It has had probably a few boxes of shells through it throughout the course of it's life. Firearm is still exceptionally clean with no signs of carbon building and very mild scoring on cylinder gap. 

Action on this firearm feels like it floats on ball bearings, double and single action pull is perfect and crisp. Bore is bright and perfectly clean along with the rest of firearm. 

Only real condition issues are exemplified in pictures, a couple of specks on the cylinder, abrasion marks on cylinder gap from a cleaning brush and a couple of light marks in the finish. Unfortunately the original box and paperwork is NOT available with this firearm. 


Pictures are of exact firearm you will receive, additional pictures available to serious inquires only.
