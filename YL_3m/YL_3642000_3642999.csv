The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

It has 15 rounds through it, I wasn't going to use to so I could sell it in new condition but something came up and I ran 15 rounds though, this pistol is flawless in every way.

If you check around for prices on this NNA .22 Magnum Derringer, you will find mine is priced right, it is fun and easy to use plus the transfer & background fees total $20, $10 each to be paid by the buyer.

The .22 Sidewinder .22 Magnum will be a legal sale.

I love it, but it needs to go to a new owner. I also have second .22 Magnum, I do not need two .22 Magnum's, my second .22 Magnum is full size as big as an Army .45.

I may keep Sidewinder if it doesn't sell soon for personal protection which I will use for several years in the future. It is priced for a quick sale.

I bought the Sidewinder new from a dealer so it comes with it's original box with it's original contents, included the factory card so it will be in your name at the factory. 

It comes with a lifetime warranty.

I will sell  the Sidewinder Derringer as it is the most poplar of the of NNA's Derringers plus it is still in ""like new"" condition.

I am currently putting together another AR build and needed to free up some moola. I had this thing gathering dust in the safe for a month and think it needs a new home. I own two other ACOGs in addition to this and have to say that there is no better optic on the market. These things are absolute tanks. The quality is second to none. This unit has not been mounted, let alone used. Its the TA31RMR with the red crosshair reticle with the 556 BDC. The RMR mounted on the top of it is 3.25 MOA. Comes with everything you would expect it to if it were coming from the manufacturer. I originally purchased it from Optics Planet when they had a sale on for around $1800. I am asking $1500. I have included some pics, but they are super small for some reason. If you want some more pics I can email or text them to you. I live in Tampa (USF area) and will only do a face to face transaction (no shipping)."

This charging handle is new and never used (I bought it for an AR15 build that I never got around to.) The description from Bravo Company's website is below:

A NEW Charging Handle and Extended Latch System
Charging Handle Machined from 7075 T6 Billet
Hard Coat Anodized per Mil-A-8625F, Type III, Class 2
GFH - Mod4 (medium latch)
Compatible with Mil-Spec AR-15 Direct Impingement Weapon Systems.
**NOT compatible with adjustable gas keyed bolt carrier groups.**
The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle offers two significant advantages:
1. The tiny roll pin is no longer the weak point - it is a much stronger system and tactical latch will stay intact even under repeated support side only manipulation.

2. With the force kept inside the body of the handle, when the handle is pulled directly to the rear, it moves directly to the rear and does not angle off to the outboard side. A much smoother operation.

I can add ammo and a holster for the right deal....

Made by Bravo Company MFG, Inc. (BCM™) These Barreled Upper Receiver Groups are designed for shooting professionals with the Mil-Spec features for the demands of their duty. They are fully assembled, headspaced, and test fired. 

As a note: BCM™ barrel components are parkerized separately before assembly. Prior to shipping, all BCM™ upper receiver groups are test fired for function, laser bore sighted with a Milspec carry handle for sight alignment within Mil-Specs, and then batch samples are test fired for accuracy. As such, the upper receiver group will show handling marks consistant with these quality control procedures.

M4 Feed Ramp Barrel Extension (USGI)
M4 Feed Ramp Flat Top Receiver: In developing the USGI M4 carbine as one of the primary weapons for today’s infantry, some modifications were performed to the original M16 platform to enhance the reliability of the shorter barreled carbines. With the shorter carbine gas system and the increased gas port pressure, the carbine cycled faster, and at times the cycle rate could be faster than the magazine would feed ammunition. One of the modifications done to increase reliable feeding included enhancing the angle and the length of the feed ramps. This USGI modification was done to both the barrel extension and the upper receiver, creating a longer and steeper feed ramp. These Mil-Spec M4 feed ramps are part of the original CNC manufacturing process. As a result, the factory machined M4 feed ramps on the receiver are hard coat anodized which adds significant strength to the aluminum. This feature is offered on all BCM uppers and all BCM barrels. 

T-Marked Upper Receiver: The contemporary M16/M4 rifle is built around the concept of modularity. All of the BCM flat top uppers feature a USGI type laser etched T-marks to provide addressing for the remounting of tactical accessories such as optics, laser sights, etc. This enables the weapon platform to be easily configured and then accurately reconfigured for each specific mission. 

USGI 1/7 Twist Rate: The USGI 1/7 twist rate of all of the BCM barrels is the preferred twist rate by most professional infantryman. This twist rate has proven very versatile and can effectively run the new heavier 5.56 ammo that is hugely popular with military and private security personal for its’ superior ballistics. 

Mil-Spec 11595E - Barrel Steel: BCM barrel steel is Mil-Spec per MIL-B-11595E. This grade (CMV) of steel is a Mil-Spec steel used in the USGI M16 family of rifles; it is stronger and will last longer than the typical barrels offered in the commercial market. The Mil-Spec grade steel gets its’ additional strength and rigidity from an increase in carbon and/or vanadium in the alloy. This will offer increased barrel life and performance through use in all types of extreme environments and temperatures.

Chrome Bore and Chamber: One of the first modifications that were made to the original M16 in the mid 1960’s was the addition of the chrome lined bore and chamber. It is now a world wide standard in the industry for a battle rifle. The chrome bore and chamber is harder than the barrel steel and on the USGI M16/M4 rifles will aid in chambering, extraction, and reliability. It increases velocity, and also resist against fouling and corrosion from extended use in the field. This gives the end user a longer barrel life with less required time in maintenance and cleaning. 

Manganese Phosphate Barrel Finish: Barrels are parkerized with the manganese phosphate finish (Mil-Spec A-A-59267). Military specifications also state that the entire barrel surface is phosphate finished to create a porous surface to absorb oil as to resist against corrosion from the elements. BCM barrels are phosphated before installation of front sights. This is a much more extensive assembly operation, but insures that the entire barrel is finished and protected . . .even under the front sight base. 

5.56 NATO Chambers: The USGI 5.56 NATO chamber is the best choice for effective deployment, reliability, and compatibility, of higher chamber pressures of military ammo. 

Mil-Spec F-Marked Forged Front Sight Bases: Mil-Spec for rifles issued to the troops require taller front sight bases on all flat top AR rifles. Many commercial offerings use M16A2 height front sight bases on all of their barrels regardless of what type of upper it is installed on. As a result, owners of rifles and carbines with the flat top receiver configuration can have problems getting a proper 'zero' for elevation with Mil-Spec back up iron sights. As all of the BCM uppers are built for flat top uppers, all have the proper Mil-Spec F marked front sight base to insure the correct height for iron sight zeroing when using military iron sights. Mil-Spec taper pins secure the forged front sight base with the sling swivel secured by tubular rivets. 

Government Barrel Profiles: Duty rifles are built to be carried - day in and day out. The USGI barrel profiles (often referred to as the Government Profile) enable the operator to carry their weapon for longer periods of time and deploy them faster than the heavier commercial H-Barrel counterparts. The government profile barrel is also compatible with the current M203 mounting systems. 

HPT / MP Inspected Barrels: Military specifications require that barrels undergo a HPT (High-Pressure Test) load as a part of quality assurance procedures. Commonly referred to as a proof load, the M197 HPT is rated for 70,000 psi. BCM barrels are proof loaded and then MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspected) to detect any possible flaws in the barrels surface. The barrels are MP inspected with both circular and longitudinal magnetic fields per ASTME1444-01 (current Mil-Spec) to assure a high quality finished product. All BCM barrels are marked HP MP as our proof load marking."

If you don't know not only are these rare as parts kits, but the barrel alone has become rare in the right twist rate.
Also with the new import ban we probably won't be seeing any more of these.
For a short history, she only has 100 rounds through her.
She does have the muzzle device pinned and welded but it's an easy job if you want to make her into an sbr.
I do have some cans of 7n6 I'm willing to part with if you feel so inclined.
Also comes with 5 magazines which are a mix of circle 10 and 21 mags, the bag that attaches to the folding stock, along with a rail if you want to go that route.
I know what the value of this firearm is, lowballers will be laughed at.

** UPDATE ** I have acquired an extra top cover for the Krinkov. Reason being the previous owner had tapped the one currently on it for a rail. I found this disgusting and decided to get an extra top cover that is non numbered if you wish to replace it. (Which is a very easy process for any half decent gun smith.)"

Unlike other models the installation does not require removal of the front sight or the muzzle brake on post ban models.
THE AR-15 FREE FLOAT TACTICAL FOREARM KIT COMES COMPLETE WITH ALL MOUNTING HARDWARE AND THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS:(1) Free floating tactical forearm assembly, (1) full and (2) half-top and bottom rails (two halves placed together make a full rail), (2) half-top and bottom forearm panels (two halves placed together make a full forearm panel), (2) half-side rails, (1) half-offset side rail (ambidextrous design), and (2) half-side forearm panels.The kit also includes a torx wrench.

Product Information

Constructed from black anodized aluminum, this standard length tube is vented for rapid cooling and ribbed for a sure grip. Two piece construction, gunsmithing required. 
Technical Information
Material: Anodized Aluminum
Rifle Length:12.6""
Finish: Hardcoat Black
Gunsmithing Required: Yes
Notes: 
•  Ribbed not knurled.
•  Two piece construction

I have used one of these some years back on a friends AR, and the advice from a Midway reviewer below is important if alignment is an issue. No big deal for the handy.
DPMS has gone to Carbon Fiber for this vented guard, however, Midway still sells the aluminum version for $92.99. I bought this one several years back for a build that changed direction. I believe I probably paid $50. NEW - Never been installed. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is nice if you're just wanting a float tube. However if you're wanting a float tube for a bipod requiring installing a sling stud or threaded stud then tube slot alignment may be a problem.
Before you marry this float tube to the receiver make sure your upper fits well to the lower while your barrel is off. Use oversize NM pins, an AR15AccuShim, pivot pin lug spacers if needed and an AccuWedge, etc. The only thing loose on a target AR15 should be the sling. 
Torque the barrel nut more than specs to 45 - 50 lbs. so to tighten and loosen the tube without fear of moving the barrel nut. 
After the barrel nut is aligned and tight the tube can be timed by carefully surfacing the tube threaded end accordingly. Once the tube is positioned for final tightening place a mark for its anticipated 6 o'clock position then remove the tube, check position for the bipod, drill and install the stud.
Touch up tube surfacing with Aluminum Black, etc. Apply a half drop of blue Loctite on a couple of barrel nut threads at the seam end. Make sure tube is strap wrench tight otherwise your bipod may wind up on top of your rifle. You can use an old belt and a tightened hose clamp placed ahead of the tube threads that engage the barrel nut. Insert a screwdriver in the tightened clamp screw and carefully tap it with a hammer until the tube aligns."

Thanks for looking! Here's the description from Midway:

Product Information:

When a shooting situation gets up close and personal, you need a scope that was designed and built specifically for that kind of shooting - whether during a tactical situation or when hunting dangerous big game. To compromise with anything else could prove to be life threatening. The 1-4x CMR (Close Medium Range) scope is the scope you need. This relatively short 30mm tube scope does not add a lot of weight to any rifle, and thanks to the large diameter of the scope tube, it lets in a lot of light for a bright target image. Also, due to the high quality fully multi-coated lenses, that image is also clear and sharp. An extremely practical circular reticle aids in quick target acquisition by drawing the attention of the shooter's eye to the center of the scope. To insure that the target is fully visible, this reticle has only a horizontal crosshair, with a partial vertical lower crosshair. The upper half of this reticle leaves the scope clean and uncluttered. Plus, the lower crosshair features short bar aiming points calibrated for standard .223 and .308 service ammo, which are very precise out to 600 meters. Another great feature of the 1-4x CMR scope is Leatherwood's new ""Zero Locking System"", which does exactly what it says. Once the shooter has the scope sighted in, this system allows that alignment to be locked in place, still offering a minimal amount of adjustment for slight tweaking of shot placement. This is the most advanced ""zero guarantee"" in the industry today. The 1-4x CMR scope is built with all of the ruggedness and reliability that has made this line well known for its quality and value. Other features include tough, wear resistant Perma-Coat soft luster blue-black finish, lenses polished to photographic quality, ""Tri-Center"" spring tension for positive windage and elevation adjustment, and a Fast Focus large diameter ocular lens. The Leatherwood CMR Rifle Scope is covered by a limited lifetime factory warranty."

Used only several times. Stag Magazine (painted matte black) has minor scratches. BCG works like new. Be aware that a 22 conversion in a 5.56 barrel has accuracy limitations. Manufacturer claims 2"" groups at 50 yards, which gives you a 4"" to 5"" group at 100 yards. Great for plinking cheap ammo and general firearms training. 

New retail on this item is $220 plus $30 for the extra 35 round magazine. 

The conversion kit is constructed of stainless steel, and is compatible with both direct gas and piston operated rifles. It quickly installs into the upper and allows the use of inexpensive .22LR cartridge for practice.

Required chamber: 5.56 NATO chamber
Accuracy: 2"" groups at 50 yards

This gun will rate an easy 97% with a slight turnline and only a hint of muzzle wear.  It has been fired but obviously minimally so.  

These N frame 6.5"" 29's are skyrocketing in value and I feel my asking price is more than fair due to the beautiful condition of the gun itself, let alone the factory target stocks.  Gun itself is all target as well.  This is by FAR the most desirable of the 29-2 series as it is physically identical to the model portrayed in the Dirty Harry series.  Make no mistake, this one is a beauty and in my opinion, a true collectors piece.

This 29 does not come with original box, tools or papers BUT I will include the modern era S&W wooden presentation case that is blue velvet lined and designed specifically for a 6.5"" N frame piece.  These cases go for around a hundred or so on eBay.
