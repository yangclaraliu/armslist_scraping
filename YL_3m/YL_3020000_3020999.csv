If you're looking to trade straight across, your trade should be close to that price, otherwise, you or I will need to add cash to make up the difference. 

I have a Ruger 10/22 takedown that is Multicam in color with stainless barrel and receiver. The rifle is new in the box, unfired and comes with it's own case and all that came with it from the factory. I've had it for a couple of years and just never done anything with it. 

I'm really only looking for trades, but will accept $350 cash and entertain reasonable cash offers. I can add or accept a little cash for something, but I'm mostly looking for an even trade. 

Thanks for looking and God bless."

It has a 4.25"" barrel. This pistol has received many upgrades to include most of its parts replaced with Wilson Combat parts. This pistol is unique because it had custom work done to the trigger guard with the famous 1911 gunsmith Armand Swenson's patented square design. 

Additionally, I also had it coated with Aluma Hyde II with a two-tone balance of an earth brown frame and black slide and all operating controls. The hammer and barrel, however, are stainless. 

The parts of this gun that were updated with Wilson Combat parts and coated with Aluma Hyde are:

- Extended Beavertail
- Extended Slide Release
- Hammer (Skeletonized Blue Stainless)
- Trigger
- Extractor
- Sear
- Disconnector
- Complete New Spring Set
- Recoil Spring Guide Rod (Short)
- Recoil Spring Plunger

All other parts including the mainspring housing (arched), barrel, barrel bushing, thumb safety, and magazine release are all factory Colt and are black Aluma Hyde, with the exception of the barrel which is stainless. I also recently installed a brand new set of black Magpul 1911 grips for it. There is absolutely no signs of usage or wear on this pistol because I just got it back from the gunsmith and have yet to shoot it. The barrel, however, has normal wear on it, but still looks great.

    up for sale is my Winchester 94 in 30-30 caliber. it was built in 1966 and is in wonderful shape for a 48 year old rifle. has a nice shinny bore on a 20"" barrel and it cycles great. it has a steel butt plate and Skinner peep sights for the rear and a skinner post on the front. these sights have made it deadly accurate for me. there are no sling attachments, i never wanted a sling since the rifle is so slim and handy. no rust or pitting but it does have some freckles on the lower part of the receiver and tang from wear of the bluing. i blame the post 64 Winchester bluing but honestly, i love love the aged look it has from it. 
    i'm fairly firm on price. i feel its a fare price with the addition of the sights, but i would love to hear your offer if your interested. i would prefer to do FTF in Montana, i wont be shipping it out of state. 
   email me with any questions you might have and i can email, text or call you back with answers. i can also text or email you any additional photos if need be, no problem.

Mossberg Maverick Model 88. I bought this gun in 2008 and am the original owner. It hasn’t been fired in six years, and only two boxes of shells have been fired through it. It’s in really good condition…there are a couple scuffs on the frame but the barrel and stock are super clean and without dings, dents or scrapes. It has the 28 inch field barrel with Mossberg’s accu choke, so it’ll handle lead, steel and all other non-toxic loads. 

I’m located near the Northgate Mall. No deliveries. Will require proof of age and allowance to make a photocopy of your i.d. 

I priced this arm new at Walmart three weeks ago for $210.00. Checked Big5 yesterday and it sells for the same $210.00 when on sale...that's $231.00 with tax. 

At $180.00 and no tax you won’t be displeased with this shotgun."

This is one of the most beautiful custom Carl Gustaf’s 6.5 Swede rifles in my collection, which I plan to use a s a guide for future rebuilds of Custom Gustaf’s.  It has an excellent Balance and a Leupold 2x scope.  Extra shell holders, built into the stock.  I would be a pleasure to shoot ro carry on a hunt.
The 6.5mm, what most of us consider the ideal caliber range for hunting CXP game. Unlike the .24 and .25 calibers, these cartridges use serious big game hunting weight bullets, typically about 120 to 160 or 175 grains. They shoot flat enough to take game without ""holding over."" Unlike most of the larger calibers, standard (non-magnum) cartridges the 6.5mm generates relatively moderate recoil that allows most hunters to do their best shooting.
What you've got is a selection of flat shooting, mild kicking, standard cartridge that will kill CXP2 game with authority. In North America, that means animals such as Feral Hogs, Pronghorn Antelope, Whitetail Deer, Blacktail Deer, Mule Deer, Goats, Sheep and Caribou. In addition, they are sufficiently versatile to bring down CXP3 game (Elk and even Moose) with appropriate loads and careful shot placement.
I have other guns from my Private collection I will be listing, so take a look.  If you have other types of guns you're looking for, let me know and I’ll look through my collection or see what I can find for you.  No Low-Ballers!

The gun itself is old. All metal trigger and trigger guard, the gun has no polymer or plastic. It has dents and dings and when i got it slight surface rust. I removed the rust. I hate cold bluing with a passion so i sanded, primed, and painted the barrel to prevent more rust. My paint job on the trigger area didnt turn out well, but the paint doesnt hold up to degreaser at all so i'm sure it'll melt off with some cleaning if you want it gone.

It has the archangel tacticool stock kit, a 9x zoom scope, and vertical grip. Comes with 2 of those bx25 x2 magazines. One of the magazines is new. I bought it, loaded and shot it once, it works fine. The other magazine came with the gun and i have no idea how old it is but i do get some feeding issues from it. A few drops of oil on the magazine follower helped out a lot, but didnt fix all of the problems. Im just not the kind of person that throws a $70 magazine in the trash.

The gun shoots fine, especially with my new magazine. Its accurate with the scope and has no iron sights.

As far as stuff i would trade it for, I'm looking for a savage 17hmr, possibly a combination gun like the savage model 24 or 42, or a small revolver like the s&w j frame or colt detective special. Or a Mossberg 500 riot gun. Id prefer it stock since the built or customized ones I've seen on here are not to my liking. Also on my list is a lever action 30-30. Preferably marlin, but i'm open to whatever you have. Any decent deer rifle, but im not familiar with bolt actions so i can't list acceptable ones except a kimber 308, which is a $1,400 rifle so i really dont expect that. Might as well add an m1 garand to the list.

Other things to trade plus cash could be a single shot break action 410 or 20 gauge.

Keep in mind, my car is broke, so we can trade guns or cash in my front yard in McDonough, i cannot drive."

Not recommended for any vehicle less than full size.

PLEASE note the following pertinent measurements:
   1. The width of your load bars cannot be more than 3-15/16 inches (10 cm) wide or they won't fit within the mounting brackets.
   2. Your interior edges of your load bars should be able to adjust to a minimal distance of 21-5/8 inches (54.9 cm) or the box won't mount on the load bars.
   3.  Less crucial but FYI: the maximum span of the load bars is 33 inches (83.82 cm).

PLEASE feel free to ask me questions about possible fit before coming out and wasting your valuable time. Pictures of your current vehicle roof setup would be helpful, along with included info about your vehicle make and year. I am adding this information because a prospective buyer came out from over an hour away recently, only to find out that the box would not fit his full sized all-terrain vehicle.

Btw, I will help you mount the box so you'd leave with it properly placed and you'd know how to do it yourself later as well.

It's in very nice shape; never dropped or been in an accident, and I am the original owner.
Has functioning locks and one key. Extra keys are easily obtained directly from Thule or affiliated vendors.

We recently upgraded to a flat screen and must give this up. Luckily, it happens to be your favorite sport season, so we hope it will be in your living room or man cave soon!

Don't make payments on a BIG SCREEN when you can own one outright! ... and NOW!

This was very well reviewed by CNET when new, who raved about the picture quality of its huge 55 inch screen. For those who are not familiar with the well engineered Mitsubishi Projection TVs: they are designed to last. Worked with no issues the last time it was used, but will be sold 'as is' since it is an electronic item. Yes, it is big... but just imagine how much chips and snacks you can spread out across its top!

Seeing it in the garage, I think it could also be great in a similar open space if you are hosting an outdoor or garage tailgating or block party! Just hook up external speakers and turn the volume way up!

Bought new in 2008. Comes with original owners manual and the original remote control. It should also work with your existing Universal Remote. Comes from a non-smoking, no-children home.

Reasonable price is $100 but with some flexibility. And since it is currently in our garage so would be a cinch to roll onto your trailer. Will help load. Will trade for ammo.

I got it on a whim from a buddy - my grandpa hunted with an Ithaca 37 decades ago and when this one fell into my lap I thought I'd take it in and see what I could do with it.  I half-thought about turning it into a utility gun for around the farm, but after shooting it I can't bring myself to do it - I'd like to see it in the hands of someone who will use it as intended.

This is a smooth shooting field gun - while I'm not a hunter, I took it out to bust some clays and it performed very well.  I already have a nice clay gun though, so as well as this shoots, I just don't have a need for it.  It is one of the models that will pump-fire (ie., hold the trigger, pump, when it falls into battery it will shoot, some say slam-fire) if that's neat to you.

It IS a 1970 field gun, though - the bluing has matured to a worn patina, the wood is worn and has dings and scratches - long story short, while it's a used shotgun, its one heck of a used shotgun that may not be pretty, but is certainly a fantastic shooter."

The only legal way to get a real Russian-made AK 74 apart from a saiga what you have to convert. And anyone who owns a Vepr will tell you they are made a world better than any Saiga, as nice as Saigas still very much are! This is all based on the typical super heavy rpk bulged receiver and heavy trunion. All receiver metal is based on 1.5mm thick steel all around. Barrel is substantially thicker than any 74 I've seen. Nice baked painted finish. Gorgeous wood stocks. Anniversary model just means it has a woodland vine like engraving in the rubber of the buttpad which is shown in the photobucket pics. This is a genuine Molot buttpad and marked as such, not aftermarket. This version has a ak74 muzzle break installed by Atlantic arms that is on correct LH threads. In addition, this rifle has one major other good thing going for it. Most Vepr rifles can only take Molot factory mags which are overpriced and hard to get sometimes. But this one has had the mag well opened up to be standard AK 74 size and I had checked it. All AK 74 mags work perfectly. This saves you a Ton of money getting magazines and not being stuck to the Vepr mags. This is also an Anaheim California import with a nicer finish that I've seen before. Not the usual TGI import where most came in through.

I have 6 fantastic magazines. The least exciting one is the simple black Tapco polymer 25 rounder. After that we have two brand new black excellent Bulgarian 30 rounders which are the metal lined polymer covered type that feed perfectly and are Glock reliable. There's two brand-new Uber rare Circle 21 Russian red/brown 30 rounders and one holy Grail factory bakelite 40 Rounder! The 60 rounds of wolf AK 74 non corrosive steel case ammo in the pic come free.

You can have it one of two different ways: 
1) $1000 for everything CASH
2) $875 for the gun & the black tapco mag CASH
If you actually do your research and check the prices of all of the stuff right now you will see this is a dang good deal! For several more high-quality pics check this link out to my Photobucket. http://s144.photobucket.com/user/aaroncohenproductions/slideshow/

The only wear is some minor muzzle tip wear as shown in the photos and very light scratches only visible with a magnifier. It is in excellent shape. Best trigger I have ever felt including my Wilson 1911, cz shadow and better than even my smith 19-4 with trigger work. Lightest, crispest, zero creep break I have experienced. Probably did have some very light smoothing Trigger work done. But retains original everything including wide serrated target hammer and trigger. Extremely accurate! Adjustable target sights. Wide serrated target trigger and hammer. Both of which are case colored and perfect. Original smith factory medallion wood grips are excellent. Very few around in this shape. No box.

Purchased M&P from a fellow member on this forum and was told gun had under 400rds. I immediately sold the complete slide and purchased a brand new one....Purchased Insight MRDS & Glock Suppressor Sights and sent to Doug Presson Custom Works ( DPCW) for machine work. DPCW milled to accept an Insight MRDS, rear dovetail, 2 ports on each side and 1 port on top and side serrations, ""soften"" the front for easier holstering and then sand blasted. The sand blast could have been done better b/c there are couple spots that you can kinda see the OEM black coating. I never got a chance to cerakote it, however I kinda like it bare. Once I got my slide back, I installed Apex FSS Kit & FRE, stippled it, undercut the trigger guard and cut 2 circular slots on each side of the grip so that I can remove the stuck mag if jammed (you can kinda see it in the pics, but the magwell covers it up pretty good. Shot it for about 1000 rounds, sold the barrel and purchased a KKM Pro 5"" Match Grade Barrel, sent it to HR Barrelworks to cut off 1/2"" so that the barrel will extend 1/4"". Shot about 500rds, VERY ACCURATE. Then I purchased 10-8 Magwell + 3 TTI Red baseplates + 1 promag 17rd mag. I have not installed TTI baseplate yet b/c I loss the follower, I'll try to find, but if I can't find it you can purchase a new one for about couple bucks. The 10-8 magwell didn't allow mags to drop freely so I sanded and dremeled it until mags dropped free. Also the magwell is screwed on, but I recommend you jb weld it as it can be slight wobble. I can provide detail pics if needed. TTI Baseplates supposed to give you extra 6 rds, but you will need to either use it more or sand the follower a bit so that it can freely move into the baseplate as I could only get extra 4 or 5 rds (can't remember).

This gun is not a striker fire, it has a hammer so it is a DA / SA Pistol.

I have FINALLY talked her into getting a more practical gun for a girl that likes tiny purses and low rise skinny jeans... She doesnt know what she wants but I know what i want so i am open to trades but she will have the final say ;'-(

TRADES: Make an offer, the worst I can say is ""no""

She really needs a subcompact weapon but Glocks are out because she hates all of mine.

I would love to trade for a Springfield XDS 9 mm. I have the .45 and I LOVE IT!!!

I would also love a full size wheel gun / revolver in either a .44 Magnum, or a .357 Mag. I prefer Ruger Redhawks, Alaskans, GP-100's or the S&W variants. Extra preference for Stainless Steel. If we go that route I will just give her the difference in cash.

I would trade for .22 rim fire bullets at FAIR market value ($.04 per rd), but REFUSE to pay the mark up for it because i find it at that price every once in a while and have about 5,000 rds as it is...

Must be a Washington resident with current WA Drivers License and have a current / valid CPL. Prefer a bill of sale, but willing to negotiate if you are the private type.

This gun sells for $520 at Sportsmans as of today and guns dont seem to lose any value in today's market. Buying private party will automatically save you $43.68 + the $20 already marked down so you save $64 right off the bat and .40 caliber is ALWAYS on the shelf even with the current ammo shortage.

Make me a trade or cash offer and lets see if we can make a deal :-)"

Fortunately, I didn't trade much for it.  Looking around, there seem to be a lot of fakes out there, and plenty of slimeballs selling them as real ones.  I was told by several folks that mine is the best looking fake cone they have seen, so be careful.  Even being a fake, it's still pretty cool.

I've had really good luck with folks on armslist, so hopefully I can provide some tips for spotting them.  Easiest is to go to youtube and search ""Benchmade Infidel - Fake Vs. Real.""  In summary:

1.  The clip was the only visual giveaway on mind.  The real ones have a butterfly on the bent clip at the tip, and mine does not.  The anodizing of the letters is also different.

2.  The fake ones are a lot heavier.  Of course, you can only tell this if you are buying face to face.  The real ones way about 5 ounces (per manufacturer).  My clone is 7.5 ounces...pretty significant.

3.  There are apparently some other finish differences, though I am told mine is a pretty darn good match.

Hope all this helps.  I am still willing to sell it, if nothing else, to keep this listing active and educate folks.  Do your homework!"

1970's vintage. Box is not original to revolver. Comes with magnum cylinder that appears to be unfired. The only downside is on the LR cylinder. It appears that it was stored with a dirty thumb print left on it. As you can see it left some corrosion. I tried to make it look as bad as possible in the picture, so you know what you're getting. In regular light it doesn't look bad at all. There is also a very light drag mark on it. Also including a patch worm bore cleaner.

Shipping FFL to FFL will be a fixed amount of $40.00. If it turns out to be less after you have received the gun I will refund the difference.
Thank you, but not interested in trades right now.

For what I offer the price seems reasonable unless you know where to get all this for less then I say go shop there my friend, I don't need to sell this but I'm sure someone else may like to own this, you must be 21 and must have a valid kansas ID, no transfers, local pick up only, can travel within reasonable distance, will make out a receipt for bill of sale to new owner.

It has night sights, SIGLITE in the rear and the TruGlo fiber optic night sight up front.  It came like this from the factory, and it's a pretty sweet set up.  It has 4 15rnd Magazines, and magwell grips in addition to the rail and beaver tail.  This all comes in the original SIG hard plastic case.  It's a great gun with just over 1250 rounds through it in total.  

BONUS!  I'm adding 2 excellent Mec-Gar 15 round magazines to the deal for a total of 6 15 round magazines! ($60+ value!)

I really do appreciate this firearm, but I've decided to get out of the .40 S&W game, it's the extra caliber that's breaking this camel's back.  So I will include the 150 rounds of loose factory ammo I have on hand.  That's a bonus 60+ dollars right there.  All because I think you guys are awesome!
