I shot this rifle in smallbore competition for about 2 years and was fortunate enough to become a National Record co-holder in the 50-meter prone event; 400 out of 400 points (see one of the images for the record at the website).  At 50-meters with Eley 10x ammunition, it can easily shoot a one hole group!  This rifle has been in my gun safe for over 30 years; well protected and well cared for all that time.  I hope someone takes advantage of this great offer so they can carry on the tradition of shooting and competing with one of the most accurate smallbore rifles in the world!

Here is excellent ammunition for the 91/30 Mosin Nagant Russian Rifles. Manufacturer is Barnaul Machine Tool Plant of Altay, Russia. Construction is Laquer Coated Steel Case, slow burning cylindrical granule powder, and non corrosive and sure firing Berdan priming system, all of it propelling a 203 grain Lead Core Soft Point Bullet. According to factory specs, from a 30 inch barrel service rifle, the bullet exits the muzzle at 2300 feet per second, with muzzle energy well over 2600 foot-pounds. These are full powered loads, and they should only be used in rifles that are mechanically strong. If there is any doubt about that, owners should have a competent gunsmith inspect their rifle. This ammunition will only work in rifles chambered for it; including Russian and Chinese made 91/30 Mosin Nagant Rifles and Dragunov type semi-automatic rifles chambered in 7.62x54R caliber. It will not work in an SKS Rifle; it will not work in an AK rifle; it will not work in a 7.62 Argentine Mauser; and it will not work in the carburetor line of a 1952 Ford F1 pickup. Replacement pricing on competitor brass cased rounds is upwards of $50 per box. We're offering this fine ammunition in 200 round lots of 10 boxes, however, at $14.90 per box.

In case you're not familiar, the dissipator is a 16"" barrel with rifle length gas tube and handguards. Allows for longer sight radius and less felt recoil. 1 in 9"" twist.

542,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3170542,For Sale:  2002 Ford Focus - Engine Problem,"Thornton, Denver, Colorado",$ 800,"Listed On: Friday, June 13, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a 2002 Ford Focus for sale. The body is in pretty good condition, the interior is ok too. It does have normal wear and tear, but overall it looks pretty good. it has a 2.0 liter 4 cylinder engine and an automatic transmission. The tires were replaced less than two years ago.

The only problem it does have is that the engine may have a blown piston ring. I took it to Firestone on 120th & Colorado and that is what they suspect, but they didn't dig into it too far. It would have to be towed. If you have a little bit of mechanical inclination, you may be able to fix it yourself.

Kelley Blue Book lists this car in fair condition (needs repairs) at $2,105, so this is $1,305 less, money you can use to get it fixed. 

This could be a good project car, and you could also use it for parts. The overall condition is pretty good, and it has 20,000 less that the average 2002 Focus. While the engine needs work, $800 for a car in pretty good condition is fair, even if you have to pay to have the engine fixed. I'm firm on the price, first one to offer $800 will get it."

It functions great. It does have some wear marks, and the slide may have been refinished at some time, but it's still pretty nice (see pics).

Some of the pictures show the finish awfully light colored because I took them outside. I wanted to show the details better, but the indoor picture is a little more representative of the actual color."

Here are just a few of the features you get with this firearm!

•	M&P 9mm full size handgun. The gun was purchased in January, is completely stock; with two (2) original 17 round magazines, interchangeable palm swells and original hard plastic case (including all of the goodies such as a cable lock, instruction manual, and factory test-fired casing). It has had more than 500 but less than 1000 rounds through it, and is cleaned/lubed after every outing to the range.
•	As can be seen in pictures, gun has some holster wear on the finish as this was an everyday carry gun, but other than that it looks fantastic.
•	Gun has had zero mechanical malfunctions due to the firearm itself, has malfunctioned due to ammunition (see next bullet point).
•	Gun has had a steady diet of factory FMJ ammunition and JHPs. Just don’t feed it Spirit Ammunition as it does not reliably feed nor eject this ammunition.
•	Has not needed any major repairs or replacement of any parts.

Along with an excellent firearm you are also going to get:
•	A FoxX brand kydex-leather hybrid inside-waist-band (IWB) holster, perfect for conceal carry.
•	An RSA Defense level 2 retention paddle holster, perfect for open carry, general range, or competition use. This includes the original packaging and hex-key to adjust the cant of the holster.
•	Both holsters are for right handed shooters, sorry southpaws.

OMNI HYBRID DESCRIPTION:

 The lower Receiver is made of a fiberglass-composite polymer over a zinc metal insert. Designed to give extra strength in the high-pressure sections, the Omni-Hybrid surpasses military pressure and weight-bearing testing.

 This unique manufacturing process produces a lighter weight platform, with the total weight of the Omni-Hybrid stripped lower being 8 ounces, a ½ ounce lighter than a traditional aluminum AR lower.

 Patented Inter-lock hammer and trigger pin retainment system prevents movement from the hammer and trigger pin during firing.

“The Omni-Hybrid lower has gone through all the pressure and weight-baring testing of a traditional aluminum lower with flawless results,” 


Will meet within a reasonable distance from Pickerington/Canal Winchester. 

Trades welcome, just let me know what you have. I am looking for  a nice Winchester 94 in .30-30 with some ammo. Also a nice gun safe.

The buttstock was swapped to a B5 SOPMOD for the nicer cheek weld when using the scope. The handgaurds were removed and swapped to the Troy Alpha rail and I have rail sections for it still.

The charging handle is a PRI GasBuster for suppressed shooting if your into that, or it simply offers a nicer charging handle with the extended latch. KAC VFG is siting under my rail which helps with an extended hold on the rail. The optic is a PA 1-6 GenII in a PA deluxe extended mount. Has a sling mounted attached to the buffer tube.

My grandfather brought these back from Japan with him after World War Two (WWII). He recently passed away, and nobody in the family is a collector of vintage arms, so we decided to offer them for sale or trade. They are complete, down to the buttplates on the stocks. My grandfather worked as the chief engineer at the Howitzer factory in Wisconsin, manufacturing Howitzers before he went over to Japan. After he got back with these two rifles, he modified one of them to have a shorter barrel, so that it could be more useful to take hunting (which he never did). That is the ONLY modification to either of the rifles. The other one was a longer range/sniper's gun, complete with range-finding iron sights. It was most likely made for a Japanese sniper before the Arisaka Type 97 came out (based off the Arisaka 38 design).

As mentioned, both of these rifles have matching numbers, and the MUM on top is visible and clean, as are the other Japanese markings. Both rifles have been well taken care of - cleaned and oiled regularly, and stored properly. There is NO rust or pitting anywhere on either of these rifles, and the only blemishes on the original stocks were suffered in the hands of Japanese soldiers, during actual battles in Japan.

I have seen these rifles, mostly rusted out, without the proper MUMs, and without any bayonet or documented history sell individually for north of $350. I believe these rifles, in the condition they are in, are worth more than that. I would entertain selling the entire lot for $650 cash. However, I am interested in trading for newer 9mm handguns (manufacturers listed below), or for newer rifles (AR-10, AR-15, Remington 700 or Ruger American Rifle in .308, etc). If you have an offer, I would like to hear it. I may be interested in a trade + cash, on either end, depending on the trade.
