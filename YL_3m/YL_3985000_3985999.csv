I have a rare CZ 97 B that is equipped with aluminum grips and fiber optic front sight.  Comes with two mags, cleaning tools, and papers.

This weapon began life as an HK factory German MP5 Navy submachine gun. I have photographs of the complete machine gun prior to me personally de-milling it per ATF specifications. A true navy gun is marked MP5N on the top of the receiver, threaded barrel, tritium front and rear sights, and an ambidextrous safe/semi/full pictograph lower. 

I then had a local FFL purchase a bare, semi auto/shelf receiver from Black Market Parts in Arizona. The receiver is marked, ""Special Weapons, Spring Lakes, MI.""

I then gave the receiver and Navy parts set to MOJO Tactical in southern Missouri. The owner is a professional TIG welder by trade, and the completed pistol returned absolutely beautiful--semi of course, new in appearance, and exceeding all expectations. It is of course, 922r compliant.

The pistol has a flapper mag release, SIG arm brace, Sure Fire 628 LM LED forearm, and it comes with one HK german factory magazine and HK factory 3 point sling  

The HK German MP5 Navy donor gun was originally owned by a California Police Department. It appeared near new when I got it-but it is a used gun, and as such, the  parts in this gun are not brand new. 

Parts value-An HK MP5 navy parts set costs around $2500. A receiver flat and the weld up parts costs around $175. The metal butt cap, tube, and SIG arm brace cost around $300.  The Surefire 628 LM LED pressure/switch light costs $350.00. Actual fair cost for the parts is approximately $3325.00. 

Build cost-This varies from the person involved, but quality work to do it all (receiver, parts conversion, flapper mag, and finish) is in the $1400 range. 

As outlined above, this is around a $4500.00 pistol.   



The build cost varies, based on who you use, but $1000 would be a conservative amount. Total for the parts and build work

This was S&W's ""Value-Edition"" pistol immediately prior to the federal assault weapons ban. Very similar to the S&W Model 5903, it is an all-metal gun with a steel slide and alloy frame. 

Contrary to some information online, all parts other than the grip are metal. Later ""Value-Edition"" models like the 910 used polymer material for the guide rods and sights; not this Model 915. It differs primarily from the Model 5903 by having an easier-to-machine frame and lacking ambidextrous controls. Most parts, including magazines, grips, springs and barrels are interchangeable with the 59xx series.

This is an astoundingly reliable handgun that in my ownership of approximately 1 year has never had a single failure. I purchased this pistol one year ago and replaced the springs with a high-quality set from Wolfe and replaced the grips with a singe-piece Hogue soft rubber. All 3 magazines are extremely dependable Mec-Gar with a 15-round capacity.

All 3 magazines and case are included in price. Ammo not included.

From Trijicon site:

The Trijicon ACOG ECOS is the ultimate sight for both Close Quarter battle (CQB) situations and longer distance shooting where accuracy and pinpoint bullet placement are required. This dual-sighting system gives the shooter a distinct tactical advantage with the option of either the Trijicon ACOG or the RMR Sight. With the quick target acquisition of the RMR Sight or the precise aiming capabilities provided by the magnified 4 power Trijicon ACOG- the shooter has the ability to select the proper aiming solution for the situation at hand- truly the best of both worlds. No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the ECOS also features external windage and elevation adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without caps.



The TA01ECOS also includes:

1 3.25 MOA RMR® LED Red Dot mounted to ACOG (RM01)

Firearm Transfer Fee is $15 for 1st transaction, each additional firearm is $10
Transfers for Law Enforcement, Fire Fighters (active or retired) is $10
We accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Cash, Money Orders
You should contact us prior to and after purchasing if having a firearm shipped to us.​

Transfer Infomation for local Idaho Customers
Incoming Transfers from a FFL dealer:  We are already listed with most online retailers on their FFL listings, If not I will need to know how they accept a copy of my FFL licence usually either through fax or email, although some dealers require a hardcopy mailed to them. After I send a copy of my FFL licence to the dealer they will ship the firearm to me, I require that the shipping dealer include a copy of their FFL licence and your contact information with the shipment. When the firearm arrives I will contact you and you will need to come to my office to fill out the paperwork.The process is simple, you come in fill out the ATF 4473, present your picture ID or carry permit and I handle all the paperwork, do all the checks required and get you on your way. Generally this process takes no longer than 15 munutes. 

If Purchasing from an Individual
I will send the individual an email with the first 3 and the last 5 digits of my FFL licence, and a link to the ATF web site to verify my shipping address. I will also need the individual to send me a copy of their drivers licence (which must have a physical address on it, no PO boxes). When the firearm arrives I will contact you and you will need to come to my office to fill out the paperwork so we can transfer the firearm to you.
​
Outgoing Transfers
If you have sold a firearm that needs to be shipped out of state it can only be shipped to an FFL. I will need a copy of the FFL's licence, and what type of firearm you are shipping. We generally have shipping boxes for Handguns available at no extra charge, for Long guns you may need to provide a box or there will be a small extra charge for us to buy a box for you.

Important Note on Outgoing Transfers
In the case of firearms shipments there is no law that prevents an individual from shipping a firearm to an FFL holder. Some FFL's do not accept shipments from individuals (We Do), and handguns need to be shipped next day air through shipping companies. The fact that as an FFL we can ship handguns through the USPS, it is sometimes cheaper for you to pay our transfer fee plus the shipping then to ship it yourself. There will also be times where it might be cheaper for you to ship a firearm to an FFL yourself. It depends on the type of firearm, and the distance it is traveling.
Just remember you can only ship a firearm to a Federal Firearms Licensee. When in doubt check the laws or give us a call and we will try to assist you.

Any questions or inquires please feel free to call or email us.

It is all matching and is a J.P. Sauer and Sohn Suhl. It is all matching right down to the screw heads all serial numbers match. Original wood stock, barrel/bore/rifling is really really good. The bipod is for a Gewher Anti-Tank rifle and is extremely rare and valuable from what I have gathered. This was found in a barn and so it is likely that the GI that brought it home put it in the barn and probably sat untouched for 90 or so years. This thing is in amazing condition. Parts that are not present are the hoses, trigger, trigger housing and the right side plate which is the machine gun. These guns were used on planes during WW1 and have some amazing history. With this being all matching and built in 1918 imagine what it may have saw! Would be perfect to add to an amazing collection. Price is $2950 with bipod or $2550 without, those prices are FIRM.

It is all matching and is a J.P. Sauer and Sohn Suhl. It is all matching right down to the screw heads all serial numbers match. Original wood stock, barrel/bore/rifling is really really good. The bipod is for a Gewher Anti-Tank rifle and is extremely rare and valuable from what I have gathered. This was found in a barn and so it is likely that the GI that brought it home put it in the barn and probably sat untouched for 90 or so years. This thing is in amazing condition. Parts that are not present are the hoses, trigger, trigger housing and the right side plate which is the machine gun. These guns were used on planes during WW1 and have some amazing history. With this being all matching and built in 1918 imagine what it may have saw! Would be perfect to add to an amazing collection. Price is $2950 with bipod or $2550 without, those prices are FIRM.

It is all matching and is a J.P. Sauer and Sohn Suhl. It is all matching right down to the screw heads all serial numbers match. Original wood stock, barrel/bore/rifling is really really good. The bipod is for a Gewher Anti-Tank rifle and is extremely rare and valuable from what I have gathered. This was found in a barn and so it is likely that the GI that brought it home put it in the barn and probably sat untouched for 90 or so years. This thing is in amazing condition. Parts that are not present are the hoses, trigger, trigger housing and the right side plate which is the machine gun. These guns were used on planes during WW1 and have some amazing history. With this being all matching and built in 1918 imagine what it may have saw! Would be perfect to add to an amazing collection. Price is $2950 with bipod or $2550 without, those prices are FIRM.

For those of you that flagged my post for being overpriced here is the breakdown.  Here is link to take a peak at gallery of guns which is a very legitimate gun seller. 

http://www.galleryofguns.com/genie/default.aspx?pg=list&mfg=Colt&mdlno=Rail+Gun

The grips on the gun were 110.00 dollars because of the custom embedded colt medallion.

It has a custom fitted egw barrel bushing fit to .00015 to slide and .002 to barrel which was 40.00

This package also comes with 3 extra magazines that the gun did not come with from the factory.

2 Metalform 8 round magazines.  55.00

1 shooting star 7 round mag 20.00

also included is a egw flared magwell-20lpi mainspring housing 70.00

So i think it is fair to value gun at 1100 dollars.  At the indy 1500 there were 4 railguns i saw there for over 1200 dollars before tax.  

So doing the math the price of gun with the things included in package comes to 1395.00  so 1200 asking price is fair."

Official description:  The XD® 3” Sub-Compact from Springfield Armory® is designed to bring you the most in a concealed carry pistol. Its superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and astonishing capacity combine to put more into a concealable pistol than you will find anywhere else.

The XD® 3″ Sub-Compact has all the same features found in the standard XD® line, but in a smaller package. The barrel is 3” and the frame is a short, compact size that will let the pistol nearly disappear when you carry it. Like other XD® pistols, the XD® 3” Sub-Compact gives you great versatility when it’s used with X-Tension™ magazines. Enjoy 9+1 rounds of .40SW with standard flush-fitting magazines. Or throw in an X-Tension™ magazine and enjoy the feel of a full size frame and 12+1 rounds of .40SW. You’ll find everything on the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that make Springfield’s XD®’s easy to use and safe to handle. The striker status indicator, loaded chamber indicator, grip safety, Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™ and internal firing pin block bring the safety and usability to the XD® 3” Sub-Compact that you’re used to with every other XD®.

If you’re looking for a concealable pistol, but don’t want to sacrifice capacity, reach for an XD® 3” Sub-Compact. It’s an excellent choice for concealed carry, and it is equally in its element at the range."

From the Manufacturers website:

The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system (14.5"" barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

No tools are needed for windage and elevation adjustments because the TA31RCO features external adjusters, making it waterproof up to 11m without the caps. Mounting bosses are integrated into the housing by the eyepiece to allow the easy addition of a Trijicon RMR® (not included)."

So Up for sale are several surplus items I am trying to part ways with for the right dollar amount of course. I have several Items which are all for sale, so rather than go in depth  about the features and specs of each and every item I will just copy and paste this text along with the proper photos and titles to each item(s). I figure if someone is actually going to buy something then they probably already know quite a bit about it to begin with so I will be kind to my fingers and give them a little break. 

I know approximately how much I am looking to sell each item for, so NO LOW BALERS! That being said, an object is only worth as much as someone is willing to pay for it. So hit me with your BEST REASONABLE offer and odds are you will get what you are looking for!

ANY questions/concerns or to purchase; please contact the ever infamous Postman @ REDACTED. Texts are always preferred, but not required of course. THANKS for taking the time to check out my post, and don't forget to check out my other postings as well!

PS, I will be on top of my game; as soon as an item(s) sells I WILL REMOVE IT IMMEDIATELY. Do not waste both of our time by asking me if the item(s) is still available"
