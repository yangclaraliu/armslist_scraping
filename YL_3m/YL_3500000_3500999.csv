Carried a lot; shot very little.

I switched out the firing pin block spring and hammer spring, dropping the DAO trigger pull to about six pounds.  Recoil is marvelously managed by the dual recoil spring, making accuracy superb.  The USP is the very definition of reliability: I’ve not had any misfeed or stovepipe with the wide variety of ammunition I’ve burned through it.  Capacity is 12 + 1—a bit small by current standards for high-capacity .45s, but the grip is not that much larger than the USP in .40 or 9mm, and feels almost perfect in my average-sized hands.  While there is holster wear evident in the matte finish, this seems significantly less than on other matte finish pistols I’ve seen exposed to the rigors of daily carry. The metal surfaces have faded uniformly from a new-in-the-box charcoal gray to a medium gray.

This particular 1999-manufactured USP 45 comes with Trijicon Orange HD night sights, light firing pin block spring, light hammer spring, and extended HK45 magazine release paddle.  I don’t have the box, but I do have three factory mags, a JM kydex AIWB holster, and GG&G rail adapter to mount a flashlight or laser onto.

216,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3500216,For Sale:  PC and Offers: PPS-43c w/ ammo and accessories. 2nd Gen of imports,"Portsmouth, Hampton Roads, Virginia",$ 450,"Listed On: Monday, September 15, 2014",Handguns,no type,7.62x25 Tokarev,no type,no type,"Everything you see here is included. What we have here is a Polish PPS-43c. A semi-automatic ""handgun"" version of the famed soviet PPS-43 Sub-machine gun. These were made at the famed Radom plant in Poland, but unfortunately these are no longer being manufactured or imported and the prices are steadily rising. They are made from a combination of original PPS-43 parts and new parts.

This particular firearm is a second generation import. Unlike its predecessors, the folding stock is not welded in place, it is simply disabled mechanically and can be repaired with the stock from a parts kit and a dremel or drill to expand the hole up top for the button. The feeding issues have also been more or less corrected. This makes a great little SBR project.

This particular firearm was fired once at the factory for testing purposes before I received it (as most firearms are) but has never been shot beyond that. There is no original packaging (which was just a cardboard box) but it is essentially brand new. The moment I got my hands on it I put it into a hard case with rust preventive foam. The case itself is a hard polymer with four latches and four loops for locks, making it safe for air travel as far as I'm aware.

As you see in this picture, there are eight original magazines (four of which are loaded with 30 JHP rounds each,) a box of JHP rounds with 30 rounds still in it (for a grand total of 150 JHP rounds between the loaded mags and the box), an original sling, original cleaning rod and oil bottle and a Flambeau AR hard case with Velcro straps and magazine dividers. The dividers and straps can be removed and the straps can moved around if you so desire as the foam has factory cut outs. They were designed to hold a firearm such as an AR securely in place within the case, but I chose to use them to secure the magazines instead. All of this is included with the firearm. It has already been dis-assembled and cleaned, as well as the magazines, though I would recommend cleaning the bore again yourself before firing just for good measure. Magazines are in great condition for surplus pieces. Firearm is free of rust or corrosion apart from a very small bit beneath the folding stock that was there when I bought it.

I purchased the firearm roughly one year ago for $350 with the 4 magazines and have since then invested another $250 or so into the weapon with everything seen here with most of the extra value being in the $70 case, $104 worth of magazines,  and $60ish worth of ammunition for a total investment of nearly $600 altogether. I'm hoping to sell it for around $450 or so but before I do I'm looking for offers.

Contact regarding this firearm is not a commitment to buy or sell. This is merely an interest check and offer taking for the time being. Not accepting trades or collateral."

This is a 1968 model with a rounded hammer for snagless drawing. The frame, barrel, slide, and all other applicable parts have been professionally media blasted and refinished in graphite black cerakote, which very closely matches the original finish and is very hard wearing. I have also added custom walnut grips that give a more ergonomic fit than the originals. Comes with two magazines, one that has a matching serial number and one that does not. I have ground down the finger rest on the non matching mag to better facilitate pocket carry. Will also include a box of Hornady xtp defense rounds and the original grips.

Molon Labe or ""come and take"", is a classical expression of defiance reportedly spoken by King Leonidas I in response to the Persian army's demand that the Greeks surrender their weapons at the Battle of Thermopylae.Molon labe has been repeated by many later generals and politicians in order to express an army's or nation's determination not to surrender. The motto ΜΟΛΩΝ ΛΑΒΕ is on the emblem of the Greek First Army Corps, and is also the motto of United States Special Operations Command Central .

Tennessee Arms Company is proud to offer our hybrid Nylon 6-6/Marine Grade Brass lower receiver. This stripped receiver is designed to accept any mil-spec lower parts kit. All colors are molded directly into and throughout the entire receiver so you never have to worry about wearing it off unlike a painted finish.

 TAC Patent Pending design is Reinforced Nylon 6-6 with Marine Grade Brass threaded inserts molded into the buffer collar and pistol grip for strength and corrosion resistance.Our receivers are designed to accept any quality lower build kit. Using the Brass inserts into a high impact Nylon 6-6 receiver make the Tennessee Arms Receiver truly the Highest Strength/ Lightest weight Hybrid receiver (5.6oz stripped) on the market. We ARE the best Hybrid receiver on the market and always will be.



Federal law requires that you be 21 years or age or older to purchase a stripped receiver or frame. If a frame or receiver can only be made into a long gun (rifle or shotgun), it is still a frame or receiver not a handgun or long gun. However, they still are ""firearms"" by definition, and subject to the same GCA limitations as any other firearms.

This is a CAA Roni conversion stock/pistol chasis for Glock 17/19. This is the Gen. 2 version, NOT Gen. 1. Also, this is the model made for use with a firearm, NOT the Airsoft model. Search Amazon or whichever online marketplace you prefer for pricing on these brand new. This one in particular in NOT in new condition. There is no hard case or accessories, therefor, I am not looking to get new money or trade for it. The chasis itself is in fantastic condition, with no nicks, scrapes, gouges, or damage to the stock. It is cosmetically and functionally in great condition, however, I have never used this conversion stock and have no intention of doing so... Just not my thing. New these run about $499, I took this one in on trade and have never used it. 

Applying a pistol to this chasis falls under NFA regulation, and doing so then requires the proper tax stamp and registration of your firearm as an SBR. This is the law, and it would be YOUR responsibility to do such. These can be legally purchased without said tax stamp but tax stamp must be applied for and received BEFORE pairing with your pistol. Again, it is YOUR responsibility to do so. I am a private party, not a dealer."

It is a fantastic carry gun as it actually has 3 safety positions! Comes with case, speed loader, extended mag and regular mag. It is basically 2 sized guns in one. Using the regular mag, it makes for a nice concealed carry weapon. Also comes with an extended mag to make it full size. Be legal and I will do a bill of sale.
The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.
The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber.
Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

It started as their M39 EMR model, which retails for about $3700 right now. (The EMR model has the notch removed on the Sage stock chassis that allows for a Brookfield style scope mount to be installed. In this case, it came with Fulton Armory's scope mount.)

The receiver is engraved ""M21."" The barrel is a Criterion, 18.5"" GI Contour, 1x10 Twist, Chrome Moly, Match Quality. There are approximately 300 rounds through this rifle; all Federal match ammunition. (This rifle is definitely sub-MOA). It comes with five (20 round) CMI magazines ($100 Total Value) and a Harris bi-pod with YHM bi-pod mount ($100 Total Value). I also had the following upgrades installed by Fulton Armory when the rifle was built:

National Match Trigger Upgrade
Sadlak TiN Gas Piston
Sadlak NM OP Rod/Spring Guide
Sadlak Extended Mag Release
SEI Extended Bolt Catch
($240 Total Value)

I will also add a Schuster adjustable gas plug and a SEI gas lock hooded front sight. These two items are new and uninstalled. I bought them so I could eventually add a suppressor to the rifle. ($130 Total Value)

Currently it has a Weaver 4-20X50 .Mil/.Mil scope which sits in a DNZ single piece mount. I will sell it with or without the Weaver/DNZ combo on it. The Fulton Armory mount base stays with the rifle.

With the Weaver/DNZ I'm asking $3,750. Without the Weaver/DNZ I'm asking $3,250. This is a fantastic price considering it comes with $570 worth of factory upgrades, additional parts, and magazines. These prices are firm and fair. Please no haggling or trade offers. Thank you for looking!"

Lowered and flared ejection port. Combat sights dovetailed into the slide. Dual recoil-spring system. extended slide catch. Beavertail grip safety. Skeletonized aluminum trigger. Lightweight alloy frame. Ultra-thin polymer grip panel.

Manufactuer: American Tactical Imports
Model: FX45 Fatboy Lightweight
Caliber: .45 ACP
Barrel Length: 3.2
Capacity: 12 + 1
Finish: Blue
Hand Gun Web Model: FX45

Overall length under seven inches, 5.5 inches high and only 1.33 inches at its widest point, the FX45 is easy to conceal even under light clothing. But it’s a true 1911 and has all of the excellent features John Moses Browning designed into his original pistol: single-action trigger, excellent ergonomics and well-placed controls that are easy to operate.
The machined steel slide has dual sets of grasping grooves, and the ejection port has been lowered and flared to ensure that spent cases get out of the way surely and quickly.
But the most modern feature is that it uses a bushing-less barrel with a flared muzzle section. Another departure from the original is a telescoping, dual-spring recoil system on a full-length guide rod. Both of these features ensure tight and consistent barrel/slide lockup for improved accuracy and functioning. It also greatly simplifies disassemble.
The low-profile rear sight has a large, easy-to-acquire square notch and is angled to prevent it from hanging up on clothing on the draw, and its rear face is serrated to reduce glare. The front is a square blade with a white dot insert.
The alloy frame pares the Fatboy LW’s unloaded weight to a mere 22 ounces, and the frame is undercut at the trigger guard to permit a high grip on the gun.
The ambidextrous thumb safety levers are smaller than normally seen on a 1911 but can still be operated positively. An extended beavertail grip safety with a palm swell provides superior handling while ameliorating recoil—a nice feature on a .45 pistol weighing so little. Aggressively checkered, polymer grip panels allow a secure grip."

First up is my last Yugo M57, when I researched the serial date it put it 1960-1961.....no crest or manufacturer stamp just model, cal, serial number and mil inspection symbols. Importer mark is ""GRC MTNBRG WV 762x25 CROATIA"" Seems to be all matching with the exception of the hammer pack (has another serial chicken scratched on it). Unsafe-ties removed, I attempted fitting the import safety so it could be left in the hole but it was a lost cause and I didn't want it messing with reliability (I think I have it still in case it's wanted). Overall condition is decent (could probably pull a good rating), and has four magazines. I've put ~50 rounds through it, with zero errors (not counting my aim).

Second pistol is a Czech Vz52 (Cz-52), dated 1952. Import mark is from our friends at CAI. Seems to only have mil armorer markings not commercial ones (if I read correctly). All matching, I acquired this in an Armslist trade and was assured it was fully functional....which it wasn't. Misfed/jammed every few rounds due to a weak recoil spring and in a more detailed inspection I believed the rollers were looking a little off (seemed like they were hitting the frame). I replaced the recoil spring with a Wolff plus P and replaced the rollers and firing pin with aftermarket ones. Now it is fully functional . I do have the original parts if one wanted to reinstall them for authenticity and use it for a display/collection piece only. This one is in Good condition and also has four magazines, as well as a surplus holster and cleaning rod.

Ammo....total there is 402 rounds if I counted right, mostly new production brass non-corrosive type but ~100 are Romanian surplus.

I would like to get $800 for all of it. I'm not opposed to trades or part trades. FTF only unless you hold an FFL and want to pay shipping, and I live a couple hours from both Denver and the Springs, travel could be discussed or you can come to me. C&R items, so the only FFL we have to involve is the 03 I have (which means I need to record your info for my collection book)."

From the Manufacturer
The NEW P229® SAS Gen 2, features a new slide design, a melt treatment on frame & slide, SRT Trigger System, short trigger, SIGLITE® Night Sights, and NEW ergo polymer one-piece grip. The slide features an engraved SIG SAUER® Custom Shop logo. This P229 pistol from the SIG SAUER Custom Shop has gone through a radical dehorning process resulting in an ultra smooth, snag free profile that’s ideal for concealed carry.

SIG SAUER’s new E2 Enhanced Ergonomics P226 and P229 pistols incorporate a reduced circumference, one-piece modular grip with improved texture. Used in conjunction with other ergonomic innovations including the reduced reach trigger, SRT™ Short Reset Trigger system and more, the E2 pistols ergonomically fit a much wider range of hand sizes.

The first is a now-banned MOLOT Super Vepr in .223 which has been recently banned from further importation by executive order.  I have taken it to the range only twice, and although it's an exceedingly nice and well built rifle I've decided to focus more on rifles I can pack / hike with instead.  I have the original box and paperwork with it, and I also purchased a the MOLOT top-mount scope rail for it (which was an additional $180).  The rifle comes with two original MOLOT factory 10 round magazines as well as a modified Polish Beryl (.223 folding Polish AK variant) see-through magazine (which only needed a small amount of filing to the magazine catch and functions/cycles perfectly).  The rifle currently wears a Vortex Diamondback 4-12x40AO scope with a .223 BDC VPlex reticle and a set of matte black Warne 30mm rings.  The scope could be included or removed.  The rifle is the fluted barrel non-compensated version (the compensated version takes the side-mount AK style optics as opposed to the more universal top-mount Picatinny rail scope mount like I have).  I will get pictures of this rifle uploaded tonight.  For now, there is a stock photo pulled from the internet.

I also have a Springfield M1A National Match in .308.  The rifle was made in 1976 and features all USGI parts as follows:
Trigger group: USGI SA, USGI SA M1 hammer
Op-rod: USGI SAK
Bolt: USGI TRW
Barrel: USGI NM SAK
Stock: USGI SA
Sights: NM

The rifle features the original M14 stock and has been glass bedded (and the selector switch has been filled with bedding material).  The rifle has seen very little use and comes with an original (1976 manufacture) Springfield scope mount with 30mm rings as well as a new manufacture Bassett high mount (no rings) and mount attachment tool with instructions and paperwork.  This rifle is a real tack driver.  It was previously wearing a Vortex Viper PST SFP 6.5-20x50 scope but the scope has already been removed and sold.  It comes with 2x 20rnd Checkmate magazines as well as 2x 25rnd checkmate magazines.  More pictures are available upon request.

It's spent most of it's life sitting in a safe, occasionally venturing out in it's holster to act as a BUG in my center console or while running (in a runner's chest harness well away from any sweat).

The safety can be placed in the on position with a loaded chamber and the hammer back. It has a tilt-up barrel, allowing it to easily be unloaded, chamber checked, or carried at full capacity without having to cycle the action and then plus up the magazine.
