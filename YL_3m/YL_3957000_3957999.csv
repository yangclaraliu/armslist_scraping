Bought New end of December at Sharp Shooters. All original paperwork and carry box included. I bought several carry guns in December, and settled on a 9mm, so this one is for sale. Not a scratch on it. Just like New. SPRINGFIELD XDS 4.0 45 ACP COMES WITH ONE 5 AND ONE 7 ROUND MAG ....What if your favorite range pistol could also shrink down for comfortable concealed carry? The ideal concealed carry pistol would have all the features, performance and power you’d find in a full size handgun, but in a smaller package. The XD-S 4.0-45 Caliber Single Stack from Springfield Armory does exactly that. The XD-S 4.0Single Stack is a mid-sized single stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory. The sub-compact frame extends to full size length when you insert an X-Tension magazine. Combined with the 4.0 barrel, this gives you a pistol that’s ideal for a day at the range. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S 4.0 Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD pistols safe and easy to use."

Includes a Magpul BAD lever and upgraded charging handle. The charging handle operates smooth as butter; it's incredibly easy to rack this rifle. Magpul grip w/ interchangeable backstraps. The camouflage is just a rattle-can job and can be removed w/ some paint stripper. The turrets and zoom ring on the scope were not painted and the glass was/is covered w/ Butler Creek flip-up lens covers. I'm asking $1,000 and I will include a 30rd PMAG or a 10rd PMAG.

Finally decided to let my baby go. All FDE diamondback upper and lower and lightweight handguard, have other spare stock and magpul moe grip, custom made muzzle break that makes it feel like your shooting a 9mm conversion, vortex sparc II red dot which is amazing and I have shot 400yards with at a 12x20 steel plate. Have 8 spare magpul pmags in matching fde, CMC 3.5lb flat bar trigger doesnt even move, you think it and it fires its that crips and fast, all kinds of stuff im forgetting. Shoots SUB MOA at 200yards with 208amax subsonics and shoots right at moa with factory box remington 120gr from walmart, THATS RIGHT, this semi auto is probably more accurate than your BOLT RIFLE with cheap walmart ammo! This gun is PROVEN and exceptional well kept, never fired more than 10rds fast, custom er shaw 1:8 barrel has never been hot. If you want the soft recoil of the muzzle brake and the badass looks of a shorter barrel this is a perfect setup to chop 4in off the barrel and have the brake welded on for a few bucks for a KICK ASS cqb setup that can still reach 400yards and do 4-5in groups.

If your looking for a dialed in MATCH quality gun you can shoot 400yards with or defend your family with or competitions for less than 2500$ shoot me a text as I have terrible reception on my property and wont get your phone call or voicemail!

This gun comes with factory box, paperwork, lock, etc. as well as (1) 10 round Glock magazine with Pearce finger extension; (1) 13 round Glock magazine with grip sleeve insert; and (1) 9 round Glock magazine that fits the Glock perfectly flush and is ideal for concealed carry. 

I had a set of new Trijicon HD night sights (GL104O) with orange front outline installed a few months ago and they are amazing and pick up very easily. Definitely worth the $150 price. The grips were lightly stippled over the Glock factory ""orange peel"" textured grips for better grip overall and for an easier draw if carrying concealed. The stippling is nothing too flashy or uncomfortable though."

The SSAR-15 SBS allows the shooter to safely bump fire their AR-15 from the shoulder, effectively and legally simulating fully automatic fire, and allowing for an unprecedented measure of control that is severely lacking when attempting to bump fire a rifle in the traditional, ""from-the-hip"" manner. 

 The SSAR-15 features a shelf that positions the shooter's index finger in a fixed position in front of the rifle's trigger. To fire, the upper receiver is moved forward with the support hand pushing on the forend, thereby bringing the trigger to the shooter's finger and discharging a round. The rifle's recoil causes the upper receiver to move rearward, allowing the trigger mechanism to reset. When the right amount of constant forward pressure is applied, the rifle will continue to fire as the trigger is brought forward and depressed by the shooter's stationary index finger, causing the gun to Bump Fire. With a little practice, the shooter will be capable of delivering accurate single shots, bursts, or even full magazine dumps on demand using the SSAR-15. 

 The SSAR-15 is designed for installation onto any Mil-Spec Diameter AR-15 Collapsible Stock Receiver Extension Buffer Tube. Installation involves removing the factory pistol grip, replacing it with the included Interface Block, and sliding the SSAR-15 onto the buffer tube. No permanent modifications or gunsmithing required! Each SSAR-15 assembly includes the SBS Buttstock, an Interface Block, Hex Key, Instructions, BATFE Approval Letter and Lifetime Factory Warranty. Made in the USA.

This is a stellar deal on a very good quality AR-15.  This is not your cheap entry level ar15, even though it is listed for entry level price...

From manufacturer's site: The SIG SAUER P232 is a small and lightweight pistol. Chambered in .380ACP and featuring a fixed barrel blowback action, the P232 Stainless is one of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 23oz in the stainless version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today."

It's a solid shooter grade rifle. made in 1940, Non matching serial numbers. The M38 is the same rifle as the M44 and Type 53 in every respect save it never had a side folding bayonet. These were generally issued to rear echelon troops with little need for a bayonet.

This is a second year of production rifle. This one is not as much a collector (very little interest there for a mutt like this) but as a general shooter, hunter. base for a custom build, it's the place to be. Condition is fair to good. the bore is weak, but still serviceable. (If you want to replace it for an accurized target shooter or whatever, i can put you on a site that has original and custom bull barrels for sale) Someone has replaced the rear sight blade with a mojo peep style. No import stamps.

It is what it is, a solid shooter that you can go several directions with.

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano; extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer.

Stripped, A3-style flattop upper receiver is carefully machined to mil-spec dimensions with M4 feed ramps to serve as the foundation for a top-quality AR rifle customized to your exact requirements. Just add the bolt/carrier, charging handle, ejection port cover, and forward assist of your choice to complete the upper. Precision machined from a forging of 7075 T6 aluminum that is almost 40% stronger than the alloy used in standard AR-15 receivers, so it stands up to the unrelenting tempo of competition or tactical operations. After machining, a black, non-reflective, hard-anodized finish is applied for strength and corrosion resistance, with a baked-on dry-lube coating inside to reduce wear and ensure exceptionally smooth carrier operation. Integral 5½"" long Picatinny rail maximizes the versatility of your rifle by letting you take advantage of the wide variety of optics, red dot sights, and other accessories for the AR platform"

Description Sig Sauer P250 Subcompact DAO 9mm 3.6"" 10+1 CS Poly Grip Blk Nitron

 The Sig Sauer P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of
 the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The
 P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the
 functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This
 allows a change in caliber and size (subcompact, compact and full). After
 any change, the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable
 functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of
 maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand
 sizes. There are 6 different available ergonomic combinations for each
 size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. The
 P250 Subcompact comes with the small grip module.
