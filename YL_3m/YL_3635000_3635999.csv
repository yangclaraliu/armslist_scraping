This has been shot a few times at the range for test fire. Purchased as a gift for wife. It was a ""bad choice"" surprise. She prefers jewelry!
My loss, your gain for an asking price of $535.00 with no sales tax (that saves you a lot of money). For a local purchase, I use L.E.P.D shooting range at 999 Bethel Road, Columbus Ohio 43214 and we can do gun purchase from me there and you can test fire at the same time. Purchase being made through mail must be sent to F.F.L dealer for you to pickup and have back ground check made. F.F.L. dealers charges can be as low as $20 and sometimes less. Some are higher. You can shop around for FFL dealer before having gun transferred.

I also have a HOUGE Grip for this pistol for an extra $10. Picture available upon request. That's at least half what you would pay buying off the shelf. The Houge grip is very comfortable. I use one on my Sig P238 Sport model."

The SIG SAUER® P226® is the pistol that set the standard by which all other combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet’s special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

I was going to sand it and see what kind of wood is under it and refinish it but I decided that the color gave it a classic look.

It has the military issue AK74 muzzle brake which is the best in the industry for these rifles. If you haven't shot an AK74 5.45x39 with the true AK74 brake, it has almost zero kick and is a blast to shoot! This one also has a G2 trigger kit for a great trigger feel as well as a USA made pistol grip for 922r compliance. This rifle will come with 3 made in USA polymer magazines.

In the picture you can see that the DOC sight had a small chip in the upper right corner. This is only on the Inside glass, not the outside. It never caused and issue, plus it's ballistic glass so it won't spread. The glass on the acog is perfect, so no issues there.

Adapted from the battlefields, US Forces have begun improving this proven Trijicon ACOG scope by adding a small red dot sight on top for close encounter missions. Trijicon has now created a similar model for the public, the TA31DOC. The main Trijicon scope provides a dual-illuminated reticle using fiber optics and tritium for bright aiming point in any light condition. The ranging reticle allows for bullet drop compensation out to 600 meters without any manual adjustments. A Trijicon RMR® sits on top with a 7 MOA aiming dot


The ACOG dual illumination sight is world renowned for reliability and accuracy in the toughest combat conditions on the planet. The numerous advantages of using a battery-free optical sight that is ""always on"" and that automatically adjusts for lighting conditions has made the ACOG one of the preferred gunsights of the US armed forces. Fiber optics and tritium vials create a bright aiming point that is easy to pick up with both eyes open, at distance or close range, for accurate and rapid target engagement."

PRICE REDUCTION...NEED TO MOVE

This rifle has only had 5 rounds run through it, as evidenced by the five rounds missing out of one box of the accompanying ammo.  The weapon is in absolutely pristine condition.  It has a VAIS .308 Stainless Muzzle Brake that has been meticulously and seamlessly installed by a professional and competent gunsmith.  I am the second owner of the rifle.  Thinking that I was going to be in Wyoming this year on an elk hunt I purchased the rifle in anticipation of throwing a premium optic on it and ultimately packing my freezer to the gills.  Not gonna happen.  Here's your chance.  It comes with 5 boxes of ammo, less the five rounds expended (see photo).  This is a FTF sale in Alabama, I would rather have someone see it in person than go through the hassle of shipping and adding another expense to the transaction. If you add it up a conservative figure of $700 for the rifle, $100 for the muzzle brake, $150 installation, $190 (less 5 rounds $180)....it's a pretty good deal!

The first and last rounds have the same force against the bottom of the rifle’s bolt.  In a typical high capacity magazine, the coil spring occupies the bottom 20% of the magazine, wasted space.  With an EAGLE, a constant-tension, rolled-ribbon spring hangs from the top, allowing ammo to be loaded to the absolute bottom of the magazine (no wasted space hanging down).  These magazines have the strongest plastic of any magazine, and window-glass clear so you can see exactly how many rounds are loaded.  This is the best built magazine, ever, rock-solid strong.  Unfortunately, they were discontinued with the Clinton magazine ban.

EAGLEs are the smoothest functioning magazine ever made.  I love them.  This one (for a Ruger Mini-30) was accidentally included in a large dealer order, back, in about 1990.  I’ve sold 100’s of these for Mini-14 without a single complaint.

The variety of stock, barrel and finish options alone would assure the place of the 500 in the hearts of outdoorsmen. But, of course, its performance in the field goes a long way in cementing its reputation with millions of hunters as well. First and foremost, the 500 is built to the same uncompromising mil-specs as the renowned Mossberg 590. Then a host of features are introduced - Quiet Carry dual-action bars, 3'' chambers and an ambidextrous safety, to name a few. Some models also include factory-ported barrels; the industry's first fully-rifled slug barrel and our Trophy Slugster. A simple change of barrel and/or choke tubes is all that's required to take one shotgun from upland birds to waterfowl, to turkey, to deer., **WE DO NOT DO TRADES.

I am unsure the exact age, but it is old enough that it does not have a serial number so that would be pre-1968. I have not fired this gun, I inherited it and I am selling it in the condition in which I received it. It comes apart fine,  the hammer cocks back and releases when you pull the trigger, you can see the firing pin move forward when the hammer hits it, but the trigger seems to be lacking a return spring. I looked it up and the spring can be purchased for $2.90 at Numrich Gun parts (I will include the parts diagram and part number for the spring). It also has an ejector for the shell. Bead front sight. 28"" barrel.  Everything appears to be original.  Bore is bright and shiny, no pitting or rust inside the barrel.

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or available SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case 7 round magazines

Chambered in the classic .308 Winchester cartridge, the LE901-16S is the perfect choice for medium to large sized game animals. Exceptional accuracy is assured by its full floated, 16.1” chrome lined barrel and one-piece monolithic upper receiver, suitable for mounting your optic of choice.

The fact that all operating controls are ambidextrous, including the magazine release, bolt catch and safety selector, makes for versatility and ease of use.

The A-Bolt design is a favorite among bolt-gun enthusiasts, and for several good reasons – A unique, highly efficient design, hunter-friendly features and all-around great looks. Its short, 60º bolt throw provides plenty of thumb clearance between the bolt knob and the scope, making cycling incredibly fast and comfortable. The rifle’s free-floating, hand-chambered barrel with target crown makes it inherently accurate with the right load, too.

It is extremely fast stock being a naked bike but with the mods it has and dialed in carbs this thing is a monster on the highway. The bike clean value is $3500 without all the mods done, their is a lot of money in this bike and everything is done right and fast.
