I will tell you though that these mags can fit a little snug in some guns, but all you have to do is a little sanding with 100 grit sandpaper and it wont be an issue. I tried them in a few different guns and they fit fine in two of them and the other one i had to sand a little on the mag to get it to drop free by just pressing the release. I will show you were to sand so if you have to you will know how.

Long story short, Standard Small Arms (SSA) was a commercial manufacturer that was established to challenge production cost/numbers during WWI in England. SSA was never successful in meeting manufacturing goals, and became more of a primary contractor supplying parts such a receivers, barrels, trigger housings, etc which were assembled in the Enfield bayonet shop. SSA later became NRF (National Rifle Factory) in 1918 after being taken over by the British government.

I purchased this rifle several years back from my local gunsmith, as it had been left by a previous customer years back to pay a bill.  When I purchased it, the stock had all been butchered and sporterized. I replaced all the furniture with a stock set from a DP rifle, but used as much as the original parts as possible.  The bluing doesn't look all original, hard to tell so it may have been blued sometime in the past.  There is pitting on the whole exterior of the barrel. Rifling is good, with some minor pitting.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

Buyer pays transfer and background check.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

1.  300 Blackout upper only.  Has a 12"" keymod Rainier Arms free float handrail.  16"" Ultralight barrel 1-8 twist.  This is a very light upper that is a blast to shoot.  Very low recoil and great with subsonic ammo.  I do not know who makes that brake, but it is evil looking and effective(not that you really need, or really even notice, an effective brake on a 300 BLK).  The upper comes with BCG, regular charging handle, and digicam soft tactical case.  I have some extra Gemtech and Remington subsonic match ammo if you would like it at $1 per round.  The price on this one is $825 without the optic, but I can add the EOTech for an extra $375 or the Bushnell ar scope with PEPR cantilever mount from the other picture for an extra $250.  

2.  .223/5.56 upper only.  Has a 12"" keymod Rainier Arms free float handrail.  16"" lightweight barrel 1-9 twist.  This is a very light upper that is also a blast to shoot.  I do not know who makes that brake, but it is a copy of the Noveske KX3 Pig Suppressor, it looks great and shoots even better.  The upper comes with BCG, tactical extended charging handle, and a digicam soft tactical case.  The price on this one is $825 without the optic, but I can add the EOTech from the other picture for an extra $375, or the Bushnell ar scope with PEPR cantilever mount for an extra $250.  

3.  .223/5.56/.223 Wylde upper only.  Has a 12"" quad rail free float handrail.  16"" spriral fluted barrel 1-9 twist.  This is a very accurate barrel for 16 inches and has a standard 3 prong flash hider on it.  The upper comes with BCG, regular charging handle, 1 black ladder, and a digicam soft tactical case.  This one is missing a dust cover which is fairly easy to add if you would like it.  The price on this one is $550 and I can add the EOTech from other picture for an extra $375, or the Bushnell ar scope with PEPR cantilever mount from the other picture for an extra $250."

 1966 was the Winchester Repeating Arms Company's 100th year of operation. To commemorate this occasion, Winchester produced a run of fancy Model 94 rifles. These were based on post 1964 Model 94's actions with a gold plated receiver and for end cap, brass ""rifle"" (curved) butt plate, saddle ring, and a heavy octagon barrel with a full length magazine that was nicely polished and deeply blued. The straight hand stock was select walnut. All were in caliber .30-30 Winchester. 


 There were rifle (26"") and carbine (20"") barrel lengths, and sets of rifle and carbines were also offered. The point to all of the gold and brass was to make the 1966 Centennial reminiscent of the brass framed Winchester 1866 ""Yellow Boy"" rifle that was Winchester's first product. 


 These Centennial '66 rifles and carbines generally showed a high order of fit and finish. The receiver was 24 carat gold plated inside and out, so they were pretty with the action open, too. Here are the basic specifications of the Centennial '66 Rifle: 


 -NEW IN THE BOX UNFIRED

This is a beautiful pistol in excellent condition in box with two factory mags and paperwork. It is quite accurate with a tight barrel to slide fit. Though I am the second owner, the original owner and the condition indicate very little use. I think this a great defensive pistol for someone like me who appreciates the safety of a da trigger pull (without the liability of a manual safety) but can't point a glock in the right direction (i wish i were made for them as they are great on paper, just not the paper i am shooting at) and don't like ittybitty grips that don't fill the hand or have a place for all fingers.

This gun apparently spent some time in Germany because it is stamped with German proof marks. It is also furnished with a rear Elliason ramp sight. This gun has been fired and has a few light handling marks but is overall in great shape with no holster wear or signs of ever being carried. It does include a Colt box and paperwork but it is a reproduction. The box is in good shape and it is just how I got it. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. Thanks for looking.

1983 Midnight Virago For sale. Clean Title in Hand. Needs some TLC. Would be a nice winter project for someone. Has a few cosmetic fixes that need to be done like the seat and a few spots where the paint is chipping off. Needs the starter fixed. It makes some noise when you start it but its been doing it for over 2 years. 

Has a small tick when running, I have no idea what it is. Doesn't seem to effect the performance of the bike so I haven't messed with it. After doing research on it, most people say that the older Yamahas are noisey. Feel free to come out, hear it run.

The XPS2 is the shortest, smallest and lightest EOTech model holographic weapon sight available without night vision. Its size and weight make it convenient for hunters and law enforcement officers to carry.

 It is also fast and runs on a single 123 battery. The compact, single-lithium-battery configuration leaves more rail space than ever for rear iron sights or magnifiers.

 I have only 10 hours run time on the battery. Excellent holographic sight with 100 and 300 yard reticle. The box and carrying case are included.

 VMX-3T Magnifier 

 Simple, fast, effective--the push-button design of the VMX-3T engages and disengages the flip-mount, allowing the magnifier to lock in place. The result, 3x magnified or unmagnified views at will. Optics are fully multi-coated for optimal light transmission. Lightweight and tough; hard-coat-anodized machined-aluminum construction ensures durability. Internally nitrogen purged for reliable waterproof/fogproof performance. Ultimate magnified versatility for virtually any AR-height red dot sight.

 This magnifier works very well with the EOTech, but if you don't want to magnify it goes off to the side. Excellent for hunting or plinking at the range."

Hi there. Made the decision to switch back to 9mm. Got rid of my Glock 23, and now I'm looking to get rid of the Glock 22 as well. I am looking to trade for a Glock 26 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com) 

Comes with everything in the original box. 5 mags (3 factory, 2 brand new extended 31 round), lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me.

The quality of pictures are severely reduced when uploaded to armslist so it can make some textures look strange (like on the extended mags.) If you'd like the full size pictures, I can email them to you."

The buyer will have ample time to inspect before rendering any payment. Other then the Glock 19 being a 9mm there is very little difference in the way they look."

Model: TAVOR
Caliber: 5.56mm NATO
Barrel Length: 18 inch
Capacity: 30-39


Here is your chance to own Israel’s bull-pup AR15. The new TAVOR has an 18” barrel vs the old 16.25” barrel. While the barrel is 18”, the overall length of the weapon is only 27.625” which gives you the mobility of a SBR (short barreled rifle) without compromising distance and accuracy.

Unlike the Steyr AUG with its gun specific and expensive magazines, the IWI TAVOR uses standard AR15 Magazines!

The TAVOR runs clean and smooth with a piston operation, and has little recoil. The TAVOR is one of the most ergonomic rifles in production. When you shoulder the rifle it feels natural and comfortable. The TAVOR disassembles easily and can be field stripped in under a minute with practice.

Ease of use, mobility, accuracy, and distance – the IWI TAVOR is sure to become your weapon of choice to defend against threats or to just have some fun!"
