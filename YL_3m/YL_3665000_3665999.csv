I wasn't high on Ruger pistols at first due to an SR45 having multiple issues right out of a Bass Pro. But after previously owning an SR22 and now this, Ruger pistols' stock is rising! In my eyes at least. Anyway I just picked up sometching else for CCW since the weather is getting cooler.

I purchased and added on to this rifle after doing many months of research on creating the ""perfect weapon system"" for any defensive/offensive situation in virtually any scenario that would come up. ONLY reason I am selling is because I am saving up for a full auto, so my baby has to go...

As part of building this weapon system, I chose the:

-Daniel Defense M4 Carbine because it kept popping up in list after list of the ""best of the best"" because of its durability, attention to detail/quality, and adherence to Military Specifications/tolerances. Watch this video on YouTube and you'll see why the DDM4 is the best M4/AR15 on the market from a durability standpoint http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kX0nCEh5E

-Burris MTAC Ballistic CQ/LR (Close Quarter/Long Range) tactical optic because it offers both Close Quarters and Medium/Long Range capabilities in the same platform and the same time. Using ""true 1x"" it allows for both eyes open use (just like a red dot...AimPoint for example), and up to 4x magnification with built in 5.56 BDC reticles for effective engagements up to 600 yards. Just zero for 100 yards (which it already is) and your ready to go out to 600 yards using the built in BDC dots. It is extremely clear, has illuminated reticle (which work even if the battery dies), weather and shock proof, with a lifetime warranty. It is just like having both a Red Dot and a Tactical magnified scope in one, giving you the best of both worlds in one small, lightweight package.

-5.11 LED Tactical Lightweight High Output Weapons light because of it's superior performance inside of an extremely light frame. It is weather/shock proof with high, low, and strobe capabilities. Mounts perfect along side the foregrip for easy of use in any conditions.

-45 degree backup sight for obvious reasons; just in case something were to happen the MTAC optic this rifle can still be effective at close and medium/long ranges.

-Viking VTAC battle sling after much research in the best sling for all situations. Check out how awesome this sling is here: 
http://www.vikingtactics.com/product-p/vtac-mk2.htm

-Quick detach Harris bipod. Small and compact, but adjustable and sturdy. Can be added/removed to the M4 very quickly if the situation requires it. Quickly turns this M4 from a close quarters machine into a medium/long tactical precision weapon. 

Comes with everything listed above, plus:

Hard Carrying case, (4) 30 round mags, 90 rounds of ammo, scope lenses covers, and original boxes for most accessories.

I have well over $2500 invested in this barely used and meticulously cleaned package. Cash price is $2000 OBO. This is extremely fair for everything included...you will NOT regret taking this beauty home. Please be realistic with your offers or they will be ignored.

1911 Carry .45 Tacops with Threaded Barrel Sig Night Sights SAO Nitron

My email and text number are below as this sights emailing doesnt work often.

I got this gun in a multi gun trade from original owner, has Sig Night Sights, lock, 4 mags, original carry box and papers.  The trigger pull is Light and Crisp and it has a safety thats easy to disengage.

It is in great condition with some wear on barrel at extraction area and minor wear at the business end and very minor wear on grip.  I can send additional pics as needed.

Send all reasonable cash offers.

Must meet publically in or near Clermont which is just west of Orlando, near Winter Garden, Leesburg, Davenport, or Hwy 27 and I-4 If interested in trading then read all below so we dont waste our time.

I would consider trades plus cash or trade straight up or possibly add a gun or guns,  ammo or extras for the right AR in .308

I don't need anything so I'd be trading at what I could buy your gun new or used from the lowest priced listings on slickguns, CDNN, classic firearms or J&G when they are in stock, dont need anything full retail, craze inflated or BPS or Gander pricing.

I would prefer to buy things with my cash so I have the initial warranty but if its the right deal, I am willing to work on my guns price too, but since I prefer cash deal, its really going to have to be a trade I really want thats in great shape or new.

Send me a pic if you have a trade and make me an offer. Don't ask what I'd take as I'm not negotiating with myself. I need to see what you have and  condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's easier if you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. 

As for trades, I'm really looking for a Sig 716, DPMS REPR or SASS, Colt, DPMS Recon or Recon 2, POF, BRO, LMT, PWS, Ruger, Windham, Core, etc or similar price ranges $1000-$2000.....Will consider most ar's in .308, with no front post and Upper and lowers must be same manufacturer. Only factory built.  Must be new or like new.  I can add one or two guns for right deal, ammo or possibly extras.  I am not looking for one at MSRP, looking for a good to great price. Decent quality optics are a plus. Obviously I would love an LWRC or HK but I cant afford those, so please keep that in mind.

Also possibly interested in new or like new AK's prefer pistol..... plus cash, possibly rifle plus cash.  I would consider Zastava m92 PAP  (I know they are out of stock in some places, but they pop up weekly and I can wait)  others i'd consider if not canted  CAI Centurion 39 ,  Yugo M70AB,  Yugo Zastava NPAP,  CAI Centurion 39 Tactical AK, Draco or Mini Draco ....... No wasrs, not interested in saigas even though I know they can be great and arsenals are out of my price range.

Only handguns I want are new or like new .......Glock 19 Gen 4, possibly a 23, FDE/OD are plus..........  Or Gen 3 19/23 in FDE/OD,  Glock 30s, possibly Gen 4 21......no stippling please   (stock glocks are $475-515 new all over and low $400's used, so please dont tell me yours is worth $600)  Also might consider LCR if under $400 plus cash, prefer .357 but open to .38  I would trade even up for 2 Glocks also in different sizes or calibers even if one has more wear or one of Glocks listed above and another like new or new gun.  Holsters and self defense ammo are not really helpful for me.

No junk, old stuff, collectibles, cowboy, military, vintage, builds, shotguns or  hunting rifles Non felon, 21 minimum, DL and bill of sale  required. 

I will try to post my other guns I have for sale/trade today or tomorrow.  Sig Extreme P938 $625, Spikes Ar 5.56 $950, possibly Glock 27 with lots of extras $600, Spikes .300 aac in FDE $1350, possibly Mossy Tactical 12ga with lots of extras $500  all prices are asking prices assuming every one will negotiate, so I can be fair if others are with me.

Tipton offers an assortment of four caliber range specific Rifle/Pistol tips for your convenience, or they can be purchased separately. Solid brass is softer than barrel steel so there is no worry of damaging your bore, plus they will last much longer than the typical synthetic plastic tips. Tips are threaded 8-32.

Prefer cash for best price on my gun. 

Spike's Tactical Ar 5.56 / .223 SL15 Punisher Lower, Multi Caliber  Magpul Handguard & Front Grip, Metal Rear Sight, Spider Marked Grip, Stock and BCG   Lifetime transferable warranty....Can throw in extras depending on deal.

My email and text number are below as this sights emailing doesnt work often.

Only fired less than 100 rds through her to sight in.  Still in great condition and very accurate.  Only selling as it's duplicate and to fund other toys as listed below

I can send additional pics as needed.

Send all reasonable cash offers.

Must meet publically in or near Clermont which is just west of Orlando, near Winter Garden, Leesburg, Davenport, or Hwy 27 and I-4 If interested in trading then read all below so we dont waste our time.

I would consider trades plus cash or trade straight up or possibly add a gun or guns,  ammo or extras for the right AR in .308

I don't need anything so I'd be trading at what I could buy your gun new or used from the lowest priced listings on slickguns, CDNN, classic firearms or J&G when they are in stock, dont need anything full retail, craze inflated or BPS or Gander pricing.

I would prefer to buy things with my cash so I have the initial warranty but if its the right deal, I am willing to work on my guns price too, but since I prefer cash deal, its really going to have to be a trade I really want thats in great shape or new.

Send me a pic if you have a trade and make me an offer. Don't ask what I'd take as I'm not negotiating with myself. I need to see what you have and  condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's easier if you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. 

As for trades, I'm really looking for a Sig 716, DPMS REPR or SASS, Colt, DPMS Recon or Recon 2, POF, BRO, LMT, PWS, Ruger, Windham, Core, etc or similar price ranges $1000-$2000.....Will consider most ar's in .308, with no front post and Upper and lowers must be same manufacturer. Only factory built.  Must be new or like new.  I can add one or two guns for right deal, ammo or possibly extras.  I am not looking for one at MSRP, looking for a good to great price. Decent quality optics are a plus. Obviously I would love an LWRC or HK but I cant afford those, so please keep that in mind.

Also possibly interested in new or like new AK's prefer pistol..... plus cash, possibly rifle plus cash.  I would consider Zastava m92 PAP  (I know they are out of stock in some places, but they pop up weekly and I can wait)  others i'd consider if not canted  CAI Centurion 39 ,  Yugo M70AB,  Yugo Zastava NPAP,  CAI Centurion 39 Tactical AK, Draco or Mini Draco ....... No wasrs, not interested in saigas even though I know they can be great and arsenals are out of my price range.

Only handguns I want are new or like new .......Glock 19 Gen 4, possibly a 23, FDE/OD are plus..........  Or Gen 3 19/23 in FDE/OD,  Glock 30s, possibly Gen 4 21......no stippling please   (stock glocks are $475-515 new all over and low $400's used, so please dont tell me yours is worth $600)  Also might consider LCR if under $400 plus cash, prefer .357 but open to .38  I would trade even up for 2 Glocks also in different sizes or calibers even if one has more wear or one of Glocks listed above and another like new or new gun.  Holsters and self defense ammo are not really helpful for me.

No junk, old stuff, collectibles, cowboy, military, vintage, builds, shotguns or  hunting rifles Non felon, 21 minimum, DL and bill of sale  required. 

I will try to post my other guns I have for sale/trade today or tomorrow.  Sig Tacops 1911 Threaded $1025, Sig Extreme P938 $625, possibly Glock 27 with lots of extras $600, Spikes .300 aac in FDE $1350, possibly Mossy Tactical 12ga with lots of extras $500  all prices are asking prices assuming every one will negotiate, so I can be fair if others are with me.

I'm the second owner. First owner didn't seem to shoot it that much. I shot 160 rounds through it using both 5.56 and .223 and it's been flawless. 2 range sessions and cleaned after each one.

I got this in a trade and considering how much this rifle goes for on Gunbroker, along with how well it performed: $1100 OBO. Either cash, cash+gun or guns is fine with me, as long as the value of your trade is reasonably close to $1100 and is something decent, i.e. offering 10 Hi-Point or Jimenez pistols (I think you get the picture) ain't gonna cut it! See down below for what might cut it. :)

I'm just looking for something different. I'm in no rush to sell/trade this as normally it's a keeper but I do have something else that's just as much a keeper. That said, any lowball attempts will get no reply from me, or at the most a ""no thanks"" (and maybe a sarcastic comment lol). I realize this item may be a bit pricy but if you don't have something equal or close to offer then do both of us a favor and just don't contact me.

Prefer to meet within 30-40 min of Navarre. Your offer would have to be something special to make me drive further than that. Be sure to have your Florida ID with you, CCW would be great. I don't require a bill of sale but won't deal with you if you're not willing to sign one. Email or text REDACTED. Thanks!"

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from SIG SAUER.

The coloring is rich and vibrant, and the grain pattern is very unique with a nice amount of depth. This set has been given the AFG/Shark Fin cut for the purpose of increased ergonomics/control and esthetic appeal. This is a one of a kind stock set that would look amazing on any stamped receiver AKM rifle. There are not many options available in this deep of a red coloring with a nice glossy finish. The pistol grip is a marbled Bakelite grip that has been refinished to match the wood stock set in both color and gloss. All mounting points including the tang, butt plate and sling attachment have been factory drilled. The stock set is also factory sized and may require some basic fitting for a nice secure fit to your rifle. This set does not come with the metal fittings. I sell excellent condition surplus mounting hardware kits separately when I have them in stock for an extra $20 (Includes: all 6 mounting screws, buttplate, cleaning kit trap door, sling attachment for buttstock, and upper and lower steel mounting brackets). Let me know if you want them as part of your order before I ship. I do not ship outside the United States. Please ask all questions before bidding. I usually ship within 48 hours. Payment is required within 10 days of auction end. If you have less than 10 ratings please contact me before bidding. Shipping will be $15.30 to any of the 48 states."

Its really just cosmetic.... so if you can deal with that its a heck of a price ;-)

Certainly one of the most unusual-looking guns to come out is the Mossberg 500 Chainsaw. Built in the iconic Mossberg 500 action, the Chainsaw is a pistol-grip pump-action shotgun with no stock. While guns like this are desirable for home defense, they're notoriously hard to control while firing, a problem that Mossberg has solved by attaching a wrap-around chainsaw-style hand grip to the pump. Intended to be fired from the hip, this top handle allows the user to cycle the action while simultaneously maintaining leverage above the gun to help tame muzzle flip. In addition to the chainsaw-style grip, the 500 Chainsaw has a stand-off barrel that can be used to breech doors and three rails that can mount accessories.
