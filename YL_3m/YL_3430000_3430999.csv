It is used, although not much. I've only shot about 150 rounds through it. I bought it for a hunting/utility rifle, so it's just seen slow fire sessions. The geissele trigger is outstanding. It has always been very accurate. It shoots .5 MOA with rem 125gr OTM match rounds. It's always been meticulously cared for. It's a really nice rifle. I'm just bored with my AR's and would like to venture into some different projects.

I've owned this gun for about a year and enjoyed every second of it.  I've literally only put about 100 rounds through her total and kept her in immaculate condition.  I firm believe Spikes makes the absolute best AR for the money being made in the USA with high end, well built parts.  Below are some of the modifications professionally performed:

- KNS anti-roation pins
- Rainier Arms - phase 5 - tactical extended bolt release v2
- Yankee Hill Machine full vertical/horizontal rail and hand guard system
- Noveske KX3 Flash Suppressor 
- Spikes Tactical Battle trigger
- 1x Sight Mark holographic scope with side laser (unmounted pressure plate)
- Troy Pop Ups
- Currently pictured with a line wrapped buffer for the minimalist however I'll likely throw on a Magpul six position stock shortly.

She shoots like a dream and she should.  I spent more than $1,600 without tax getting some of the various options I wanted.  The scope is nothing to brag about obviously but for $150 new, it is about the best I've found so far.  Below is a link directly to the base ST15 which I purchased before doing all the additions.

Link above has all specs and a thorough independent review.

Ideally, I'm looking for a good trade however would entertain a cash offer.  If you can find them in stock on the web you'll pay about $850 plus the obvious transfer fees and minus any of the additions.  I'm looking for roughly that out of it which would be a stellar deal at half the price - considering all the additions.  For trade - I'd give preference to a Colt Defender, Kimber compact variants or any higher end compact 1911.  I can add cash for the right deal.  Considering I by no means have tried every semi there is out there I would also entertain various other offers so send over your trade offer.  The worse either party can say is ""no""."

I acquired this guy in a trade being that I don't typically buy or trade for pistols.  I basically had a friend who wanted an AR I had built but didn't quite have enough cash to complete the sale.  I've been to the range with it a few times and I must say that while I've only fired SA/DA pistols, the LEM trigger is very smooth with little seemingly weight to it.

Comes with original case and one clip which is all I received as well.  I'd ideally like to find a Walther PPS either 9 or .40 for a straight up trade however would also consider any compact 1911 of decent quality.  I can add cash to the right trade.  I will consider other trade offers and can add cash for the right deal.  Send over your offer as the worst either party can say is ""no"".  Thank you!"

PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY. ANY QUESTIONS, FEEL FREE TO PM ME AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO HELP YOU OUT.

I have decided to sell this after much thought. This is a used Cooper Model 21 (single shot) Varminter in 223 Remington (24"" barrel). Weight is around 7lbs and includes the stock upgrade to the Montana Varminter (vented forearm) The rifle has been fired 121 times (by me, with modest loads, 23.0 grains of Benchmark with a 50gr ballistic tip). It was owned by another individual who documented all shots (364 rounds down the tube) This makes for a very accurate rifle with a lot of life left to give, see targets @ less than 1/2 inch to 200 yards. The rifle has been threaded 1/2x28 (includes knurled thread protector) to accept a suppressor as well as the included custom brake. The barrel was threaded and the brake was done by Sam Miller and is concentric. I have fired the gun with the brake, as well as, several suppressors with zero issues. The rifle has a 14 twist, so you are limited to 55gr and under. Brand new (never had anything mounted on them) Warne bases are included and already mounted. These mounted by degreasing the threads, applying a light coat of oil to the bottom of the base/top of receiver (being careful not to get any in the threads) and tiny amount of blue loctite. Rifle ships in factory box and includes everything above, plus 4 boxes of bullets for reloading.

There is a very small ding in the wood (approximately .100""X.070""), caused by me losing hold of the bolt when removing it (stupid I know) Stock was done by cooper and have the factory paperwork to prove it (done 3/2014). Includes factory 3-shot target. Minus the small ding the wood is awesome condition. The metal is in great condition with a few normal wear marks on the barrel.

It was floated, bedded and fitted by Cooper before being returned, as well as being test fired. See target

Also included:
86 Hornady 52gr BTHP #2249
100 Nosler Varmageddon 40gr FB tipped #17230
15 Nosler Ballistic Tip varmint 50gr spitzer #39522
80 Nosler Varmageddon 55gr FB tipped # 17240

Lee Collet 2-Die Neck Sizer Set 223 Remington (Lee #90707, minus the shell holder)

A very nicely done, knurled thread protector.

CONUS Shipping is FREE. Will ship to the other 2 states as well with what I would pay to the furthest CONUS location subtracted from the whole amount to your location in the other two states.

Asking price is $1475.00 OBO
These are roughly $2200.00 new with the same stock configuration. Then you add in the brake, threaded barrel, thread protector and Warne bases and I think the price is fair.
