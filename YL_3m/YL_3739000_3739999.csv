The iron sights are visible through the scope mount.  

This older rifle is in perfect mechanical condition, and has obviously been shot very little, but long-term storage has caused some damage to the finish.  There are a few small bare spots on the barrel, and the left side of the receiver.  Some of the finish it also gone on the tops of the Weaver scope rings.  There is no rust on the gun.  It's a working gun you can throw in the truck and take to the woods without worrying about marring the finish.

This 336CS is the deluxe model with a checkered walnut stock and grip cap, and features the cross bolt safety.  The stock is a beautiful piece of walnut, with nice sharp cut checkering.  It has a rubber rifle butt pad, and a blued steel barrel band with integral swivel stud.

Since its introduction in 1948, the Marlin 336 family has been one of the most popular hunting rifles in North America.  Over 6 million Model 336 rifles have been produced.  It embodies Marlin's dedication to dependability, pinpoint accuracy and good looks.  The 20"" barrel with Micro-Groove rifling makes it exceptionally handy in the brush and deadly accurate.  

This Marlin has been in storage for many years and is now available for sale.  The asking price of $350 is fair for a sturdy scoped rifle in this condition.  Deer season is upon us.  Don't be bashful. Contact me and let's talk about this gun. It would be the perfect Christmas gift for someone special."

The long, 15” DDM4 quad rail over a 16” cold hammer forged Government profile barrel gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol Grip.

Barrel Length: 16.5""
Caliber: 5.56MM
Color: Black
Sights: None

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.

The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.

This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.

The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system.

The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled.

The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems.

Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life.

But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore.

Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy.

The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy.

A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance.

Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition.

The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product."

Made in USA

Shotgun is in excellent overall condition; (looks like very little use, if any). Absolutely gentle use with only very slight slight scuffs/marks apparent. (please see pictures). Very nice walnut stock; no chips or cracks (only minor handling marks). 

Everyone knows Mossberg is a terrific utilitarian shotgun; there are lots of accessories (sights, stocks, barrels, etc.) that you can add to these weapons...and, for a relatively small investment you can have one gun that will do it all !!  Hunt deer, turkey, waterfowl (ducks & geese), small game, and still have an awesome home protection weapon.  

The older Mossbergs have very nice stocks (walnut), and a little crisper machining.  Very desirable.

For your consideration, a used Kimber Tactical Custom II. This is NOT a safe queen. There are wear marks on the ambi safeties and grip safety, under the slide stop (no idiot marks), under the bushing, and along the edges of the muzzle. The front strap and magwell shows some wear too. All this shows is that the pistol was carried and used so when I sell it you can rest assured that it will work. This thing is spot on accurate and is ready to go. Night sights still have a lot of life left in them. Aluminum frame, steel slide. Will come with box, docs, bushing wrench, lock but no spent casing. I can send more pictures if needed. This is FOR SALE ONLY. Unless you're willing to offer a Les Baer, Nighthawk or Ed Brown please do not send me any trade offers. I'm tired of getting offered jon boats and livestock. I will ship or drive a reasonable distance for the right deal.

I will also include a partial box of .40 S&W defense HP rounds.
This pistol shoots any kind of ammo problem free and has a great trigger- that being said, I am just more interested in the 1911 platform.
As such, I would like to make a trade for a mid-range 1911. The main one I would be interested in would be a Springfield Armory Mil-Spec. Otherwise would be interested in anything comparable, like models from Para-Ordanance, Ruger, Remington, etc. Mainly interested in a commander size, but will consider full and officer size models as well. Have cash to add for a higher end model as well, Sig Sauers in particular. Might consider basic models like Rock Islands but will expect some cash on top.

The car was in a bankruptcy a long time ago. The car is in pretty good shape. No accidents. Car was running when it was parked about a year ago. Before I get a ton of emails telling me to file for a lost title or any of the other things i have heard in the past, let me just say I have talked to a lawyer and the dmv and none of that will work. SO, I'm looking for someone who either has one of these cars and needs parts or someone who has a spot and the time to part out the car. I'm sure the interior alone is worth $500. Black leather heated seat ect. The car is in my name, and I could drive it and keep registering it if i wanted, but i am getting ready to move and would just like the car gone. If your serious email me and I can send pics and give more info about the car."

It is the first 9mm handgun I purchased and pretty much what I used to learn to shoot a ""big gun"" (my other was a .22 plinker).  I did a lot of research before buying this gun and it's been a fantastic firearm.

Billed as a ""duty"" or service gun, this is a full size (4.53"" barrel) 19+1 9mm pistol.  The Czechs have long been known for quality firearms and this is no exception.  The slide milling is beautiful; the barrel's feed ramp is mirror polished.  I have probably somewhere between 600 and 800 rounds through it and it has not failed a single time...no failures to load, fire, extract, or eject.  It just runs like a clock.  Almost everything I shoot through it is 115 grain Winchester ""white box"" ammo...the cheap stuff.  Either that or 115 grain Blazer Brass or Federal.  It eats everything I've run through it.

I changed out the stock recoil spring (18#) for a lighter one (13#) to make sure there are no problems with lighter loads.  The stiffer spring seems to work better for the stouter loads.  I am certainly including BOTH springs with the gun, so you can tune it yourself to what you want to shoot.

Features: it's a hammer-fired gun with the double action-to-single action mechanism.  It has CZ's really versatile Omega trigger system, and actually comes with the parts to convert the gun to a manual safety instead of the ""hammer drop"" decocker lever.  I've run both on this gun to see what I like best, and I have the decocker lever on it now.  I will show you the steps to take to convert it to manual safety if that is what you prefer.  It takes about 5 minutes...there are videos on YouTube as well.

It comes with all of the original paperwork and all of the original materials.  I bought it in January 2014 for $499+tax at Shooter's Supply on Bragg Blvd.  It was the only P-09 I could find in town at the time.  They're still somewhat hard to find locally (the smaller P-07 is more common).  The materials include the nice CZ case, the factory target calibration paper, the two additional backstraps (small and large; it has the medium installed), the cleaning brush and rod, and the two factory magazines.  Disclosure: the magazines are 19 round magazines, but I can only cram 18 rounds in them.  In addition to what's listed above, you also get the ""Special Collector's Edition 2014"" of Guns and Ammo magazine, which is dedicated to coverage of CZ's excellent products, with a nice cover story about the P-09.

I'm looking to sell for cash to buy a S&W M&P 9.  If you have an M&P 9 that you would like to trade, please contact me.

Email me with any questions; my email goes straight to my phone, and I'll answer back as soon as I can.  Buyer needs to have either a North Carolina Pistol Purchase Permit to surrender to me or a North Carolina Concealed Handgun Permit that I can photocopy or photograph for my records, and to go along with the Bill of Sale.

This was my starter rifle that I babied for a few years. I just bought an AK, so I figure I won’t be shooting her as much any more. I cleaned this rifle every time it was shot without fail and you will see that in the great action and flawless stock. Very accurate! Great deal for anyone - especially since I am including 850 Rounds of HARD TO FIND .22lr ammo! You’ll have over 800 rounds to start plinking with your new friend. Comes with one ten round magazine. Buyer pays all transfer fees.

Key Features of the Remington 597 HB .22lr and this great deal:
-Solid household name with made by Remington quality
-Comes with 850 round .22lr ammo!
-16"" Heavy-Contour Barrel for quality and

I believe it is unfired.  However, since I do not have the box and papers, it has been pointed out to me that I cannot PROVE it is unfired.  I bought it several years ago from a local dealer, who had three of these.  He said it was unfired.  It looks unfired, and I know I have not fired it.  The only mark on the gun is a light cylinder mark, which I gave to it.

This unit has been upgraded with a side folding mechanism with a pistol buffer tube and sig SB-15 brace. This makes one handed shooting much easier and folds out of the way for more compact storage. Also, the keltec railed forend is installed allowing the mounting of a light or laser. The muzzle break is a KAK brand that greatly reduces the blast to the shooter. This break is like the noveske kx3. The best part of this pistol is the piston operating system. This makes it more reliable than direct impingement on the AR15 pistols. And it allows the folding option of the arm brace, an option not available on the ar15 pistols. I have 90 rounds thru this pistol since adding the brace. Runs 100% with no issues what so ever. Weighs 6 pounds unloaded."

Cold Steel is famous for raising the bar in the knife industry and our Recon 1 tactical folders are setting a standard that's hard to beat. Why? Because they are as tough as nails and will cut like a chain saw! Every facet of their construction has been over engineered to make them as strong, durable and effective as humanly possible. The blades are made out of imported Japanese AUS 8A stainless steel that's been vacuum heat treated and sub-zero quenched and the handles feature G-10 laminate scales artfully contoured and scalloped for a terrific non slip grip."

(If you want both cases we can work out a deal) If this add is still up then the rounds are still available, however you MUST pick them up to night,  and in the next few hours!

Description:
The PF-9 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. It has been developed from our highly successful P-11 and P-3AT pistols with maximum concealability in mind. The PF-9 has a single stack magazine holding 7 rounds. It is one of the lightest and flattest 9 mm ever made. Firing mechanism is Double-Action Only with an automatic hammer block safety. The PF-9 is available in blued, parkerized, and hard chrome finishes. Grips are in olive drab.

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use."

For sale today, we have a Springfield XD-40 Tactical with 5"" barrel, stainless steel Stormlake 9mm barrel, two 16-round 9mm magazines, four 10-round .40 S&W magazines, and one 12-round .40 S&W magazine.

The Stormlake 9mm barrel is designed to give you drop-in conversion to a 5"" 9mm barrel, using the same slide and recoil spring.  When you want to switch, you simply take off the slide, pull the spring, swap the barrel, and reassemble.

The Springfield XD-40 Tactical is a striker-fired semi-auto with 5"" barrel, accessory rail, and grip safety.  It features a loaded-chamber indicator on top and a striker-charged indicator on the back.  Takedown is fast and easy using the side lever.  Springfield's XD series is clearly Glock inspired, and it's known for excellent reliability and accuracy.

This gun is in good physical condition, with some minor holster wear.  It has white lettering as can be seen in the pictures.  It gets compliments, but if you prefer to go back to original, it's easily removed with non-acetone nail polish remover.

My wife and I both love this gun, and we hate to let it go, but she carries a slim 9mm gun, and I carry a higher-capacity hammer-fired gun.  The Springfield usually ends up coming to the range with us, but it rarely ends up as our carry-guns.  Facing that fact, we've decided to let it go for someone who is looking for a quality piece.

It has never given us ANY issue.  Even shooting low-power reloaded 9mm didn't cause any FTF, FTE, or anything!  It just keeps running whatever we give it.  The recoil is so gentle, making it fun to practice for extended periods of time.  The long sight radius makes even rifle-range targets fun to hit.  We have always kept it clean, and this last trip out to the range I disassembled the striker assembly and cleaned that as well.
