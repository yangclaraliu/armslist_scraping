Brief Introduction:
By projecting a laser beam from the center of the barrel axis of firearm, this laser bore sight collimator allows you to instantly&accurately set your sight or scope etc. The laser light emitting from the laser bore tool travels in a straight line while the bullet follows a trajectory. Even though the use of this device will get you very close, final adjustment should be made at the range."

I got these a year ago and meant to mount them but never had the chance to go out last season (huge bummer) but my loss is your gain!

These skis are NEW IN WRAPPER, seriously the plastic wrap is on them still. No holes drilled for bindings yet so you get to choose how to set them up. They have been stored at room temp in my bedroom under my bed all year long so they are true and the edges don't have any dings in them.

First $225 or best offer gets them!


From the maker-
Volkl Wall Skis 2010: The Volkl Wall is for the serious park rider who wants to be the best. With a fully symmetrical sidecut for switch riding, a full Sensorwood core for extra pop, and Power construction to bring you through those shaky landings, the Wall takes it to the top.

Other Features
Core and Flex Pattern -- Multi layer wood core with butter zones. The front of the ski is stiff; since the rocker design is pre-flexed, added stiffness in front provides stability. The flex in the mid-body of the ski is medium, providing a transition to the softer tail, which allows ease of turning on the groomed, and maneuverability in powder.

Construction -- Power Construction: Völkl's longest-running construction utilizes traditional vertical sidewalls and a torsion box internal layup and provides tremendous grip, stability, and sensitivity. Tough Box: Constructed by wrapping the core with layers of fiberglass strands. Made up of numerous 4 X 4 wraps, and oriented at different angles, Tough Box increases the strength of the connection between ski binding and ski.

Specs-
Terrain: Park & Pipe
Shape: True twin with center mount, best for butters and jibs
Binding Compatibility: Requires bindings with brakes of 90mm 
Turning Radius: 18.2 @ 169m
Tip Width (mm): 115
Waist Width (mm): 87

The SR40c features a through-hardened, stainless steel slide or alloy steel slide with Nitridox Pro Black finish. Though remarkably similar in size to the popular SR9c, the SR40c's custom slide design reduces recoil and slide velocity, making it more comfortable to shoot than many of its competitors. Its raked-forward front sight allows for easy removal from the holster and the rear sight is windage and elevation adjustable while the front sight is windage adjustable. Other features include an integral accessory rail, retraction grooves, an ambidextrous thumb safety and d-shaped magazine release, and a reverse backstrap.

I am thinking of selling mine, and sijce it is far from stock it needs a special home to go to. It is one of the original import square backs (can use a myriad of basic AK stocks as opposed to the FSF that limits that). Wood crap has been removed and replaced with a Bonesteel left side folder Galil style ($160), the basic grip is replaced with a Magpul AK grip ($20), the plastic handguard was replaced with a Chaos Quad rail ($160) and has an aluminum Spiked VFG on it with storage ($40), the thread protector was tossed and it now wears a Chaos Warthog muzzle break ($100) and to top it all off it also has a Chaos Porkypine on the muzzle ($400). Also comes with five SGM 10 round mag parts kits and three factory 5 rounders, totaling 8 mags ($350)

So all in all im in on the gun about $2300. I would like to get $1500, which includes the legal transfer at a FFL per state law. 

For any not familiar with the VEPR series of AK variants it is the premier 3 gun shotgun in Europe and while they look similar to a Saiga, that is all they share. It has a heavy RPK receiver, autoadjusting gas block and actually cycles bird shot reliably as well as high brass."

It has a near perfect German MG3 barrel and feeds/cycles excellently. Has the correct MG3 feed tray and top cover so it feeds standard NATO links (i.e. M60 etc). It is very well built and a blast to shoot. Comes with a standard Bundeswehr AA tripod,the wood transit case (requires stock removal-easy) an assault drum and 100 links. This is one of the most reliable machine gun designs in the world and still in use with the German military. This weapon can be adapted to use 8mm ammo but you would need a barrel, feed try and topcover. Not hard to change over but 7.62 is far easier to find these days than 8mm. I did not bother to make the safety functioning on this one as its pretty much a non issue on a belt fed range weapon. It has its original finish. I prefer to show these as they are, no surprises. It looks very good as it is but can be easily duracoated if you wish. Personal checks must be held to clear. In addition to the listed payments I can accept bank transfers to my USAA Account.5300 Alaska and Hawaii will be extra, enquire before you bid. This will ship in several packages. I have the original shipping carton for the tripod. Update: I will substitute the desireable Lafette ground tripod for the AA one if you so desire. This one is in good shape, Bundeswher issue and has the periscope optic. Excellent for defensive positions lol. These tripods have gotten to be very hard to find."

I am selling my like new Arsenal AK in 5.45, comes with one polymer mag (surplus steel reinforced) full of surplus FMJ, This gun is practically brand new, I puchased it as an impulse buy, brand new from Atlantic Firearms a few months ago. an about 150 rounds through it, runs smooth as butter with almost no recoil, like shooting a .22. I've put in a recoil buffer as well as a rubber buttpad. I have also wrapped the stock in 8 strand 550lb paracord. The proper milspec stuff, not the commercial crap. Stock still folds up nicely. This model has a side rail and a chrome lined barrel and piston.  Mag releases are fast and easy wih the extended mag release. Even with rapid fire its easy to get all 30 rounds on a silhouette at 100 yards. 


If you are trading an AK-47, I have extra mags and 8-900 rounds of 5.45 I can add in for any ammo and mags you may have.

Looking for cash but I would trade for a century AK-47/74+cash, or a sub-2000 in .40 that takes glock mags plus cash. Open to partial gun trades+ cash or multi gun trades. Unique and interesting firearms are an interest."

Witness Pavona Polymer Compact
By Tanfolgio For the discerning female shooter who appreciates Italian design and craftsmanship. The new WITNESS PAVONA POLYMER PISTOL is compact, easy to load, easy to control and enjoyable to use. From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use. The new WITNESS PAVONA is beautifully designed, elegantly packaged and sparkles when you hold it; a sophisticated pistol for the woman that desires everything.

The upside is that I got a sleeping bag system that I lived in for 8 years in the Army with three deployments and endless camping, hiking and hunting trips. The downside is that for the best price possible I had to buy an entire crate of the things. Anyways each set has been inspected inside and out for damage, they're all fantastic and lightly used (and I was issued a well used one so I know the difference) these things are super comfy and military durable. 

Each comes with a stuff sack and three bags. 1 waterproof goretex bivvy bag with woodland camo, 1 inclimate weather bag (patrol bag), and 1 heavy winter bag. Each bag has heavy duty zippers on the inside and out, and snaps to allow venting if it's too warm zipped up. The sleeping bags also have built in hoods with bungee tensioners. 

I've got extensive use out of all bags in varying climates around the world. At 6'3"" and 250lbs I've never had trouble getting comfy, even sleeping in my armor and boots with my m4.

Don't roll the dice on getting a Chinese clone on eBay, or a worn out spank tank from a surplus shop for 400 bucks. This stuff was clearly issued to pogues who never used because they never went to the field or deployed.

Don't want to make the investment just to build one or two?   Intimidated by the task at hand?  I can help you out!

For $50, you get my guidance and the use of a full size DRO'd 3 HP Lagun vertical knee mill, along with the correct cutters.  Yes, you have to operate the machine; I can't legally finish the lower for you.  But I will walk you through the process so that your project turns into a rifle with a professional finish in the fire control pocket instead of a paperweight.

Expect to spend about 60-90 minutes completing your 80% lower on my machines with my help.  This is not one of those CNC operations where you just clamp the lower in a fixture and push a button (which ATF has frowned upon). This is a manual mill with digital scales.  I have worked up a cheat sheet that accounts for cutter radius; you won't need to do any math, it's basically color by numbers.

Just to reiterate for the legal eagles: You are not paying me to finish your lower receiver; you are paying to rent my time and equipment.

Yes, you have to come here.  This mill weighs 3,600 pounds and requires 3 phase or phase converted power.  I cannot bring the machine to you, not even for extra cash."

Danish Military contract ammo for use by all NATO countries, similar to Federal Lake City M855 Green Tip. SS109 is the international code given to M855 mil-spec ammo made outside the USA .

As with LC M855, this ammo has annealed case necks, necks & primers are both sealed, primers are also staked & necks crimped per mil spec. They also have the *NATO CROSS* head stamp to verify mil-spec quality compliance.

This is accurate compared to other SS109/M855 & ranks among the better lots of Lake City M855 ammo & possibly the best of foreign manufactured SS109.

These come packaged in plain white boxes of 50 rounds each. Each 50 rounds is loaded on 10 round plastic stripped clips sealed in air & water tight plastic sleeves, each 10rd stripper clip is separate airtight into 5 individual perforated sections so you can open part of a package & still maintain the long term storage of the ammo on the other on stripper clips. All 750 rounds are in 15 boxes of 50 rounds, in a plain white box sealed with packing tape as I received it from Ammoman's website in 2013. Head stamps are years 2010-2012. I also have some opened boxes still sealed in the plastic if you want a full 1000 rounds, just let me know.

This is perfect ammo for long term storage to put back for a rainy day. As it's already sealed in airtight plastic (as well as the standard Mil-spec primer & case neck sealant) all you need to do is put it into a metal or sturdy plastic ammo box in a stable environment that's relatively cool. Storing in this method it should last for generations if needed.


$325 - for 750 rounds in sealed case (as shipped from distributor)
$400 - for all 1000 rounds (sealed box of 750 plus 5 x 50 round boxes)

When Taurus made the first PT-92 in 1980, they didn’t copy or reverse-engineer the Beretta Model 92F as is sometimes believed. Instead, they bought Beretta’s entire Brazilian factory in Sao Paulo with its machinery, parts and plans. They even kept Beretta’s trained workers at their stations. 

Taurus has specially designed a drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. They’ve also included a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA de-cocking lever. With the 3 dot fixed combat sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.

In all aspects of its fit and machining, the Taurus is every bit as good as the much costlier Beretta Model 92FS it’s patterned after. The Taurus’ metal finish is smooth and even. And Taurus uses a stainless-steel guide rod rather than the Beretta’s plastic rod.

I suppose if you just want one of these long guns we might be able to make a deal but I'm not interested in trading just the pistol as I need the room.  Also contact me if you have a SCAR 17 but don't want to trade as I could probably sell a couple of these fairly quickly.  Only interested in a rifle in near new condition.  I don't care if it has 100 or 2000 rounds down the pipe as long is it has been well maintained.  Not interested in the SCAR 16 just the 17.  Color is unimportant.  My guns are all in like new condition and clean.  Here is the list. I'm not going to get into details because if you are reading this you can google.

From what I know, it has a single non-selective trigger, no rib, and an octagon mono-block. There are roman numerals XVII, from my research it was made in 1959. Model #s.55. Both right and left sides of the receiver are marked with: Pietro Beretta, founed in 1680, Made in Italy, Silver Snipe 12 Gauge, and an imprint of 3 arrows in a circle and markings around it. I believe the gun is eligible for C&R status, but does not look aged. There are some scratches on the top of the barrel, but the camera flash made them appear a lot worse than they are. They mostly look black and blend in, you almost have to be looking for them. Other than that, the bottom barrel has some VERY light pitting. I tried taking some pics but they didn't turn out clear.

I purchased it to carry instead of a 1911 but since getting it I've failed to ""get used to it"" and constantly find myself wishing for the familiarity of the 1911 grip and balance.
I've put exactly 100 rounds through it with flawless performance.
It comes with all the standard accessories S&W includes with these pistols.
I purchased the Apex Tactical Aluminum Trigger system but never got around to installing it. I paid full retail price of $185 for it and it's still in the packing it came in.
I also will be including the Compact Minotaur holster with the purchase, which retails for $100.
Please contact for questions, to make an offer, or more pictures.

HKSpecialtystore.com is simply one example...  search around for legit sellers and find great deals this Holiday season. Oh yea... I've been buying 22lr for about 5 cents per round shipped to my door... not the 10 cent plus found here.
try Slickguns.com to see what real deals are like!
I am not against this site here... I find some good honest deals from honest sellers... but there are too many trolls, private and stores posting here raping people in my mind... 
Happy Holidays* Shop wisely and save!"
