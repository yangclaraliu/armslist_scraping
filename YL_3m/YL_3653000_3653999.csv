Sort of... What we have here is a Fabrique Nationale d'Herstal Browning 1903 pattern modified to the specifications of the Swedish military for adoption in 1907 as their primary service pistol as the M1907. These guns were made by FN and imported to Sweden until the FN factory was captured by Germans during the Great War. After that Husqvarna began production and eventually produced them for Columbia and other countries after the end of WW1.

This great little gun served with distinction up until the adoption of the Lahti in the 1940's. Once out of field use, they were still preferred by police and officers due to their compact dimensions and great handling. They were also used by several European, Middle Eastern and South American countries as well as the Russian and Ottoman Empires! If you like unusual guns with a storied history, this one is for you.

This gun is in great shape considering its age. Finish is very good at around 92-95%, bore is good and still shoots great. These are hugely overbuilt by todays standards for .380 so I would have no worries shooting +p or defensive ammo out of it. Best of all, you are probably the only person at the range with one! Needless to say these don't pop up every day so don't let this one pass you by.

The match series is hand fitted from the Rock Island custom shop, so I really wanted to compare it to my S&W PC1911. It was really close in groups and I am sure it would be about the same if I was more accustomed to the grip (VZ grips are a little more aggressive than I am used to). Both guns shoot better than I do. There is a very small scuff on the right side just below the hammer, you can see it in the photo, this is where the original ambi safety was installed. If you put the stock safety back on, you can't see it, but it's totally cosmetic. You can't even feel it if you try.

The guy I got it from had done a lot of upgrades:

Match grade barrel - factory 
Action tuned by gunsmith
Stainless skeleton hammer (Ed Brown)
Stainless barrel bushing (Ed Brown)
Stainless grip safety (Ed Brown)
Stainless 3-hole competition trigger (Ed Brown)
Sear spring (Ed Brown)
Recoil spring (Wilson Combat)
Blued thumb safety (Colt)
Anodized black checkered MSH VZ grips

Still have all the original parts, plus all the Ed Brown packages from the upgrades and receipt from the gunsmith that did the work.

I would prefer a trade, but would take $750 cash. 

I am looking for: 

- Glock 26 Gen 4
- I would consider just about any Sig in 9mm, send me an offer.
- if you have something else I will consider it, just lean towards the items listed, so don't be offended if I say no.

More than 100 years ago, the Colt 1911 was chosen as the official sidearm for America’s Armed Forces. Today, a Colt 1911 is once again proudly serving at the side of our country’s military. After a rigorous selection process, the United States Marine Corps selected the Colt Rail Gun as their Close Quarters Battle Pistol (CQBP). This marks the first time since the end of World War II that a Colt 1911 is being shipped to the United States Government.

To honor the brave men and women of this important staple of America’s military might, the Colt CQBP will be made available in limited quantities through the Colt Custom Shop. What makes the CQBP stand out is its Desert Tan Cerakoted Stainless Steel Receiver and Slide, Novak® 3 Dot Night Sights and Flat, Serrated Mainspring Housing with Lanyard Loop. The pistol also features an Enhanced Hammer, Colt Tactical Ambidextrous Safety Lock, and a 5” National Match® Barrel.

The Colt Custom Shop performs hand fitting of critical mating parts and each firearm is test fired by the Custom Shop and supplied with the actual test target.

 I had 1 problem with the ammo I was using and the shell expanded in the barrel.  I took a small cleaning rod down the barrel and the shell popped out. Other than that, I can fire as fast as I want with no issues.

.32 ACP +P Ammo - 75 gr. Hardcast F.N. (1150fps/ M.E. 220 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box

The 32 ACP auto inhabits a valuable and useful place in our society as a defensive cartridge, mostly because of the easily concealable, tiny pistols chambered for it. HOWEVER, because of the very limited size of the cartridge, it is plagued with limited power and therefore most of the existing ammo in 32 ACP suffers from not being reliable as a man-stopper. We've studied and examined nearly all available 32 ammo and find it wanting as a reliable means of self defense, especially against a large, drugged up/pain free, determined attacker.

Here's the problem. The current 32 ACP frangible ammo delivers a large amount of surface trauma, but lacks sufficient penetration. For example, if you shot me or another sane man in the face, with modern, frangible 32 ACP ammo, it would blow off a big portion of my cheek. I would undoubtedly fall to the ground in shock and pain, but I would be very much alive and functional if I could get past the pain, as that frangible bullet would have stopped somewhere in my face, never making it to my brain. However, if you shot a drugged up maniac in the face with that same frangible bullet and blew half his cheek off, he would keep right on coming because he is insane and is not thinking like you or I. Plus, he is likely pain free and fear free and won't know that part of his cheek is missing and if he did know, he would not care. So, whatever 32 ACP ammo you shoot him in the face with, had better go through his face and blow his brain stem out the back of his head, because only a CNS (central nervous system) hit with a 32 ACP is going to stop him. Likewise, a torso hit to the sternum needs to penetrate deep enough to blow all the way through his spine in order to shut him down instantly. If you fail to shut him down instantly, you and your loved ones are going to have to find a way to survive while you wait for him to bleed out and pass out. The best chance of survival for you and your loved ones, is to shut down the attacker instantly. So, we've designed this 32 ACP+P load to keep you and yours alive under the worst of scenarios.

This 32 ACP+P ammo will better all American made 32 ACP+P ammo by 110 fps to 150 fps with a heavier bullet than any other American made 32 ACP ammo.

Item 30A/20 is a 75gr. HARD cast bullet with a flat nose. It is traveling over 1,000 fps out of my 3.4 inch Beretta Mod. 70. We've used a flash suppressed powder so that you won't be blinded by your own gunfire in the dark. This is significant as well over 90% of all civilian shootings in America occur in low light when the criminal element is out and about. Also, this flat nosed, nonexpanding, hard cast, bullet will penetrate deeply and will do much more damage than the typical round nosed FMJ bullet. Round nosed bullets tend to slip and slide through living tissue, doing little damage as opposed to a flat nosed bullet. The flat nose not only wounds much more than a round nosed bullet, but it actually keeps the penetration straight and thus deeper. Notice the below velocities from my personal 32 ACP pistols. These are real world guns and thus the speeds are realistic and not the exaggerated speeds you'll see produced from laboratory test barrels. What you see with Buffalo Bore Ammo advertising, is truly what you get in the ""real world"" where it matters. You can expect 20+ inches of straight line penetration in flesh and bone with this load. If you are worried about over-penetration with this load, DON'T! You chose to carry a tiny under-powered 32 ACP pistol and the trade off is that now you are going to have to stay alive using this pistol and over-penetration will be the least of your worries if you end up needing this gun to save yourself or your family.

A. Berretta Mod. 70, 3 inch bbl.- 1001 fps

B. Kel Tek, 2.5 inch bbl - 910 fps

C. Seecamp, 2 inch bbl. - 856 fps

The above bullet speeds are 110 fps to 150 fps faster than the Winchester 71 gr. FMJ ammo on the American market. Not only is our bullet heavier than any other American made 32 ACP ammo, but it is moving about 15% to 20% faster - with that heavier bullet!
Feeding and function was flawless in the three test pistols listed above."

If you have a rifle in the closet or hiding under the bed then this is what you need.  It is a very secure gun locker with anti-bolt cutter guard and it bolts directly to the concrete via concrete anchors.  When it is bolted to the concrete you cannot take it, break it nor pry it open.   I made one for myself and store my Remington and AR in it.   Someone actually broke into my house and attempted to steal my guns.   However, they could not get into it and ended up leaving with some tools instead.     It is made out of steel and has one removable shelf.  I can set the anchors (in concrete) for a little more.   Thanks for looking. Feel free to ask questions."

Everything pictured is included, there's quite a bit of fatwood, fatwood shavings, dust, etc. Magnesium shavings, rods, etc. Ferocerium fire steels in various sizes, easily over a hundred rods. And half as many magnesium rods, squares, etc.The idea at the time was to create little fire starting kits to give out / sell at various events, keep some for preps, etc. 

There are 10 + rolls of jute cord, some frayed, petroleum jelly and wax to coat it. For anyone who's made their own accelerants, these will make sense. In places where it's sometimes difficult to find dry tinder (the NW) having premade accelerants greatly increases your chance of success with fire, and they burn longer than tinder would. 

All of the Pre prepared magnesium, fatwood shavings, dust, etc is stored in sealed tins or plastic containers in preparation. The idea was to include some of each in fire starting kits.

Some of what is included was at various stages of completion as you can see from the pictures and while I know the cost of everything it's incredibly difficult to price.

I prefer trades, open to offers of hunting, fishing, outdoors gear, ammo in .40, other survival, knives, prep oriented gear, etc. It would be perfect  for a scout troop as a project, or prep group. If i cant find a trade and anyone has a troop in mind I'll likely just donate it.

This is NOT a Spanish built Interarms import, it was built in the U.S.A. By Interarms themselves. It is a blued barrel and cylinder  with a case hardened frame and is similar to a Ruger Blackhawk in size. Engraving on the bottom of the grip frame reads 'We the People 1776-1976'. It Includes both the standard wood grips and the rare, hard to find, Pachmeyr rubber grips. (The Pachmyer grips sell for $75 to $100 a set used on eBay.) Also included is a new in box set of Redfield scope mounts and a small box of Hornady ammunition. (gun has NOT been drilled for the scope mount.) Tight, smooth shooting gun that is heavy enough that the recoil of 44 magnum ammo is reasonable and 44 special recoil is no worse than a 9mm.  It just doesn't get shot much due to me having several other pistols, including another 44 magnum.

*I appreciate the notes I have gotten from four or five people telling me that my gun would sell better if I reblued the frame. The thing is that the frame on this gun is not blued. It is color case hardened. That is the original finish for this gun, just like it was on the Colt SAA that this gun was patterned after. *

Great gun for the field or if you are looking to start shotgunning and are not looking to break the bank."

Factory part # PC9105LP The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class. TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide.

These are all manufactured in-house at Adams Arms. The lower receiver is 7075 aluminum, much higher quality than your standard 6062 lower. They are a mid-length gas system, so will cycle more reliably than a carbine-length system. Has a heavy barrel, which will help tremendously with accuracy. The piston system has 4 settings - normal (for just normal shooting), dirty (for extreme conditions or if you don't clean the rifle for many thousand rounds), off (rifle becomes a single shot, and won't eject any brass) and suppressor (for reliable cycling with a silencer). Comes with box, manual, warranty card and a 30 round magazine. We'll be happy to ship this to your FFL."

Utilizing a removable, serialized sub-chassis the Nano pistol can be easily modified with replaceable grip frames and is simple to disassemble and maintain. Ease of use and concealment were key drivers in the development of the Nano. The Nano’s extremely low profile, snag free design makes it easy to carry and draw from concealment. To accommodate right or left-handed use, the Nano’s magazine release button can be easily reversed. The light, durable, frame employs modern thermoplastic technology through the use of fiberglass reinforced technopolymer. The Nano’s sights are user adjustable with a 1.3mm hexwrench and your fingers. This allows anyone to adjust their sights without the assistance of a gunsmith. Modular structure, ergonomics and ease of use make the Beretta Nano the ideal firearm for concealed carry. Made in The U.S.A.

This is not your typical consumer grade M4/AR15 platform or accessories. It meets Military specifications all the way around, using only high end parts and components as you are about to see.

I present to you the Daniel Defense DDM4 V5 M4 Carbine Mil-Spec Rifle. Below is a link giving the specifics of this same rifle for sale (except the stock). The rifle is 100% factory installed, not a ""parts gun"". Daniel Defense is widely considered the premier MIL SPEC AR15/M4 platforms being made. It is one sexy and effective piece of art...

https://danieldefense.com/firearms/mid-length/daniel-defense-m4-carbine-v5.html

I purchased and added on to this rifle after doing many months of research on creating the ""perfect weapon system"" for any defensive/offensive situation in virtually any scenario that would come up. ONLY reason I am selling is because I am saving up for a full auto, so my baby has to go...

As part of building this weapon system, I chose the:

-Daniel Defense M4 Carbine because it kept popping up in list after list of the ""best of the best"" because of its durability, attention to detail/quality, and adherence to Military Specifications/tolerances. Watch this video on YouTube and you'll see why the DDM4 is the best M4/AR15 on the market from a durability standpoint http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kX0nCEh5E

-Burris MTAC Ballistic CQ/LR (Close Quarter/Long Range) tactical optic because it offers both Close Quarters and Medium/Long Range capabilities in the same platform and the same time. Using ""true 1x"" it allows for both eyes open use (just like a red dot...AimPoint for example), and up to 4x magnification with built in 5.56 BDC reticles for effective engagements up to 600 yards. Just zero for 100 yards (which it already is) and your ready to go out to 600 yards using the built in BDC dots.

As part of building this weapon system, I chose the:

-Daniel Defense M4 Carbine because it kept popping up in list after list of the ""best of the best"" because of its durability, attention to detail/quality, and adherence to Military Specifications/tolerances. Watch this video on YouTube and you'll see why the DDM4 is the best M4/AR15 on the market from a durability standpoint http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kX0nCEh5E

-Burris MTAC Ballistic CQ/LR (Close Quarter/Long Range) tactical optic because it offers both Close Quarters and Medium/Long Range capabilities in the same platform and the same time. Using ""true 1x"" it allows for both eyes open use (just like a red dot...AimPoint for example), and up to 4x magnification with built in 5.56 BDC reticles for effective engagements up to 600 yards. Just zero for 100 yards (which it already is) and your ready to go out to 600 yards using the built in BDC dots. It is extremely clear, has illuminated reticle (which work even if the battery dies), weather and shock proof, with a lifetime warranty. It is just like having both a Red Dot and a Tactical magnified scope in one, giving you the best of both worlds in one small, lightweight package.

http://www.missionknives.com/shop/index.php?dispatch=products.view&product_id=20

The MPK12-Ti is a compact, heavy-duty, light-weight, non-magnetic titanium knife designed to the demanding requirements of the Navy SEALs and Explosive Ordnance Departments.  The MPK12-Ti is immune to rust, corrosion, salt water and other chemical attacks.  It has been proven to be the “World Toughest Knife” by 20 years of vigorous SOCOM military usage without a single report of a broken MPK in the field and has earned its own NSN number (1386-01-417-1263).  Our MPK models include the famous dual lock system of snap and rubber D-ring on a custom Hytrel sheath designed to be worn on the leg or thigh. This version of the MPK is made with our special blend of titanium, which has very superior wear resistance and is “thru-hardened” to Rockwell C 47, while still maintaining its flexibility. Field sharpening of the MPK is easy, the cutting edge retention is superior and the V-ground blade is not susceptible to cracking or chipping.  The handle material is Hytrel/Kevlar mixture, injection molded onto a full tang which prevents handle separation even when subjected to extreme stress.  The MPK12-Ti is approximately 12” in length, .250” thick, partially serrated or plain with handle colors in standard black or high visibility orange for Coast Guard or other underwater use. Use it, abuse it, and put it away wet or dirty, this knife will last for generations."
