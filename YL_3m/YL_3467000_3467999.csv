It is an old German rifle made in 1896, the guy I bought it from did a little grinding to the back so he could mount a scope on it.

It is also missing the peep out of the flip up sight, I never looked but I'm sure you could find a replacement for it.

I am only interested in selling/trading ONE of the rifles, not both. 

1) The top rifle is a Cugir M+M M10-762 with vertical foregrip and OD green rail covers. Last time I took her out was back in June for Outbreak Omega 6. Shot like a dream as she always has. Cleaned, lubed, and placed back in the safe. 

Price = $650

2) The bottom rifle is a Chinese Mak-90. I took this in as a trade almost a year ago and haven't even fired a round through it. Yes, that is sad/pathetic. Its been a safe queen but has cleaned and lubricated on a regular basis.  This is not a $550 WASR!

Price = $850

Why am I trading one of these rifles? In a nutshell, I own several AK's and recently got the itch to have something else. Thats it. Why trade these rather than my others? My others have been personal-project guns that have personal value to me. These two, while great rifles, are just typical AK's that I don't necessarily mind trading. AK trade will come with 2 30-rd mags. 

If the right deal doesn't come along, I have no issues keeping these rifles as I  truly love Kalashnikov's design. Thus, am in no hurry to make a deal. Just seeing whats out there. 

Conditions of trade:
1) You must have current PTP or PTC and be willing to present it at the time of trade. I have a mine and will do the same.
2) Must be willing to complete a Bill of Sale. I will make a copy for you and a copy for me.
3) Must be a current MN resident.
4) Must be 21 years of age.
5) FTF transactions only. Prefer to stay around the Mankato area but can negotiate."

Great trigger on this carry gun. Very thin width similar to width of the M&P Shield. Much more ergonomic than the Shield because of the reduced trigger guard size, giving more room for the handle. I have medium sized hands and can easily get all my fingers on the handle. I've put about 500-600 rounds through it at the range with no problems.

The CZ P-07 Duty is the next generation of the CZ handgun family. The Duty features the ergonomics and accuracy of the CZ 75 with a totally new trigger system. The new Omega trigger system simplifies the CZ 75 trigger system, uses fewer parts and improves the trigger pull. In addition, it allows users to choose between using the handgun with a decocking lever(installed) or a manual safety (included) by a simple parts change. The polymer frame design of the Duty and a new sleek slide profile (fully machined from bar stock) reduce weight, making the P-07 Duty a great choice for concealed carry.

It was the first polymer-framed pistol, 12 years before the Glock 17. The VP70 uses a spring-loaded striker like a Glock, instead of a conventional firing pin. It is double action only so the trigger pull is relatively heavy. In lieu of a blade front sight, the VP70 uses a polished ramp with a central notch in the middle to provide the illusion of a dark front post. The VP70 does have a manual safety. It is the circular button located immediately behind the trigger and is a common cross-block safety. The ""Z"" designates the civilian variant is a semiautomatic only version. The VP70 was produced from 1970 until 1989. Four hundred VP-70 Z pistols were made chambered in 9×21mm IMI; these samples were made primarily for the civilian market of Italy, where the use of the 9×19mm Para is a sole privilege of military and law enforcement agencies. 
One of the two pistols is chambered in 9x19mm Para and the other is chambered in 9x21mm. For the pistols one comes with two magazines and the other comes with three. I believe all are 21 round magazines. The 9x19mm comes in a 1970’s pristine box that is still dark grey, magazine loader tool, has the original target from the factory in a wax package and the original operation manual. The 9x21mm comes in lighter grey more warn box that is still strong just lighter than the other. Included with this is 500 rounds of 9x21mm ammunition.

It was only mounted for a short time so it's in excellent condition. The rings are 30mm. I will ship 2 day priority mail for $6.00. If shipping, payment by USPS Money Order will be required.

The LT104 places the centerline of the optic 1.5"" above the top of the rail for optimum cheek weld with a variety of AR-platform rifles. The cantilever positions the scope out front over the handguard, eliminating the need to span from the receiver to the handguard. The cantilever also allows the shooter to obtain proper eye relief.

The popularity of the SPR series of mounts is partially due to the innovative backbone that connects the split vertical rings. This design provides a more robust platform for the optics, increases repeatability, and eliminates the need for time-consuming lapping. The rings are precision-machined with the tightest tolerances, and feature threaded steel inserts, built to withstand a lifetime of abuse.

Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and anodized. The locking LaRue Speed Levers provide outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed.

Assembly and adjustment only takes a few minutes, then off to the range."

Manufacturer, of course, is O.F. Mossberg & Sons of New Haven, CT. Construction is steel barrel, bolt, and internal parts with lightweight alloy receiver and polymer trigger group housing. Capacity is 8 + 1 on 2 3/4 inch shells, or 7 + 1 on 3 inch magnums. Barrel is 20 inch Police Cylinder with perforated Trench Gun type heat shield. Front sight is Hex based solid brass, threaded into place. Buttstock and forend are traditional serrated Corncob configuration forend with paneled-grip black buttstock that has a 1 inch smooth rubber recoil pad. Both pieces are high impact polymer. Metal is blue steel on the barrel, magazine tube, and double steel slide arms, with black matte anodized finish to the lightweight alloy receiver. Safety, as the photos show, is traditional Mossberg top tang, polymer construction and user-friendly for southpaws. This shotgun is also equipped with a bayonet lug that will accept an M8A1, M16 / M4 Bayonet or similarly equipped accessories. Weight empty is a surprisingly light 6 7/8 pounds. Magazine capacity is 8 + 1 on 2 3/4 inch shells, and 7+1 on 3 inch shells. Current pricing on the 590 is upwards of $700 apiece in our area, and they’re scarce. We’re offering this 590 in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates for only	$ 400.00.

About 1500rds fired. Solid and reliable workhorse carbine. Mild wear from normal use such as scratches and dings. 

20"" DMR is a Loki upper on a forged 80% lower. The lower was one of the first I have done and the cuts are a little rough, however the rifle has run flawlessly. I've put about 500rds through it. I have achieved approximately .75 MOA groups with match ammo, and I'm not that great of a shot. This rifle is very accurate with the right ammo. Barrel is fluted stainless 20"" medium contour 1/8 twist with 5.56mm chamber. Standard BCG. A1 length stock with storage compartment. Hogue pistol grip. BCM Large charging handle. Troy industries 15"" free float rail. Magpul RVG and MBUS. KNS anti rotation pins. Phantom flash hider. Standard trigger group with ""garage"" style tune to lighten the single stage trigger.  Was supposed to be a temporary thing until I could afford a quality trigger, but I haven't upgraded that yet. However,  this trigger has worked fine for me. Occasional light primer strikes on cheap steel case ammo with hard primers. Has fired every quality brass cased round I have fed it. I think I have some spare FCG parts lying around which I will throw in if I can find them. 1.5"" nylon Web sling with quick detach swivel included. The upper was Duracoated OD green and FDE from the factory.  The lower was Gunkoted OD green using bake on enamel from Brownells. Rifle has some wear from normal use. Very unique looking rifle,  always a head turner at the range."

It appears to have some holster wear and a few small scratches on the left side of the grip, but besides that its in great shape, no scratches on the frame itself that I can see. The proof markings under the barrel indicate that she(yes, its a she)was made in 1991.

I have personally put around 500 rounds thru her with zero malfunctions. I ran every cheap type of ammo I could find and had zero issues. Shes a great shooter and very smooth.

I’m also getting rocked by back Tax’s currently so my previous plans for a new build are out the window and now I get to sell this to fund our lovely Gov. Lucky me.
Anyways about the gun.
I did a more recent assessment on how many shots this rifle has seen – 280 rounds instead of my previous guess of between 300-400. I know this because I still have the remaining 140 rounds left over from the 420 bullets originally purchased.
The rifle it’s in near new condition, I am the original owner and purchased it November of 2013. It has been to the range 4 times in its short life, never hunted, just sat in its case. Always babied and cleaned after each time at the range.
Break in procedure was followed to the T and it runs and shoots flawlessly. It out performs me, a novice/intermediate shooter and I’ve still been able to achieve sub moa groups with 193 ball ammo.
I should say that the rifle has actually 285 rounds through it, a buddy let me try out some of his 53 gr hand loads and my group tightened up quite a bit. (5 holes at a Little over .6″ moa at 100 yards) I’ve found every rifle has it’s own special round it loves, but Im impressed with its accuracy even with the cheaper 193 55 grainers.
The rifle retails for about $1150-1200, but because of my circumstance I’m willing to let it go for $800. Any one who knows anything about rock river arms knows this is a steal.
That includes rifle, original RRA hard case and all original paperwork.
If you are adamant about wanting the scope and mount I would be willing to sell those in this package for a total of $1050.
Nikon p223 4-12×40 BDC 600 scope retails for $250 (purchased in February/2014)
Burris P.E.P.R. Mounts retails for$ 90 ( also purchased in feb/2014)
I Will include both original scope caps and my flip open scope caps plus one 30 round pmag
This package is worth well over 1500 before Tax’s but because of my situation I need to get rid of some things and I just can’t justify having this rifle sitting around. This is your chance to own a RRA 3/4″ moa guaranteed rifle for a fraction of its cost.
I will add a pic from RRA’s website so you can see all of its details completely. This would make for an excellent predator/ coyote gun, I just never had the time for it.
Sum up
Complete rifle, original RRA BLACK hard case, all original paperwork $800
Or
Complete rifle, original RRA BLACK hard case, original paperwork, scope, mount, flip scope lens covers, and one 30 round p mag for $1050
PS I’m keeping the bipod, it’s now on my 22 mag – the gov can’t make me give up everything I’ve got!!
Shoot me a text or email, that will be my best way of responding to you the quickest.
If you need more pics shoot me an email and I will get those out to you.

It does have the manual and sling even though it is not pictured anywhere. Only has two blemishes, one compression dent on the underside of the hand guard from the fold stock which is normal and one on the left bottom side of the site post were the bluing was rubbed from riding in the box."

It is new unfired direct from the factory. This is serious fire power.

From the factory: The KSG is our first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1″ overall length and an 18.5″ cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3″ shells each, for a total capacity of 6 6 1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4″ shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil."

It is new unfired direct from the factory. This is serious fire power.

From the factory: The KSG is our first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape and design are similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9lbs and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1″ overall length and an 18.5″ cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 6 rounds of 12 gage 3″ shells each, for a total capacity of 6 6 1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4″ shells). The simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. A cross bolt style safety blocks the sear, and the pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard. The pump includes an under Picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, or a light or laser. The included top Picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil."

Was going to build this one but I just have too much going on with other projects right now so I'm looking to see if anyone else has need for it now.They retail for $114 complete online from NFA and so after all the fees and expenses you end up spending just a little over $140 if I remember correctly.

Rifle Dynamics Grey Moly Resin finish and Rifle Dynamic enhanced rear sight. With a East German stock set, bayonet and type 84 flash hider (also Sniper Grey Moly Resin). This gun is all parts matching with original barrel which are getting harder to find. The owner then sent it off to Jim Fuller of Rifle Dynamics after Mark Graham built it for his Moly finish and enhanced rear sight. I liked this gun because it has a combination of the best ""hard use "" AK builders on the market hands down. The gun is in very good condition with a few marks here and there but over all striking and handsome. It’s action is fantastic, the safety has perfect fit and function. The trigger is the best of any AK I have owned and other’s have remarked on it as well. I cannot give a complete accurate round count though from what the last owner said likely around 2k. Though I personally don’t worry much with semi auto 7.62x39 and barrel life due to the lower velocity of the round over a 5.56 chamber gun. So this gun has years and years of use left in it. This is my favorite AK and situation is forcing its sale. The folding stock has paracord wrapped on it for greater comfort and a semi cheek weld. I am including one Tula excellent condition bakelite magazine with this gun. Please ask any questions you may have and will do my best to answer. If you need any additional photos please do not hesitate to ask. Happy Bidding!! Nick ***PLEASE DO NOT BID IF YOU CANNOT OWN THIS RIFLE IN YOUR LOCAL.

The owner then sent it off to Jim Fuller of Rifle Dynamics after Mark Graham built it for his Moly finish and enhanced rear sight. I liked this gun because it has a combination of the best ""hard use "" AK builders on the market hands down. The gun is in very good condition with a few marks here and there but over all striking and handsome. It’s action is fantastic, the safety has perfect fit and function. The trigger is the best of any AK I have owned and other’s have remarked on it as well. I cannot give a complete accurate round count though from what the last owner said likely around 2k. Though I personally don’t worry much with semi auto 7.62x39 and barrel life due to the lower velocity of the round over a 5.56 chamber gun. So this gun has years and years of use left in it. This is my favorite AK and situation is forcing its sale. The folding stock has paracord wrapped on it for greater comfort and a semi cheek weld.
