This weapon is used but in Excellent condition, Feels tight and does not rattle like a heavily used gun would. Included with this weapon is 1 10 round magazine and 1 high capacity 22 round mag. This can be a great addition to any collection.
The SUB-2000 is a self-loading carbine for pistol cartridges. Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is available in 9 mm Luger or .40 S&W calibers. The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE Premium 35 Whelen Supercharged 225 gr. TSX (2800 fps) - 20 Round Box








Again, as per customer request, Buffalo Bore has developed two new 35 Whelen loads. Item 42A features a Sierra 225gr. SPTZ-BT bullet @ 2705 fps out of my Remington 700. (24 inch bbl)  At the expected impact velocities, this bullet will mushroom readily, but hold together on large game like bull elk. We recommend this load for use on smallish big game (like whitetail deer) through Yukon Moose and Bison. However, on very tough (other than broadside) angling shots on large big game, we recommend the use of our item 42B, which features a 225gr. Barnes TSX bullet @ 2654 fps out of the same rifle. The TSX load is a bit slower than the Sierra load because the long-for-weight all copper TSX uses up more case/powder capacity than the shorter Sierra bullet of the same weight.

If you desire the deepest possible penetration from an expanding bullet in 35 Whelen, the 225gr. Barnes TSX bullet delivers. It will out penetrate a 250gr. typical premium partition bullet, but gives the advantage of higher velocity, flatter trajectory and reduced recoil of the lighter 225gr. bullet. You can use this TSX load for bad angle (quartering or going straight away) shots on the largest North American big game.

This ammo is designed to be the highest quality, most powerful/versatile, 35 Whelen ammo, in the world. It exhibits sub MOA accuracy in our test rifle."

Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). 


The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

This rifle would be worth what I’m asking all by itself, but it also comes with over $300 worth of upgrades, all in matching OD green:

-	Israeli-made M4S1 modular handguard from CAA (supplier for the Israeli Defense Forces), with 4 modular Picatinny rail sections and integrated QD sling sockets - $90 value
-	GripPod vertical foregrip with quick-deploy bipod legs - $35 value

This M6X is in excellent condition, VERY bright light and laser. Long throw. I Shot maybe 150 rounds through the rifle with it mounted (it was protected by a can), there is NO fouling on the light. It's waterproof to 20m. Light has a LED head, rail grabber attachment and long gun back plate. I compared it to an x400 last night and the beam is really nice, it's wider with no visible ""rings"", as opposed to the surefire which was more of a spot light with very faint outer ring. so more of a spot than a flood. For room clearing the Insight wins, and once you add the backplate and pressure switch to an x400 you're almost 2x as expensive. This is military grade equipment.

******************************************

Description: 
 The Micro Might handgun is a five shot, fixed cylinder mini-revolver. It is designed around an historical and simple single action mechanism. By ""fixed cylinder"" means that the cylinder does not swing out of the frame for loading and unloading. Removal of the cylinder is accomplished by removing the cylinder base pin and taking the cylinder completely out of the frame. By ""single action"" means that the trigger performs only one function: it releases the hammer.
 Ammunition Warning
 Micro Might Inc. produces and sells Micro Might handguns designed and chambered for two different calibers. The intended caliber is noted both on the shipping and storage box and on the barrel of the Micro Might handgun itself. If your revolver is chambered for 22LR, any good quality factory made 22 caliber ammunition in long rifle, long or short may be safely used in the revolver. The revolver will also safely handle high velocity 22 ammunition.
 If your revolver is chambered for 22WMRF ammunition, ONLY USE 22WMRF cartridges. This designation stands for 22 caliber Winchester Magnum Rimfire ammunition. Use of standard 22 caliber ammunition in the 22WMRF revolvers can result in malfunctions and serious injuries.

It is built on a Remington 870.

The nation's leading defender. For a half century the Remington Model 870 has been the pump shotgun of choice for government agencies. With over 10 million produced to date, it remains the standard by which all pump actions are measured. Its dual, non-binding action bars deliver ultra-smooth, reliable cycling. The ultimate pump shotgun, the Model 870 stands the test of time, extreme conditions and duty.
•Non-binding twin action bars provide smoothest/surest pump operation
•Receiver milled from solid block of steel
•3"" chamber accepts all 2 ¾"" and 3"" 12-gauge shells
•Steel-lined/grooved fore-end for a stronger grip
•Breech block locks into barrel extension for strength and consistent head space
•Balanced sear and inertia firing pin prevents discharge unless action is closed and trigger is pulled
•Flexitab feeding system prevents a misfeed from jamming the shotgun
•Cross-bolt safety

The Modifications to the firearm are as follows.

It has a Knoxx Specops stock on it. It is adjustable to fit any person or can accommodate body armor. This is NOT a cheap stock like an ATI. This is meant for serious duty use.

The forend is a Surefire Remington 870 Weaponlight. This light is blindingly bright and great to easily identify anything that goes bump in the night. The forend alone retails for $300 dollars and they rarely come on the used market. It has buttons for continuous light and a pressure pad for momentary light.

The Firearm is coated in Ceracote H baked on finish. It is extremely durable and abrasive and chemical resistant. To have a long gun refinished in this coating runs about $200. The process is very labor intensive but results in the most durable firearm finish available and is well worth the money.

There is a single point sling mount between the stock and receiver for carrying the firearm with a single point sling but there are also mounts included to run a 2 point sling as well.

It has a side saddle on the side of the receiver that can hold 6 shotgun shells. This allows the firearm to have 13 rounds of ammunition carried on it before adding extra with your preferred method of carrying shells.

The magazine extension allows the firearm to have 7 shots including one in the chamber to allow for the most firepower before a reload possible. It functions reliably and is very heavy duty. The magazine spring is extra power to ensure that even under the most demanding conditions, the firearm will always reliably feed a new shell.

All of the internals were upgraded to new extreme duty police parts. This includes heavier springs for the hammer, shell lifter, and trigger sear and upgraded parts that are all machined and not MIM.

The barrel is an 18 inch factory Remington barrel with a cylinder bore. That means that the barrel has the optimal spread for close quarter combat and can fire any ammunition you put in it from birdshot to buckshot and slugs. It is the shortest barrel that can be legally fitted to the firearm. It can handle both 2 3/4"" and 3"" ammunition and has functioned flawlessly with both.

This is the ultimate combat shotgun and it is a shotgun you can trust your life to. I would not hesitate to grab this gun if I was having a home invasion. This shotgun will more than exceed your expectations for a shotgun and is the best that money can buy. All the parts and work for this shotgun total more than $1200."

Original luster intact. Barrel is excellent with the exception of some pitting closer to the hooded sight. About a 3 inch section of pitting. All other bluing and barrel itself is in excellent shape. No other rust or blemishes.  Has original CZ recoil pad at butt. This is a nice example of a .458 Lott.  $850.00 obo.... This gun is priced per recent auction sales"

I have the barrel wrapped with 40 ft. of 550 Paracord and a sling with over 60 ft. of 550 Paracord. This is 22 LR over .410 shotgun in a break open/folding/or take apart format. Stock holds 15 rounds of 22 LR and 4 rounds of .410 2.5"" or 3"" shells. I have made the top of the front sight florescent orange so that it can be seen against a dark target. These rifles are getting very hard to come by and can cost upwards of $1200.00 They make the ultimate bug out / survival gun and when in take apart they only measure 18.5"" long. The earlier versions of this rifle were made by the Czech Republic for Springfield. This is one of the last series made by Springfield USA as the ""SCOUT"" and has a trigger guard. It went out of production in the beginning of this century. It has the two scope mount holes. NOTE: On either side of the metal stock there is some light numbers that look to have been made with a hard graphite pencil by the Previous owner for some reason unbeknownst to me. Some Springfield M6 History: Springfield originally made the M6 for the Air Force B52 crew members in a 22 hornet / .410 with a 14 inch barrel. This is the civilian version of that gun. This is the last version of this design. The safety is on the hammer and there is a removable trigger guard. Both barrels are clean and clear of any imperfections with the 22 rifling clean & crisp. This rifle has been used very little in its lifetime. Rifle and shotgun are very accurate."

This gun is in very good condition with just a few of the normal scuffs and scrapes. Please note that this is the 'A1' version of the model 92, that means that it has the picitiny rail, and the updated recoil springs and buffer assembly. It also comes with 3-17 round magazines which are brand new Beretta factory mags. I always used other mags I had on hand. The pistol comes with all the factory paperwork, owners manual, unopened cleaning kit, the original Beretta case, and cardboard box. The pistol has only had about a hundred rounds fired through it, all without a single failure so it's just broken in. Cash only, no trades please. Due to my work schedule I am not always around, but I will do my best to answer emails/questions etc. ASAP. Thanks!"

Originally designed as a hands-enabling tactical instrument for law enforcement, the Liberator has quickly become the leading choice of rst responders across a huge spectrum of agencies. With its unique hands-free design, First-Light USA Liberators are pressed into service by professionals that require full use of both hands for any number of mission critical applications. The Liberator throws a 150 lumen focused hot spot, and casts a generous peripheral for total situational awareness.

When the illuminating power of the Liberator STT is simply more than what's necessary for a given task, the Liberator STT's Task Light feature is a perfect solution. Conveniently positioned to illuminate your hands with just the right amount of light, the Liberator Task Light provides an additional source of light for hands-intensive tasks - without having to go to your pocket or belt to grab a penlight.

Examining evidence, checking a driver's license, writing in a ticket book and much more - they're all tasks made easier, safer and more convenient through the Liberator STT Task Light. Liberator STT gives you the best of both worlds: the raw power of a 120-Lumen strobing LED, with the convenience of the Task Light when you need it. And all with the flick of a thumb using intuitive, easy-to-operate controls.

IT HAS STEEL FIBER OPTIC FRONT AND REAR SIGHTS.
THIS ONE COMES WITH A HARD CASE, 3 MAGAZINES, ""XD GEAR"" HOLSTER AND MAGAZINE HOLDER, SLIDE LOCK AND GRIP EXTENSION.
SPRINGFIELD IS ALWAYS ON THE CUTTING EDGE WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY, ACCURACY AND DURABILITY, AND THIS GUN IS A FINE EXAMPLE OF THEIR QUALITY.
