I rate bluing at 99%. Stock has one or two tiny idiot dings, very minor. This was kept in amazing condition.  Scope pictured does not go with rifle it is being sold separately pending funds. It comes with the original manual with the matching sticker/serial number from the box. Also it comes with a very nice embossed leather sling with quick clips.  I will leave the mounts and rings with the rifle.   I was told this has not even seen 50 rounds. For those who don't know, these rifles were made by Zastava in Yugoslavia. These were exceptional quality. This is the sporter model without sights. It was born to be scoped. Factory drilled and tapped.  5 rnd capacity w/drop floor plate.  These rifles were built on the Mauser K98 action.  I will not ship, please don't ask.  I will meet within 1 hour of Wilkes-Barre, PA.  Please include a phone number to contact you, otherwise it will be regarded as spam/scam. Thank you for your interest. This rifle won't disappoint."

I put up the max. three pictures but have more upon request.  Only two superficial things, a tiny bit of surface rust formed on part of the barrel ( use 000 steel wool and gun oil to remove, I just don't want to risk it as i have never removed rust before) and I noticed a super tiny indent in the stock on the bottom.  But that is why I'm not asking $1,000+. If you remove the tiny bit of rust you will have a perfect collectors piece.

These pistols are almost never made available for sale and are getting very hard to come by.  You also don’t find them in this condition every day. I’m asking $1250 or best reasonable cash offer.

AS STATED BEFORE THIS IS AN OBO OR TRADE PLUS CASH DEAL. Ideally id like 2500

***UPDATE***20141206 I am willing to swap out the upper receiver for a standard forged PSA upper i have. This will significantly drop my asking price. I will offer the upper with the standard forged upper w/o a CH or Bolt Carrier (you still get match grendel bolt). My asking price for this setup still including all other parts (PRS Stock, ammo, etc.) would be $2000. I have also added trades below.

***UPDATE*** I am not a hard guy to deal with, pls feel free the extend offers or trades plus cash. The worst that will happen is i say no thank you.

I am listing my 6.5 Grendel Upper and other parts to go with it as well as ammo. The lower receiver, lower parts, and pistol grip are not included or for sale what so ever. Pls read the listing in its entirety so you know everything before contacting me pls.

 I will itemize all parts included below:

Cross Hills Technologies XSR 15 Ambi side charging upper receiver w/NiB BCG
AR Stoner 18' Grendel Barrel and Bolt combo
AAC 51T 9/16 24 Flash Hider
JP .750 Adjustable Gas Block
VooDoo Innovations life coat mid length gas tube
Troy 15' alpha rail w/ noveske push button qd sling attachment, and MI qd sling swivel
Harris S-BRM 6-9 Bipod
GGG Bipod rail adapter
Magpul PRS Stock w/ A2 buffer assembly (tube, buffer, spring)
Accushot monopod 3.75 - 4.65
5 round grendel magazine
Burris PEPR 30 mm scope mount

Ammo is as follows: 

Wolf Gold 123 GR SP - 100 rounds
Alexander Arms 123 Lapua Scenar - 180 rounds
Hornady 123 GR AMAX Match - 140 rounds
Hornady 123 GR SST Custom - 320 rounds
This is 740 rounds of ammo that is included with all parts listed above, upper receiver will be assembled if purchased.

As you can see i have spared no expense in building this Grendel, the only reason i am selling is to try to fund a couple suppressors and another build. This is a SUB MOA shooting gun. It no longer has a scope bc i put it on my 700. When there was glass on it i was shooting under 1 inch groups all day with factory ammo. I will not separate anything this is for everything. Pls keep in mind when making offers that there is just under $3,000 worth of stuff here including tax and shipping. This is all you need to start shooting 6.5 Grendel, put all of these parts on your selected lower and start shooting, the only thing missing is a cleaning kit. 

Thanks for looking and reading everything if you did!"

I just never got around to shooting it much since i fell in love with my G23.I have a custom kydex holster by Armiger Solutions in Beachwood. I am looking to trade for a G19. I prefer a Gen 4 but will hear offers of Gen 3. I have 3 mags and all the factory goodies and case. Not interested in anything beat up. Trade offers that seem fair to both parties.

metallic silhouette shooters and those looking for an added level of safety
when outdoors in dangerous game country. Ruger Super Redhawks are available
in standard satin stainless. Handgun hunters can choose from 7.5 or 9.5
inch barrels. The .480 Ruger offers approximately one third more energy
than the powerful .44 Magnum and divides the gap between the .44 Magnum and
.454 Casull. Ruger Super Redhawk revolvers are strong handguns that easily
withstand the stresses imposed by the calibers for which they are chambered."

1) Springfield XDS 45, 3.3 in barrel, I bought this with the recall modification from the factory already completed. It will be sold with the hard case which includes a holster, magazine case, additional grip placement for sizing, 1 5rd magazine and 1 7rd magazine, a lock, red breech plug, and additional front sight night time markers. This pistol also comes with a crimson trace red laser attached (as shown). In addition to the 2 mags in the hard case I will be supplying 6 more 7rd magazines, and 3 more 5rd magazines, for a total of seven 7rd and four 5rd magazines. The four 5rd magazines have extensions that allow a full hand grip. I will also supply 40 personal defense rounds that I will reveal only to the person who buys this pistol. This pistol will also come with a real nice ankle holster as well as a krydex pocket holster, both of which are modified to accept the pistol with the crimson trace laser attached. This pistol has been cleaned and lubed after each firing, meticulously maintained, and looks brand new. Total rounds fired is approximately 250. See all of this in the 1st picture.

2) FDE Karris Arms AR15 Pistol, 5.56 Nato/.223 Rem, 7.5in barrel with a 1:7 twist. M4 feed ramp. The sound deflector/flash director is a Krink which directs both flame and sound forward, not down or sideways. It has a full floating handguard with plenty of picatinney rail surface to use. The Bolt Carrier and Bolt are standard MilSpec, and the gas key is staked to MilSpec as well. The upper is built by Karris Arms. The lower is an Aero precision forged MilSpec 7075 T-6 aluminum lower receiver. The pistol grip is an Ergo, the magazine well grip is a Fab Defense, and the forearm brace is a Sig Sauer SB-15. This AR15 Pistol comes with Promag M247 and M248 front and rear flip up sights (not PTS) and it will come with an EOTECH EXPS 3-4 Holographic Night Vision compatible sight that will come with its own hard case. ($600 sight). This AR15 Pistol has only been test fired to ensure proper feeding, functioning and firing. This AR15 Pistol receives a lot of positive attention anywhere it is fired. I will include the statement from Sig Sauer about the legitimate use of the forearm brace as recognized by BAFTE, and a letter, from BAFTE, that states ""if"" the firer was to shoulder the pistol when firing, that this action does not make the Pistol into a SBR.

I really need to sell both of these and will make the following deal to whomever wants them.............The prices are non-negotiable, no trades, so please contact me if you are serious ""only"" to buy.

Both of these pistols for $1800, cash only. If you wish to purchase separately the XDS 45, as described above, will be $850 and the AR15 Pistol will be $1300 ($900 without the EOTECH).

I bought this gun new a year ago and have only fired it a handful of times.  Awesome little gun, I just never use it and would rather get it into the hands of someone who will.

The gun itself is like new, as mentioned, I’ve only fired it a few times, and never had it in the woods.  It features a 26” barrel, and I’ve outfitted it with a fiber optic sight.

Included are:

-  Two chokes:  Improved Cylinder and Modified
-  Choke tube wrench – will work with 12, 16, and 20 gauge guns
-  Trigger lock (unopened as it was stored in a safe)
-  Soft case (not pictured)
-  11 boxes of shells – various target and game loads: 2 ¾ inch, 6, 7.5 and 8 shot, one box of Winchester Super X waterfowl loads: 3 inch, 2 shot (fired two rounds).  Most boxes are unopened.  A few boxes are half to three quarters full.

I have about $500 into this setup; again, selling because I just don’t shoot it much.  Asking $400 or best offer.  Call, email or text Chris with questions REDACTED.  Thanks for looking."

Thumbscrew securely locks the slide so it’s fully supported in the rigid, machined aluminum body.

Hardened steel handle provides plenty of leverage, while self-lubricating, oil-impregnated Oilite® bronze bearings and extra-fine threads ensure smooth, precise movement.

Bought this a few months ago and I love the thing to death, but recently I've decided that I'm going to get my concealed weapons permit soon and it's a bit too big to carry. I love the thing, but I think I'd be more comfortable with something like a Glock 19 or something else that size. Only shot it a few times, but it's pretty accurate and never had a problem with it, only a few hundred rounds down the barrel. Has a stainless steel slide and barrel. Comes with 4 mags and a case. Only interested in straight across trades at this time. All controls (except takedown lever) are ambidextrous and the slide lock/release doubles as a decocker, which I love. Mainly looking for a 9mm but I'm open to other calibers as well.
