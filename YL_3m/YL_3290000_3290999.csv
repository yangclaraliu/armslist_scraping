""It didn't take long for the douche bags to start gouging on the Saiga shotguns did it? Hope you choke on them along with your gouge priced 22""

My response: I didn't take long for the nagging assholes to start bitching about the market for a particular rifle to start bitching and throwing a fit! Supply and demand on a now banned rifle, god forbid you should pay what it's worth when the market changes. Sick of hearing this goddamned bullshit. Welcome to the gun trading world, where anything other than 1/4 of the market value is ""price gouging"". Shut your fucking mouths, goddamned crybabies."

He said he had some Pmags I had put up as ""want to buy"".  He said he had 11 of them and gave me agreat deal on 5 of them.  He asked I send money thru moneygram and include delivery.  With much back and forth in my own mind I went against my gut and decide to trust this guy. He told me numerous time in his poorly spelled texts(red flag) that I didnt need to worry and that I would get them as soon as I made a payment.  I paid for them and 2 days later he sent me a Fedex delivery conformation email that looked real except it had no tracking number. I called Fedex and there was no record of a package being delivered to my residence.  When I confronted ""Mark"" he said he'd call Fedex.  When he got back to me he said ""ATF was holding my package and I needed to pay them $150.00 for them to deliver my package.""  He said the ATF told him it was a ""safe handling fee"".  I told him I didn't Obelieve him anymore and requested him to send me pics of the Pmags... He downloaded, probably from google image, a pic of the wrong Pmag and sent it to me.  Obviously I didn't pay this fucker any more money... Luckily wasn't buying a $1200 gun either...  PLEASE BEWARE!! I'd hate for this to happen to someone else!

Don't know how many rounds through it, as I got it in a trade. Stock is a factory folder made by Choate, which is correct for this gun. Choate made these by modifying GI fiberglass stocks then finishing them with black crinkle paint.

The barrel, action, and sights match themselves, the bolt completely matches itself, and the stock matches itself(except for the buttplate, I believe that this is a Norwegian capture). The correct Waffenamts are on the rifle, which includes WaA623 on the barrel, action, front sight, floorplate and stock; and WaA77 on the barrel bands, rear sight, and bolt(I believe this rifle was redone by the Radom plant in Poland that was owned and operated by BNZ in Steyr). Furthermore, there is not a Waffenamt on the receiver above the BNZ code, which means that this was not regular army issue. The bore is in pristine condition with strong lands and grooves, and about 90% of the bluing is in tact on the rifle with some rubbed off under the front barrel band and the sight hood. Rifle comes with a sling and cleaning rod. Price is 1000 OBO(these matching go for about 3000+ in bad condition). For trades, I will take a PTR-91, an East German Walther ppk with some ammo, or an FAL. I think I have about 20 or so rounds for this. Thanks for your time and have a great day.

 They were ahead of their time in terms of design and performance.

 Do not confuse this round reel with the current low-profile Abu Garcia Black Max, as is there is no comparison. 

 These reels are extremely durable, but susceptible to boat rash. Some of the lettering on this particular reel has rubbed off.

 The Black Max 3600 is great for the beginning or experienced angler. They are easy to cast for distance and hard to backlash.

 They can cast lightweight lures and go directly into the wind.

 Aluminum Alloy spool
 3 Bearings
 Triple Cross gear system which lays down line in a X pattern which prevents the line from digging into itself
 Frame is made in one piece of solid aluminum

This is an unfired ( yes reallly unfired) Sig P220  made in 1993. It comes with an extra magazine the factory box and manual. It was originally ordered  as a  gift, arrived a bit late and was replaced by N available  226. and this P220 became a safe queen and has remained one  for 30yrs. New from the box in 1994 every surface of every part of the pistol ( wtih the exception of the bore) was coated with  the Black-T   SOCOM finish by Mr. Birdsong himself in 1994 long before his unfortunate passing. Also in 1994 Hogue Custom Goncalo Alves grips were installed. The stock grips are included. Were these two features purchased today they alone would cost well over 200.00 and the wait time would exceed a year. 
The relative it was to be passed down to will no longer need it.   Asking $750.00 and will consider  reasonable offers. Available from  Jackson/ South  to the Louisiana line: Pic is not great. If it looks like wear or a scratch it's glare."

I appreciate when someone points out sales on items online that may turn up here.
I like it when someone points out that there are mismatched or improperly ""custom built"" ARs out there that may turn up here.
I like to know when Palmetto State or other companies are selling blems for nothing and people are selling them here for retail
Its a good thing when someone lists retail stores that aren't screwing people on .22LR ammo so that we have a chance to buy some before the douche bag resellers get it in the north state.
I like it when folks call out douche bags reselling .22LR and flags them.
Now, if someone is dumb enough to buy a rifle in the parking lot of BILO having not done any homework on it, thats on them. If you've gotta have a gun that bad, you probably don't need it or you probably aren't allowed to own it.
There are plenty of sites to get a handle on what things should sell for: buds, jgsales, centerfiresystems are just a few. Anyone that will pay $1200 for a rifle that is sold for $799 is more than likely a person who can't buy one through the proper channels. Anyone who is listing a rifle for that is fishing for a fool or trying to sell to criminals who can't use the proper channels.
Either way, I have it from pretty good sources that most of the frequent ""reselling"" activities here are being monitored so in the end you may likely just be screwing yourself if you are acting like a weekend gun dealer without an FFL."

Factory Part # 35177 Factory Description = The Hogue EX-F01 Extreme Series Fixed Blade Tactical Knives are world-class cutting tools designed by renowned custom knife maker Allen Elishewitz. The EX-F01 knives feature an Elishwitz designed drop point blade, mirror polished convex cutting edge and quarter inch thick A2 Tool Steel construction. The Hogue EX-F01 Series of knives also make use of a full tang design that is incredibly tough and creates a storage space within the handle via removable handle scales. A torx tool is included to remove the handle scales allowing access to storage area. The Hogue EX-F01 Fixed Blade Knives utilize Hogue's proprietary G-Mascus G-10 composite. G-Mascus handle scales are available in black, olive drab, and tan. A2 Tool Steel was chosen for the blades because it is an extremely tough, high carbon steel that is abraision resistant and has excellent edge holding properties. Hogue further increases the performance of the steel by cryogenically treating it. This treatment increases the ability of the steel to wear and absorb shock without becoming brittle or suffering any decrease in rockwell hardness. After the cryo treatment the knife is coated in KG 2400 Guncoat for corrosion resistance. The Hogue EX-F01 Extreme Series knives serious tools that will buzz through even the most challenging cutting tasks. Available in either 5.5"" or 7"" blade lengths, the EX-F01 knives from Hogue are the ultimate in cutting tools, if you can only have one; make it an EX-F01. 5 1/2"" Fixed Drop Point Blade A-2 Black Kote G-10 Scales, G-Mascus Tan.

During these tours I carried 1911, Glock, and BHP model pistols--I was also a RMSO for small arms qualifications.  I will never claim to be an expert on anything (I believe self-described experts are educated idiots) but nonetheless know a thing or two about firearms.

I have owned several different 1911 models, from low-end entry level guns to some of the more expensive.  One thing that has always pissed me off is these so called ""experts"" that say all 1911 mags are interchangeable.  THEY'RE NOT!!!  You may get a Ruger SR1911 to accept a R100 mag and it may even feed flawlessly, but then it won't lock the slide back after the last round.  I've even had ""experts"" tell me all I have to do is tweak the lips--it'll work fine then.  Bullshit.  This is not proper firearm maintenance and upkeep.

So, I was wondering.  With the variety of mag lips available--GI, Wadcutter, Hybrid, etc. has anyone begun a chart or tracking which model guns work well or better with other model guns' magazines?  Thoughts?  Comments?  Even the McCormick mags are not 100 percent reliable across the board.  

For now I've decided to stick with twin SR1911CMD models and use nothing but Ruger factory mags (which are made my Check Mate.)  Even at almost $30 a pop I'd rather be out the money than be in a jam.  Thanks--John"

So... have to sell one of my toys, and save my nickels, dimes and quarters, to purchase the other. I've seen others on here going for right around the $600.00 mark, with only (1)one clip and NO Case.

This one comes with (2)two clips..AND.. the ORIGINAL Hard Shell Case(still has the little key), WITH.. the ORIGINAL little booklet that came with it years ago. As well as a print-out from online for it. To me.. that makes it worth at Least $50.00 bucks more.

The bore is still shiny and the rifiling is still in good shape. Besides that... it's a Hoot-To-Shoot at days end after you've plinked a few holes in targets. Then... just blast the hell out of the remaining target(s)!

FTF and will split the PIC fee for paperwork at FFL.

Not looking for trades, etc., unless it's an HK that I'm looking for, at a reasonable price. I missed one for $2,200.00 a week or two ago. :-(

This knife did not come with a box from Blade HQ when i bought it. It came in bubble wrap with knife, kydex sheath with 2 rotating steel belt clips, and certificate of authenticity.

This is the same knife that was designed by Tom Brown for the movie, ""The Hunted"", with Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro. The knife design, the WSK, was originally made famous by custom knifemaker Dave Beck.

For full specs and details on this knife, go to TOPS.com or BladeHQ.com.

This knife is big, heavy, and just mean as hell! I love this design and often use my other one for the woods, camping, hunting, or anything outdoors. If i was in a life or death survival situation, this is definitely one knife I wouldnt mind having with me, because of its versatility and battle tank tough construction.

So anyways, the MSRP on these are $300. Price on Blade HQ is $210. Im asking $200 OBO. Price is already reasonable for this knife, so there might be a little wiggle room, but probably not much. Depending on where you live, inside the CONUS, the $200 will include shipping. Outside the US, the price will vary with shipping charges.

Full specs listed at the links below. The Tactical Custom ll has great reviews and are known to be highly accurate pistols that run perfectly right out of the box. Like all the Kimber Custom models it has their ""melted"" treatment, all sharp edges and corners are dehorned/smoothed out. It only weighs 31oz which is less than a S&W with Scandium frame but recoil seems no different to me than on heavier guns. By far the nicest 1911 I've ever had and the quality of it is evident as soon as you get it in your hand. Only has a few hundred rounds through it so it is just broken in. It runs flawless, I shot a box of 100 through it last weekend without a single hitch. $1000 cash or partial trade plus cash on your end. You won't find a better 1911 than this one for the money. If you are interested and serious, please reply with a phone number to contact you on.

Double action. Comes with 2 10 round magazines and 1 ambidextrous holster. Gun was carried by the security guard at my job. He didn't shoot very often and I'm guessing by the excellent condition of the mechanical workings of the pistol that there have been less than 50 rounds through it. I actually cleaned this piece for him for 3 years. Overall condition is good-above average. Working parts are excellent, rifling looks like new, outside of pistol has surface wear from holster (worst on the grip sticking out of holster), has no deep scratches and no rust or pitting at all. I've test fired 20 rounds through it, 10 rounds to test accuracy and 10 rapid fire to test function of pistol. Shoots great. 2"" pattern at 20 yards with Winchester target rounds. I've owned several rugers and in my opinion, they're as good as you can find in this price range. Call or text John at REDACTED."

The bow is a great starter bow for anyone. The bow was designed to be able to change draw length and poundage easily, so it is a great bow to grow with. The draw length can be changed from 17-30. This bow also has a very nice set up to go with it. It comes with an Apex Gear lighted sight, Fuse Whisker biscuit rest, TruGlo Quiver, Fuse Stabilizer, a Mission wrist strap, a Tru-Fire release, and a cloth camo case. 

I only used this bow for one season, and the only deer it has every shot at (a nice 8 pointer) it killed.

This new 30-30 load was designed as the single 30-30 load for all big game hunting. The Barnes TSX opens fast enough to be brutal on deer sized critters, yet penetrates like TSX bullets normally do, so it gives ample penetration for larger species such as elk. While we feel the 30-30 is marginal for big bull elk, this is the load to use if you choose to pursue elk with a 30-30 and then use the same load to hunt deer, so you don’t have to readjust your sights for differing loads. This is the perfect load to hunt black bear of all sizes with as the bullet will expand fast enough to deliver terminal devastation on smallish bear, but will penetrate deeply enough for 500+ lb bear.



The below velocities were shot from my personal rifles. We believe the industry wide use of extra long laboratory test barrels gives unrealistic high velocities that you’ll never realize in hunting rifles. So, we give you real world velocities from real world rifles, so you know what to expect in the real world, where it matters.

Comes with extra mags, a holographic red dot site. Plenty of rails and custom front hand guard. Has a chrome style shiny barrel that looks amazing under the front guard and the flash suppressor on the end works great and matches the barrel.  Has an arm sling and cheek rest. This can easily be fired from the shoulder very accurate and fun to shoot. I will put this spikes tactical AR-15 pistol up against any other tactical rifle or pistol out there and it will prove the best. This was custom built for me about a year ago. Has quality parts throughout the gun. Shoots .223 or 5.56 NATO this is deadly accurate and has lots of extras on it. It has had about 200 rounds out if it at the most. In fact it was only fired that one time except when it was factory fired and tested. The price I am listing is a cash price. This is worth more than listed. So if you're trading then know your trade needs to be worth more than $800 unless you're adding cash which I prefer trades plus cash since I am selling this because I need cash. I also have a spikes tactical AR-15 rifle that also shoots both rounds. Both are for sale if you're interested in this combo."
