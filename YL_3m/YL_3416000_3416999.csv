It's the 12.5 inch barrel version. I've only put 300 rounds through it. The previous owner was a family friend. They never fired it, so it only has the 300 down the tube. I put up a picture of some damage to the finish near the windage drum. I bought a cheap NC Star sighting tool and the hole wasn't big enough for the windage drum to move into. I thought the drum was just stiff from being new-ish. Me being an idiot, I gave the tool a couple extra whacks with a hammer and made it clamp even harder on the finish. That's what happened there. Besides that, the gun has always shot very reliably and is a fun gun to shoot. I'll include at least a steel mag and a tapco mag. If you have any questions or want a pic of anything else, just shoot me a message. Thanks!"

This is what the P06 came from.
It is chambered in .40 s&w and has a steel frame so the recoil is very minimal.
The finish is outstanding with only a little wear on the take down pin.
It comes with the factory case and test target
It has the two factory flush fit mags and it absolutely loves HD rounds! The only feed problems I have ever had was with flat nosed target rounds but I guess that is understandable because the mag springs are the old factory ones and probably could stand to be replaced.
I have recently replaced the recoil spring with a WOLFF and that is the only modifications that has been done to it.
The WOLFF spring was in a kit so those unused springs are included along with the original.  
 
I am looking to trade for a Kahr PM.40 or 45 and prefer the all black model  but am open to the stainless CM models as well.
I will also like to try the Kahr MK'S.

 
I put a trade value of $450 on it and can add cash or ammo for the right trade.
I will consider  lower cash offers but really looking to trade"

The popularity of the 300 AAC Blackout round is soaring, and for good reason! With more muzzle energy and knock down power than a 5.56 round it has the stopping power that smaller calibers lack. And with the ability to swtich quickly from a supersonic high velocity round to a sub sonic suppressed round with the simple change of a magazine, this round provides more versatility than just about any other caliber on the market today! Its one drawback is its cost, rounds can tipically cost $2.00 to $3.00 each or ever more. Ozark Ordnance is going to change that!

Norinco SKS in a tapco stock with 30 round magazine. This weapon has had the extractor, firing pin, and piston replaced by me and fitted into a tapco stock. The bolt group and barrel are also in great shape and it is a solid shooter. The rifle comes with 110 rounds of FMJ ammo and 100 rounds of Hollow Point ammo, original 10 round magazine and tapco 30 round magazine, and a tapped receiver for a scope mount along with rings for said scope. All serial numbers on the rifle are matching as well. Estimated trade value: $375 - $400

It comes with the original box, all original paperwork, 2 10 round magazines, 1 30 round magazines, soft carry bag, Simmons Red Dot scope, and 80 rounds of 5.56mm ammunition. For those that are not familiar with this rifle, you can store either two 10 round magazines, or one 30 round magazine right in the stock of the weapon. This rifle is also able to fold in half so it is only 23 inches long for storage. Also, one of the better features is that the forearm of the rifle can fold into a bipod for those extra important long distance shots. Estimated Trade Value: $650-700

Mossberg 88 12ga Shotgun. This weapon has only been fired 3 times, twice with birdshot and once with 00 buckshot.

You know how that one goes.
The pistol's in nearly pristine condition, and has been a great shooter. It's had less than the 500 rounds through it, which is the amount of break-in firing recommended by the manufacturer, so it's basically still new.
I have the black rubber factory grips seen in the photo, but I currently have some retro-looking GI-style walnut checkered grips on it that look really good.
The Tactical model is different than their basic GI model in that it has dovetailed Novak-style sights, an extended beavertail, skeletonized steel trigger, skeletonized hammer, a flared ejection port, and ambidexterous safety.
These come from the factory with a Parkerized/phosphate finish, and I've also applied some gun-sight paint to the rear sight dots, and the front sight post (which really help).
Included is the factory ( Italian-made ACT) magazine, as well as an extra US military issue magazine.
As I said, it's been a reliable shooter, and I have no problems with a test fire if you have someplace safe and convenient to shoot (and of course, your own ammo!)
I can only sell to legal Georgia residents, over 21 years old, and must at least see a drivers license. I can sell to Ala. residents, but legally we'd have to do the FFL transfer on the Ala. side, which typically will cost you $25.
I'm a 51 year old Ga. resident, with my Ga. carry permit, so everything's good on my end.
E-mail me, or call/text 706-three-o-four-0494 (preferably both, to be sure.)

I'm looking to sell a pretty unusual rifle, this non-refurbished M38 rifle is in it's original as manufactured M38 stock not the more common later production M44 stock.

It is not counter-bored and has a nice light trigger.

You can look long and hard to find an M38 in this condition and that is not the typical ""refurb"" so don't miss out on this one, again the more typical refurbished M38's are getting hard enough to find but ones in this much more original condition don't come along everyday, In fact the only other non refurbed M38 rifles I had the opportunity to handle were Finnish capture.

Collectors, hello!

I have up for sale a really nice and very early Finnish made M39 rifle.

This one is very much original, it has a matching numbered bolt and floor-plate, it also has the original matching numbered front sight blade, another neat feature of this early M39 is that it was built utilizing it's predecessors (the Finnish M28/30's) upgraded rear sight base, (not too many have this feature). 

The artic birch stock has a good mixture of looks and character as can be seen in the pic.s it also has a nice crisp Sako stock cartouche.

Finnish sling not included in the sale.

Face to face sale in the eastern Henrico area preferred. (Richmond, Hanover, Hopewell areas) if your willing to travel. 

or

$450 + actual USPS shipping cost(depending on how you want it shipped) to your FFL.

Thanks!"

The reliability of a steel magazine, the durability of a polymer magazine and the weight of an aluminum magazine. The L5AWM, a lightweight AR rifle magazine, fills the gap between the current metal and polymer magazine designs, combining the best features from both designs into a unique hybrid magazine.

Unique to the L5AWM is the one piece wrap‐around hardened steel feed lip assembly that is permanently attached to an impact resistant polymer body. The hardened steel feed lips won’t bend, break or deform due to rough handling or long term storage. An aggressive surface texture has been applied to the polymer body to improve gripping and retrieval from pouches. The combination of steel and polymer result in a lightweight, robust magazine tough enough for professional use.
The internal geometry of the Advanced Warfighter Magazine is a constant curve to maximize feed to the 5.56X45mm NATO round with a non‐tilting follower for trouble‐free feeding. The feed lips are made from a single piece of precision formed steel that is hardened, then PTFE coated for corrosion resistance. The body and component materials are corrosion and chemical resistant, passing military chemical testing, including exposure to DEET. The L5AWM is compatible with modern weapon systems; M4/M16/AR, HK416, SCAR16, and the ARX160, to name a few, and available in 10-round capacity with a translucent or opaque polymer body.

This is a .44 caliber gun based on an 1851 style revolver (yeah, not historically accurate). I checked the serial numbers and it was made in the early 80's ('83 I believe). I have not shot it extensively but I can attest it makes a nice big muzzle flare with a potent loading.

The bore is in great shape, although the inside of the chambers show some minor corrosion (surface rust, no pitting). Brass needs to be polished up to look nice but overall the gun is in great functional shape. Hammer shows some peening but nipples look great and I have had 100% ignition with it. The action and trigger are nice as is typical of Colt clones. No. 11 caps fit perfectly and it has shown good reliability for a Colt. I use .454 round balls with good effect and chamber sealing. 

Gun will come with the original full-length loading lever for loading on the gun and if you like I can throw in a bird's head grip, although I have no frame for it."

He's also texted me from REDACTED
He tries to get you to send him money by offering a hell of a deal on a rifle that is very valuable. When you refuse he offers to accept part of it and get the rest later. He refuses to meet or deal with a FFL. When he claimed to have the very valuable and sought after rifle I was looking for, I told him I would get a flight to come inspect it. He wasn't having any of that. He is obviously foreign judging by his broken English. He uses ""sir"" excessively and has claimed to be in the military. He always has a sob story. When you ask him for pics of his rifle, they are always pics off the internet from previous sales. He even sent me pics of two totally different rifles in the same email. Stay away from this trash Armslist unless you want to just throw away your money. And if you want to do that just contact me. I promise it'll be a more pleasurable experience than dealing with this guy. To all the other hard working people here just trying to enjoy our 2nd Amendment rights, have a good day. **Update** 9/30/14** He has responded to another ad of mine for a different, high price firearm.

.45ACP Thureon Defense Carbine - Glock Mag Compatible w/ extras - Like New.

Thureon Defense makes an amazing product with awesome customer service.  I purchased this rifle in late February for $1,400 (Not including shipping/tax) and had them add quite a few things from the factory.  Since I have owned it, I have put about 250 rounds through it.  The recoil is almost nonexistent so the Bushnell TRS-25 was more than sufficient.  With ammo prices today this thing is well worth the money for those who train regularly or just for recreational shooting practice.  In the price I will included the TRS-25 w/ 3/4"" and the 10 rounder that comes with it.  I also have some Kriss Glock mags that can be negotiated.  Magpul stock, afg, and pistol grip remain with the firearm."

The DPM System is about the best guide rod you can buy on the market. It significantly reduces recoil, gives better control and accuracy, superior slide and frame protection, improved firing speed, elimination of jams and much more!  

If interested in buying (local only) here is how I have everything broken down:
Glock 20 gen4 with VTSS and VTMR: 620$
DPM System: 95$
TTI Sights: 85$ 
Ammunition: 120$
Range bag: 10$

920$ firm for everything pictured. Will not separate any items from listing.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a single brand new, factory fresh, and VERY rare Springfield 1911 TRP Operator .45 ACP Pistol, in the awesome Armory Kote Finish! The Springfield TRP is everything you expect in a high-end 1911, and they do not disappoint. This is the first one of this model I have ever managed to get my hands on!


 I have just ONE in stock, and have it priced to sell QUICKLY for just $1,429.00.


Springfield PC9105LP 1911 TRP Operator, 45 ACP, 5 in, G10 Grips, Armory Kote Finish, Night Sights, Tac Rail, 7 Rd

The TRP standard line is designed around the same specifications as the FBI contract pistol, the TRP-PRO model. The Springfield TRP offers nearly the same performance and features as the TRP-PRO model at a fraction of the cost. From its fully checkered front strap and mainspring housing, to its durable Armory Kote Teflon or stainless steel finish, this gun can only be described as a knock out value.

The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.

TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.
Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.
