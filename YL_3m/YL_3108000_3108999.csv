The High Speed Gear™ SureGrip™ Padded Military Belt is designed to provide the comfortable, no-slip stability necessary for reducing back strain and general discomfort so frequently caused by loose-fitting, drooping and weighted-down belts. Featuring a brand-new modular system, the SureGrip™ has a slim profile that is just 0.75 inches thick and only 4.5 inches tall.

The SureGrip™'s updated design features Neoprene as the belt's padding. This material gives the belt a cushiony gel-like feel for greater comfort and exceptional gripping power. It also features a removable HDPE stiffener sheet throughout the entire main portion where the three continuous rows of PALS/MOLLE are located. This feature is for those times when added stability is required. With this proprietary ability to remove the stiffener sheet, the SureGrip™ is one of the most flexible military belts of its kind, making it the ultimate support system whether at the range or in the field.

With three conveniently-positioned access ports, the SureGrip™ allows you to seamlessly attach subloads to the belt's interior, while the belt's four suspender attachments allow for easy expansion."

I built this for myself. The only reason I'm selling is to fund a 300 blackout upper build. I believe the internals are DPMS. Mil-spec VLTOR buffer tube assembly with Magpul MOE stock. The grip is a blackhawk ergo grip. Only fired about 100 rounds.

I'm an FFL and since this is still on my books it requires a form 4473 and background check.

The SP 223 Billet lower feature a unique design geared towards the serious tactical shooter. The oversized winter trigger guard, quick access mag release, beveled mag well, ambi bolt drop and user friendly features make this lower the best on the market. To ease assembly Seekins Precision eliminated the use of roll pins, hammers, punches and replaced them with custom screw in dowel pins. We installed an upper tensioning set screw, a set screw for trigger reset, relocated and retained the rear take down pin detent under the grip. Our ambidextrous bolt control allows the shooter to quickly drop the bolt or from either side of the firearm. The unique magwell design allows positive mag changes and allows the use of most all mags including Magpul P-mag and Surefire high capacity mags.

The wood on these guns is really great looking.  This would be a great home defense gun or great for hunting.  I don't think anyone would want to consider it for a concealed carry, it might be hard to conceal.

Chambered for NATO 5.56mm or .223. Comes with two 30 rd clips, older vertical grip on grip rail, carry handle with top rail for sights and 178 rounds of WPA ammo valued at $50.00. Darker areas on finish are from factory oil job. Will even out with a rag or something. Just haven't done it. RIFLE CASE NOT INCLUDED. Sorry! I've had a lot of inquiries about this rifle. If you want the gun by itself with no ammo, no additions I've made (carry handle, grip rail etc., I'll strip it to just the rifle, rear factory sight and two clips. 500.00 flat.

From Beretta:
“A400 Xcel: the Fastest, Lowest-Recoil Clay Buster

The A400 Xcel is a 12-gauge competition shotgun that is faster-cycling, softer-shooting and better balanced than anything else on the market. Built on the revolutionary A400 action, it delivers follow-up shots 36% faster than any other brand, while its advanced recoil-reducing systems make it absolutely pleasant to shoot, even on demanding all-day competitions. Its sleek lines and superior ergonomics are designed with one goal in mind: letting the A400 naturally follow your eye to the target. This is why it has quickly become a favorite among serious competitive shooters the world over. 

Built on Today’s Most Advanced Semi-Automatic Action

The A400 action is the culmination of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and passion for shotguns. It feeds reliably all types of shells from 2 ¾” to 3,” with loads ranging from target-light to hard hitting--making it also suited for the occasional upland or waterfowl hunt. Also, it features the unique Blink technology, a gas-operating system that is capable of delivering two shots in less than half a second, while also integrating an easy-maintenance self-cleaning piston. Furthermore, the action has sleek lines and a low profile, meaning that the vertical distance between the dominant eye and the supporting hand is reduced to a minimum. The result? A gun that follows your swing like an extension of your body and eyesight--and many more broken clays.

Extremely Low-Recoil

There are no two ways about it: felt recoil is only a liability and the less of it, the better. The A400 Xcel incorporates several recoil-reducing systems operating simultaneously to make recoil virtually negligible (70% overall reduction). One is a hydraulic shock absorber that softens the rearward energy from the action’s moving parts, which minimizes felt recoil while reducing wear within the receiver. Another is a Micro-Core buttpad that all but neutralizes the recoil generated by the power of the cartridge. Also, the A400 is designed to recoil parallel to the comb, meaning no thump to the cheek and minimal muzzle rise.

Durable, Easy and Quick to Clean

The A400 Xcel's cold-hammer forged barrel is made of nickel-chromium-molybdenum steel (Beretta’s “Steelium”), a proprietary formula engineered for consistency, toughness and durability. The bore is chrome-plated to facilitate cleaning and minimize wear and corrosion. And the new Optimabore HP choke tubes are particularly easy to remove--even after several thousands of rounds. Lastly, the new, improved gas piston makes assembly and disassembly a matter of seconds. All these are reasons why when your competitors see you approaching with the A400 Xcel’s telltale bright-blue receiver, they will know you have the absolute best--and they will know who the winner is.”

You may not have snakes in your yard but you do have bad guys around and there is no gun better to use to practice shooting than this.  It will even fire the quite rounds so that you can practice in your yard without going to the range.  Remember to always practice gun safety and don't make enemies of your neighbors.

If you know tires you know what those Bridgestone Duelers cost.

Does not smoke or knock or ping. New distributor a couple years ago, new front pads last week. Pretty clean truck for 1995, starting to rust where the chevy trucks do. Garage kept for years. Cap is in great shape no leaks. Ive never taken it off, has plastic bed liner that I have never removed. Has some oil stains on it from small engine repair. Interior is in great shape carpet has some stains but no holes/tearing, ceiling is nice and tight. Driver seat has wear from driving. Back seat has only been used a few times. Mostly kept coat and tools back there.

Everything works, all gauges, heater, cruise control ect ect except A/C does not work, shop says charge it because it had a leak when I had tranny checked.

The forward on the tranny works excellent. The reverse is starting to slip It still backs up but is slipping. I had the tranny filter and oil changed and it helped but it's still slipping. It's been slipping since last fall. This has been my daily driver for several years now. Extra set if tires and factory aluminum rims. This is a real good truck, clean title.

TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast.

We sold the gun and the customer came back in one month after firing it one time and upgraded to a Kahr 9mm.  This is a great quality concealed carry pistol that can be easily carried by men or women.  The quality is easy to see right away with a quality stainless slide and the polamer frame is perfect.  This brand of gun is used by law enforcement as a backup gun.  When you compare it to a Keltec 380, Taurus TCP380 or a Ruger LCP380 it stands out well ahead of the others.  

The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.

The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.

Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.

I am the original owner and the gun just sits in my safe.  It's time for me to convert it into cash for other projects.  

If you follow SIGs, you know what this gun has become.  It is truly a legend and the price they are bringing these days reflects that.  As time moves on, they are becoming harder to find in this condition.  As a two-tone with factory full nickel controls, this is even more rare.  

On GunBroker, this gun would likely bring $1200+.  I'm putting it on Armslist for a local buyer at $975.  I'm not interested in trades and the price will not change.  Cash only.  I can meet you anywhere in Indianapolis or within 20 miles outside of I-465.  If you are South of Indy, I would go as far as Edinburgh.  You must have an IN DL and sign a bill of sale.  If you are OK with shipping, I will ship to your FFL holder for an additional $40 (Indiana only.)    

If you have an interest in SIG handguns, get this piece of history while they are still available."

Magpul MOE Stock

I have put on a Magpul MOE  butt stock, hand guard, and +grip. also I have installed a YHM fold down front sight/gas block, black rain charging handle, and a YHM style flash hider.

If you have any questions please feel free to ask. Thank you for looking. 

I have received a lot of questions about the rifle so let me answer them on here.

1.No I will not ship the rifle to you or your FFL

2. I live in Fayetteville, NC and no I will not drive half way across the state to meet you I have a job and can not just go on road trips.

3. Yes the price is firm at 800 if you do some research you will find that the msrp is 1100 for a stock rifle. When you consider that it is a 308 AR and comes with a bunch of up grades and extra parts and 4 mags 800 is a very fair price. If you can find one cheaper please buy it. I'm not in the business of buying and selling guns which means I don't price match. 

4. I'm not really looking to trade but that being said I am a collector of modern tactical firearms. So if the deal is right then I may consider trading. 

I'm sorry if the above answers make me look like an asshole but if you have never posted on here you wouldn't believe the stuff that gets asked."
