The ergonomically contoured and well-balanced handle has a black finish and is made of a high strength, abrasion and impact resistant glass-reinforced nylon that will fit comfortably in your hand. A black nylon sheath with a hook and loop closure and secure clip attachment is included to keep the Magnadot 2.0 safely protected and close to you at all times.

The Magnadot is a meaty folder. It has substance and you know it when it is in your hand. A traditional and reliable pattern that will give years of reliable use, the Magnadot is more turtle than hare. Easily opening the formidable 3.63-Inch half serrated blade with one hand gives you a sense of power. The Magnadot includes a lockback feature and is one of the oldest locks in use today. It's a great mechanism that locks up very securely. The lever on the back edge of the handle catches in the tang of the blade and locks it, while with one press on the back of the lever, unlocks the blade in this ambidextrous and safe to operate feature. The glass reinforced nylon handle is high strength, abrasion and impact resistant. The handle also offers a chemical resistance to common chemicals such as motor oil, transmission fluid, and methanol. Magnadot... it is happening big. This knife is backed by a lifetime warranty that protects against defects in manufacturing and materials.

The wait list to buy one of his barrels is something like two years long. This barrel is threaded 5/8x24 and is 0.75"" thick at the gas port. The blank and barrel extension came from Stag Arms. High-quality craftsmanship and precision is evident by looking at the threading, crown, gas port, etc. 

The feed ramps have been polished. I purchased this barrel new in November 2013, used it to build a pistol upper, let the upper sit in my safe for 6 months, and then I disassembled the upper and decided to go with a different length. This barrel is brand new, unfired and hasn't had so much as a round put into the chamber. There is some minor wear on the exterior finish from assembly and disassembly, but nothing major and nothing that won't be covered up by the handguard. $200. Price is FIRM. Will trade for an 8"" or 8.2"" barrel (can add cash on my end). Buyer must pick up in downtown Dallas or in NE Dallas near the Arboretum. Thanks for looking."

Many are missing parts and all are in various states of disrepair. Some of these are old enough that they were built prior to modern powder, one has a bulge in the barrel, possibly from someone attempting to fire a modern cartridge through it. There are 4 Iver Johnsons, Two Harrington Richardsons, and one Smith and Wesson. All are chambered in either .32 S&W or .38 S&W, one is .22. They are difficult to date as serial numbers were not used the way they are today, but most should qualify as C&R."

This is 5.56NATO (5.56x45) ammunition and perfect for your 5.56 chambered AR-15.  Please verify your weapon is chambered for 5.56 before purchasing these.

Technical/Ballistics Information:

This is INCREDIBLE factory new, high-performance, precision-manufactured, SS109 steel penetrator, lead-core ammunition loaded exactly to NATO specs.

THIS IS AMAZING AMMUNITION - These are nothing like those PMC X-TAC ""light armor piercing"" green tip rounds... these are PENETRATOR rounds and have unbelievable accuracy and destruction.  This same ammo has been manufactured and sold to the U.S. and foreign Governments for use in combat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other foreign theaters of war.

This ammunition is powerful enough to penetrate up to 3mm (0.12 in) of steel at 600 meters & up to 12mm (0.47 in) of RHA steel at 100 meters. 

These rounds are not cheap range fodder.  These are battle rounds that are moisture sealed to military specifications for long term storage.  The ammunition is manufactured in Romania, by Uzina Mecanică Sadu, which is an ISO 9001:2008 (Certificate 154-C) and AQAP 2110 certified manufacturing facility.  They have been manufacturing high quality ammunition for 75 years and have been supplying our armed forces and our allies overseas to this day.

These are NOT reloaded ammunition!  These are 62 grain full metal jacket SS109 5.56NATO rounds that are brand new from the factory, boxer primed, and in a beautifully sealed brass case.  If you reload your ammunition, after you fire off these rounds you will find the brass some of the best you can use for reloading.

This is INCREDIBLE factory new, high-performance, precision-manufactured, SS109 steel penetrator, lead-core ammunition loaded exactly to NATO specs.

THIS IS AMAZING AMMUNITION - These are nothing like those PMC X-TAC ""light armor piercing"" green tip rounds... these are PENETRATOR rounds and have unbelievable accuracy and destruction.  This same ammo has been manufactured and sold to the U.S. and foreign Governments for use in combat operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and many other foreign theaters of war.

This ammunition is powerful enough to penetrate up to 3mm (0.12 in) of steel at 600 meters & up to 12mm (0.47 in) of RHA steel at 100 meters. 

These rounds are not cheap range fodder.  These are battle rounds that are moisture sealed to military specifications for long term storage.

They have been manufacturing high quality ammunition for 75 years and have been supplying our armed forces and our allies overseas to this day.

These are NOT reloaded ammunition!  These are 62 grain full metal jacket SS109 5.56NATO rounds that are brand new from the factory, boxer primed, and in a beautifully sealed brass case.  If you reload your ammunition, after you fire off these rounds you will find the brass some of the best you can use for reloading.

*** See my other postings for 22LR, 380ACP, 5.56NATO, and 223 Remington that I have for sale.  I may consider negotiating the price lower if multiple postings are being purchased. 

If you are reading this posting, it means I still have the ammo and/or item(s) listed above in my possession and it's still for sale. First person that can actually come pick it up gets it. All postings are immediately deactivated once they are picked up from me, so if you're reading this there is no reason to ask me if it's still available.

Ammo and/or item is located in the Troy and Sterling Heights area near 16-Mile & I-75 or near 16-Mile & Mound.  You MUST be willing to come pick up the item near me.

The pistol is in 100% working order, but there is some wear on the finish.  I pushed out as a police trade in, hardly never fired but drawn a lot. So, it could use a refinish. Also, as pictured, there is a small spot of surface rust. Nothing a wire brush couldn't fix in a minute or two.

Its a large frame revolver that holds 6 rounds with very little use. I bought it new and put a box of 50 rounds through it while hunting pigs/deer and target shooting. It's extremely fun to shoot, ammo is less than a dollar a round and it's extremely accurate. It's so fun, my buddy went out and got one after he shot mine when I first got it and he swore he hated revolvers. The revolver functions flawlessly and I have had not one issue with it. However, if there was any issue the Taurus warranty is still in effect for the life of the firearm. The long barrel, muzzle porting and extremely smooth trigger pull in single action controls the recoil significantly to the point I can shoot it one handed. The revolver comes with a leg holster and speed loader. Retail price for the revolver alone runs about $600 at budsgunshop.com. If you are out of state, I can ship through an FFL dealer of your choice. Come with original box. Asking $500 or best offer."

also....... oh man, this one gets me !, ha ha, your old, scratched up, holster worn, no accessories having bang stick is NOT, seriously.... NOT, worth even close to a used one (take it to a gun store to see !! ha!) let alone a new one. i know you would love to think it is, but this is why it has been listed and will not sell. doing it over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over will not make it sell. has it yet?
please people, if you think your firearm is one of the rare 5% you can not get anywhere, your wrong, it's around OR, nobody really wants it, if they did, you would not have a hard time getting rid of it. it would all ready be gone. if you did not want a new car and $5000 for you old gun, it would probably sell. seriously, if you want to sell your gun, put a reasonable price on it, and trade values ( wow, just wow !!! ), why is your used gun more than a new one? magic bullets? cleans it's self? loads it's self? oh oh, it's a hollyweird gun and never runs out of bullets!!! well if it does not do these things, it is NOT worth it. so, wonder why your gun won't sell? think.

i know you really really want it to be magic, but it is just not gonna happen. my gun is special, i think it is worth a trip to the moon, it is so special you should want to pay me more cause it is special, you are special and i am special and everybody gets a trophy, that's is why my gun is special, cause. cause you can keep your Doctor if you like your Doctor. you are so special and so is your gun, that's why. cause i just really really really want it to be. pay me a whole lot, it is worth it. see, if we just say it over and over and over it must be true. remember, you can keep your Doctor. if you do not understand this rant, you have no business owning a firearm. if you question weather you should have a firearm, you should NOT have one.
so...... buy my gun for $REDACTEDREDACTED0000 it is almost new and has only been fired once( yea, who only fires once? ). it is special though, you should pay me( and want to, and love the fact you are doing it !!) full price for it. because, if you like your Dr. you can keep your Dr. same kind of lies, different kind of HOPE(and change). 
just buy my gun!!! i am special, you are special, and so is this gun, so special.

just buy it.

oh, by the way, if you are butt hurt because this rant made you mad because you bought a used glock for $550 and then you just saw one new for $509 i guess you should be a better shopper.
and, cry babies, just dry your tears and stop with the boo hoo. shop around, shop around and then shop around some more.

gun flippers...... i do not care if you get yours or not, i hope you don't, so go here, go there, and flip em all the way to the gas station at $4 bucks a gallon. oh man, i saw one on the west side, get it !!, i saw one on the east side !!, then i saw 2 on the south side. go get em !!!!!

GENTLY USED

From Beretta:
“A400 Xcel: the Fastest, Lowest-Recoil Clay Buster

The A400 Xcel is a 12-gauge competition shotgun that is faster-cycling, softer-shooting and better balanced than anything else on the market. Built on the revolutionary A400 action, it delivers follow-up shots 36% faster than any other brand, while its advanced recoil-reducing systems make it absolutely pleasant to shoot, even on demanding all-day competitions. Its sleek lines and superior ergonomics are designed with one goal in mind: letting the A400 naturally follow your eye to the target. This is why it has quickly become a favorite among serious competitive shooters the world over.  

Built on Today’s Most Advanced Semi-Automatic Action

The A400 action is the culmination of Beretta’s centuries-old experience and passion for shotguns. It feeds reliably all types of shells from 2 ¾” to 3,” with loads ranging from target-light to hard hitting--making it also suited for the occasional upland or waterfowl hunt. Also, it features the unique Blink technology, a gas-operating system that is capable of delivering two shots in less than half a second, while also integrating an easy-maintenance self-cleaning piston. Furthermore, the action has sleek lines and a low profile, meaning that the vertical distance between the dominant eye and the supporting hand is reduced to a minimum. The result? A gun that follows your swing like an extension of your body and eyesight--and many more broken clays.

Extremely Low-Recoil

There are no two ways about it: felt recoil is only a liability and the less of it, the better. The A400 Xcel incorporates several recoil-reducing systems operating simultaneously to make recoil virtually negligible (70% overall reduction). One is a hydraulic shock absorber that softens the rearward energy from the action’s moving parts, which minimizes felt recoil while reducing wear within the receiver. Another is a Micro-Core buttpad that all but neutralizes the recoil generated by the power of the cartridge. Also, the A400 is designed to recoil parallel to the comb, meaning no thump to the cheek and minimal muzzle rise.

Durable, Easy and Quick to Clean

The A400 Xcel's cold-hammer forged barrel is made of nickel-chromium-molybdenum steel (Beretta’s “Steelium”), a proprietary formula engineered for consistency, toughness and durability. The bore is chrome-plated to facilitate cleaning and minimize wear and corrosion. And the new Optimabore HP choke tubes are particularly easy to remove--even after several thousands of rounds. Lastly, the new, improved gas piston makes assembly and disassembly a matter of seconds. All these are reasons why when your competitors see you approaching with the A400 Xcel’s telltale bright-blue receiver, they will know you have the absolute best--and they will know who the winner is.”

 Springfield Armory SOCOM II rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.

Because these were only made for three years, there isn't a whole lot of information online about them.  I have read where many consider these to be some of the stronger 357 magnum double-action revolvers ever made.

This one is in very good condition.  Some wear on the e-nickel on the barrel.  Minor scratches on the original wood grips.  Has the awesome Colt Revolver look though with the vent rib and shrouded barrel.

For sale.  Cash only.  No trades.  Gun and grips only.  No holster or original box.  I am in the Burlington, KY area.  Will meet up to half-way between Lexington and Louisville if necessary.  Kentucky residents only.  Face-to-face.  Must have valid Kentucky drivers license for proof of residence.

Thank you for looking."

Here is a description on the CZ VZOR 50 from world.guns.ru:
The small, pocket-sized Vz.50 was developed during late 1940s for police use and it was chambered for the marginally powerful 7.65x17 Browning ammunition. Apparently influenced by the Walther PP in design, the Vz.50 had several differences in safety and disassembly. In the early 1970s the basic design went through minor face-lift, and the ""new"" design received the designation of Vz.70. Many Vz.50 pistols were refurbished to Vz.70 standard, with different finish, grip panels and a slightly different safety lever. New Vz.70 pistols were also manufactured between 1970 and 1983. After the replacement in service of the older Vz.50 and Vz.70 by more modern 9mm Vz.82 pistol, most were sold as surplus, as Cz-50 and Cz-70, respectively.

The Vz.50 (commercially sold as Cz-50) is a compact pistol of all-steel construction, firing the relatively weak 7.65mm ammunition. It has a simple blowback action with a fixed barrel. The trigger is double-action, with an exposed hammer and a frame-mounted decocking safety lever. The sights are fixed. Magazines are single stack. The magazine release button is located relatively high on the left side of the frame, behind the trigger. Vz.70 (Cz-70) pistols are similar, with minor differences in the finish, shape of the safety lever and grips. Manual safety is a lever at left side of the frame, behind the trigger guard. To set on safe: pull the lever down; if the hammer was cocked, it will be automatically brought down to rest. To disengage safety: push the lever up; a red dot will appear on the frame."

Recently had some unexpected auto repair bills so dropping price for cash offers.

For sale (or possibly trade) a pretty rare and collectable shotgun...  

From the research I've done this is a Winchester 1200 Stainless Marine from 1982.  It has beautiful wood furniture unlike the 1300's that took over the following year and went to synthetic stocks. 6+1 capacity, adjustable rear site, front and rear sling attachments, very good condition with only minor handling marks, and did I mention that beautiful wood stock?  

This is not some cheap Police trade-in so please do us both a favor and skip the low-ball offers.  I'm not saying the Police trade-in guns aren't quality firearms, but they aren't really collectable and will gain in value like this will.  I purchased it as a collectable item, but apparently I don't have the patience to have a gun sitting around just to look at.  I've been so anal about keeping her clean (as you can probably tell by the pics) that I haven't even shot her.  She just sits around looking great, but I have other projects I want to get going on so it's time for her to move along.

If you do a search on Armslist for Winchester 12 gauges and use ""Marine"" or ""Stainless"" as a Keyword you will find these list for $700 usually.  You'll find the same on Guns America or Gun Broker if you search around and wait for the auctions to get towards the end.  I do not have the original box or paperwork for this one though, so the asking price is lower, which I think is fair.  

Possible trades would only be for quality carry guns.  Not looking for anything large-frame or any rifles. 

More pics available for serious buyers.

Thanks for looking.  Have a great day."

I originally built this because I enjoy learning the different weapon platforms and I thought this would be a great shooter. Absolutely no surprises, this rifle shoots beautifully. The few times that I took it to the range, there is always a small audience behind me trying to figure out what I'm shooting. If you have friends or family that shoots, or you just want to show someone up that is different from what everyone else has, then this is the rifle for you. Or if you just like to have fun and blast away with inexpensive steel ammo, then this is also for you.

Replacement parts for the Norinco are cheap and are plentiful because of U.S. companies making compatible parts between all of the SKS platforms for all the different countries who manufacture it. The overall recoil is very manageable, if you wanted to take someone with a small frame to range they would have a blast without any concerns of injury.

I figured that whoever wants to buy it will have to pay for the transfer and background check fee. So I cut the price down from 900 to 800 to help cover the cost of those transaction fees at whichever local gun shop we commit our transaction.

What is in this packaged deal?

1 Norinco SKS with a custom bullpup stock

800 rounds of ammunition (40 rounds of PDX1 Defender, 40 rounds of winchester white box brass, and the rest of the ammo is Tulammo steel cased)

5 20 round magazines
3 30 round magazines
2 40 round magazines
(all magazines are reliable)

20 stripper clips (for quick ammo loading)

1 steel ammo can with 7.62 markings.

NOTE: Magazines will be disassembled and provided to purchaser as parts kits, exactly how the gun shops in Colorado sell the magazines. This rifle is 922r compliant the entire stock kit is made in USA as well as the magazines and buffer pad that I installed.

If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. Also have some side plates 6""x6""
Text Cody @ REDACTED or call 520-723-92five-five

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. Also have some side plates 6""x6""
Text Cody @ 480-228-8195 or call 520-723-92five-five

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the entire Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates that would be $300.00"

I don't think even the SCREWBALLS on here are stupid enough to take that bet!. The guns amazing to shoot even with 3 inch buck it has no recoil. Will also include 7 boxes of Zmax Buck and 3 boxes of Breneeke Special forces slugs. Thanks so much for looking and have a great weekend."

You'll find that the K.Kale marked receivers will not have a matching numbered barrel. It seems that the barrels were taken off  some other small shank Mausers and assembled on the new receivers. Or, is it possible that they were mismatched on purpose? Again, it isn't clear how this all happened and the Turks have been rather secretive about it.

The HK91 is a semi-automatic version of the G3 similar to the HK41, also marketed to civilians. However, in order to comply with US firearm regulations a number of modifications to the HK91 were made that do not appear on the first pattern HK41. Internal parts that could allow fully automatic fire were removed. A shelf was welded onto the receiver where the push-pin of the trigger pack would normally go, to prevent installation of a fully automatic trigger pack. This did not allow the use of the paddle style magazine release and so the magazine release button on the right side of the magazine well must be used instead. It is otherwise identical to the G3A3/A4. Importation into the United States began in 1974 and ceased in 1989, with some 48,000 rifles being imported.
