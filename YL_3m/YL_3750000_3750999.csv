The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases conceal-ability and enhances shooting ergonomics. The USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floor plates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing conceal-ability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified link-less Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, case, three 13 round magazines, night sights and simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Has pattern 1907 sling. I ""rejuvenated"", if you will, the stock by applying some linseed oil and a little teak oil and it came out beautifully. The stock disk is regiment marked on both sides. The rear sight does have the windage adjustment. I can take some outside pics of the rifle too so you can get a better appreciation for the stock color, getting some snow here right now but once it slows down I can take some (tried it already but kept getting snowflakes streaking through the pics). The shot of the wrist band looks like it has rust, but it's not, simply dried cosmo. The buttstock looks super red in the last pic but I think that's just from my camera and the lighting, it's not like that in person just FYI.

It was bought as a stock A2, but I have changed a little bit of stuff on it. It now has a Quad-Rail w/Magpul covers on it, a Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) precision-adjustable butt stock, Ergo Tactical Deluxe Grip w/Shelf, a forward grip & bi-pod all in one, a Blackhawk Tactical single point sling & the original sling with it/ on it, a free extra plastic grip, Colorado legal mags to go with it. I will also throw in an adjustable stock w/ tube, nut, & adapter plates. The Armalite AR10's use the same spring in the carbine that it uses in the rifle version, however you would need to buy a heavy carbine buffer for it (H3 buffer). As far as mags go I have (2)15RD, (2)10RD, & (2)5RD Mags as a part of this deal. Now yes there are fancier AR's out there that have lights, scopes, lasers, & who knows what else, but if you look at what your getting and what it would cost you in retail to just get what I have done to this one, and you compare it to what I am asking you will see that it is a pretty good deal. You can use this gun to play or even hunt since it is a 308 w/20in barrel on it. So please no low-ball offers, I don't want to nor do I really need to sale it, I made a deal with my wife to sale it because I have two of them, and there is some stuff that we would like to do around the house. You can look up the retail prices if you want but I looked them up as I was writing this ad, so these prices are right now prices. I can tell you now that I over paid retail on the gun so I am taking a big loss by putting it up for sale, so my loss will be your gain.

Hi there. Made the decision to switch back to 9mm. Got rid of my Glock 23, and now I'm looking to get rid of the Glock 22 as well. I am looking to trade for a Glock 26 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com) 

Comes with everything in the original box. 5 mags (3 factory, 2 brand new extended 31 round), lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me.

The quality of pictures are severely reduced when uploaded to armslist so it can make some textures look strange (like on the extended mags.) If you'd like the full size pictures, I can email them to you."

I'm selling my Winchester Gun safe. 
New it was $2800. 
I'm selling it cheaper because it has a few scratches on the out side. 
From the front it looks perfect so you don't even notice once its in position. 
Its a fire proof safe with a electric lock. 

The safe is extremely heavy so you will need a trailer and a few guys. 
I can deliver it for a fee. 
This would make a great christmas gift for any hunter or manly man. 

If you want to come take a look at it let me know. 
I may be willing to trade for it depending on what you have. 
Obviously I'm a guy who likes things with barrels and triggers. 
Maybe a nice skeet 12 gauge, Remington 700? A R? Sniper? let me know 
Or a few other ones that add up to equal value. 
I like things that are 4X4. 
Maybe a jeep? Or anything of value but no junk I know my stuff.

Do NOT send any money on this, because (LIKE A IDIOT) I already did. I paid for this yesterday and it was supposed to be overnighted but didn't happen, and that didn't bother me to much as the payment didn't get done till the afternoon. I was promised it would ship first thing this am. Still didn't happen. Then this afternoon it was offered up as ""still available and for sale"" to myself via text (cause they didn't recognize the number) and a friend of mine who inquired about it through armslist.  If any questions or anything please contact t me. Everything I've stated  is truth and can be verified. Not shipping on time, while sucks, was not the big issue. This is starting to REALLY LOOK LIKE I GOT BURNED. Please contact me if you've inquired about this scope as I'd really like to hear from ya. This is regarding the Mark 6 in Kentucky. I've attached a screen shot of the ad.

All sights and accessories present and stock is surprisingly nice. Bluing is also still present and good                         on action, barrel and sights. This model has the BDL style floorplate.  The 725 was the BDL version of the predecessor to the 700, the 721 I think-long action. It was made from 1959-1962. The action takes all 700 parts and stocks, but has strait round military style bolt handle. The 30-06 is common, but the furniture could really spruce up a more rare caliber like a .280 or .270 in 725 or 721 with trashed  furniture. I purchased it for the action because the build quality is 1959 Remington-quality, and you avoid the ahem, (tactical) bolt handle mod .encountered when building on 700 action. I just don't have the heart to break it down. The gun is too nice and complete for a 1959-62, right down to the white spacers on the sling mounts and hard rubber recoil pad with a white spacer. I will send lots of pics if you are serious.  prefer phone calls- REDACTED"

One in .30 and one in .25. Both made in 1914. The other gun is a 1917 Winchester in 30-06 made in 1917. This gun was only produced in 1917 and 1918 for WWI and Winchester produced the least amount, making them more desirable. All guns have original working sights and are NOT tapped for a scope so there is no damage to the barrels. Everything is in great shape for guns that are 100 years old and all guns will fire without problems. I would REALLY like to keep the two model 8s together since they are both the same year, not something you see every day. I also have 5 speed loaders and around 160 rounds for the .30. These rounds are NOT reloads (even though reloads go for over $1.00 a piece)! Online they sell for around $3.00 per round and that is the low end. I've seen sites selling the same boxes I have for $5.00 per round. I am really interested in getting some offers for these. I can accept credit card if needed. Please let me know what you think. I would consider trading all three for a truck, but cash is always fine with me!

First off if you think that your Glock is worth over 500$ don't bother me. I can buy gen3 22 for 500$ new in Covington.  I dont need your laser/flashlight combo. Or your holster. I will pay extra for mags over 3 or reasonably priced range ammo. Remember on the ammo that .40s&w at Walmart is very cheap.

I am looking for a used Glock 22 or 31 only. I can also order one online and have it shipped from J&G gun sales online for 349$ free shipping. Which I will order next Monday if I have not found a good deal that puts a Glock in my hands and $$CASH$$  in yours. I want to give my money to someone local who has an extra pistol laying around. I am specific on what I need for a job. So no I do not want a Glock 23, 32, or what ever else you have. And If it don't say Glock..... I can't use it.

I will pay a preimum for a Glock that comes with the extra barrel.

This is a limited time offer. A standard Gen2-3 Glock 22 or 31 with 2-3 mags depending on condition or if you have the case and paperwork will get my cash. 

I have a TN permit and will do a bill of sale
ONLY TENNESSEE RESIDENTS
I will meet in Millington or Tipton county unless the deal is soooo good.

 One is a MK3 Talo exclusive that I bought new. It is catalog number MKIII4GPRFS model 10154. It has a 4"" threaded barrel with flash suppressor. Hogue grips and Picatinny rail. It has a black matte finish. It comes with the box, soft carrying case, trigger lock, manual and two ten round mags. It has had three mags run through it. It is also topped with a Burris Fastfire II. I bought the FF used and it came with a FN 5.7 mount. I bought a Picatinny mount and put it on theMK3. I'm asking $450 for the package.

 The other is a MKII target model. It has the target grips and a 6 7/8"" tapered bull barrel. This 1984 production gun has excellent bluing with the only blemish being what looks like the outermost curve of the back strap was rubbed. The pistol has a VQ trigger, but I make no claims that it has VQ innards. I know the trigger pull is very light, but I don't know the poundage. Comes with two mags, but no box. I'm asking $325.
