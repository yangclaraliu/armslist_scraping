It also has Wilson combat sights and authentic white stag grips. It is in excellent condition.

For sale is an HK P30, DA/SA chambered in 9x19 and it is a V3 model with a decocker. I am the original owner and I've fired less than 500 rounds through it. I bought this pistol new at Kesselring Gun Shop in June or July 2013 for $949 before tax. With this pistol you can get a very high quality gently used hammer fired pistol for less than you can buy a new HK VP9.

Included are the pistol, one 15 round magazine, the original case, all backstraps and side panels, HK lockout key, operator's manual, HK sticker, one factory fired brass, gun lock, and a bag of silica gel. All of this came with the pistol when I bought it new.

I am asking $650 for everything and I am not interested in any trades. I am located in OAK HARBOR and I'd be willing to meet anywhere on Whidbey and as far north as Mt. Vernon/Burlington. You have valid WA ID, CPL, and be willing to fill out a bill of sale for my records."

In handguns Colt, Smith & Wesson, Springfield, Les Baer etc, possibly a few others. Same with AR-15, but must be pre-ban, or very inexpensive. 28 gauge shotgun probably European O/U, but will consider Fox, LC Smith, Parker Bros. etc, if a European SxS I would prefer a side-lock, but will consider all. Winchester lever actions pre-64, Savage 99 in 300 Savage, Swiss or German 22 lr competition semi autos. If manufactured in the last 50 years they must be in 90% or better condition, preferably with original box. Older and pre-war pieces must have original finish, but still be clean, honest,working examples. I have cash in hand for the right gun/guns at the right price, I will use the Blue Book as a guide. That doesn't mean I'll low-ball you with pawn shop buy prices, but I'm not interested in retail, or even close to retail. Call if you have some items for consideration, images preferred. I'll be happy to give estimates. Face to face in Washington state only. Seattle or Kitsap county. I have a CPP and I'm a WAC NRA member.Thanks Steve REDACTED

Don't wait months or another day, buy today with a Mo CCW ID and bill of sale. Weighing less than 14 ounces and with a barrel length of just 2.75 inches, Kimber Micro .380 ACP pistols are easy to carry and conceal. Slides on the Stainless and CDP models as well as all Micro barrels are machined from stainless steel for superior resistance to moisture. All Micro frames are shaped from the finest aluminum for integrity and strength. In many respects a miniature 1911, among the most important Micro design advantages is a single action trigger with the kind of short, smooth pull that ensures accuracy and builds confidence. The thumb safety, slide release and magazine release are pure 1911 as well. Standard features include a lowered and flared ejection port for flawless ejection and a beveled magazine well for fast, positive loading. Sights are steel â not plastic â and mounted in machined dovetails for additional integrity. Each Micro includes a flush-fitting 6-round magazine and an extended 7-round magazine is available as an accessory. Ideal for shooters with small hands as well as those who insist on mild recoil combined with enough power for concealed carry or home protection, Micro pistols are the right choice for many applications. Best of all, they offer unequaled Kimber quality, dependability and performance. Cash only no trades. I will remove this add when sold."

The optic is The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the US Army's M4 weapon system (14.5"" barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator."

Ok so here is a the parts build list from the 5.45AR. As an FYI â this rifle was built in around June of this year and has a handful of mags through it â but once my suppressor came in, I just shoot my .300BLK and 9mm AR a whole lot more and with a wedding coming, itâs just time to thin the herd a bit. The cerakoting was done by BDL Customs in St. Clair Shores; great work, Mike has done a few items for me. The mechanics of the rifle are it is a standard RH bolt carrier and uses DPMS 5.56 LH bolts that I had cut to 5.45 (had a spare done just in case â and Iâve shot at least 100 rounds in each to test function). Obviously the prices you see are new as I was building it so clearly I donât plan to sell it for that, but it gives you a reasonable idea of what she cost. Happy to sell as a package (clearly at a better price) or in pieces. To give you an idea â it shots around MOA or better with pretty much every ammo Iâve used. I have lots of replacement parts so if you want to swap things out â I can do that â for example, I really donât want to sell the custom UC Grip 23 and would swap in a plain black version ($30 cheaper).

Unlike some of the ads on here, I'm not going to bullshit you. This thing has been carried everyday in my front pocket for 2 years so there is some ware. I refer to it as love.

This is still the lightest 9mm on the market for its size. But this is not a beginners gun. I know people have had problems with these but mine runs flawless with gold dots and HSTs. I have not had a misfire in it. Its a snappy pistol so don't make its not great for your first 9mm but this one is a machine. Of course you get kel-tecs lifetime warranty as well.

I bought this rifle new, and Iâve been the sole owner of it. Besides the SRS chassis, youâll receive:
300 Win Mag Barrel by DTA
Magnum Bolt (for 300 win mag barrel of course)
1 x Mag for 300 win mag conversion
260 Barrel by Mark at Short Action Customs
Bolt for 260
2 x Mags for 260 conversion
DTA Built in Monopod
Seekonk Torque Wrench with Bit
Range and Target Book

The 300 win mag barrel has rougly 600-800rds down the pipe, while the 260 barrel has about 1,100 â 1,200 rds down the pipe.  Both barrels shoot incredibly well, and by that, I mean Â¼â MOA at 100 yards.  The 260 barrel is not fluted, and is actually heavier than the 300 win mag barrel, but Iâve been able to shoot half MOA with it at 700 yards.

The little mag carrier shown is one I made out of 500D nylon and a Kydex insert, and that comes with the kit.

Iâll also include my log book as well as targets from zeroing and load development if youâre interested.  These are just 5 Star note pads, so nothing high speed low drag, but just helped me with documentation. 

Iâm going completely away from 300 win mag, so I can also sell you my 300 winmag brass (Winchester brand 2-3x fired) as well as my Redding Competition Seater die, body die, and neck sizing bushing die if youâre interested.    I have extra Federal GM Magnum primers I can seat in the prepped brass as well as an 8lb keg of H4831SC powder, and several 1 pound containers.  I also have about 600 new in box 208gr Amax bullets, and about 75rds of loaded 300 winmag ammo using the above mentioned components.

If interested in load recipes that this rifle seems to like, Iâd be more than happy to share.

This rifle has definitely been used.  I used it at a match recently and the safety/trigger failed, and I while on the clock, I was frantically trying to get the safety to disengage.  While doing so, I marred up the safety area pretty good.  After the match, I sent the rifle back to desert tech and had the issue fixed, as well as the safety switch replaced.  However, the rifle still has some battle scars, which Iâve documented with photos below.  This rifle has been used, and has NOT been a safe queen to say the very least.  That being said, it still performs incredibly well.

Iâd like to get $5,000 for everything pictured, minus the GG&G Extreme Duty bipod.  

If youâre interested in the bipod, reloading equipment / components, or the DTA one piece 20MOA Scope mount (not pictured), let me know and we can work something out.

Complete CNC-Machined Bolt features our hardened and tuned extractor for positive, consistent extraction. It also includes our round titanium firing pin. This round design eliminates the unnecessary movement found on most 10/22 firing pins. The CNC-machining process allows us to hold the head spacing to exact dimensions eliminating the need for having your factory bolt reworked.
Bolt is case hardened and then a black nitride finish applied for improved lubricity during cycling."

It's has a 21 Inch vented ribbed barrel and  from what I've researched the barrel length makes it  rare and it is an Upland model in this length wich helps double as a home defender due to the shorter barrel but still works as a handy accurate field gun as well. No chokes but is choke ready on end of barrel. I have no reason to believe it does not function.  It has some very small handling marks from being in my safe but it looks mint. I have no idea if it has been fired but I will say 100 pct whoever had it before me pretty much never shot it.
These are inertia driven, superbly balanced and light. This one has markings imported by Hechler and Koch Sterling Va. I researched and apparently it is likely a pre 1994 gun if imported by HK. Guess at one point it was a so called preban for the Clinton 94 ban and did not have to comply with 922 compliant stuff. So it's an all Itallian made gun and NOT a Benelli USA. I gave it a good cleaning for the buyer already. Sorry no original box or literature. The literature and parts diagram is available on Ebay fyi but i'm sure there is some free download somewhere. Face to face purchase only and prefer close to Arlington area please when do so.  This gun is priced very fairly as you could look and see what they go for. Please no insulting low ball offers.  I quite simply will ignore Pawn store trolling lame offers and maybe even put a voodoo curse on you as well. Gonna G broker it in a week if it does not move here.

Retails for $520!

Specs from Volquartsen:

Our stainless steel drop-in 0.920"" bull barrels set the standard in accuracy and performance for rimfire barrels. They feature match bore and chamber dimensions and vary no more than +/-0.0001"" from breech to muzzle. Each barrel is digitally measured and inspected. The barrel shank is machined 0.0025"" oversized to create an extremely tight fit into the factory receiver. This prevents the barrel from canting once the locking block is installed. Weâve developed our unique chamber to provide optimal accuracy but also superior function.
All barrels for the 10/22 LR are drilled and tapped to accept our Barrel Mounted Scope Mount. This barrel can be set up with 1/2 Ã 28 threads and fitted with any of our available compensators.
There are several fluting options available as well on all of our stainless steel barrels. Choose from I-Fluting, Snake Fluting or the conventional Straight Fluting.
Snake Fluting is not a spiral or helical flute, nor is it a conventional straight flute, but a unique method of cutting flutes. Snake Fluting is a set of flutes that are positioned around the barrel to provide unsurpassed rigidity and longitudinal stiffness. The Snake Flutes also increase surface area to help cool the barrel during long, rapid fire strings.
I-Fluting is the next generation of fluting patterns. It is unlike any other fluting pattern available. In addition to the dramatic appearance, the innovative I-Flute design is extremely functional. It reduces more weight and creates more surface area than any of our other fluting designs.
Straight Fluting is the most traditional of our fluting patterns. The straight fluting pattern not only decreases weight without affecting accuracy, it will also increase surface area to help cooling during rapid fire shooting. Our straight fluting features six longitudinally flutes that are machined in a unique method avoiding any additional stress on the bore."

I have a Glock 26 gen 4 in Lipsey's exclusive full FDE color. This has the factory FDE polymer lower and FDE cerakote upper. The previous owner said he put less than 100 rounds through it. I've shot 150 rounds with it. 

This comes with tupperware, backstraps, 3 mags, etc all the retail accessories minus the cable lock. The factory test brass envelope is still sealed. The sights are standard Glock sights. It is in excellent condition. 

Why am I looking to trade it? I don't love it. I was holding out for a FDE G19 and found this and figured it would work for me, but it just doesn't shoot the same as a 19. Plus I know EDC will ruin the slide finish after years of carrying and its a beautiful Glock. It deserves someone that will appreciate it."

972,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3695972,"For Sale:  Indirect Combat Relay Optic (ICRO) - ""Shoot Around Corner"" Optic","North County, San Diego, California",$ 250,"Listed On: Tuesday, November 11, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is an Indirect Combat Relay Optic and was designed and built for the U.S. Military by a company called Exponent Inc.  for use by special forces units during  U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

It is not a very common item . The items is brand new and I only took it out of the box to take the pictures for this posting. This unit has never been mounted on a weapon. 

The ICRO fits over the front of pretty much a Close Combat Optic (CCO) or M68 reflex sight and gives the user the ability to aim the CCO from a better protected position by allowing the weapon to be sighted 90 degrees off the barrel. In laymans terms, that means you can look around corners using this device. This device will also not affect the zero or boresight of the weapon. The ICRO uses a little mirror that flips in position on demand to enable you to look through the sight from the side of the weapon. The mirror also flips out of the way when not in use so that the sight can be used as normal. The ICRO is an elegantly simple solution to an age old problem. 

Again, this item is brand new in the box and comes with the instruction sheet and one extra elastic band. This little thing is a great piece of equipment and an awesome addition to any soldier's toolbox, especially if you are getting ready to deploy to an urban combat environment where a shoot-around-the-corner device would give you an unparalleled advantage.

Selling price is $250, including shipping and insurance. This item can only be shipped in the USA, so no foreign orders please.  I prefer Paypal but will accept a money order but please no personal checks. 

Pictures:
1) ICRO in box with user's manual
2) ICRO mounted on Aimpoint (not included)
3) 2 ICROS side-by-side for comparison purpose (showing ICRO in ""open"" position for normal use of your CCO, and in ""closed"" position to acquire targets at 90 degree angle looking through your CCO)."
