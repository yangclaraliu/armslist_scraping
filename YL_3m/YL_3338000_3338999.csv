I've taken it out to the range twice, exactly 100 rounds total through it. Virtually no recoil which is why I bought it as a training rifle - it's just too heavy for my nephew to handle and my daughter has many years before she's ready for the range. I prefer cash, a straight trade, or trade + cash on your end.  I may be able to add a little bit of cash for the perfect deal, but not much."

It’s hard to find this gun for sale on any website. The closest model you will find is one of the Tactical Mark III's which doesn't have the muzzle device and the stock is black. Gun has been shot less than 20 rounds. It's crazy accurate, sticks out at the range, and has some great custom features.

Shooters Arms Manufacturing (SAM) M1911 Military. Full size 1911 with one 8-round magazine ($550), one 7-round Colt factory magazine ($35 - not pictured), WRB XMH holster with thumb break and magazine pouch ($30 - not pictured), zippered locking soft case ($19), rubber Hogue grips with finger grooves ($20), wood Hogue Sig Sauer grips ($50), 8 brand new 16 lb recoil springs ($75), a .45 caliber cleaning kit ($12), 20 rounds of Federal Premium low recoil Hydra Shok ammo ($28), and an antique leather shoulder holster with built-in spring retention ($?).

I've put exactly 132 rounds through the pistol. The previous owner bought it and kept it new, but there's a little surface rust in the grip screw head slots from replacing the grips. He also apparently dropped it so there's a ding on the front left side of the slide, and the left corner of the hammer and safety. Nothing which affects the shootability of this gun. This is considered one of the best entry-level 1911's, and shoots great. Perfect if you're trying to decide if you want to go a 1911 route without paying for an expensive name, or looking for a project gun to test your gunsmithing skills on (not that it needs anything).

The previous owner told me the leather shoulder holster is from WWII, but there's no markings. It's in pretty rough shape. The holster needs some stitching and the shoulder strap is cracking or split in several places, and missing the back strap.

Price shown is for cash - trade value will be a little higher. I know funds are pretty tight for a lot of us right now, so while I prefer cash I'm open to trades, especially partial trades with a bit of cash. I can add ammo, or a little bit of cash for the perfect deal.

Do NOT ask what my bottom dollar is or if I still have this - I won't respond.  Otherwise feel free to ask any questions you may have.

The Lo-Pro Upper is equipped with a 16"" Target-Crowned Bull Barrel, a true 5.56x45mm NATO chamber for use with either commercial or mil-spec ammunition, and employs the versatile 1 in 9"" rifling twist rate capable of stabilizing a wide selection of different bullet weights. Additional features include heat resistant GlacierGuard polymer handguards, single rail gas block, charging handle and complete bolt & carrier assembly. Aluminum parts are hard coat anodized to mil-spec, steel parts are manganese phosphate treated (parkerized) matte black.

Desined by shooters for shooters, the Shot Trak HD mounts on any rifle,
handgun or bow to capture incredible color video of targets in full HD(1920
x 1080p). Most action cameras offer a wide lens that may take great videos
close up but fail miserably when attempting to capture game at a distance.
The Shot Trak HD delivers 5 times the magnification of a standard action
camera and comes with a built in microphone. Shooters can view videos on a
wide screen TV or a mobile device. This camera is great for hunting,
archery, target shooting, home defense and law enforcement.

Its in great shape with minimal wear. These have 4.25in commander length barrels and has a lightweight alloy frame making it much easier to carry as a cc pistol. Also has cocobolo hardwood checkered grips, flat mainspring housing, extended beavertail safety, 3 dot sights, skeletonized adjustable trigger, extended safety lever, and ring hammer; basically all of the features that most people want on a 1911.
 Comes with two factory mec gar magazines, case, barrel bushing wrench, fobus paddle holster, and all factory paperwork and accessories.

Its a great gun but I've had a few 1911's and I'm just finding that I'm not a big fan of the platform. I'd like to trade for a different semi auto handgun of some sort in 9mm, .40, or .45.  Would be interested in Glock's or XD's + a little cash.  Would particularly be interested in a Beretta 92 compact or Stoeger Cougar in any of those calibers + cash as well.  Would be interested in a .38/.357 revolver as well, particularly a Ruger GP100 with a 4 inch barrel.  Pretty open though so let me know what you have, No tauruses or kel tecs though, and I'm not interested in rifles or shotguns. My ONE exception would be a .357 magnum lever action rifle.

If not interested in trading I will sell for $650.

My buddy's uncle bought this new around 1971.  It is a 1970 model according to the serial # Ruger's website.  I fired 20 flawless rounds through it and decided to completely disassemble it for refinishing.  It doesn't appear to have been shot much.  The bore looks great and rifling is strong. I order a new Boyd's Laminated Pepper Stock, Wolff extra power recoil spring and mag tube spring set, and an extra set of every little spring in the rifle plus a mag follower and another recoil spring and 2 more mag springs, and an extra rear sight (the rear sights are folding and adjustable), all from Numrich.  I spent $200 on all the extra parts and I have all the receipts.  Also included is a PDF file of the parts schematic from Numrich to help you with reassembly.  (I can reassemble it back to working condition if you like.)  I will also include 2, 50 round boxes of 44 mag ammo.

The original stock has a crack in the forearm that was glued, so it is still usable, just not perfect looking.  The new rear sight is installed and the metal is now refinished with Brownells Oxpho-Blue and came out very nice.  I hope to start on finishing the stock this week if it is still unsold.  

I should mention that this is factory drilled and tapped for scope mounting.  Also, these .44 carbines are gas piston operated, not recoil operated.  I understand Ruger stopped making them because of the fine machining that was necessary and too expensive to make much profit on.

 Not interested in any trades or low offers.  Thanks

I purchased this brand new in 2013. I'm selling it because I rarely use it. I've only taken it out 2 times, with minimal use. It's in excellent overall condition! I have taken good care of it, and cleaned it after each use. I'll include the owners manual and lock, but no box. If you have any questions please contact me.

The Geissele Automatics Super 3-Gun trigger is a precision tuned, semi-automatic only trigger designed after the Geissele 2-stage combat trigger presently being used by US Special Operations Community. The S3G has an enhanced trigger pull improving accuracy with your firearm while still retaining the rugged durability of the combat-tested triggers. The trigger components are constructed of tool steel durability and the engagement surfaces are wire EDM cut for smooth operation. The hammer and trigger pins are constructed of 4140 chrome moly tool steel and are hardened for durability. The hardened pins will not embed debris that will lead to damage of the lower like softer, aftermarket pins. The S3G is a hybrid of a single-stage and a two-stage trigger. The trigger pull is a very smooth 3.5 pounds. The pull is much like a single stage, with no indication preceding the initial firing. After the first shot, a very slight forward movement of the trigger will reset, and with an extremely short subsequent pull fire again. This super short reset allows the shooter to engage targets with extremely fast shot-to-shot times. The S3G trigger is perfect for 3-Gun and Multi-gun competitors looking for a faster trigger to decrease those stage times and improve scores. Field tests with experienced shooters have shown that 12 rounds onto an IDPA silhouette target in 1.9 seconds is possible."
