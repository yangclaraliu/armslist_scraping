UPGRADES:
1st Trigger PRP Spring Kit, now the trigger is very smooth, clean breaking at 6 lbs. 
2nd is Coloration of stampings, as shown in photos.
3rd is Talon rubber grips added to gun grip and magazines bottoms.
4th is Pearce Finger Extensions added to the two 7 round magazines

Decided to get another gun so selling this while it is in new condition, great shooter. The 4” barrel is a great carry option, as it’s just as thin and short in the grip as the 3.3”, but the 4.0 barrel length adds better sight radius for accuracy and higher velocity over the 3.3” version, and just as easy to carry in or out of waist band.

Sig Info:
The P229 is a compact firearm often used for duty and/or concealed carry purposes. The standard version features a DA/SA trigger. The pistol has also been made available in a DAK (Double Action Kellermann) model, which is a DAO system with two trigger reset points, and a lighter, smoother pull than that of traditional DAO handguns. Most of the above-mentioned factory variants of the P226 are also available for the P229, including the Equinox option, Elite lineup, as well as a SAS GEN 2 model.

The P229 differs from its cousin the P226 in several respects, and was originally introduced to supplement and then replace the P228 by adding the .357 SIG and .40 S&W as available chamberings. The P229 was the first production handgun introduced that could chamber the .357 SIG round.[25] The P226 and P228 were originally manufactured using a stamped-steel slide on an aluminum alloy frame. The P229 consists of a CNC-milled stainless steel slide, typically colored black with a Nitron finish. The P229's milled steel slide was introduced to handle the higher slide velocities created by the .357 SIG and .40 S&W loads, which the stamped slide of the P228 could not handle without the use of a much stiffer recoil spring. This would have made manual slide-retraction much more difficult and the use of a milled stainless slide (coupled with the new milling and stainless production capabilities found in the U.S. factory) with a standard weight recoil spring made more sense.

A standard weight recoil spring for the P229 is 71 N (16 lbf). A spring weight of 89 N (20 lbf) or higher would have been required if a stamped slide was used for the .40 S&W or .357 SIG chamberings. The SAAMI maximum chamber pressures of 9mm, 9mm +P, .40 S&W, and .357 SIG are as follows: 240 MPa (35,000 psi); 265 MPa (38,500 psi); 240 MPa (35,000 psi); and 280 MPa (40,000 psi). The slide on the P226 was redesigned in a similar fashion, and civilian sales of the P228 were discontinued in early 2005 due to declining sales and the advent of the P229 in 9mm. The P226 and P229 are both available with optional accessory rails and optional forged stainless steel frames.

The P229 can be chambered in .22 LR, 9mm, .40 S&W or .357 SIG. Changing between .40 S&W and .357 SIG is as simple as switching out the barrel. Conversion barrels, from companies such as Bar-Sto Precision Machine,[26] also allow a P229 or P226 to change between a .40 S&W/.357 SIG to a 9mm caliber. Magazines shipped with .40 S&W models will also accept .357 SIG cartridges. The 9mm model (both railed and non-railed) can be converted to .22 LR, but in the past its receivers were not designed to provide the space needed for handling the larger rounds of .357 SIG and .40 S&W. As SIG Sauer has slowly begun adopting the E2-style grip system across the P229 model range in 2011—a move similar to what is also happening to the larger P226—they have also begun using the .357 SIG/.40 S&W spec frame dimensions for their factory 9mm P229s, presumably to streamline the number of variations in parts needed to be kept in inventory. Although the manufacturer has announced that older-configuration magazines will continue to operate in the new receiver configuration, SIG Sauer has nonetheless revised new P229 9mm factory magazines to a design that is specific to the resized magazine well of the newly reconfigured receiver/frame. As a consequence, the newer magazines are not back-compatible, due to their larger diameter."

Over the years I longed for it, I only found a few quite like it. I bought it with the thought that I might make this West German Sig P226 into a competition gun, and even picked up some pieces with which to do that. In the end, my SIG-loving heart just couldn’t modify this classic P226, as it deserves to be made a safe queen or fired often in its intended configuration. With my focus now on some other 3-gun tools, I thought I’d see if there was one of you who would love her and treat her like the regal lady she is. 

She is a “KA” stamped, classic SIG- Sauer P226 9 mm. This makes her West German manufactured (of course therefore much sought after by loyalists) with Exeter, NH as the import location. She has additional German proof marks. 

To me, this is where it gets cool. Most of the W German P226’s in police service were retired somewhere around the 10 year mark, and by 1993 the 226 production was occurring in the US. This means that by 2003 most of the police service weapons (read that as low, almost known, round count) were traded in for their replacements. 11 years later, they have often been shot tons more, and when you buy one used the overhaul is $140.00 (with shipping) through SIG. This does not include refinishing (100.00 for original Nitron,) any small parts, or barrel if necessary. 

When I found this pistol I was truly surprised. It was a police trade to SIG and they made it a SIG certified pre-owned. It was overhauled by Sig and graded “excellent.” The only other SIG of that age I’ve seen this clean was mine- on the day I bought it in 1993. It comes with 2 SIG 15-round magazines, and all the stuff you’d find in a new gun box today. It still has the CPO band on the handle. I’ve never loaded it, never chambered a round, never fired it. The protectant is still on the slide. The breech face is not marred. I‘ve stared at her LOTS but I just can’t bring myself to modify this one. There are no finish issues- what you see in the photos is the protectant form the Sig packaging. It is truly like walking into a store in 1990 and picking up the real West German classic.

I will cover the transfer fee if we use my LGS in Clayton. Otherwise, we can transfer at your preferred FFL in the Raleigh area at your expense. 

In addition to the two supplied 15 round magazines, this package also includes 4 Sig-Sauer and 3 Mec-Gar 20 rd magazines, 4 Mec-Gar AFC 18 rd magazines, and a package of Magwell grips (all brand new, in package, original value $380.00.) Price for the entire package is $975.00. Firearm only: $725.00. Prices are firm.

Only trade I would consider is for a Barnes Precision Machine complete upper or rifle."

They were used to mount a Nightforce 3.5-15x to a Remington 700, shortly after, the scope was moved to a .308 AR at which point the rings became too low to mount properly. There is no damage done to these rings and they still function 100%. 

They retail for over $220, I'm asking for $120 and a preferably a face to face meet around the tacoma or south seattle area.

Mark 4 Rings take mounting to an entirely new level. Machined from solid steel, this mounting system is one of the strongest available. Designed with long-range shooters in mind, this system will ensure that your scope won't shift under the severe recoil some rifles dish out.

What is shooter grade, you ask? Well if you don't want to drop $1k-$2k on an all-matching, safe queen Luger, this is your gun. She's not perfect. Mismatched numbers, weak rifling in the barrel, wear marks and dings. But, a Luger is a Luger. She shoots straight and functions just fine. So, if you want a decently priced Luger you can feel comfortable shooting that will still collect value (obviously they aren't making more of these, took me months to find this gem) this is your gun. I'll take $700 or a trade. Might need a trade and cash on your end depending on the gun. I'm only selling this to get funds for my next Luger or AK project, no hurry to sell.

Since then there have been a few negative replies not worth repeating. Some people have told me they had the same experience.  The truth is there is a guy in Fernely selling bad reloads that jammed in my gun barrel more then once. If I had been doing double taps the gun would have exploded in my hands. Not because the gun is bad but because the reloads were junk. I have been buying reloads from Titans in Reno with no problems.

Sig Sauer
938 Extreme Ambi

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!


With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue G-10 Piranha grips in black and grey provide maximum grip and a distinctive look.

From the serial number it was made in 1974 to the best of my knowledge. It appears unfired to me but not sure and I have not shot it since I've had it. The nickel on one side of the slide seems a little ""frosty"" on very close inspection-- this could be age, or just how it was made. The box is tattered but it seems correct to the gun. I do not guarantee the box to be absolutely for this exact gun as I can see where there is some modifications to the end label. I don't know if the grips are original to the gun or not. They are not ivory. Obviously, grips on a 1911 is an easy change if you don't like.  This is not the Satin nickel finish but the more sought after shiny Nickel finish. Email me with your info if interested and I will incur FFL transfer cost so you don't get stolen firearm and I don't sell to a felon.  This does make an interesting piece to anyone's collection!

It runs flawless with quality ammo.  Used it to take 2 large hogs last year.  1 dropped immediately, the other ran 30 yards and dropped.  Shoots 75 grn hornady tap like a laser beam.  Shoots everything accurately.  Piston system combined with NP3 coated internals runs extremely clean and smooth.  Wilson combat TTU breaks clean and crips.  Gas block has suppressed and standard settings that can be changed without tools. All components used are top of the line.  Gun will include 3 magazines.  Can add more mags or ammo for the right deal.  I am mainly looking for a M1A but will entertain all offers.  I am looking for a fair trade.  If cash is involved my price is flexible.  This rifle is a steal at $2000.  I am moving to California soon, and don't want to neuter my prize possession.  Would rather see it go to someone who will appreciate it.
