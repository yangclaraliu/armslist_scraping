From S.A - > The world of tactical rifles forever changed in 2004 when Springfield Armory® introduced the M1A™ SOCOM 16. 7.62NATO power in a package this small was previously unthinkable. Shooters who need a compact rifle no longer have to settle for a lesser caliber, although they can expect less felt recoil and less muzzle rise, thanks to the SOCOM 16′s unique design. - See more at: http://www.springfield-armory.com/products/m1a-socom-16/#sthash.uoqgV4BG.dpuf"

The scope is 4-16 power, one inch tube, with a 42mm objective lens. It has a BDC reticle that has has graduated hash marks that correspond to the drop of a .308 round out to 850 yards, which takes a lot of the work out of hitting targets at extended ranges. Once zeroed, simply hold on the correct hash mark and fire.
I have used the optic out to 550 yards, and found the hash marks to be accurate to that distance. Pretty nifty.
The mount is a one piece mount that gives good height and eye relief; it is cantilevered so that it can be comfortably/easily mounted on upper receivers or any other picatinny rail. The upper rings on the mount also have picatinny rails on them so additional accessories (scope levels, backup sights, etc.) can be mounted.

The optic works just fine, and is in fine condition. There is one cosmetic scratch on the finish on the side of the optic, but that is all.

I am selling it because I don't shoot long range very often, and actually found that I enjoy lower magnification ranges for the type of shooting I do.

From Sig:
P220 COMBAT
Designed to meet, and exceed, rigorous military standards, the P220® Combat performs like no other .45ACP available. Each pistol features the military’s Flat Dark Earth finish on its alloy frame and SIG’s Nitron® finish over a stainless slide. Internal parts and controls are phosphated for extreme corrosion resistance and reduced friction while the barrel is hard chromed and finished in Nitron® which easily passes the military’s accuracy requirements – even after 20,000 rounds. The P220 Combat also passes the military’s 240-hour salt spray corrosion test. Additional features include a M1913 Picatinny rail, vertical front strap serrations and SIGLITE® night sights."

It is the most accurate of the pocket 45's, too. The XR45-S is a very unique pistol, especially the feeding system and magazines. At first look, the magazine seems backwards. You push the round into the closed end of the magazine. I wondered how in the hell is the slide going to rake a round off? It doesn't! After inserting a loaded magazine, as the slide is pulled to the rear, a fork grabs the rim of the cartridge and PULLS a round out of the magazine, raises it so the slide can chamber the round. Arne Boberg probably pulled out a few hairs figuring out how to make that work! Hats off to him!! Here is a link to the video http://community.bobergarms.com/video/boberg-xr9-patentpending-feed-1 This feeding system allows for the use of a 3.75"" barrel that extends over the magazine. So, you have a barrel that is .45"" longer than the barrel in a SPRINGFIELD XDS 45 (3.3"") in a gun that is .53"" shorter in length than the XDS (6.3"") vs. XR45-S (5.77"").The height of the XR45-S is the same as the XDS (4.4""). The width of the XR45-S is .11"" wider than the XDS. The XR45-S weighs .22oz vs. 21.5oz XDS. We are not taking anything away from the SPRINGFIELD XDS, they are an excellent firearm. We are trying to illustrate that you can have equal to or better accuracy and more muzzle energy in a smaller package. That is where the XR45-S shines. This little jewel is a work of art. The slide action is smooth and slick. The stainless steel slide is machined to perfection and the tough 7075-T6 Aircraft-Grade Aluminum Frame keeps the weight down to 22 ounces. The XR45-S is +P rated and also rated to fire the powerful 45 SUPER, so you can shoot +P ammo all day long. The XR45-S can handle it and with the low bore axis and forward grip, so can you! Recoil, not a problem. I'll list a few specs and let you get to bidding. Caliber: 45acp, 45acp +P, 45 SUPER. Capacity: 6+1. Length: 5.77"". Height: 4.4"". GRIP Width: 1.01"". Barrel Length: 3.75"".

It's lightly used in almost new condition and only had around 200 rounds through it. Has night sights and comes with three 10 round mags, two with pearce pinky extensions. Also comes with its case and paperwork.

I've been carrying it for a little while but I've just picked up a smaller carry gun so I would like to trade this for a mid or full sized 9mm handgun. Primarily interested in a Beretta 92 or CZ75, but would also consider a similarly equipped Glock 19 or Springfield XD or XDm. Would consider handguns of lesser value plus cash as well, so feel free to let me know what you have. Not interested in kel tecs or Tauruses though with the one possible exception being a PT92.  No other calibers aside from 9mm either please.
Not interested in shotguns or rifles at this time, only looking for 9mm handguns.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

The rifle is a Savage Mark II .22LR bolt-action rifle.  It has a beautiful wooden stock with a gorgeous color and finish, great checkering, And sling studs.  It is known as a ""GXP"" model - the G denotes the wood finish and the XP denotes it was a combo package with included scope.  The actual rifle is absolutely amazing - if you do not know about Savage, they are known as some of the most accurate production rifles in the country and the best overall accuracy for price you can get.  Their quality-to-price ratio is simply unsurpassed.  This rifle shoots any single .22LR ammo you feed it (via detachable 10 round magazines, included) and has a degree of accuracy nearly unbelievable in a store-bought, production rifle of this price range.

The rifle can with some cheap scope that I immediately replaced with a top-quality Nikon ProStaff 4-12x40mm scope - simply amazing.  Nikon is basically the equivalent of Savage in the optics world - they give you the highest quality-to-price ratio with unsurpassed engineering, amazing optical technology and glass quality, fully multi-coated optics and a huge 4-12x zoom range.  With the 40mm lens size you are gaining something like 98% light transmission - unreal.  I have 3 total Nikon ProStaffs and an absolutely amazing Nikon Monarch ... they are simply the best for the least money.

The rifle comes with several 10-rd spare magazines, a camo-pattern Field and Stream sling with the swivels, and the Nikon ProStaff scope mounted.  It has probably been fired somewhere from 250-500rds.  Nearly all were high quality CCI Mini Mags, CCI Standard Velocity, Federal AutoMatch, and some Federal Value Pack 36gr HPs.

I love this rifle- I am simply attempting to fund a present for my Dad and I have several other .22LR rifles I can keep shooting while using this money to buy my Dad something he wants.

** Look I hate to sell this but i have to sell something, and as I said in a previous post, I have a surplus of combat shotguns and .22LR rifles.  So those are the things I can spare the most, thus the sale.  I hate to let this go as the accuracy is absolutely *amazing* and Savage rimfire reliability is pretty legendary ... combined with the Nikon ProStaff 4-12x40mm BDC scope etc. it's just a sweet sweet shooter package.  $500 takes it."

No previous lever action ever handled as well. No previous lever was as strong. No other lever action ever offered chamberings in such powerful cartridges. A new standard was set, and it would be years before another lever action would even come close to the perfection of a Winchester 1886. The 1886 Winchester accompanied settlers all across America. It soon became the premier big game hunting rifle for North America. It was the rifle that became a Theodore Roosevelt favorite when he was a working cattleman in the Dakotas, years before he was President of the United States. Today's Model 1886 rifles come in versions and configurations that you will love. And the line-up is changing all the time as new models come and go in our production line-up. One thing is for sure, all are beautifully finished and made to the level of precision and quality that made the originals famous. The 1886 was the second John M. Browning design he created for Winchester. It was considered robust and accurate, and capable of handling the long, powerful black powder “buffalo” cartridges popular on the Western Plains. The 45-70 Government is the all-time classic chambering for this robust rifle design . . . more than a match for grizzly bear, bull elk and bison.

A self defense rifle has to perform the first time, every time. The ultra-reliable A.R.G.O. system incorporated into the new Benelli MR1 does it for the U.S. military, and makes the MR1 the best home defense rifle available. The MR1 self defense guns are chambered in .223 Remington and use the battle-proven Auto Regulating Gas Operated System, the same system developed by Benelli for the M1014 (M4) and used for over a decade in multiple conflicts by the United States Marine Corps. The MR1 features a stainless steel, self-cleaning piston that operates directly against the proven rotating bolt, thereby eliminating the need for complex linkages found on other, inferior gas systems. This piston-driven system, perfected by Benelli, incorporates a gas port located just forward of the chamber, where the gases are hotter and cleaner, resulting in less fouling and more reliable cycling. Accepts high capacity M-16/AR-15 magazines."
