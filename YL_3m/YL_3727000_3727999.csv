FIRST OFF THE ONE AND ONLY I GOTTA SELL MY AWESOME .223 MODEL 700 RIFLE IS BECAUSE I JUST GOT LAID OFF FROM MY JOB AND NEED THE MONEY. I REALLY, REALLY HATE HAVING TO SELL THIS GUN. IT'S BY FAR ONE OF MY FAVORITES!!!
Ok This Gun when I say it is in MINT CONDITION I mean it is absoulutly FLAWLESS!!!
I have maybe at the very very most fired 40-45 rounds through it. All 100% trouble free of course. Most of those rds fired were at the range dialing it in out to 300 yards and beyond. Let me tell you, the Model 700 Remington Rifles are proven to be the most Accurate Rifle ""Out Of The Box"" on the market. It's definitely true. When I bought this gun made sure is was one in the back in a sealed box. When I bought it I also bought a super nice Nikon Prostaff 4-12X40 with the BDC feature, (Bullet Drop Compensator) which is built into the nice crisp cross hairs which allows you to accurately shoot out to 500 plus yards. It's a Damn nice Scope that cost me $250 extra. I also bought some super nice scope mounts and rings damn near top of the line, they cost me a extra $65 but both were well worth it. I purchased this Rifle to be my Varmint/Coyote gun and what a hell of a job it has done. 4 confirmed kills in two trips out. It's a very smart idea to get a Range Finder to better and more accurately use the BDC Feature on the Nikon Scope. The first Coyote was 191 Yards. And the second and final trip with this gun, the three Coyotes were 226, 293, and the last one was a whapping 409 yard shot. YES this gun is accurate, the question is are you? I only use Hornady Ammo through this .223 Remington Model 700. The best I've found, ""Factory Loads"" are the Hornady Superformance 53 gr V-MAX Bullet. They are rated at 3,465 FPS On the box, how when I shot three of them through my Chronograph, all they honestly were above 3,500 FPS I don't remember the exact numbers but they were around 3,530 FPS, I was pretty surprised. Usually ammo fires out slower than what the box says.
This package deal also comes with both front and rear Butler Creek Flip Open and Snap Water Tight Close Scope Covers/Protectors, they are a MUST!. Also included is a super nice Black ""BlackHawk"" Sling. And a Nice padded Gun Carrying Case.
Ok here's what kind and how many rounds of ammo this deal comes with
- #150 Hornady SuperFormance 53gr V-MAX Rounds. (THEY VERY BEST FOR VARMENTS)
- #150 Hornady  55 gr FMJ (A Excellent All Around Round!)
- #50 Winchester ""VarmentX"" 40 gr Polymer Tip. (I had these left over from my other .223. They have not been fired through this Rifle I am selling.)

· Norinco Chinese MAK-90 Sporter
· A2 style flash hider
· Magpul MOE AK-47 Grip
· (6) – 30 round steel Chinese magazines (stamped Polytech / China)
· (2) – 75 round steel Chinese drums. One is stamped with the (36 in a triangle) the other is stamped (9396 in a circle)

· 930 rounds of Wolf Steel Case ammo 7.62X39mm FMJ
· Original Chinese military issue chest rig
· Original Chinese sling

This rifle was purchased in 1990 along with the magazines and the drums. I am the only owner (original). This weapon has seen about 1000 rounds over the years and has been very well taken care of. The furniture was changed to (I believe) Chinese laminated wood and also includes the original military issue cleaning kit in the stock. The Wolf ammo (non-corrosive) was bought around 2005 – 2006 and has been kept in ammo cans. I have shot 60 rounds of it over the last few years and it functions flawlessly in this AK. 930 rounds is what is left.

My asking price of $1600 is firm and I will not split any of this up at this time, so please do not ask.
Thanks!"

The cracker is made from 8 stands of braided fishing line. The whip is 3 layers with 9 inches of ball bearings after the handle. The final 550 layer starts with 4 strands (4 plait) and ends in 16 strands at the handle. Very loud, very easy to crack, and very dangerous on the business end. Not for a child.  The whip without the fall is about 7 1/2 feet. There is no black tape or weird things inside this whip....just 550 cord. Fall and cracker easily replaced without unbrading.  (I have yet to see a cracker or a fall fail on these) This whip is a few months old, and well broke in.  Well over 100yards of cord went in to this whip.

I will explain what I have done to this pistol and see if anyone has any interest since I will never fire it. 
This pistol started out as an Ultra Raptor in blue finish. I have had a few pistols refinished at Cummings Custom Coatings in the past and decided to let them Cera Plate II this Raptor. If you are not familiar with their work in particular the Cera Plating please visit their site http://www.ccrrefinishing.com/information.html  for info and google people’s opinions and reviews.  This is a great finish that is self lubricating and VERY durable. This is not a spray on finish!! Also had the ramp polished even further than the factory. 
You will never find a nicer Ultra Raptor than this one I shot it before all the work and it is sweet. I do not have to sell it but since I won’t shoot it (just to nice) I have shooters, wanted to see if anyone has any interest. It comes with box, all paperwork and 2 Kimber magazines. Of course it has bright night sites
I would consider trades on Springfield M1A , M14 possibly top end Gerand, Nice Deer rifle with cash. No AR’s I have enough. If you want to make a trade offer gun plus cash give it a try.

Model : P-01 
Caliber: 9mm
Capacity: 14+1 (2) magazines
Features: hard case, cleaning rod, lock, factory owners manual and msterials.

The P-01 9mm (designated the P-06 in .40 S&W) was designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame made it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry.
The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police.
Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142!
For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN."

Ruger Vaquero Deluxe .45 Colt Revolver, 5.5 Inch, Engraved Barrel, Frame, Cylinder, Talo Edition, Ruger 5157
This is an exclusive Talo edition Ruger Vaquero Deluxe. Limited to 500, these are new in a retro red case and have a 5.5″ barrel, stainless steel, engraving on barrel, frame & cylinder and hardwood grips.
Original Old West Single-Action Look, Size and Feel. Since its introduction in 1993, the Ruger Vaquero® has dominated the cowboy action shooting world and earned its reputation for rugged reliability due to its strength and mechanical superiority. It is often referred to as “the gun that won the New West” because of its widespread popularity among single-action shooters and cowboy action competitors.
The Ruger Vaquero combines the original Old West single-action look and feel with new features. The mid-size steel frame and cylinder are scaled-down to the same size as the original 1955 Ruger Blackhawk®, closely resembling the classic single-action revolvers of the late 1800’s.

Guaranteed to be accepted by the ATF or your money back.  Period.  No questions asked.

I have never received a single call or email from a client that said the ATF rejected their NFA Trust or their Forms prepared by me.  I will walk you through every step of the process and answer all your questions so that this unnecessarily complex process is easy and painless.

What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property.

As a Texas lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!

This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.

Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.


What the Trust includes:

- The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (14 pages)
- Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms)
- Appointment of Trustee (1 Page)
- Trustee resignation (1 Page)

I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.

Guaranteed to be accepted by the ATF or your money back.  Period.  No questions asked.

I have never received a single call or email from a client that said the ATF rejected their NFA Trust or their Forms prepared by me.  I will walk you through every step of the process and answer all your questions so that this unnecessarily complex process is easy and painless.

What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property.

As an Ohio lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!

This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.

Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.


What the Trust includes:

- The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (14 pages)
- Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms)
- Appointment of Trustee (1 Page)
- Trustee resignation (1 Page)

I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.

Call anytime. Free consultation: ***Attention: Due to the announcement from the White House that they are actively pursuing to close the ""loophole"" and possibly end the benefits of a Trust (the privacy, the security, and even requiring the beneficiaries to obtain fingerprints, background checks, and CLEO approval) though it is speculative, I believe time is of the essence and if you have been thinking about a Trust, please do not wait to contact my office for information***

BULLET INFORMATION:
Thanks to its unique projectile design this load possesses a higher ballistic coefficient than standard M855 ball. The noticeably longer projectile ensures it better retains both its velocity and energy over distance. The end result is it shoots flatter, drifts less in the wind and hits harder compared to standard M855. It also possesses greater sectional density for deeper penetration.

These are 30 cents per round. You will not find a better deal on this type of quality ammo!!

BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE 357 SIG - 125 gr. Barnes TAC-XP @ 1425 fps - 20 Round Box

For those wanting a 357 SIG load utilizing an expanding bullet, that penetrates very deep, this is it. This lead free, all copper Barnes TAC-XP bullet, will penetrate roughly 20+ inches in flesh and bone, yet it expands to roughly 55 caliber.

We are utilizing a flash retarded powder in this load, so that the vision of the shooter will not be significantly impaired should he be required to drop the hammer in low light. Roughly 95% of all civilian shootings in the US happen in low light when the criminal element is most active. Not being blinded by your own gun fire can be a significant advantage.

In small cartridge casings such as 40 S&W, 9mm, 380 auto, 357 SIG, etc., these long-for-weight all copper bullets, crowd precious and limited powder capacity and force us to load the bullet to lower velocities than we would like. However, the advantages to these Barnes all copper bullets, outweigh the disadvantages for most applications.

My single 357 SIG pistol obtained the below velocity with this new load. At Buffalo Bore, we always use real world pistols to generate our advertised velocities. We disagree with the industry wide duplicitous practice of using extra long laboratory barrels which generate false high velocities the end user will never see in the real world, when using real world firearms.

To the seasoned collector, it is an excellent example of the Last Ditch Type 99. It has all the hallmarks of the last ditch effort. The rough woodwork on the stock. The wood piece at the end of the stock. The simplified rear sights. The absence of the mum on the back of the bolt. The bolt numbers do match the receiver numbers on this rifle. The trigger does not catch the bolt however and will need a minor repair. This comes with the bayonet as well as a classic example of the last ditch sling. The sling itself is interesting because there is a cloth sewn onto it. The Kanji on the cloth refers to the orders the soldier was given. I had it translated by the head of a local history department and will include a printout of the translation.

Super thin, ultra conceable, and easy to configure, the Beretta Pico sets a new standard for the micro compact carry pistol. The Pico is the thinnest .380 auto made by a millimeter. The Pico's snag-free slide and frame is a true 18 mm at the widest point. The grip frame, sights, and caliber are all simple to modify. (It can go from a .380 to a .32ACP by changing the barrel.) Extremely soft shooting with a double action trigger, the Pico is easy to control with its smooth, tip-to-parallel, straight line action. The removable, serialized sub-chassis and modular frame feature simple disassembly for easy cleaning and customizing. The dovetail quick-change sights can be adjusted or replaced by the user. Light, durable, and easy to draw from concealment, the Pico brings all the reliability and quality of a Beretta to bear on its standing as the leader of a new generation of concealed carry firearms.

 The gun has a fully ground and polished slide, trigger and hammer. All of them buffed to a mirror shine. It has been treated to a full trigger job with all the internals polished and lightened. The result is an incredible trigger pull with crisp release and very little creep. The feed ramp has also been polished to provide unparalleled reliability. I am no marksman but it is honestly one of the best shooting pistols I have ever owned or shot. It features a Wilson Combat extended magazine release, Ed Brown ""snakeskin"" back strap to match the slide serrations and an Ed Brown extended magwell. It includes 3 stainless magazines, box, fired brass and all paperwork and extras included with it as original. 

 This is a truly well done 1911 in very nice condition; just looking for a new home. It has maybe 3-350 rounds fired down the pipe. I have quite a bit more into this gun than I am asking and at the price is truly a bargain. Thanks for looking."

It has been well cared for (I am meticulous when cleaning). I haven't replaced any parts except the drop-in handguard, which I kept and is included in the sale.

- Butt stock: stock (standard 6-position adjustable)
- BCG & charging handle: stock (quality S&W parts)

- Grip-Pod vertical foregrip with retractable bipod, 'Military' model w/ steel leg inserts (genuine, not a knock-off) - $40
- Generic 45-degree offset back-up iron sights - $25

About the military grade:
#DM111, Ammo: .308 German Military 20 Round Boxes 147 grain Full Metal Case Brass & Nickel NON corrosive 762 NATO 7.62x51 308 Winchester 
Excellent ammunition, and it functions well in any .308 caliber rifle. Manufacturer is Metallwerk Elisenhutte GmbH in Nassau, Germany, simply known as M.E.N., the headstamp abbreviation. M.E.N. supplies the German Federal Police, the German Army, and multiple Law Enforcement and Military Agencies. This is their standard load 7.62 NATO Round, known to us as .308 Winchester Caliber. Construction is brass case, NON-corrosive Berdan primers so non-reloadable; Projectile is DM-111 type 147 grain Nickel Plated Steel Shell / Lead Core bullet, and the nickel jacket ensures barrel longevity. M1A and M-14 owners, this ammunition is much less likely to cause a slam-fire than boxer primed cartridges.

All matching numbers.  Factory adjustable sights, factory grips, one factory mag, and one aftermarket mag.  Also comes with factory zipper pouch.  Fantastic shooter and very tight/excellent mechanically.  The Finish has some black flecking scattered on it and some muzzle wear, but a lot of it would probably clean up with Flitz.  It is priced accordingly -  I bought it as a shooter grade gun and am selling it as one.  I really like it, but am downsizing in life and don't NEED it anymore.  Rare chance to get a bona fide Belgian Hi Power for $550 and an  uncommon model to boot.  Price is FIRM and is for face to face deals in Hickory, NC.   May also be able to meet in Winston/Kernersville/Stokesdale, as I have to head that way next week. Not interested in lower offers. Not interested in trades unless heavily weighted in my favor, as I am downsizing and trying not to add more stuff to my life. Thank you for looking!"
