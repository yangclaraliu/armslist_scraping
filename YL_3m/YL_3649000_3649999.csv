The 19 is the most popular Glock selling in the US. It is the ""mid"" sized 19mm. Comes with 3 15 round mags. It is smaller than the full-sized model 17, yet still holds 15 rounds and fits in the hand like a full-sized pistol but is very carry friendly. Comes with 4 back-straps that allows you to adjust it to just about any sized hand with two of them being dove-tailed to protect your hand like a 1911's grip does.

Comes with the very nice holster and night sights and grip plug (basically makes the bottom of the gun look better and does keep dust out). All these are over $110 before tax.

Gun is immaculate and not even broken in. Everything it came with is neatly put away in a large manilla envelope so that just the gun, mags and speed loader go in the case so as not to stretch out the bindings or the egg-foam. So the back-straps go with the gun and havn't been used and are carefully stored away along with the original sights, as well as the instructions, papers and lock.  I have some shells to get someone started too.

Not really interested in trades at this time unless somone has a mint Ruger Charger plus cash.

Interesting reading about the finishes through google searches and on youtube and the glock forums.  Basically, this is the one to have if you're lucky enough to get it on a 4th gen.  Gen 4's have the 3 magazines, 3 backstraps, and a larger ambidexterous mag release.

Since then, I have put the gas piston kit on this new rifle, and sold my old one, I'm looking to sell or trade this rifle.

This upper was built with only the best components.   It runs great and it is incredibly light weight.  It is very fast and it feels amazing.  You will be surprised every time you pick it up.  The mid-length gas system is very soft shooing.  It includes a standard A2 style flash hider but if you use a quality comp, like the PWS556 or BattleComp, etc… then it turns this already amazing rifle into a flat, fast, tack-driving, machine.

I have tested 55gr, 62gr, and 77gr factory ammo.  It all shot great.  This upper has fired approximately 100 rounds of each (300 rds total).

I am looking to trade the following two items for a AR-15 or AR-10 (Pistol Configuration Preferred) that will be a truck gun. I am not interested in Poly Lowers nor AR’s without a forward assist / dust covers. I am interested in 5.56/223 - 300 AAC - 7.62x51 and 6.5 due to me already having ammo for all listed. Obviously I am not looking for your Noveske with a Aimpoint but am also not looking for your Walmart special Mossberg 715T ;)

Brushed Finished (No Pitting)

(1150fps/ M.E. 294 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 21,"Listed On: Tuesday, October 28, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"https://www.extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=127

380 Auto +P Ammo - 100 gr. Hardcast F.N. (1150fps/ M.E. 294 ft. lbs.) - 20 Round Box

The 380 auto inhabits a valuable and useful place in our society, mostly because of the easily concealable, tiny pistols chambered for it. HOWEVER, because of the very limited size of the cartridge, it is plagued with limited power and therefore most of the existing ammo in 380 auto suffers from not being reliable as a man-stopper. We've studied and played with nearly all of the existing available 380 ammo and find it wanting as a reliable means of self defense, especially against a large, insane, drugged up/pain free, determined attacker.

Here's the problem. The current 380 auto frangible ammo delivers a large amount of surface trauma, but lacks serious penetration. For example, if you shot me or another sane man in the face with modern frangible 380 ammo, it would blow off a big portion of my cheek and send a few teeth down my throat, I would undoubtedly fall to the ground in shock and pain, but I would be very much alive and functional if I could get past the shock and pain as that frangible bullet would have stopped some where inside my face, never making it to my brain. However, if you shot a drugged up maniac in the face with that same frangible 380 ammo and blew half his cheek off, he would keep right on coming because he is insane and is not thinking like you or I. Plus, he is likely pain free and fear free and wont know that half his cheek is missing and if he did know, he would not care. So whatever 380 ammo you shoot him in the face with, had better go through his face and blow his brain stem out the back of his head, because only a CNS (central nervous system) hit with a 380 is going to stop him. Likewise, a torso hit to the sternum needs to penetrate deep enough to blow all the way through his spine in order to shut him down spontaneously. If you fail to shut him down instantly, you and your loved ones are going to have to find a way to survive while you wait for him to bleed out and pass out. The best chance of survival for you and your family is to shut down the attacker instantly. So, we've designed a few 380 auto +P loads to keep you and your loved ones alive under the worst of scenarios.

This 380 Auto+P ammo will better all American made 380 Auto ammo by 150 fps to 200 fps in all bullet weights we make. This is a serious improvement in this typically anemic cartridge. This 380 auto+P ammo is more powerful than the typical 38SPL ammo made by most American ammo makers and you'll get 7 shots of it in a small/flat/light weight 380 versus 5 shots out of a bulkier 38 SPL J frame revolver. Additionally, with the 380 you'll get much faster reloads and the little magazines are flatter than a speed-loader used for a J frame.

Item 27A/20 is a 100gr. HARD cast bullet with a flat nose. It is traveling over 1,150 fps out of my 3.75 inch BDA (Browning Double Action). We've used a flash suppressed powder for all three of our 380 auto loads so that you wont be blinded by your own gunfire if you have to shoot in the dark and since around 95% of all civilian shootings in America occur in low light, the chances that your own gunfire will blind you while you are trying to save your life, are good - we've eliminated this variable by using flash suppressed powder. We've also chosen a flat nosed solid bullet. The flat on the nose ensures that the bullet will cut/smash its way through flesh and bone and do much more destruction than typical round nose FMJ bullets. Round nosed bullets tend to slip and slide through matter, doing little damage as opposed to a flat nosed bullet. The flat nose not only wounds much more than a round nosed bullet, but it actually keeps the penetration straight and thus deeper. Notice the below velocities recorded from my personal 380 auto pistols. These are real world guns and thus the speeds are realistic and not exaggerated speeds produced from laboratory test barrels. What you see with Buffalo Bore Ammo, is truly what you get in the ""real world"", where it matters. You can expect 20+ inches of straight-line penetration in flesh and bone with this load. If you are worried about over penetration with this load, DON'T! You chose to carry a tiny under-powered 380 auto pistol and the trade-off is that you are now going to have to stay alive with that pistol and over penetration will be the least of your worries if you end up needing this gun to save yourself or your family.

592,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3649592,For Sale:  Surefire X400,"East Side, Milwaukee, Wisconsin",$ 225,"Listed On: Friday, April 17, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a Surefire X400 Tactical laser/light combo for sale.  It is in used condition and does show some wear.  It comes with the original packaging and everything that was in the box from the factory.  Below is the description of the light.  I will be adding pictures in the near future.

The SureFire X400 combines a brilliant white light with a bright red laser aiming device in one WeaponLight. A high-efficiency LED generates 170 lumens of brilliant white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with good reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The LED has no filament to burn out or break and generates tactical-level light-enough to overwhelm an aggressor's night-adapted vision-for 2.4 hours per set of batteries. The 5-milliwatt, 635 nanometer laser sight, located below the primary light, is nearly twice as bright and much more visible than the nearest competitor. The laser's adjustment mechanism uses Nylok® screws that won't back out from the effects of recoil, which means it rarely needs to be re-zeroed. The white light/laser combination makes the X400 effective in close- to medium-range engagements, ideal for law enforcement, military, and self-defense use. The high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof. The X400 comes with two adapter wedges permitting rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. An ambidextrous push/toggle switch provides one-finger operation for either momentary or constant-on operation, and a mode switch allows you to select white light only, white light + laser, laser only, or system disable. Optional pistol grip switches permit operation with the top grip finger, leaving the index finger free to operate the handgun trigger. Other switches are available for operating the X400 when attached to a long gun. Some firearms may require an adapter mount. FITS: Handguns and long guns with Picatinny or Universal rails. Adapter mounts available for several non-railed handguns."

Manufacturer's Info: The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR10/SR25 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock especially designed for the longer charging handle throw of 7.62 NATO platforms. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage. Stock includes all mounting hardware for A1/A2 type rifles with fixed stock."

The vector mini models are not impossible to find, however they arent exactly common either. My price and the price you would pay from vector (after tax and ffl fee and shipping) are similiar. Maybe a little less than from a dealer. The plus side if you by mine is you dont have to wait two weeks to get it (for those that are as impatient as me), there is no paperwork (I do check ID, I absolutely will not do a B.O.S. Regardless if you want one or not), PLUS if you are unfamiliar with the FFl transfer process it can be a big pain in the ass. 

So.. Recap, if you want a mini uzi BNIB you can buy mine local today and be a happy customer, or go through the transfer process which is a PITA, wait a couple weeks and then finally get it... Sight unseen."

One arrow needs an insert and a couple could use fletching.  Carbon part of arrow is in great shape though.  Will ship in case for $40.  I accept paypal payments."
