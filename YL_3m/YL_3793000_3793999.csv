The price depends greatly on the condition  of the rifle, so I will leave it to you to drop me an offer.

I would normally pay cash, but I do have some other guns for trade if of interest. One is a bubbified standard m91/30, stock refinished with rubber pad, missing rear handguard spring, very straight shooter. The next is a 1908 (I think it might actually be 06) Ishevsk made m91. It was at one point captured by the Finns and had the makers crest scratched off, who knows what else they did. The stock is in rough shape, it just needs a new finish, dings and dimples as you would expect from a rifle in its age, most accurate mosin I've fired. The last is a winchesteer 1897 12 gauge takedown. It has a great looking patina on it, have not had the chance to fire it yet, full choke, made in 1924.

Pictures for serious inquiries, send a pic of your gun in order to get one, I'm only interested in letting those rifles go if it means I will finally own an M39."

Excellent condition, very lightly used. It spent its life in a set of Burris Signature rings, which really do a great job of protecting the scope. There are a couple nearly imperceptible rub marks where the plastic inserts contacted the scope, otherwise it would be indiscernible from a brand new unused scope. I've run 40 rounds of 22-250 through it, and before that it was briefly on a .22lr. I've bought and sold a few rifles, and bought and sold a few scopes, so I'm starting to swap some things around and get rid of what's left (only reason I'm selling this one is I have a Redfield Revenge thats slightly higher power and a little heavier reticle).

Objective focuses down to 30yd, would make a great .22lr target scope.

It is made in the USA and a copy of the South African design.

* It is chambered in 410 shotshell , 45-70 government rounds, or .45 Long Colt.

* It is officially classified by the ATF as a pistol/revolver that’s why it has no stock or forward pistol grip. I guess in a way you could call it a revolver since the drum does not remove for reloading.

* It holds 12 rounds with a built in drum.

* These units are NOT listed as a destructive device. When the Street Sweeper became listed as a Destructive Device, Cobray used some of their tooling to create the LHC.

* The 45-70 pistols do have a grooved barrel and operates exactly like the 12 gauge units.

* This unit was completely refurbished. The main spring and trigger group were degreased and re- oiled to ensure a long service life. The unit looks and functions like new. Very few of these units exist and this is a wonderful addition to any firearm collection.

* Weighs about 12 pounds, has a 25 lbs trigger pull and can all be release in about 3 seconds.

* Very few of these are on the open market.

* These were made by Cobray, which also produced the Street Sweeper shotgun.

* If you”re wondering why Cobray chose that name (Ladies Home Companion), it’s because the Street Sweeper’s name was partially why it got targeted by politicians. Rather than choose something menacing, they went with something friendly."

Last assignment was a Missouri National Guard unit. Retains Pvt. Soup Sandwich's wonderful 3-tone NATO Woodland pattern depot paint job. 

Trailer is lucky enough to be covered most of it's life, as there is very little rust in the usual spot up front in the bed. The minimal rust that is there appears to be primarily from water backsplash from the tow vehicle. You can see the remains of the old MERCD camo pattern, and the OD before that. There's probably 20 pounds of CARC paint on this thing, so rest assured the metal underneath it is well protected as is.

All lights work (24v). Parking brakes work great (right one could use a tension adjustment). 

New tires with 1700 miles on them ($600), new slave cable for 24-volt hookup, new 3-tone Woodland synthetic top ($330). Doors/chains/wood are present and in nice shape. All bows are present (two of them updated to newer style aluminum). Also includes an extra set of tires that were new four years ago, but were replaced for a cross country trip as a precaution. ""Kick-stands"" present and working.

Note: Bows and Tarp not shown in photos

Trailer has been garaged for the past two years for potential restoration/repaint, and is currently buried as a moveable storage unit for boxes etc. in our garage. Will pull out for serious inquiries. Trailers in this condition typically sell for about $1300-$1600.

This would make a great trailer for the military vehicle collector, strong candidate for a bug-out or off-road camper, or ready to go to work as a wood/farm trailer. 

I'm selling my M1009 (seen in the photos), so you will need a vehicle with a pintle hitch to tow it home. Or, it's easy enough for one guy to roll around on level ground. Two guys and a winch could easily walk it up on a flatbed trailer.

If you're interested in the M1009 CUCV (Military K5 Blazer) seen in the photo, let me know and we could work out a package deal."

Link to extended album of full-resolution photos:

Included with the pistol are the original hard case, the two factory magazines (6-round with half extension and 7-round with full extension), both the standard and large backstraps, one Blackhawk CQC Single-Stack magazine carrier, one Galco Stow N' Go IWB clip holster, one Crossbreed Supertuck IWB holster, the owner's manual and test-fired shell casing, and five Pachmayr snap caps.

The pistol was originally owned by my brother, who used it as a primary CCW for a little over a year and a half.  As such it has some minor indication of holster wear, but is in overall great condition with no damage to the slide finish and a nice shiny barrel.  It has seen an estimated 700-800 rounds of various FMJ loads as well as 165-grain Speer Gold Dot, and it has cycled everything without failure.

The magazine with the full extension has two minor rust spots, one by the feed lips and the other by the baseplate.  The Crossbreed holster has a small crack in the kydex shell that should be easily repaired with some plastic epoxy.  These can be seen in the full-resolution photo album I have linked.  The fit of the Crossbreed has loosened over time and can be tightened to your liking using a hair dryer, though when worn it still retains well.  All other accessories are in good condition.

Asking price for everything is $475, reasonable offers will be considered.  I am not interested in trades.

Local buyers - CHL with bill of sale, or transfer at FFL.

I am willing to ship to FFL, buyer pays shipping and transfer fees.

Thank you for your interest!"

Springfield Armory®, the same company that brought Point & Shoot Ergonomics™ to the market in 2001 is proud to announce the latest evolution of the polymer pistol – The XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact in 9mm and .40SW.
Put an XD® Mod.2™ in your hand, and you’ll feel the difference. Equipped with the GripZone™, the XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact applies ergonomic science to every surface that touches your hand.
Enter the GripZone™: a set of frame features working in unison to optimize interaction between the human hand and the pistol. Within the GripZone™, there are three distinct textures, each engineered for a specific purpose.
The GripZone™ doesn’t stop with new grip textures. The re-contoured, slimmer frame and slide add up to a far more natural grip feel that has nearly twice the magazine capacity and is only 2 tenths of an inch thicker than single stack conceal carry models. The High-Hand™ grip relief and High-Hand™ beavertail enable the hand to be positioned as high as possible toward the barrel bore thereby greatly reducing the pistol’s felt recoil. The no-snag trigger guard minimizes possible unintended contact with a holster or clothing. All of these GripZone™ advantages are ergonomic features that you will truly feel. It all adds up to a pistol that naturally and comfortably stays positioned in your hand.
If you are looking for the best solution to shooting comfort, concealability and increased magazine capacity, you’ll want to pick up the new XD® Mod.2™ Sub-Compact.

I have a Kahr CW40 with Crimson Trace laser. It is in great condition. It comes with two extra mags (three total), a hard case,ammo and papers. Also comes with a generic pocket holster that came with the gun when I got it. It is light and thin and carries very well. I have never had any problems with it and I have ran 100 rounds or so (2 boxes) through it. It has been my CCW for a while. Laser is dead on at 15 yards and combat sights work great. I also have a custom Alien Gear Cloak Tuck 2.0 IWB holster made for this gun with the laser that has never been worn that has just came in from a 1.5 month backorder. I will include it and sell the gun for $480, or I will sell the gun without it for $450. Trade value is $480.

In minutes, without tools, it will go from 5.56mm to 6.8mm to 6.5mm by swapping the bolt head, barrel and magazine. With an exchange of stocks, barrels and accessories, it transforms from a close quarters weapon to a designated marksman platform. Simply put, the Bushmaster ACR is the highest evolution of modular rifle utility. This rifle is built specifically for law enforcement and tactical applications - with Bushmaster's unrivaled standards for durability and precision. They've nearly doubled barrel life and reduced maintenance with the addition of an innovative protective coating. This is also featured on action components for dramatically reduced wear and enhanced operation. For the ultimate blend of strength and reduced weight, they used rugged, high density composite for the hand guard, lower receiver and stock. The heart of the ACR is their gas piston operating system. It's torture tested and proven reliable in the most brutal conditions on the planet. From the magazine release and fire selector to the non reciprocating charging handle, ambidextrous controls optimize user effectiveness. Add Bushmaster's hallmark commitment to quality down to the slightest ingredient, and you have a platform that's a natural fit for any operator and every mission"

Others, like the Danish Garands, sat in the warehouse the entire time, safely preserved and packed away, until the Lend-Lease program expired, and they were sent back.

Has some wear and tear from duty but in great condition for it's age. 2 3/4"" Shells - High Brass or magnum. 

These guns were designed and developed by a Santa Monica, California police sargent named Alfred Crouch, for use as a SWAT tactical firearm. In the mid 1960s Crouch sold his design to High Standard who used their Flight King shotgun as the platform for the product. In the late 60s and in the 70s these guns were sold to many police departments and some foreign militaries. The compact size, manuverability and ability to use with one hand make these a formidable self-defense weapon. The shooter can fire five 12 gauge shells of his choice just as fast as he can pull his trigger finger.

I have a really nice 2007 Yamaha YZ450f in excellent condition. I purchased this bike from a friend that needed the money who put over 700 into rebuilding the motor last year. I already have 2 other bikes so i dont need 3. I want close to what i paid for it so I am willing to sell for $2800 or partial trade for a nice full size high end 1911 or winchester 30-30 lever action rifle.

-I have black plastics on it now, but I also still have the blue set the bike came with when it was bought new. The blue set are in near perfect condition, besides a few scratches on one of the rear pieces. 

I am now the 3rd owner. I am pretty firm on the price but may consider a REASONABLE cash over. PLEASE NO LOW BALL OFFERS! I am not an idiot. I am in no rush to get rid of and I can wait until mid summer when I can easily get 3000 or more. The only trade I will consider is if you have a really nice, high end, full size 1911, 30-30 lever action or .308 AR10, otherwise no trades. And partial trades only, no straight across trades unless what you have is actually worth the same.
