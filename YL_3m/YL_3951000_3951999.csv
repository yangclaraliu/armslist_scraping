This rifle was around $2000 for custom work, and the price will steadily rise, considering certain markets. If you arent interested in this rifle, please dont email me that you can get an Arsenal of Vegas for $900 from your ffl buddy. Great, go to him, and then try to convince Arsenal to custom build you an AK to your specs on an unblemished receiver.

Hey all,
I have up for trade or sale a sweet 1911. This is a Taurus PT1911 in used but great condition. It has a few marks on the muzzle end of the slide, but nothing too bad. I would keep this by I really am looking more for a compact 1911 than a full size. This will come with 2 magazines, factory box, and factory barrel brush. Need to meet up in Norman on this one due to my schedule. 

In terms of trades, I am somewhat open. I would consider a Kel-Tec PMR30, Decent AK (no 74s), XDS in 45, Ruger GP100, a nice Marlin 30/30 (plus boot), 223/5.56 semi rifles and even other semi-auto rifles or other handguns. I would consider a Bolt action rifle, but it would have to be pretty slanted in my favor for me to do it because aside from that lever 30/30 i only want another semi-auto. I would even trade up to an entry level AR. Some trades will need boot on your end, some will need on mine. I also have a substantial amount of JHP 45 ammo that I could sell with or add to to even out the values. For any questions or to make an offer shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here.

I have had it about one month and have put maybe 100 rounds through my pistol with this arm brace on the gun.  I am selling it because i like the foam pad i was using on my pistol buffer tube better.. i shoot better without the brace.
The brace will also come with a Odinworks SB15 lock nut that slides onto your buffer tube and then locks the brace in place.  This is so you can adjust how far the brace sits back on the buffer tube and to keep it from rotating or sliding forward.  My tube is 1.16"" diameter and it works perfectly.  I am only asking 100 dollars for the brace and Odinworks lock ring.  The brace will also come with the original box and ATF letter but i lost the instructions somewhere in my messy truck and cannot for the life of me find them.  Call or text any time.  REDACTED.

The brace will also come with a Odin SB15 lock nut that slides onto your buffer tube and then locks the brace in place.  This is so you can adjust how far the brace sits back on the buffer tube and to keep it from rotating or sliding forward.  My tube is 1.16"" diameter and it works perfectly.  I am only asking 100 dollars for the brace and Odinworks lock ring.  The brace will also come with the original box and ATF letter but i lost the instructions somewhere in my messy truck and cannot for the life of me find them.  Call or text any time.  REDACTED.

Great for CC. This was bought new in 1992 or 93 and has spent most of the time since in a sock drawer. 

It's been fired 100-150 times and is still in almost new condition. There is a very light turn line on the cylinder and that's it, not a mark on it otherwise. Bore is shiny and clean. Really nice wood grips. Comes with original paperwork and a plain cardboard box.

487,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3951487,For Sale:  Forehand & Wadsworth .32 Hammerless Top-Break Revolver - Antique for Display or Restoration,"Greenville, Greenville, South Carolina",$ 120,"Listed On: Sunday, February 8, 2015",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a non-functioning revolver!

Forehand & Wadsworth .32 (S&W Black Powder-Only) Hammerless Top-Break Revolver

This revolver was made sometime between 1888 and 1890. The model was introduced in 1888, the company name changed sometime in 1890 to ""Forehand Arms Co."" after which the brand marking on the firearms changed to match. This allows for narrowing down the manufacture date to a short period. 
The matching ""1926"" stamping viewable on both the cylinder and bottom of the frame/handle of this revolver is the serial number, not a manufacturing date for those curious. And here again, the S/N is a fairly low number.

As-is this gun would make a nice display piece or wall hanger. It's got the surface wear to show it was a well used gun in its' day. This is a steel gun with nickel plate finnish and an after-market stained wood hand grip of unknown age and origin. All of the rusty areas of the gun are purely from the nickel having been worn off from handling over the last one hundred and twenty-five years.

Worth Noting:
- This is a non-functioning revolver!
- If in working condition, which it isn't, this would only fire gun powder based .32 cartridges. The ""grain"" combustible in modern ammunition creates a great deal more pressure than gun powder and could damage the revolver and cause injury to the user.
- Will entertain offers."

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

is still easy to carry concealed. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938
easy for left- and right-handed shooters. With dimensions just slightly
larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs 6+1 9mm rounds (7+1 in
finger rest mags) into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked SAO
trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size. Fans of the
1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in
familiar places. The P938 comes in multiple finishes.

The SureFire and RM04 ALONE are worth $700, so DO NOT low ball me, I will not respond.  The pistol without the upgrades is worth $600.  I've put over $400 into the frame upgrades and $300 into the slide upgrades.  Slide work was done by ATEi, so you know it's quality.  That's over $2,000 worth of pistol.

If you want to make an offer without the RMR and/or the SureFire, just take $400 off for the RM04 and $300 off for the SureFire.

Also comes with a NEW in package pair of Uncle Mike's Custom Checkered Grips; they're a lot like the OEM grips that came with the P226. I will include these as well.

I have never fired it; do not know round count from previous, but judging by the condition, it couldn't have been much. A great CPO pickup.

Comes with everything seen in the pics; magazines are factory Sig. Lowball offers will not be returned. I have lots of pics of the internals, rail, slide and barrel; just contact me if you need more.

Can meet virtually anywhere in the Twin Cities. Call or text me at REDACTED."

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin.

Rainier Arms Base Piston 16"" 5.56/.223 caliber Upper Receiver Group. The Rainier Piston Series are built in collaboration with Adams Arms Piston Kits. The 5.56 Midlength Base 16"" Upper is a standard mil-spec upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology. The midlength piston system will give you the benefits of a longer forearm by giving the user a longer, more ergonomic grip, a longer sight radius between the front and the rear sight for quicker sight acquisition and less felt recoil. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The Rainier Piston Series system allows you to have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer.
