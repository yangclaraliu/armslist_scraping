I didn't think I would ever let this one go but I am consolidating (already have a 376 Steyr and 350 Mag). This gun has had 38 rounds through it since new. It's the Carbine 18.5"" barrel model which are normally known to shoot better than the long barrel in these guns. I've never hunted with it and have owned it approximately 2 yrs. Very accurate auto loader with not much recoil (the auto tames the 35 Whelen down to a little less than a 30-06 to my shoulder). These are fairly hard to find and I have never had any issues whatsoever with it (No jams or feeding issues). Great gun, just an overkill for me anymore. Bill of sale will be done.

Factory limbsaver pad comes with it but I have a sleeve on the end in the pictures (I have a short LOP so just used the sleeve).

$625 cash seems very fair on this one

The scope is not included unless you really want it. It's a VERY rare EuroClass Tasco (Made in Japan). Built like a tank and very good glass. 1/8 adjustments....this was Tasco's attempt in the higher end market. It's a 3-12x52 (30mm tube) on Warne rings. Add another $200 FIRM if you want the scope and rings. This is not your normal ""Tasco""! 
I really like the scope so no big deal either way. It compares close to my German glass so I like it

I have shot less than 100 rounds through it.

It comes with everything it came with as new. I'll throw in 2 extra magazines (for a total of three) mounted on a tri-mag coupler (See pics).

Don't confuse this model with the stainless steel barreled version. This model has the Graphite barrel & weighs in at 4.45 lbs. The graphite barrels command a higher price than the heavier SS barrels. It also has the Hogue over-molded stock. 

MSRP is $791 for the rifle and one magazine. Street price is just about $700 with shipping & FFL transfer, if you can find one. 

The magazines run about $20 a piece shipped & the tri-mag couplers cost around $12 a piece.

I'll sell this rifle for $635 (includes three magazines and a tri-mag coupler). I also have additional magazines on the tri-mag couplers that I'll sell for $45 each to the buyer of this rifle. My prices are firm. 

This rifle comes with a plano-like storage case and the original cardboard box. I have also installed a larger magazine release which is faster than the stock lever. I still have the stock lever that will be included in the sale.

I have also been asked if the end of the barrel is threaded or screws off to accept a suppressor. It does not appear to nor does the company literature say anything about it.

The Nikon Prostaff scope is NOT included but can be purchased separately if you buy the rifle.

Only thing it needs is a scope and I purposely left it off because your taste may not be the same as mine in optics, and I’ve gotten some in the past that I didn’t like, and I didn't want to just throw some cheapy on it just so it would have one.

The only part of this gun that is left from the stock 10/22 is the receiver and the bolt. And they were even fixed up.

Nice little target gun. I’ll take $325 for it. I’ve got a lot more than that in it, especially with the mags and ammo, but there’s something out there that I want more, so it’s your lucky day, and please, no trades You can call or text me at REDACTED I live near Skiatiook but work days in north Tulsa so can meet anywhere in between.

First, you should note what kind of seller they are. In this case they are a private seller.

Third, the location of this post says PA, yet when I emailed him to inquire if he would ship to an out of state FFL he said he is in WA. This contradicts with the post. 

His exact initial response: 

""Yes i will definitely ship to your FFL dealer, Am in WA. Where are you located ?Price includes shipping to your FFL, do you have an FFL dealer that you work with? I'll be shipping as an individual to your FFL and i'll include a copy of my DL in it for his record and Transfer purpose.

Lately (mainly the last couple of days), I have seen listings for things that look VERY suspicious.  For instance, DVDs showing you how to convert an AR-15 to full auto.  The listing claims that it's First Amendment protected to communicate this information; I'm not so sure.  I believe it is possible to be charged with conspiracy to even talk about converting a semi-auto to full-auto.  It is WITHOUT QUESTION a crime to do so.  Did you know it is a crime to be in possession of a single PART which would be used to make a machine gun?  You don't even have to use it.  Just owning it is a crime.

Now tonight I see an ad for an AK-47 style rifle that to my eye looks either like a short barreled rifle (controlled much like a machine gun) and/or equipped with a suppressor (aka silencer - also controlled much like a machine gun).

So I ask you fellow 'listers - Are you sure it's safe to do business with these kinds of people, who advertise things that could land your keister in jail?  

If you don't know the law, be SKEPTICAL.  Better than to end up with a criminal conviction (which, by the way, means you will lose ALL your guns - FOREVER).

Thanks for listening.  Send me a buck if you feel grateful (grin).

P.S.  I went back and looked at the listing that seemed to be a short-barreled rifle with a suppressor.  Looks like the suppressor is fake, but I don't see anything on the website of the manufacturer that lists the barrel length.  Probably legit, but my point is to WATCH OUT.  Don't give the I-594 crowd something to brag about.  Use your common sense."

At a slight 3.9* pounds, this rifle is chambered for the powerful 5.56 mm NATO cartridge but will accept the nearly identical .223 Remington as well. The Upper and Lower Receivers, Buttstock and Forend are all molded of state of the art Carbon Fiber material that offers incredible durability, strength and ultra-light weight. Carbon 15 is impervious to weather, moisture or corrosion and requires only minimal lubrication through the life of this durable firearm. The rifle's highly accurate, fluted, stainless steel match grade barrel offers light weight and resistance to corrosion. It is fitted with a unique Quick Detach Compensator that reduces muzzle rise and felt recoil, and offers easy cleanout of any powder residue.

 The Carbon 15's Receivers feature controls nearly identical to the standard AR 15 type rifle. With safety selector markings clearly color-coded on both sides of the Lower Receiver, the operator can quickly check the firing status of the rifle. A shell deflector keeps hot brass away from the shooter's face, and the magazine release button, Carbon Fiber charging handle and takedown and pivot pins all function like the standard AR15. Mounted to the Upper Receiver of the Type 97 C15 is an anodized aluminum Picatinny rail that allows installation of the operator's choice of sighting systems: scopes, red dots, holographic or laser sights. No iron sights are supplied with this rifle. For ergonomic comfort, the Lower Receiver is fitted with a Hogue OverMolded pistol grip.

 A feature unique to the Bushmaster Carbon 15 rifles is the removable Carbon Fiber buttstock. A lever on the Lower Receiver's left side releases the light weight stock for ease of storage and carrying convenience. The Carbon 15 forend is molded in an oval shape that is comfortable to hold and offers a non-slip stipple finish. The forend and the buttstock can be easily drilled to accept standard sling fittings."

Also included is an official letter from Kennesaw Cannon Co, from the BATF which certifies the .22LR barrel is legal to own, and by placing it into the 26.5mm flare gun it turns the flare gun into a handgun.

I believe it was manufactured by H&K but i'm not entirely sure, I bought this one on sale for $180 + shipping, In a recent search I've found them for $200-$300 and everyone refers to them as German military steel distress pistols.

Selling my .45 Rock Island Armory 1911 Match. This is RIA's Top-Of-The-Line custom fit model that competes with other 1911's costing more than $1k. Think of it as RIA's take on the Springfiel Armory TRP. This is not a cheap 1911, but a tight and right example of the design.

The Match distinctions include:

-Match grade barrel
-Extended Beavertail
-LPA Elevation/Windage adjustable rear sight
-Fiber Optic front sight
-Full length SS guide rod
-Ambidextrous safety
-Lightened trigger w/ 4.25lb trigger
-Flared & lowered ejection port
-Polished feed ramp
...and more

Included:
*Pistol as shown
*Original case
*Six 8-round magazines (only two are pictured. 3 ACT, 3 Chip McCormick)
*Wilson Combat extended slide release


Shoots very well, and in good shape. Has some light scratches/wear in the finish along the front/bottom of the slide from use, not abuse(closeup pic).

Here's a review:
http://ezine.m1911.org/RIAMatch.htm

FWIW, Lowest new price I've found is $650 online - with only one mag included. This means $730 to $750 after FFL fees and tax. I am offering mine for $100 less and with 5 more mags. That strikes me as a good deal. 

 (Msrp is $880 for everything) 

Will be completing a BoS for my records only, and will need to see good guy credentials.

Located in Seattle, though I make frequent trips down to Tacoma. Please include a phone number with your PM and I will get back to you. No phone number = no response.

Not really looking for trades....but I might be swayed by a nice P220 full size w/ SRT. Or HK 45 Compact or USP compact (USPc) chambered in 45. Cash added where appropriate."

I really like this gun but the grips are way too big for my small girly hands (even with the slimmer E2 grips), so now it mainly just sits in the safe.  The gun is in very good shape with about 400 rounds down the barrel by me (I am the second owner - first owner moved to Hawaii and couldn't take it with him).    

I've upgraded the grips to the E2 grips and installed the SRT kit which gives it an incredible super short reset.  I've also swapped out the rear factory Sig Nite Site for a Trijicon yellow rear nite sight - I did this to change the factory combat sight picture to the standard point of aim/6 o'clock hold.  The original rear site is included, as are the original parts.  Also included is a Wolff Reduced Power Hammer Spring Pak, which includes a 17#, 18#, and 19# hammer spring for reducing the double action pull. 

The pistol is in very good shape with no holster wear.  The pistol has been cleaned after every range trip.  Comes with everything described, 4 mags, and the original case and papers.  Would like to take a peak at your good guy card before the sale.  $950 OBO.  Would also consider trading for a 9mm Shield or 3.3 Xds with cash."

Description:
Is it possible for a pistol small enough to carry every day to have all the features and capacity that you’d expect in a larger pistol? If that pistol is the XD-S® from Springfield Armory®, the answer is yes. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack 9mm offers so much that you’ll be astonished that it all fits in the small, concealable profile.

The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol.  Use your XD-S® Single Stack with an X-Tension™ magazine and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Use a flush-fitting magazine when you carry it, and it shrinks such that you’ll forget it’s there.

If you’re looking for the most available capacity in the most concealable package, you should pick up an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack  in 9mm. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice size for capacity. Hold an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

Description: 
Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance. 

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

I bought all of this new myself, reloaded around 200 rds and then had to get rid of the bench I was using and all of this ended up sitting in the attic for the past 6 months or so (except for the powder). Everything is in mint condition, the only issue is there is some surface rust on the lever. Could probably just be cleaned off, just from sitting in the attic.
