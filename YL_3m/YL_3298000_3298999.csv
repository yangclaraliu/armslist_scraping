This is upgraded with a Glock factory extended slide stop, and a lone wolf extended mag release. This gun is used, and shows signs of wear. Mostly holster wear. Its probably had 2000+ rounds through it. The finish is dark grey, not black. It is in good to very good condition. Functions perfectly and its accurate. Rifling looks great. It also has Trijicon night sights installed, and still have some glow left in them. Making this a great self-defense pistol or bedside gun.

3 of the mags are Glock factory magazines, 2 of them have a Pearce Grip +2 extension on them, making them both 17 rounds. Thats two mags that hold 17 rounds of .40 S&W. Then there are 3 Korean magazines that function perfectly, but do not drop free unless they are empty.

AMMO: This includes 200 Rounds of Winchester White Box 165gr FMJ, 100 Rounds of Winchester 180gr JHP, and 200 rounds of Fiocchi 165gr JHP. All great ammo. 500 rounds total.

I'm also including a Fobus paddle holster.

I also have about 200+ once fired .40 brass that I can include for free if you plan to reload. All PMC, Winchester, and Fiocchi brass."

Before i knew it was a russian, i removed the rear sigjt and installed a tech-sights rear peep.  I saved the old parts tho so with a new stop pin in the rear takedown pin you could return in to original.  

It also comes with a cheapo sling that is probably chinese made and about 30+ stripper clips.

 Bullets & Beans is a small, home-based FFL, started because I was fed up with gun shop prices, transfer fees, and 'take it or leave it' attitudes. As I run out of my house, my low overhead allows me to sell, accessories, and build/modify firearms at reasonable prices and all transfers are $20. I am always willing to provide information or a price check, just email me what you are looking for and I will get back to you in a couple days (as I do this part-time) with a price and availability. I can also provide a price check if you need a bargaining chip for a new gun at a local shop."

Serial number for this rifle is 23930.

This is a well-made rifle. The bolt is nicely smooth and tight.  The 721 had button-rifled barrels, a very accurate production method used only on Remington's target barrels, now.

I purchased for this rifle, from Classic Firearms and Parts in N.H., an original front blade sight and rear open sight, plus two receiver plug screws.  The front blade sight and two receiver plug screws have been installed.  The rear open sight has not been installed, but is included with this purchase.  Also purchased for this rifle was an original rear sight ramp.  ($60 worth of parts)  

It is stated in Remington history that this model was manufactured from 1948 to 1962, however, the date code on the barrel is R SS which stands for 11 1947.  That puts this rifle at November of 1947 for a date of manufacture.

This is a local sale, only.  Serious inquiries only and, please, no low ball offers.  Many more photos available upon request."

It is heavy duty construction, made of high grade steel with 6 very small brass screws holding it together with and a pocket clip for easy access when needed.

All you need to do is move the lever on the side to open & close it, it opens and closes very fast, plus it is very sharp.

This knife is approximately 4 & 5/8"" long closed, 1/2"" thick, 1"" wide, the blade is 3 & 3/8"" long with a weight of 3.9 ounces, this is a heaver than the plastic or pot metal knifes but it will last 100 times longer, with the pocket clip it is not noticeably heavy in your pocket. This knife could save your life.

The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – AR15/M16 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock for rifles with A1/A2 fixed stocks. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS is adjustable for both comb height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to the A2 stock, the PRS can shorten LOP by .25"" or extend it by .75"" as well as provide three-quarters of an inch of comb height adjustment. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Bottom Picatinny-type rail allows for monopod use, additional sling mounts or storage."

I bought this knife at the Denver Gun Show over 2 years ago, I carried it for a while but I never use it for anything except to open taped  boxes.

This is heavy duty construction made of high grade steel with 6 very small brass screws holding it together, and a pocket clip for easy access when needed.

All you need to do is move the lever on the side to open & close it, it opens and closes very fast, plus it is very sharp.

This knife is approximately 4 & 5/8"" long closed, 1/2"" thick, 1"" wide, the blade is 3 & 3/8"" long with a weight of 3.9 ounces, this is a heaver than the plastic knifes but it will last 100 times longer, with the pocket clip it is not noticeably heavy in your pocket.

This knife could save your life.

Brand new the gun and all the extras would be over $1000, looking to sell for $750, also interested in trading by itself or with one of my other guns being posted today (Glock gen3 G36, Hungarian AK-47, Chinese SKS). Trades of interest include:

- AR-15 .300 AAC, short barrel (7.5"" to 10"", prefer the shorter) - if you have just the upper would be interested with cash or ammo on your side.
- Desert Eagle .44 or .357 (combined trade with about her gun, cash on either side to make even if needed)
- SCAR 17 (for the right SCAR would consider all 4 guns, but target is three of the guns)

I had this sold already, however the SoCal buyer has fallen through. 

For your consideration, I have a rare and unusual 12mm Gyrojet by MBAssociates from 1968-69. This was rocket-propelled technology from right here in San Ramon, CA. This does not shoot a traditional bullet, but rather a solid projectile filled with solid rocket fuel. The rounds have directional cut jets around the primer to create spin as it travels. Feature in the James Bond movie ""You Only Live Twice,"" this was Tiger Tanaka's weapon of choice for his secret Ninja commandos.  This is an amazing piece of firearm history.

Make: MBAssociates of San Ramon, CA

Model: Mark II Model C Gyrojet

Caliber: 12mm

Condition: New unfired condition in the box

Location: Dublin (SF East Bay)

Price: $3,000

Will ship (Y/N): Prefer local transfer at City Arms in Pleasant Hill, but will ship to your FFL at your expense

 These revolvers were formerly known as the M&P (Military & Police) Models before the number designation in 1957. There are two types of barrels: The Heavy Barrel, & the thin 'Pencil Barrel'...this is the old Classic Pencil Barrel that was used for most of the 20th Century by soldiers, cops, outlaws, trick shooters like Ed McGivern, & is seen in lots of old movies.
There were quite a few of the 5"" Barrels made back when this gun was known as the M&P, but they are rather scarce in the later Model 10 designations. The beauty part is; these later Models look the same, but handle the more modern higher pressure +P ammo, & hotter reloads....but this one has been babied.
 This gun is totally original, & has a very nice polished deep blued finish, & beautiful case colors on the hammer & trigger, with the factory Magna Grips.
There is only faint muzzle wear from light carry by the previous owner, & lock up/action are all you can expect from a well cared for vintage S&W."

1301 Comp: Ready to Go for 3-Gun Matches, Practical Shooting

The Beretta 1301 Comp semiauto shotgun is designed to win tactical competitions right out of the box. Combining the technology of Beretta’s best sporting shotguns with the requirements of the most demanding tactical shooters, it cycles faster than the competition, handles like a dream and has oversized controls for super-easy operation. It is available in two barrel lengths (21” and 24”) and its receiver is drilled and tapped for rail mounts, so that it can be equipped with optics or tactical aiming devices without any gunsmithing. And thanks to its Optimabore HP interchangeable choke system, it can also be adapted for other uses and will always perform like a Beretta.


Lightning-Fast Shooting, Easy Operation

The 1301 Comp features Beretta’s proprietary Blink gas-operating system, which enables it to shoot 4 shots in less than 1 second--that is, 36% faster than any other brand. But even with this tremendous advantage, Beretta’s engineers did not stop there. The controls are supersized so that the 1301 can be operated quickly and easily when seconds count: the cocking handle, bolt-release lever as well as the loading and ejection ports are oversized for simple and intuitive use under the heat of competition.


Ultra-Durable Steelium Barrel

The barrel of the 1301 Comp is made of Steelium, Beretta’s own steel blend designed to give premium performance even after tens of thousands of rounds. It features a stepped, wide sporting rib that minimizes mirage, and it has both a mid-bead and front fiberoptic sight for instinctive pointing under most lighting conditions. And thanks to the Optimabore HP choke system, the 1301 offers unmatched ballistic performance, with constant patterns regardless of load used.


Best-in-Class Tactical Stock

Having worked with military and police forces all around the world, Beretta offers you decades of experience building firearms that meet the strictest demands of professional shooters. The 1301 embodies this experience, with its short stock with aggressive non-slip checkering for positive handling under the stress of competition. Also, the length of pull is user-adjustable so that this shotgun will give you the best fit and the most natural pointing regardless of your shooting style, thickness of clothing or body size.

I've put less than 400 rounds through this tack driver and it shoots like a dream! I am selling because we have enrolled my very independent four year old daughter in preschool and her education is a higher priority than keeping this rifle. Your LNIB OBR will come freshly cleaned and lubricated, wrapped in a plastic bag, stored in a Plano-style hard case, and shipped in a LaRue Tactical box. The only way you'd know it wasn't shipped directly from LaRue is because of the shipping label and clear packing tape. There is a long line for folks waiting on rifles from LaRue - you can get this one in days.

The rifle is outfitted with: 
MagPul CTR Stock
Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA) trigger
Seekins Precision billet magazine release button
LaRue Tactical APEG grip (can swap back to the original MagPul if you prefer)

In addition to the 18"" OBR 5.56 rifle, you'll receive: 
LaRue Tactical ball cap equipped with Tactical Ear Retaining Devices (TERDS) It will not be the Owners Edition hat, because thats worn. I will provide a new hat.
MagPul PMAG 30 (times two - provided they are legal to possess in your area of operation)
LaRue Tactical Dillo
LaRue Tactical Dillo Dust (sealed)
Documentation
Gun Lock

Fine Print:
1. This rifle has wear marks, as one would expect, on the rail from LT mounts. They don't show up well in the pictures below, but they exist.
2. The Grip Adapter Panels (GAP) were originally black and have been Duracoat sprayed to match the UDE color because LaRue didn't offer colored GAPs at the time. I can leave on the Duracoated GAPs or replace with new black GAPs - your choice.
3. The LT marked front and rear Troy battle sights, prone optimization device, cheekweld riser in the picture are NOT included but if you're interested we can work them into the deal.

Payment:
1. Price is $2,400 shipped CONUS
2. I can accept payment via PayPal (+3%), Credit Card by telephone (+4%), and USPS Money Order
3. I may be interested in a Springfield TRP 1911 as partial trade"

It's too small for my fat sausage fingers. I used to refer to this as my tuxedo gun, and I usually reserved carrying it for formal occasions. Somehow it reminds me of the Walther PPK in that manner.

Included in the package is the Kimber, one mag, the original carrying case (with original paperwork), and two holsters. One is a White Hat Holsters IWB horsehide/kydex holster. The other is a combo IWB holster that you can take the clip off, and it becomes a pocket holster. This is the way I usually carried the gun.

To Place An Order for Shipment: Email a list of the items you want, along with your full name, shipping address, and the email address and phone number where I can best reach you. You will then receive an order confirmation email from me with your total due and detailed payment instructions. 

PLEASE NOTE:  Requested items are made available to other customers if product is not picked up or payment is not received within 7 days and special arrangements for delayed payment haven't been made. 

If you were referred to me by a friend, please let me know so that they can get 10% off their next order as a thank you. If you refer me to a friend or shooting buddy after your order is received and they give me your name at the time of their order - you will receive 10% off your next order. 

Payment is by check or money order. Personal checks and brands of money orders other than US postal money orders must clear before shipping. If payment is made by US postal money order, your package will ship out the same day payment is received.

Offers for amounts other than the price that is listed CAN NOT be considered as all product is priced based on what I have invested in it. The prices for my long list of available powders start at $29/lb and go up depending on how much I had to pay for the case that you are buying from. I am paying the same jacked up retail prices that most of us are having to pay and I travel extensively through multiple states to find supplies for my base of established customers. 

I do not have the ability to buy wholesale and buy only factory sealed cases from established retail outlets and vendors. I CANNOT AND DO NOT **BUY FROM INDIVIDUALS** OR **TRADE PRODUCT** due to my commitment to providing factory fresh, quality, and intact product to my customers.

I'll also sell it as a complete rifle with a DPMS lower on it (just a standard lower, carbine setup) for a total of $850 - All laws followed, waiting period, etc.  Who ever purchases the upper will also have first shot at the ammo I have for it - I have 5 unopened 7n6 tubs (4 still in crates - with two to a crate) and another 1080 rounds not in a spam can (can was opened and ammo moved into a ammo box - but is still in the wrappers - so there are the 36 bundles of 30 rounds each).   I'm looking for $600 for the upper.  The buyer will have first crack at the ammo and the 12 mags for it (that have the correct follower for 5.45 in them) - 10 C Products 5.45x39 mags, and 2 AR Stoner 5.45x39 mags - looking for $140 for the Mags, and $225 a spam can, but will discount it with the upper purchase.

As stated in the title this is a hand built gun with a spikes tactical lower and palmetto upper and parts pack. It has a tapco hand grip and a tactical flashlight as well as a tactical, nylon carry bag. As shown in the photo I have amassed a large stash of ammunition worth damn near the asking price. I have never shot the Tullammo through it but was told by the builder that the only thing it wears out over thousands of rounds is a $3 part. Thats why I bought as much as possible. THERE ARE OVER 500 ROUNDS INCLUDED WITH THIS GUN! COME AND GET IT! NO TRADES UNLESS IT IS A HOME DEFENSE SHOTGUN AND I WILL NOT GIVE MORE THAN $150 IN TRADE FOR IT.
