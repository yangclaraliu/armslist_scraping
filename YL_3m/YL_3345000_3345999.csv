The new GLOCK 42, in .380 AUTO, is a slimline subcompact pistol engineered with the GLOCK Perfection promise and able to withstand the rigors of routine training. Made in the USA, the G42 is the smallest pistol GLOCK has ever introduced, making it ideal for pocket carry and shooters with smaller hands. Years of requests across market groups for a super-concealable, reliable single-stack .380 GLOCK pistol prompted extensive research and development to bring the GLOCK customer the G42."

Best quess is the lube dried by the time I got to that last case. Fairly new to reloading, so in my unknowledged attempt to remove the stuck case I ruined my die. So I need a new die to replace it, don't want to have to buy a whole new set if I don't have to.
I was a using the Hornady full length sizer and have had no problems cycling rounds in either of my ARs. Some people say the small base RCBS die is better for the AR platform. Either way, I know either of them work.


If possible I'd like to trade for them, mostly what I'd have to offer is some ammo. I have a ton of steel cased .223, a couple boxes of brass 5.56x45, a couple boxes of factory load brass .40s&w. I do have some Hornady .40cal XTP bullets that I can part with.

If trade isn't an option, I'm wlling to pay as much as $25 for a Hornady full length die or $35 for the RCBS small base die.That's the cheapest I found them for shipped online, just would rather not have to wait on shipping. To get those prices the die must be in as new condition! Older,well used dies aren't worth it to me unless they are cheaper.

It features a cool side folding/ locking bayonet and 10 rd detachable magazine. This one was showing some ware on the bluing so I had the barrel and receiver black nickel plated. Its more of a gray nickel look to me. Has a shiny bore and is in overall great condition. A lot of these were painted with this black textured paint from the importer, which looks great on the stock. Not so great on upper hand guard. It was flaking off in some spots because paint doesn't stick as well to metal. I cleaned it all off of hand guard and repainted it.

The grip has been shortened for use with the 9 round magazines for the SR40C (compact model). The pistol has also been upgraded with parts from Galloway Precision, including a stainless guide rod, stainless striker indicator, and smooth it trigger kit. The smooth it kit adds performance springs to the trigger assembly as well as replacing the factory striker blocker along with the striker blocker spring. The trigger safety has been omitted by fusing the two piece trigger together, so the trigger would need to be replaced if the trigger safety was desired. All factory parts included and can teach you how to detail strip entire pistol. 
Included are 3 magazines, 2 are 15 round and one compact 9 round with both flat base as well as the pinky extension base. Both the 15 round mags have been custom finished to provide a full grip, both are rubber coated, using black plasti-dip. One was made using stacked leather the way a kabar handle is made, the other utilized an SR40C magazine extension.
Have ammo depending on trade, 200 rounds of fmj and 100 hollow points available. FMJ 100 Winchester White box and 100 Federal. HP 50 Winchester Ranger Bonded, 50 Atomic Ammunition Match grade defensive hp. $150 in ammo, so if all ammo is on the table I consider $600 as total trade value. $475 for the pistol with no ammo, as there is $100 in upgrade parts and time in fabricating the magazines for clean tight fit. Second owner, was told that it had 300 or 400 rounds though it when I bought it, I have personally put 450 through it, no failures to fire or eject, ever. 

I'm in no hurry, nor do I need to sell.  I just prefer all metal guns, which is why this is being posted.  Trade value negotiable to an extent.

I have a bunch of pictures, hopefully they upload properly if not I can email them to you."

Pistol was purchased in Texas about 5 years ago and has less than 500 rounds through it. The reason for sale is it does not get shot much and is taking up room in the safe. Price is $250.00 cash or would consider trade for reloading equipment of equal value. Sorry I do not have the case anymore. E-mail for pictures.

I have modified it for use with the KAC 600m rear sight (P/N 25650) seamlessly. This would look great on a Mk12 MOD1

The sleeve was previously painted, and has been carefully removed with Methylene Chloride (Satan in a can). It is about 99.99% removed. The only place where a very minor amount of paint residue remains is in the lettering on the right side. (You really have to look close though...I don't think the buyer will be disappointed)

At the bottom of the ad shows a photo of the rifle it was mounted on (not included). I filed it for a snug fit *right* up to the rear sight.

If you feel my price is too high, with all respect please purchase a factory new ARMS #36 instead, and do the modification yourself. This is a neat modification that takes some time and talent to properly do, and I think the buyer will be very pleased.

Blueing is great. Gun is like new.
Everything works well and locks up tight. Nice revolver. Got it in a trade but don't need another full sized revolver. I'll drive to meet you. (within reason)

It's the old style Model 66 which is a clone of the S&W Model 66-1 K-frame. 
I shot it side by side with my fathers S&W K-frame and it's exactly the same.

Shoots .357 Magnum, .38 special, and .38 special +P rounds.
Very fun to shoot. You could shoot cheap .38 special bullets all day and save some money on ammo.

These sell new for around $600.
A shop would be selling one used in this good of condition for over $500. 

If you don't have a full sized revolver I'd recommend one like this.

Taurus has a Lifetime Warranty that follows the gun.

Buying bulk 556/223 ammo as well. Looking for 500+ rounds for both. 

Im in the market for a PS90. Im not paying any funny guy prices. I can get it in store for 1100 with 30 of them still at the distributor and I can get it for 1000 on gunbroker. Im offering cash, send me an offer. I dont need your 1200$ acog on it either. Looking for stock with maybe extra mags. 

looking for an FNAR, not the wood/painted stock only the tactical model. Used/New doesnt matter.

Also considering a SCAR 16, I have multiple trades + cash Id do for that. 

Dont email me craziness, I know some of you think everything you touch turns to platinum, but trust me it doesnt."

 Magpul Trigger Guard w/ screw kit
YHM Yankee Hill Extended Take Down Pins (not shown in pictures)

This lower has only been mounted to an upper and dry cycled, (never fired). I put this together last month with big plans for it, but unfortunately wont be happening...  I have close to $415.00 in receipts for this lower...  For the serious ones interested in purchasing this, I can give you names and numbers of a few people that are currently using Lowers that I built them. (for verification that I know what I am doing)

340.00 firm...  300.00 firm w/o Rogers Stock.  The stock is the only part I will remove to change price!  Must sign Bill of Sale.  Low-ball offers will be ignored.
Thank You for looking"

This example features Browning name and logo on the butt stock and the barrel, a 30"" ported barrel, factory choke tubes, and after market fiber optic sights with additional tubes. This is a rare Browning also because it was one of a limited run of Belgian made browning in 1998 as most were made in Japan at that time. This was confirmed by Browning customer service and they also confirmed that this was an even further limited run as indicated by the Browning name and logo on the barrel and butt stock. All things considered including its condition (90%) I am asking $1000 for it mostly because it is so rare. I can also throw in a few boxes of 12 gauge so sweeten the deal."
