This listing is for One revolver. Dealers, Departments and Collectors, however, are welcome to take any number of virtually identical specimens we might have on Hand. Revolvers chambered in .45 Colt caliber have multitasked for many years. Thompson Center’s Contender barrel created quite a stir forty years ago, with heated discussion over whether it constituted a sawed off shotgun. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer classified it as such. Taurus introduced its Judge series at the 2006 SHOT Show, by our poor memory, and it has made enough of a splash that Smith & Wesson followed with the Governor four years later. What is distinctive, of course, about the Taurus Judge is that while it fires .45 Colt caliber ammunition very well, it will also chamber and fire .410 gauge shotgun shells. This one, unlike many of its siblings, will chamber and fire 3 inch .410 shells. Manufacturer is Forjas Taurus, S.A., of Porto Alegre, Brazil. Importer is Taurus International of Miami. Numbered model is 4410; factory order number is 2-441049MAG, and this is one of the harder to find variants. Construction is entirely stainless steel, with the exception of internal springs and the front sight housing. Finish is satin stainless, with hard finish stainless hammer and trigger. Barrel is one piece, 4 inch 1:12 rifling with shallow grooves. Front sight is dovetailed blue steel housing a high visibility red fiber optic tube, with frame integral fixed groove rear sight. Trigger is .395 smooth face combat type with matching width semi-target serrated short spur hammer. Ignition is floating firing pin, and the hammer operates against a transfer bar safety device, and also houses Taurus’s patented internal hammer lock. Ejector rod is checkered serration stainless, and Taurus’s detent locking system for the cylinder yoke ensures stability with dual cylinder anchoring. Grips are Taurus Factory Ribber with horizontal serrations, sure gripping and recoil absorbent. Overall length is 9 inches. Weight empty is a well balanced 37 1/2 ounces with center of gravity at the front guard junction. This judge holds 5 rounds of U.S. Made .410 gauge 2 1/2 inch or 3 inch Shotshell, or any brand of .45 Colt Caliber ammunition. Judges exhibit difficulty in extracting imported .410 spent hulls, but no problems at all with any of the big three U.S. Manufacturers – Federal, Winchester, or Remington. This specimen is what we call a factory demo, most likely a sales rep’s sample that served as a showgirl in industry trade shows like the annual SHOT Show in Las Vegas. It was manufactured in 2012 or 2013. Box is marked, Factory Reconditioned, as the photos show. That sticker simply means that Taurus will service this revolver for any mechanical issues, but will not perform a freebie refinish. It does not need a refinish anyway. Surface detractions are minimal to negligible, really no more cylinder rotation marking than brand new specimens on display in gun shops. Bore, cylinder chambers, and mechanism are all bright and clean. It comes in its original box with two keys for its hammer lock, protective wrappers, and instruction manual. Replacement pricing on this Judge is upwards of $700 in our area. We’re offering the 3 inch chambered, 4 inch barreled Judge in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates,		 for only 	$ 459.00.  Not transferable to civilian residents of California, the District of Colombia, or Massachusetts. Any ammunition showing in our photos is NOT included. Shooting watermelons is considered sacrilegious in Tennessee and Mississippi.

Big medicine for those born 100 years too late. The sporting tradition, American history and good ol’ fashioned quality craftsmanship come together in this big-bore rifle built to celebrate a legacy that began in 1871. Modeled after the Frank Wesson tip-up rifles that were first made in Worcester, Massachusetts in the 1850s. Chambered for the 45-70 Gov't. cartridge, this rifle reflects true 19th century styling with antique color case hardening on the frame and a crescent butt plate. Its handsome American walnut stocks and fore-ends are accentuated by cut checkering.

Buffalo Classic Rifle
Traditional styling and aiming stability were foremost in its design. Offered in 45-70 Gov’t., its 32"" midweight barrel helps this big-bore cartridge develop full velocity and accuracy potential. It also provides the necessary sighting radius for long-range matches. The Williams receiver sight is complemented by a traditional globe-style target front sight with eight aperture inserts."

I don't know very much about Firearms or Cannons so I can't really tell you a lot in detail. 

I purchased this from someone that needed the money at the time and now I'm in the same situation.

The Cannon is approx. 4' wide x 4' tall x 7'long. So hopefully from those measurements you can tell the actual cannon size. It shoots concrete balls the size of a tennis ball (2.63 in. in diameter). It's a black powder cannon. We have everything that goes with it. 

We fire it every 4th of July so it gets a good cleaning at least once a year. It does have some surface rust but nothing major that can't be brushed off with a wire brush.

If interested I can be reached vial E-Mail or phone.

I am willing to sell/trade for a decent carry pistol.

First up is an AR-15 223/556 100 round drum. It has been loaded but not fired from. Included is the carrying case with a speedloader, lube, and owner's manual. (Sold)

 Next up is an Everlast MMA/Boxing bag stand with a speed bag and heavy bag. I bought it about 2 months ago. It is practically brand new, and has been kept inside. I'll take $150 O.B.O

The last item is a men's 14k yellow gold ring with quality diamonds set in platinum. This is an heirloom and I don't know much about the value of jewelry, but I do know it is a high quality piece that was valued close to $1000 nearly 20 years ago. It has a mark of 123 JTC, which according to a little research showed that it most likely came from Zales about 40 to 50 years ago. I'm willing to take $400 O.B.O for it, and I would prefer someone buy it at that price than a jewelry store, which will end up turning it around at 300% profit.

I am looking to sell/trade either of the items separately or together depending on offers. I will also send more information and  pictures via email, or you can come look at the items in person, on the NE side of Albuquerque. I am available most of the day."

Eurolux is some defunct Chinese company from the 80s as far as I can tell. The scope works fine and has held zero for many hunting trips being dragged through the woods.  All other parts are original and historically accurate. 

I do not have the original rear sight unfortunately. They're available from Nurmrich or whatever other fine purveyor of gun parts suits your fancy for around $30, as these are not uncommon rifles. I'd recommend getting the Mk2 rear sight if you plan to replace the scope, as while it's not historically accurate it's much better-designed.

The surface of the frame is the Generation 4 Rough Textured Frame scientifically designed, real world tested. Internally, the Glock dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right handed shooters.

 Shown here is an S&W .38 M&P Model of 1905 (4th Change) (SN: 272***); in speaking to S&W today, I learned it was made in 1917. The question I’ve got is: How can I best discern it’s grade? Using these two sites (http://www.nramuseum.org/gun-info-research/evaluating-firearms-condition.aspx, http://www.1stclassfirearms.com/Grading.htm), I’ve learned that the grading criteria for this revolver is different than that of a “newer” revolver (since it is pre-1920), and judging by descriptions given in the latter resource, this revolver appears to be Good to Very Good (30% - 70%).

Alas, this is all subjective. Anybody have any experience on grading these old 5-screws? Please help!

When it comes to reliability and tactical flexibility, nothing matches the FABARM FP6 Series shotguns. Security professionals agree that a pump-action shotgun is still the best choice for a defensive shotgun. FABARM FP Series shotguns are built to take the toughest abuse confronting today’s law enforcement and security users.

FABARM pump-action shotguns use the same advanced design and manufacturing techniques found on their premium arms. Twin action bars, deep drilled TriBore™ barrels, durable sandblasted anodized finish, as well as interchangeable chokes, make the FP6 one of the strongest and most tactically adaptable pump-action security and utility shotguns available. The ability to mount accessory Picatinny rails on the extended forearm, combined with the rail mount built onto the receiver of many of the FP6 models further enhances the tactical utility of this shotgun.

Features:
• Tribore™ chrome lined barrel with heatshield 
• free carrier for quick, smooth reloading 
• extended forearm has hard points for mounting accessories 
• threaded outer barrel for chokes 
• Ergal 55 alloy receiver 
• can use a variety of accessories, including folding stocks, compact handgrip, and magazine extension 
• twin forged action bars for smooth reliable operation 
• 3"" chamber

Baby on the way, need to clear some stuff out for diaper fund. No time to shoot..

I bought this last winter from my elderly neighbor who was moving into an assisted living facility. Said he bought it new 20+ years ago and only used it for ""whackin' squirrels"". The old squirrel stock was really nice so I put it on my other M60. This new ATI stock was purchased two months ago, looks 100% new. Very nice light weight package, tube holds 17 rounds. Trigger is much better than new ones, bluing is really nice besides top right of barrel, picture shows a small batch of light pitting. I stripped the rifle down and gave it a throughout cleaning and fired exactly 10 tubes of ammo. In 170 rounds I only had 2 malfunctions. Both rounds FTF, but as is expected when firing bulk ammo. Runs like a Champ! Don't want to sell but I have 3 other M60s..
Thanks for looking,

Then replaced the standard stock with a new fixed Magpul.  Replaced the cheap hand guard with a new, one-piece, free float, 15 inch Daniel Defense Lite Rail III.  Finished off the build with a Primary Weapons Systems FSC 556 muzzle brake.  

The stock A2 front sight/gas block was retained in order to ensure the strongest possible build.  

All of the work was performed by one of the most sought after smiths in this area, CDI customs.  At any given time, the man will have a 1 to 2 month back log.  He's so selective about his work that he wont accept jobs from people he hasnt serviced in the past.

Everything on this rifle is comprised of the highest quality parts and expert workmanship.

No expense was spared on this build.  The cost of the rifle and transfer fee ($1045), Daniel Defense Lite Rail III ($395), Magpul fixed stock ($45), PWS FSC556 brake ($95) and modification/compliance work ($150) came to over $1700.

The Zastava PAP M85NP pistol is the perfect choice for shooters searching for a compact, easy to carry, powerful sidearm. With a small overall profile, the Zastava PAP M85NP is also an excellent choice for hunting varmints in heavy underbrush. Even though it's relatively lightweight, the efficient muzzle brake means that excessive recoil is simply not going to be a problem. The gas system is inspired by the legendary AK-47 rifle, and will chug right along under even the dirtiest of conditions.

These unique handguns readily accept common AR-15 magazines and drums, and are a great addition to any modern sporting firearm collection.

You still having a hard time convincing yourself or significant other of the NEED for another pistol. Well I can do one more option, $700 and you can make up the difference with a trade for the whole shebang. Now the only way I'll except a trade offer is $700 cash and a good enough trade where I feel it's in my favor. That being said I'm not expecting a $500 gun. A 12ga, 9mm, or the right 38 would tempt me as long as the cash was there to back it up.
