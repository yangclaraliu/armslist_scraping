The 3MR is a drop-in 3-mode fire control system with Safe, Semi-Automatic, and Tac-Con™'s patented 3rd Mode. The 3rd mode has a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible. Both semi and 3rd mode positions exhibit a non-adjustable 4.5 pound trigger pull weight.

Our cast receivers are made with 6061 aluminum. They are one of a kind in design, and have adaptations necessary to improve the functions of better hand placement on the magazine well. They also have over sized beveled walls all around the entry of the magazine wells to feed fast and easy. All season trigger guards have been included in the design to add additional strength and durability to the receiver.  

The Jig. This jig was engineered for those who have never machined or completed a receiver before. Simply drill four holes through the drill guide with a large 7/16"" drill, to remove the majority of the material initially. Prior to installing the milling guide template, to square out the rest of the trigger control cavity efficiently. The carbide end mill is included. 

Inside the standard kit, you have a Cast Receiver with the jig and all the hardware to install it into the fixture. A carbide end mill, DVD and step by step slideshow instructions so you can understand and work at your own pace. I also provide personal technical support for this product and can vocally assist you through this procedure on site for a fee of $60 and if needed rent you a drill press for an additional $20. Providing one on one education on the drilling and milling skills is an excellent experience you can embrace for the rest of your life, and continue to produce beautifully machined receivers on your own, I grantee it!

This system was designed to be self-contained, portable, and rugged enough for use out in the field, camping or in an emergency. With 18 amp hours this system provides enough power to recharge phones/tablets, batteries, laptops, run lights, fans or radios. All of the components are secured in a government issue 50 cal ammo can with input and output power delivered through marine grade dc (cigarette lighter style) plugs. This allows the batteries to charge with the lid closed and the components to stay safe from rain, dirt, or curious animals. The battery is protected from damage or overcharging with a sunforce charge controller and power is generated using a new 10 watt high efficiency mono-crystalline solar panel. This system is all hooked up and ready to provide off grid power on your next camping trip or when the power goes out at the house. Price is $300 firm.

Note: This is a 12V DC system which means you can plug anything in that you could plug into your cigarette lighter in your car. If you want to use it to power 110V AC (household style plugs) all you need is an inverter which are available at pretty much any big box store.

NOTE: The Raging Judge is different from other Taurus Judge models.  It will shoot three different cartridges: the .45 LC, the .410 shotgun shell AND the .454 casull. 

The .454 casull has about 3 times the muzzle energy of a .45 ACP round.  Yes... you read that correctly - THREE TIMES the energy.  Wanna put a home invader's dick in the dirt?  The .454 casull will do just that.

This gun is built by me on a PSA lower.  It's a Bravo upper with a 16"" Satern/Liberty barrel, DPMS free float tube, Daniel Defense brake and Windham BCG.  Scope is a Nikon 300 supersub on the Nikon mount.  The list of the rest of the parts is in one of the pics.  I'll throw in the rest of the range ammo I have for it as well.

These retail for 159.99 in most stores, so you are getting a great product at a reduced price with no taxes and shipping charges.  If you have an offer feel free to send it my way but I am pretty firm on this price because I bought it for 159.99+ tax online and it was not what i wanted. it was my mistake and now the company wants me to pay for return shipping plus restocking fees which brings me back to about 130. so I thought I would get it to someone locally who may need it."
