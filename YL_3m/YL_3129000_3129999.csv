What if your favorite range pistol could also shrink down for comfortable concealed carry?
The ideal concealed carry pistol would have all the features, performance and power you’d find in a full size handgun, but in a smaller package. The XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack from Springfield Armory® does exactly that. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack.
The XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack is a mid-sized single stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. The sub-compact frame extends to full size length when you insert an X-Tension™ magazine. Combined with the 4.0″ barrel, this gives you a pistol that’s ideal for a day at the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.
But the strengths of the XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with a flush fitting magazine, and you’ll find that your range pistol has shrunk into something that carries so easily that you’ll forget it’s there.
Choosing a multi-purpose handgun doesn't have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power or size. And you certainly don’t have to take a gun to the range that you’d rather not even shoot. Put an XD-S® 4.0″ Single Stack  in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

The JRC is a modular gun that is super easy to convert to exactly how you want it.  Fully ambidextrous with a bolt that can be switched to either side, as well as ejection port, means no more brass in the face for lefties.  It uses all the standard AR stocks, grips and hand guards as well as triggers so you can make it exactly how you like it.  Best of all you can easily adapt it to fire other calibers by swapping the bolt and barrel, or to use different mags by changing out the mag block.

This is not your typical plinking AR as it is expensive to feed and belongs out putting deer on the table. I have an Alexander Arms 6.5 Grendel M4 carbine that has been test fired with 20 rounds of Hornady 123grn AMAX. The carbine has a 14.5 barrel (made by Sabre Defense) with a welded and pinned 1.5inch flash hider to bring this to the legal minimum limit of 16 inches.  The value of the carbine is $1499.00 approximately as they no longer offer this barrel length. The carbine comes with a silicon cleaning cloth, instruction manual, (1) ten round magazine, (5) 26 round Alexander Arms magazines, brand new rear Troy Back Up Iron Sight, and KNS anti-rotation pins. If you are concerned about ammo, I have two boxes of 123 grain Hornady AMAX. If you live in Colorado then I can only supply the ten round magazine. The ammo is still in the case it was shipped in and is valued at $24.00 per box of twenty. If you decide that this offer is something you would like to move forward with then we go to a local FFL. I do have multiple photos to be emailed to you if you are interested. If one carbine is not enough for you, I have three Alexander Arms consecutive serial number carbines waiting for that father sons hunting trip. I would be happy to sell all to you for $1000.00 each. I will pay for all the transfer and shipping fees.

Dont be a tard and come at me with a $600 Cetme that doesnt work an SKS or Wasr. With $200 worth of crap strapped to it or anything bolt action.   All you will do is embarrass yourself...."

Designed as SIG’s entrant in the military trials to replace the 1911, today the P226 is in use by the Federal agents, and numerous law enforcement agencies including the Texas Rangers, Ohio State Highway Patrol and the Michigan State Police to name a few. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make this full-size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 Navy is identical to the pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs-the fleet's special warfare operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs.

This is professional work, not the hack jobs that you see floating around here. The cost for this labor was 200.00, but I am entertaining selling the pistol at a great price point of 500.00, or trade for like-value. 

This is a great way to get your hands on a custom piece without the shipping or lag time. 

As for the pistol, it is brand new, unfired. I purchased it specifically for building it custom, but find it is a bit aggressive for my soft jazz hands. The frame is the only custom component, and I have not sunk any more time or money into anything else. The pistol will include a holster, perhaps ammo if need be, and the factory OEM stuff. 

I am not in a hurry to get out of this. So if you are making me an offer, don't think I will accept a lowball. Sale price is firm at 500.00."

This firearm is in fantastic shape. Excellent bore, smooth as butter action, no buggered up screw heads and very nice wood. I received this as a boy at age 10. I don't have anyone to pass it on to. I have had it for 45 years and it has been rarely shot, just a handful of deer. And when it was, I personally completely disassembled and properly cleaned, lubricated and reassembled the rifle. Like many of you, I am ridiculously conscientious of maintaining my firearm collection. Such a fantastic classic lever gun and if you do your part it will put every round in the size of a silver dollar at 100 yards. I know...I have done it. Rifle comes with a quality 100% leather sling and feed tube sling swivel, and 280 quality rounds of ammo. Hornady Lever (best factory .30-.30 out there) Federal, Remington Core-Lokt,  Hornady Whitetail, and Winchester. And it includes the ammo can! This add is for serious buyers who understand and appreciate what owning an awesome original owner, Pre 1964 Winchester 1894 lever gun is all about. I clearly dont need to sell this package but its time to let a younger shooter get ahold of one of these rare gems. I've seen them anywhere from $1500 to $700 depending on quality. Well quality isn't an issue here I can assure you! With that being said I will let it all go for $849.00. Sorry guys but Im selling all of it together unless someone wants to make splitting it up worth my time. I'm not in the listing and selling business so its kind of a pain. Please let me know if you would like to see it. I can drive within an hour or so to meet. Prefer CCW but for sure ID and signed bill of sale. More pictures by request as I know the one posted aren't that great and don't do the rifle justice......"

The Colt LE6920 is all MIL-SPEC and has a 16"" barrel with a 1/7 twist and is chrome lined. It has M4 feed ramps, an individually inspected and stamped bolt from the Colt Factory, an M16 bolt carrier and an ""H"" (Heavy) Stamped Buffer. This rifle sets the bar for ""MIL-SPEC"" rifles. Included on the rifle is a long list of aftermarket parts that i will have listed below. I am also wanting to sell with this rifle a 420 round ammo can of Federal 62 Gr. XM855 Green Tips and 7 Magpul P mags. 6 of the mags are windowed and 1 is the regular p mag that came with the rifle. 5 of the mags are also loaded with 30 rounds of the XM855 Green Tip ammo. I am asking $2100 for everything or $1900 without the ammo. I will not part out this rifle but I will sell ammo separately. If you read through the list of parts on this rifle I think you'll find this is a pretty great deal. E-mail me with any questions. All emails asking for trades or low ball offers will not be responded to unless you have an Arsenal AK47 with extras that are at or above the same value I'm asking for this setup. TY Pat

Firearm is blued, not parkerized; bluing in good condition with exception of traffic areas, like under the dust cover and around gas tube.
Gun functions with no issues and is relatively accurate.
Purchased this at a gun show some years ago, so I have no idea what the round count is.

Interesting to this model is the presense of all three fire notches including one for full auto. Obviously this is non functional and for LOOKS ONLY.
This is NOT a Century import or build, rather a kit that was built state-side by either a company or individual, and they did a very good job.

Comes with two Master Moulder 30 round polymer magazines.
I actually have a total of 12 more if someone wants all of them with the rifle they'll be $100 extra.
I use them for range mags, they work just as well as Tapcos in my experience.

Norinco SKS Model MC-5D takes AK mags..............

This is a rare variant that was factory built to accept AK mags instead of the old style ""Duck Bill"" SKS mags.  It is all original and has not been modified or ""Bubba'd"".

It is in very good condition with minor handeling marks on the stock that is pretty typical, nothing major. All metal is in great condition, the bore and bolt are like new looking.  This doesn't appear to have been fired very much at all, most likely it was more of a ""Safe Queen"".

I purchased this for my collection, cleaned it up and put her away in the safe and never fired it.

Comes with 2 AK 30 round mags.  These are newer mags not the originals that came with the rifle from the factory.

I have additional photo's I can email, feel free to ask questions, I will reply as soon as I can.

*** Please, serious inquires only ***

If the listing is up, then it's available. Sorry but I'm not interested in trades at this time.
I'm firm on my price of $500

I'm located in the Clearwater, MN area and you must be willing to meet at my location or very close. You must also be willing to provide a copy of your current and valid DL & PTP/PTC and sign a Bill of Sale, no exceptions. CASH ONLY !"
