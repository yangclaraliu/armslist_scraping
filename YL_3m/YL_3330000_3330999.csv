I have noticed it’s been awhile since anyone has held an Open Carry gathering. These meetings are important, particularly because it gives citizens the ability to assemble, pass ideas, information and be amongst others that share the same ideas and beliefs. I would like to take this time to extend my hand out and say I would be one amongst many that I’m sure would be interested in attending such a meeting. The last one that I know of took place a couple years ago at Cracker Barrel in which they were more than happy to allow such a meeting, which went exceptionally well, being that it was the first one that I knew of. I say to you all, let’s get the ball rolling and safely practice something others have work so hard for us to keep and maintain. Open to ideas and suggestion. Thank you for reading."

Ruger Redhawk revolver.  SS, 4"" barrel, 45 Colt caliber
I just bought this last month and realize that I've been buying too much.  It is newish production without the large barrel side legends.  Fired little and in great shape.  It has a pair of elk bone grips installed that really look awesome.  Will also include a pair of standard rosewood grip panels.  Complete with box and paperwork!  $850  

The Grashorn elk bone grips are sold for $175 by their maker. If you are interested in the Redhawk with only the factory rosewood grips, I will sell it without the elks for $750. 


Here is the description from the previous owner and I cannot add anything to it since I have not even fired it!
Ruger Redhawk in .45 Colt with a four inch barrel and is fitted with smooth elk bone grips from Patrick Grashorn. It is in outstanding condition and comes with the original box.  Ruger seems to have hit the nail on the head with this gun: all my .452 diameter bullets pass through the throats with gentle pressure and the warning roll marks are small and underneath the barrel (please see photos). This gun is very accurate and was a delight to shoot. I experienced no light strikes or failures to fire. Cylinder: lock up is tight without backward and forward play; the cylinder is virtually one with the frame during full lock up. Timing: all six cylinder bores line up with the barrel perfectly. Bore: there is no pitting, worn-out rifling, or bulges of any sort. Trigger: SA mode is smooth but heavy and the DA pull is without grinding throughout or undue stacking at the end.

Please email me for fastest response to any questions or to purchase.  Thanks!

Model 7600™ centerfire rifle will get you back on target – instantly. Because not only are they built to deliver legendary Remington® first-shot accuracy, they’re also designed for ultra-fast follow-up shots – without ever having to unshoulder your rifle.

Our ever-popular Model 7600 is one of the most proven deerslayers in the woods. It has a 22"" barrel, a four-round magazine and is available in wood and durable synthetic models. All of our centerfire pumps feature quick-release magazines and Remington’s rotary bolt lock-up design for exceptional strength, safety and reliability.

You can't find a big-game rifle with a better combination of practical shooting features: twin action bars provide slick, smooth operation for rapid repeat shots; a quick-release, drop-out four-round magazine that loads and unloads instantly; and a free-floated barrel that matches the accuracy of the best bolt guns.

An ideal cross-over rifle for pump-gun wingshooters. A Monte Carlo walnut stock with a satin finish is standard. An optional high-gloss finished stock available in 270 Win. and 30-06 calibers.

We've taken the world's most popular pump-action deer gun and given it the extra toughness and weather resistance of a fiberglass-reinforced synthetic stock and fore-end.

Metal work and stock have a black matte non-reflective finish, and the butt stock is furnished with a black rubber recoil pad. Like its walnut-stocked brother, the 7600™ Synthetic has twin action bars for smooth cycling; a quick-release, drop-out four-round magazine; and a free-floated barrel that matches the accuracy of the best bolt guns.
Key Features:

    Robust slide-action design allows for fast follow-up shots in the harshest conditions.
    Action, slide release and safety based on the design of the Model 870™, America's most popular pump shotgun, for instantaneous end user familiarity.
    Weight distribution and slim line design result in shotgun like balance and pointability.
    22"" barrel with iron sights and receiver drilled and tapped for scope mounts allow for multiple sighting options.
    Rotary-bolt lock-up provides rock-solid action strength.

I have a set of 20 inch GM Chevy GMC wheels. They came off a 2006 Chevrolet Silverado. I just bought the truck. It had 24"" wheels on it already the previous owner just gave them to me as part of the deal. There is some curb rash little pitting I'm some. Two of the tires look 98% brand new and the other two are at like 25% of life. I don't need them sitting around I'm going to keep the 24's on it and not worry about the factory wheels.

When I did take it to the range, it fired well, but would not lock back on an empty magazine. I suspect it needs a new slide stop and spring. The edge of the slide stop is worn. The gun shows some wear overall. It has 3 magazines. One with the Pearce +2 extension, one brand new mag with the factory +2 extension that I bought after I got the gun, and one Promag.

If you have a flare gun not pictured/listed here. you may contact me to have one custom made for you!Some things to consider when purchasing from Sparks Trust:First we would like to thank you for coming down this far and reading this entire ad in its entirety. With crowdfunding being very popular nowadays, we doubt that we would be able to meet the $15k goal in the time allotted. Not to mention many of those places take a fee off the top.We decided to start selling the flare gun sights on several websites in order to generate funds for this ongoing project. The flare guns sites have gone through thousands of changes, tweaks and upgrades over the past 18 months. They have gone from a concept stage all the way through to a work of art in addition to its obvious functionality. We have also implemented additional accessories for the sight including the lower rail and a new ammo caddy. The lower rail was designed to allow the user to attach a laser or flashlight to the bottom of the flare gun. The ammo caddy will allow those same features, in addition to holding additional ammo at your fingertips.There are also other features and accessories I would like to bring to the market, however financing is a big challenge not only for this project but for several other projects and innovations to the firearms industry.By purchasing a flare gun sight you are helping to fund these projects. Donations are also accepted to further the projects. We appreciate and value every sale, every customer and every donation.The next big innovative project we would like to bring to the firearms industry is The Double Standard. We do have a Patent Pending. Do you own a firearm that only comes with one size of magazine? Do only some of the magazines you have work flawlessly?The Double Standard is a magazine adapter that allows the user to take two standard capacity magazines and turn it into one higher capacity magazine. So many firearms on the market today only come in one size of magazine. You couldn't buy another size even if you wanted to. For instance, the Ruger SR22 only comes in a 10-round magazine. The Sig Sauer Mosquito, The Walther P22 and the tt-33 series only come in 8 or 9 round magazine capacity. The Romanian PSL has a lot of magazine seating problems, as well as the magazines themselves are ridiculously expensive. The Double Standard eliminates the problems associated with magazine seating correctly as well as provides you with additional ammunition for your firearm.

Here is the full description from Nightforce.  
What’s in a name? In this case, everything. Our all-new ATACR™—Advanced Tactical Riflescope—builds upon the long and successful history of our NXS™ series. The result is a riflescope of unprecedented long-range capability and image quality.

The 34mm tube allows 120 MOA/34.9 Mils of elevation adjustment—20% more than our most capable NXS™. Fully multi-coated ED glass results in light transmission values of over 90%, brilliant images and exceptional color contrast. A magnification range of 5x to 25x, and a wider field of view as a result of its unique optical prescription (17.96 feet at 5x) will cover virtually any situation a shooter could encounter.

All this power comes in a compact package, too, measuring just 14.3″ in length. Our patented ZeroStop® is standard, and the ATACR™ is offered with two of our most sophisticated reticles, leaving nothing to chance.

The ATACR™ redefines the “long” in long range for serious shooters and hunters, pushing the envelope of precision…and possiblity.

Attached are the iron ""rain"" sights and a Doctor Optic back-up red dot. With the dual-illuminated reticle, the ACOG provides shooters with a distinct aiming point in all light conditions--without batteries. Powered by a tritium-phosphor lamp, the gunsight's reticle glows in low-light conditions, while advanced fiber optics automatically adjust the brightness level and contrast of the reticle in brighter light conditions. Broadband, anti-reflective coated lenses provide superior clarity and light gathering capabilities with zero distortion. The ACOG also offers large eye volume, giving you greater leeway--fore and aft, and from side to side--with which to see through the lens.
