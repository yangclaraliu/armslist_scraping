As the only pistol on the market made with the same steel as the Vulcan 20mm Gatling Gun, Patriot Missile, Abrams tank, and more, the Gladiator provides tremendous longevity. The gun components that are made using 17-4PH stainless steel include the frame, slide, slide stop, thumb safety, grip safety, hammer, and main spring housing.

To create the 1911 Gladiator, Maximus Arms took a traditional 1911 pistol and made more than 80 dimensional changes to improve the gun's reliability, accuracy, and functionality. In addition, Maximus Arms took numerous features that other manufacturers offer as optional at an additional cost, and made them standard on the 1911 Gladiators.

No Hidden Credit Card Fees!
Maximus Arms Arms 1911 Gladiator 70 Series .45ACP 5-inch
DETAILS
Each 1911 Gladiator is shipped in an airline-approved case along with two, eight-round mags, a cable lock, a brush, and a custom metal bushing wrench.

    StormLake Match Barrel, Bushing, Link, & Pin: Features precise cut broach rifling and seamless ramping from the frame, which prevents failure to feed the round into the chamber and improves accuracy.
    Custom High Ride Beavertail Grip Safety: A specially designed grip safety that allows your hand to fit higher under the slide than any other gun on the market, reducing felt recoil. The custom design also provides increased comfort and a very natural, intuitive grip, which increases accuracy.
    Commander-Style Hammer
    Ramp & Polish: Frame is ramped and hand polished to improve feeding and minimize jamming.
    Melted (Contoured) Edges: Smoothly contoured edges across the gun provide a natural and comfortable fit while simultaneously reducing drag in drawing and holstering the gun.
    Ready One Position Indentation: Ensures proper trigger finger placement in the Ready One Position as an additional safety feature and training aid. Also ensures proper finger placement for safe drawing and holstering of the gun, creating valuable muscle memory.
    Sprinco Recoil Reduction System: Stainless steel guide rod cushions the slide-to-frame impact, reducing muzzle climb, and tested to 100,000 rounds with absolutely no maintenance.
    Integral Plunger Tube: Manufactured into the gun, unlike a conventionally staked plunger tube. This reduces the risk of unseating and loss of the plunger spring, ensuring consistent pressure on the slide stop and thumb safety.
    Lowered & Flared Ejection Port: Smooth and reliable ejection of spent cartridges, reducing the possibility of stovepiping.
    Integral Ejector: Manufactured into the gun to eliminate the risk of loosening with use.
    Extended Thumb Safety: Easily deploy the safety without adjusting your grip.
    Extended Slide Stop: Easily deploy the slide release with one hand and minimal grip change. Unlike most 1911s, the slide stop is flush cut to reduce drag when drawing and holstering the gun."

The barrel has not been replaced and every number that I have found on the rifle is matching; stock, bolt, receiver, floor plate. This was a Steyr gun evidenced by the WaA623. Unknown as to what time period because of the Yugo Crest. 

The barrel is in decent condition. Not a sewer pipe, strong rifling, just a bit of light pitting starting in the grooves as I have shown in the pictures. The bore itself appears tight. I don't have a gauge but the bullet sits very high on the muzzle. 

The wood has not been sanded recently, the Yugo's may have done so initially. There are still battle scars present that can be felt in the wood.

The finish is worn, but not corroded off the rifle. And overall the metal is in good shape. A used, but not neglected rifle. 

The bolt locks down securely, and the safety clicks into place firmly. Doesn't seem like it was used very much as it has a very ""new"" feeling to it.

The trigger is crisp with a clean let off, and only minor creep. Accuracy is unknown since I have not tested the rifle.

XREP 12 gauge shotgun shells for sale. They are very rare and extremely effective as a non lethal projectile. This is the most advanced projectile ever made for a 12 gauge shotgun. It's basically the Tasers that police use made to fit inside a 12 gauge shotgun shell. It has the same effect, it's slightly more intense, and the effect lasts 5 seconds longer than the hand held Tasers. It can also be shot out of any standard 12 gauge shotgun from up to 100 feet. The blunt force trauma of the 4 barbs puncturing the skin and the subsequent NMI ( Neuro Muscular Incapacitation ) will send the strongest man on earth to the ground and will render him completely harmless.   A box of 5 retailed for $860. Now that they're a collectors item I've seen a box go for well above $1,000. I'm selling a fully functional full box of 5.

This listing is for a NIB Beretta ARX-100 5.56 rifle for $1749.99 + shipping and or taxes.  The ARX100 was engineered with one purpose in mind: to be today’s best tactical semiauto rifle.  The ARX100 features a constant contact/short-stroke gas piston system that makes it feed and fire under the most unforgiving conditions. The lightweight technopolymer receiver allows for reliable operation with virtually no lubricants. To make maintenance easy and trouble-free, this rifle has no pins and can be completely disassembled in a matter of seconds with no tools at all.This rifle was designed to be completely ambidextrous, and all the critical controls on it may be operated right- or left-handed. These include the 2-position safety, the magazine release, the bolt release and charging handle and the case-ejection selector, which determines whether spent brass is ejected to the right or left. The flip-up backup sights that come standard on the ARX100 are also versatile, offering an easily-adjustable diopter system ranged from 100 to 800 yards. The barrel is also easily replaceable in seconds, making is possible to use different lengths and calibers without any tools required. Lastly, the folding stock is adjustable for length of pull at the touch of a button, using a simple and rugged telescopic construction.  The possibilities for accessorization on the ARX100 are limited only by the user’s imagination. It comes out of the box with a full-length Picatinny rail on top, which is perfect for attaching a variety of optics and other sighting systems. It also has Picatinny rails on both sides of and under the fore-end, which offer countless possibilities for easily adding lighting systems and other tactical devices.

Its lightly used and in pretty good shape. Very accurate with minimal recoil, +P rated. This is the relatively rare six shot M856, not the M85; it is one of the very few 6 shot J frame sized .38 snubs out there. Easily pocket carriable which is a plus in the summer heat. Will include the gun and box it came with, around 50 rounds of assorted .38 special, two Bianchi speed strips, and an ankle holster.

I'm primarily interested in trading it for a Ruger SR40c as the title says, don't really care if its stainless or black. Might also consider a S&W M&P Shield in .40.  Prefer .40 but may consider the same guns in 9mm.

If not interested in trading I'd sell everything for $350

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with offers, texts preferred.

Thanks!"

392,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3453392,For Sale:  AN/PVS-4 2nd gen Night Vision Scope,"Beech Grove, Indianapolis, Indiana","$ 1,000","Listed On: Thursday, October 16, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is my AN/PVS-4 night vision scope.  It is second generation night vision which is far superior to 1st gen and surprisingly close in optical quality to earlier 3rd gen.  It is also far more durable than 1st generation night vision.  The Marines still use these things mounted on DMRs and heavy weapons such as the MK19 and M2HB.  It features adjustable gain and adjustable reticle brightness as well as changeable reticles.  It currently has an M14/ M60 reticle installed as seen in the third pic.  This scope is capable of being zeroed and used in broad daylight as well as well lit urban areas at night when used in conjunction with the included adjustable lense cover.  It is in overall decent condition for it's age and shows some scratches and scuffs on the housing.  The lenses are scratch-free and look new.  There are a few specs of dust on one of the lenses that appear as small black specs when looking through the scope.  They are circled in red in the last image.  It has been converted to take AA batteries and is capable of running on a pair of them for about 30hrs.  The screw-on cap for the battery housing shows quite a bit of wear from being installed and removed, but is still perfectly useable.  It has a custom ratcheting low profile QD mount that allows it to sit about 1/2"" off of the rail that it is mounted on.  It originally sat much higher which made a good cheek weld impossible.  I am asking $1,000 FTF for it, and am willing to ship assuming the buyer pays for shipping.  I am not interested in trades at this time.  Text me at 317-529-72ninenine"

The polished stainless steel finish and laser etching on the frame are available on all Kahr Elite K series pistols - the K9, MK9, K40 and the MK40. The lustrous finish complements our innovative designs and solid construction. The magazine well is beveled for easier magazine reloading. The feed ramp on the barrel is polished to a high luster to insure reliable feeding with all types of ammo. Laser engraving on the frame provides the finishing touch to the polished stainless steel - for an appearance as impressive as its capabilities.

I bought this from a friend who said the rifle was too loud for his covered enclosed shooting range. It is the ported rifle only made a few years by Marlin. I'm guessing 1977-78 and JM of course. It has a Simmons Whitetail Classic 2x10x44 scope. Has original sights as well. This rifle will out perform the 45-70 and is much flatter shooting and higher velocity with much less kick due to the ported barrel with almost the same knockdown power when using 400 and smaller grain bullets. It will kill anything walking. With the rifle comes 85 factory loads, 38 reloads, 200 new brass, 21 once fired brass, new Lee .444 Marlin loading dies, and a nice case. Price is very fair at 1100 with all the extras. I won't answer stupid lowball offers and don't want to trade. Look at my other ads. Don't need the money, just to warn the scavengers who want to take advantage of those who do. Just cleaning out the safes.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Less than 200 shells put through it, and I can include the sights (MBUS pop up sights), shoulderpad, and foregrip (Barska flashlight / foregrip combo) for 850.  

750 for just the shotgun."

Great gun - perfect for steels, 3gun, or any competition requiring a fast accurate handgun w/ quick easy reload - makes a good HD gun also with high round capacity and ease of aim - bought for a ex gf and I have my own so it sits in the safe and rarely gets used is why I want to go a different direction and make a bigger bang - it would take $1500 conservatively to build this package and its in 95% or better condition with low round count and lifetime warranty - dont waste your or my time with unreasonable offers as I'm not looking to give away the firearm - make reasonable offer and I will negotiate -  Im asking $1,100 obro - Thank you"

It is a pre cross bolt safety and has a very smooth action and tight lockup built in 1980. This rifle was built when Marlin was still hand fitting them, unlike the two recent bad 1894 Marlintons I have owned and returned due to failures.... Remington took over Marlin, fired all the employees and moved production in the 2000s... bad idea. Gun has never failed to cycle and will give 5 shot 2"" groups at 100 yards with my reloads and a 7x scope. Your mileage my vary. The previous owner allowed the barrel and magazine tube beyond the forearm on the non ejection port side to develop some surface rust. I have removed all the rust and cold blued it. Yes, it is not as dark as the original blueing, but it will prevent further rusting if kept oiled. The receiver is free of rust. There are some dings in the forearm and stock. I have completely (I mean every part came out) disassembled the action and cleaned it up to remove any surface rust. Gun comes with a Weaver scope mount, leupold rings  and the original iron sights.

798,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3453798,For Sale:  Buffalo Bore Ammo - 460 ROWLAND Ammo - 255 gr. HC-FN (1300fps / M.E.957 ft.lbs.) - 20 Round Box,"Azusa, California, United States",$ 32,"Listed On: Tuesday, September 2, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"https://www.extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=231

Again, as a result of popular demand, Buffalo Bore has added a new cartridge to its line—the 460 Rowland.

The 460 Rowland, as we load it, is squarely at mid 44 magnum power levels.  This means that a person can now carry a 1911 style combat pistol that has the power of a 44 mag. revolver, but is slimmer, faster to reload, faster to shoot and holds nine rounds instead of a revolver’s six.  The 460 Rowland casing is simply a 45 ACP case that has been slightly lengthened so it won’t chamber in a 45 ACP chamber.  It also has a stronger web area in the casing, so as to avoid ""blow outs"".

To acquire 460 Rowland test guns, I sent two of my 1911 45 acp pistols to Clark Custom Guns and had them install their 460 Rowland conversion kits. To date the converted 1911’s work great. I can fire a 255gr. hard cast bullet @ 1300 fps or a 230gr. FMJ-FN bullet @ 1350 fps. What a great ""woods"" pistol that still maintains combat pistol qualities.

We are using flash suppressed powders in each 460 Rowland load, so that if you have to shoot a bear or “bad guy” in the dark, the muzzle flash will not blind the shooter and we feel this feature is a big tactical advantage as most civilian shootings in America, occur in low light and we are willing to bet that most emergency wildlife shootings in the wilderness will be in low light too.

Note my real world velocities (below) from real world pistols, not laboratory test barrels.

I outfitted this rifle differently from the original configuration to a polymer triangle stock that I ""tacti-twined"" for comfort and for a better cheek weld. Also another very rare component is a custom made wood handgaurd from ironwood designs. I put a yugoslavian pistol grip on it as well.

The rifle will come with the stock handgaurds, grip and sidefolding wire stock.  It will also come with around 900 rounds of 7n6 steel core surplus ammo. 2 tapco 30 round mags 1 bulgarian 30 round mag. And 3 40 round pro-mags. Rifle will also come with a bayonet.

All in all the most accurate AK variant I've ever owned. Simply a joy to shoot. Very little recoil and flat shooter. Selling it because funds are running low and need the money for other hobbies. Price is somewhat negatiable. Pick it up off me before I change my mind!
