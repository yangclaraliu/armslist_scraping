The gun has digested around 200 rounds, flawlessly and I had no intentions of getting rid of it but... I really, really want another revolver. This gun comes with 2 mags, one of which has the pinky extension and the other is a flat base for less of a footprint while being carried. This gun is currently in the DA/SA with a safety which means it can be carried cocked and locked like a 1911, but also the safety serves as a decocker akin to the SIG line of pistols - best of both worlds and they are infinitely customized with an enormous amount of trigger options which are easily installed. Comes with the box, 2 mags, original paper work and I also have over a hundred rounds that can go with the gun in the trade if a deal is struck.

These stainless models are considerably rarer than the standard ""hostile environment"" blued finish and look a helluva lot better in my opinion. H&K positively makes the best polymer handguns out there - nothing else even comes close.

Colt's database shows this as model year 1964 per the serial number.  This is the older model, not a MKIII.  I understand these earlier Troopers are considered attractive because the action is the same I-frame as the Python and the manufacturing quality and machining is of high quality relative to later guns.  I purchased it more than a decade ago, fired it a few times, cleaned and oiled it, and it has sat ever since.  

I'm having some difficulty figuring out what a fair asking price is for this gun.  Based on the research I've done, the asking and auction prices seem to range from  $600 to as high as $1,200.  I'm listing it at $650, but I'll consider offers and thoughts on fair price.

Pistol: Smith&Wesson M&P .40 Vtac edition (Viking Tactical). Bought new three years ago. Such a great gun. Trijicon dual fiber optic/ tritium sites. Trigger work. Two clips. Holster, and everything that came with it in the box. Have shot plenty of rounds through this gun, and have never had a jam. Capacity on mags is 15+1. Trade value 600-700 

Ruger 10/22: Made in 1970s. No plastic or synthetic parts. Bull barrel, and amazing wood stock. This gun shoots everytime. Even with less than great ammo. It's a tac-driver. Comes with 10rd standard mag and 25 round steel top mag. Simmons scope (3x9) Trade value 450+

I am open to any nice .40 caliber pistols, and also in any assault rifles. Would maybe do trade plus cash on your end if it wasn't worth full trade, but would prefer to trade one or both of these sweet weapons for equally nice pieces. Thanks for taking the time, and if I left anything out please ask. Text or email 541 six zero six 3126.

This is a very elaborate forgery of an FN hi-power by FEG(I assume).

This gun has ALL of the FN markings including proof stamps, and NO FEG markings at all whatsoever.

The only determining identifier is the serial number which is almost certainly FEG.

This is a forged(haha...pun intended) steel frame and slide, with ambi safety, ring hammer, and rib top slide.

Mag safety is available, but has bee removed.

Good shooting gun too, parkerized and in good condition...comes with 1 mec-gar magazine(13rd).

Any ""smudges"" or dark spots on the gun in the pictures is just oil weeping out of the parkerizing....the gun is truly in good shape.

Import engraving is discreet, small, and under the dust cover on the slide...as belgium ""somthing"".

So, here is a USGI Springfield Armory, M1 Garand, 30-06 Rifle. (CMP Derived)

It has the Original finish and a May 53 Barrel. Mostly SA parts with some correct drawing numbers on those parts. OP handle and Trigger guard is WRA marked. The Stock is a Walnut USGI stock ( No Cartouches ) and in pretty nice condition.

it is a very low 6 Digit, (18XXXX) series, Jan 1941 and with the Rebarrel in 53, It has no doubt been in both WW2 and the Korean War. Has a 2/2 on the gauges and has a lot of life left. The money/collectability is in this receiver and would make a great gun as is or a perfect start for an investment project if so desired. You can always get ""Correct"" parts, just low serials are very hard to come by.

I am not interested in trades. Must be a VA resident and will sell to civilians and Military alike with proper ID.

The rifle comes with: Hard case, Operation Book, 1 USGI Sling, 50 Rounds of FMJ Greek Rounds/ 3 Clips. 

These rifles are through the roof over the years. I am asking $1050 for the package and will ship to an FFL to anyone outside VA State ($50 Shipping cost) . This is incredible package for what it is and the market on these guns. 

I will post pictures soon and can text more if desired. 

Please text me your name and Phone # and I am available for conversation at any time. I do not ""Negotiate"" over text and prefer to talk with you over details or concerns you may have.

The Cold Hammer Forging of barrels is accomplished through intense hydraulic pressure applied at opposing angles by carbide steel hammers. During the hammering process, a mandrel is inserted into the bore while the carbide steel hammers shape the barrel around the mandrel creating the chamber, the lands, and the grooves. In addition to the aforementioned benefits, the Cold Hammer Forging process creates a defect free bore and the most consistent chamber possible.

Unfortunately, S&W discontinued this awesome line-up and I don’t really want to get rid of it.  I used this as my walking/hiking in the woods sidearm with Buffalo bore .44 special 255gr HC or Corbon 320gr HC loads; both of which generate over 1000fps out of the 2.5” bbl.  I am looking to upgrade to a Ruger Super Blackhawk Talo or Ruger Alaskan in .44mag so I can use the same ammo in all my .44mags.  Right now I use Buffalo Bore’s 340+p+ .44 mag round (1250fps out of an Alaskan) and the S&W is not rated for safe use along with the cylinder being too short for the round to fit.  I really like this S&W for it’s perfect size and weight, effortless all day carry.  My S&W comes with the factory case w/ accessories (fired casing, I think I have the manuals also- will look), a black De Santis leather holster and Crimson Trace Laser Grips.  I would be looking for the Ruger to have to have a nice holster and cash to equal out the deal.  If there is no interest I will just keep this and save up for the Ruger, so don't bother offering me cash outright.  Trade within WI only and email is the best way to get a hold of me.

Hi there. Made the decision to switch back to 9mm. Got rid of my Glock 23, and now I'm looking to get rid of the Glock 22 as well. I am looking to trade for a Glock 26 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com) 

Comes with everything in the original box. 5 mags (3 factory, 2 brand new extended 31 round), lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me.

The quality of pictures are severely reduced when uploaded to armslist so it can make some textures look strange (like on the extended mags.) If you'd like the full size pictures, I can email them to you."

In a perfect world I go throw 1000 rounds through it today and not be bored. If you're not completely familiar with HK's shoot me any and all questions. I believe the make the P30 in 6 variations. The V3 gives it the DA/SA trigger with a thumb spur allowing you to manually put in single action from the first shot. Otherwise first pull is DA and all follow up shots are SA. It also has a manual hammer de-cocker if you decide to lower the hammer. 
It is by far the nicest pistol I've ever held. Like the new striker VP9 you get the original small, medium, and large grip panels and back straps. The gun if you can find one sell just under $1k with a current rebate. Some manufacturers you get your rebate quick. I received one from a certain company early August in 8 days. My only rebate experience with HK took the full 6 week plus some!  I have handled this bad--- pistol but haven't fired. It's basically a used unfired gun!  Unfortunately I need cash. Please if you're looking or thinking of a P30 take a look at mine I will save you money.   Will give the Streamlight laser/light combo for decent offer. The price listed NOW includes the stream light. 

You get HK +200 rounds and Tac light for the $695 asking price. Tactical light ran me 30 days ago $150. Make an offer all I can say is yes!  Sorry no trades this time. Wives great x-maa gift here. Lol"

BECAUSE BEAUTY AND FUNCTIONALITY AREN’T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
SIG SAUER® pistols have long provided their owners with peace of mind. Now the SIG Sauer Custom
Shop Equinox series adds pride of ownership to that feeling. The distinctive polished slide flats and
nickel controls contrast with the dark-coated surfaces for a visually arresting two-tone appearance. When
combined with its practical features, the Equinox series is pretty to look at and beautiful to shoot.

The P238 Equinox®, it’s just a fraction of the size of our ful-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® rear Night Sight and Tru-Glo Tritium Fiber Optic Front Sight."

It is in very good condition.   These little flip-open Berettas are getting nearly impossible to find in the Bobcat .22... the larger.32 cal Tomcats are still available new, but the Bobcats are not.  This one is in great condition as you can hopefully see in the pics.  When it comes to ease of use, these little Berettas really have no equal... they'll run about any ammo and you don't have to rack the slide if you don't want to... just flip open the barrel and load the first round manually... then close the barrel and cock the hamer and you're ready to fire 8 rounds on single action. They will also fire double action if preferred.  They are so small they are easily concealed in just about any clothing or purse... no holster needed.  Taurus makes a pistol very similar to this Beretta, but the Taurus is DAO... it won't fire single action.    I will take $300 for mine and I will include one box of mini-mags.  You will also get 2 7-rd mags.  You can find these little bobcats now and then online, but it will cost more than this and you must pay shipping, transfer dealer, etc,..

BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE Premium 35 Whelen Supercharged 225 gr. TSX (2800 fps) - 20 Round Box

Again, as per customer request, Buffalo Bore has developed two new 35 Whelen loads. Item 42A features a Sierra 225gr. SPTZ-BT bullet @ 2705 fps out of my Remington 700. (24 inch bbl)  At the expected impact velocities, this bullet will mushroom readily, but hold together on large game like bull elk. We recommend this load for use on smallish big game (like whitetail deer) through Yukon Moose and Bison. However, on very tough (other than broadside) angling shots on large big game, we recommend the use of our item 42B, which features a 225gr. Barnes TSX bullet @ 2654 fps out of the same rifle. The TSX load is a bit slower than the Sierra load because the long-for-weight all copper TSX uses up more case/powder capacity than the shorter Sierra bullet of the same weight.

If you desire the deepest possible penetration from an expanding bullet in 35 Whelen, the 225gr. Barnes TSX bullet delivers. It will out penetrate a 250gr. typical premium partition bullet, but gives the advantage of higher velocity, flatter trajectory and reduced recoil of the lighter 225gr. bullet. You can use this TSX load for bad angle (quartering or going straight away) shots on the largest North American big game.

This ammo is designed to be the highest quality, most powerful/versatile, 35 Whelen ammo, in the world. It exhibits sub MOA accuracy in our test rifle."
