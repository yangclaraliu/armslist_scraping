These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You’ll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.

TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3-Dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.

Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.

Up for grabs is a Remington M1903A3 is very good condition. The barrel is stamped 2-43 and reads LESS than 1 on a ME gauge. The throat registers about a 1.5. This is a 2 groove barrel and the rifling looks strong. The wood looks great IMO and still retains the arsenal markings near the magazine plate. Don't miss your chance to own the rifle that helped supply our troops with weapons during the beginning of WW2; there's just no telling what this rifle saw in its life.

The bayonet in the pics is NOT included.

This is a CMP rifle and I do have the corresponding paper work.

Very strong engine and tranny. Only thing wrong is the rear CO2 sensor needs to be replaced or possibly moved up some as it sits on the split and not the single pipe. Has newer dual exhaust in great condition with the bad sensor, sometimes causes engine light to come on but does not effect anything. Complete error code check was done engine light is for sure CO2 sensor and nothing else. Runs great, acceptable loud mean exhaust sound, shifts great now with new rearend. Also needs alignment something I cannot do. Cooper tires in great condition. Only real rust is at passenger door bottom front and rear less than 150 worth of body work if picky. Typical rear bumper corrosion at plate otherwise bumpers are great condition. Come with heavy duty grille guard. Great heat and a/c. Interior is near mint with new detail done a few days ago. Comes with four floormats, full manual and two sets of keys with remotes. Power windows/locks/seat.

I do not need to sell so 3500 cash price is firm I will not go any lower as book with miles is 3200+ and I did about 1000 in labor and parts. Plus take a look at what's available in mid 90s to 2003-4, high miles! The 5.2 will go 250k+ easy if not 350k. Great all season truck but definitely a great winter auto. 4x4 on the floor engages easily, properly and works great.

Overall a great truck for being 15 years old and you won't find any with this low of mileage.

Clean title will go down to DMV with you if you want for title change at time of purchase, cost is $40 being truck is 10 years or older. Plates/tabs good until August of 2015.

 This SIG Sauer P226 is chambered in 9mm. It is German made as opposed to most SIGs you will see in your local retail location. Stamped, ""Made in Germany"" on the slide, and other side of the slide is stamped with German markings. German SIGS are not rare in themselves, but the only German SIGS I have ever seen are older and dated guns and have internal extractors. This is a newer SIG with the external extractor. Also, this gun is noticeably lighter that the New Hampshire produced SIGS that I also own. The slide is noticeably lighter. This weapon came from the factory with E2 grips.
 Unlike most SIGs you see in your local retail, this one was made in Germany:
 Factory installed E2 grips. Like all guns straight from Germany, this gun did not have night sights. I had a SIG certified armor install Trijicon night sights on the rear ($50.00) and an SRT (Short Reset Trigger) ($50.00). The weapon came with two magazines, I will sell it with a third magazine ($45.00 value).

Weapon was brand new when I got it. I have only fired 250-300 rounds through it. 
Will also include a Fobus paddle holster."

Will be put back in the safe after Friday if not sold. This fine single-action handgun was made in 1954 and imported in the early 90's (no import marks). Included are three magazines with aftermarket extended floorplates for fast reloads, the original holster, and the option to include 520 rounds of ammo. The CZ-52 is widely accepted to be a more robust design than the TT-33, utilizing the roller delayed-blowback action like the MG-42, HK G3, and MP5. The original rollers have been replaced with new hardened steel ones. The original firing pin has also been replaced with a hardened steel model that won't break when dry fired. The original tiny fixed sights were milled off and 1911 style Novak adjustable target sights installed- the difference is amazing compared to the factory sights. The original Bakelite grips were sealed and then painted black. The parkerized finish on the frame is in 90%+ original  condition and the slide has been coated in Dark Parkerizing Gray Alumahyde II rustproof gun coating (properly cured) so it can be carried IWB without worrying about rusting from sweat. Function wise, I have never had any malfunction in 500 rounds. The decocker/safety works properly and the hammer does not contact the firing pin when decocking.

It fires the potent 7.62x25mm tokarev round which will defeat both sides of a threat level IIa bullet proof vest or one side of a level II vest with normal target grade FMJ's. The now banned 320 (of 520) hardened steel core AP rounds I am including will defeat all soft body armor up to level III. These rounds are legal to own in all 50 states, they can just no longer be imported into the country or manufactured.

The gun has a very thin profile and can be concealed as easily and sometimes better than a 1911. If you're expecting bad guys with body armor and want better penetration than a .357 SIG, this is the gun for you. Would make a perfect glove box gun to shoot through glass and sheet metal if needed to. Hollow points are available online if you are concerned about over-penetration.

The ammo available is:
100 rounds of banned Norinco mild steel core non-corrosive FMJ
100 rounds of S&B indoor range safe new production non-corrosive reloadable FMJ
320 rounds of mixed Hintenberger and another European manufacture 1955 and 1962 production hardened steel core AP. The finest 7.62 ammo ever available to civilians, last available in 1990. This ammo is mildly corrosive like most surplus stuff. It is very clean brass cased and berdan primed. I have shot through 1/4"" steel plate like it wasn't there, and I have seen it shred Kevlar helmets.

Besides defense, this is one heck of a fun gun to shoot. It sounds like a .44 magnum going off, and it has the recoil of a .45 1911. Minute of bad guy accuracy out to 150 yards from a bench, and very flat shooting. 9mm luger drop-in conversion barrels are available online.

I'm looking for a new toy, so this one has to go. 

$400 cash for the pistol and three mags and holster.
$600 cash OBO for the above plus all the ammo.

Ammo is not for sale without the gun.

The sights, modern steel upgrades, and magazines are worth $400 alone.

I am open to trades and trades plus cash for firearms and military related equipment, silver, cool stuff etc. What do you have? Worst I can say is no thanks. I am NOT interested in your used SCUBA gear, marijuana grow lights, or fish tanks.

If you are reading this, it's still for sale. 

Will meet at the Tulalip Cabelas in Marysville, WA only. Will ship overnight to your FFL at your expense for $50. Ammo ships separately for $20. 

I am a CPL holder and will only sell to US citizens 18 and older with valid ID and bill of sale. If you have a CPL or WAC card, no bill of sale is necessary.

Open to trades.

Up for sale is my Winchester model 77 semi-auto .22lr rifle. It grades in 95%+ condition, all parts matching and original. One factory magazine included. Bluing is perfect besides the normal wear line under the charging handle. A couple light scratches and one small ding in the walnut stock, but it's all storage wear. Very nice for a 50 year old rifle. Bore is mirror bright. the rifle functions flawlessly and it has never jammed on me. Zero rust, corrosion, or pitting.

Extremey accurate. Shoots sub-MOA at 100 yards with bulk ammo. This may also be because there are very rare Redfield micrometer adjustable target sights installed on the rifle. The very same used by the U.S. shooting team in the 1960's. These sights alone sell for $300 on Gunbroker. The receiver also has a rail so you could take the sights off and attach a scope if you wanted.

Also included are vintage Lyman sight inserts. Just unscrew a cap on the front sight and you can switch out the sight picture to a few different options including a red-orange filter. 

And I'm throwing in a sealed new production brick of Remington 22lr ammo to sweeten the deal. 

These quality Winchesters couldn't compete against the cheap Marlins and they were only produced for a few years even though they are one of the finest .22 rifles ever made. The milling and finish work is second to none, and the barrel is super-heavy compared to any of my other 22's.

Selling the package w/ ammo for $375 cash, firm. 

$350 cash, OBO without the ammo.

Will take old military handguns as trade: makarov, Star model B, cheap 1911, smith and wesson chiefs special, etc. Also looking for retro m16/ AR-15 parts and a CETME. Will add cash for the right deal. Will take cases of ammo in almost any caliber as well.

I am a Washington CPL holder so you can be assured the rifle is in good standing. You must be 18 or older to purchase and I will have you sign a bill of sale for my records. No FFL transfer necessary. Would prefer to meet in Arlington, Snohomish or Cabelas, Marysville. Will ship to an FFL holder at your expense."

It was originally custom built in 08-09 to run Starcraft 2. It was hardly ever used. I inhereted it about a year and a half ago, added some upgrades (RAM and GPU) and recently built a new PC, so it's time to recuperate some funds for that project.

Specs:

Core 2 Quad Q6600
Gigabyte GA-EP35C-DS3R motherboard
Crucial Ballistix 1333mhz DDR3 RAM at 8gb (2x4gb) This is the fastest/most RAM this mobo will run.
Zero-Therm Butterfly CPU cooler
LG super-multi DVD-ROM
ASUS GTX-560 graphics card
500gb Seagate 7200rpm HDD
Antec case and Antec Earthwatts 500w PSU
Encore 2.4ghz wireless PCIE adaptor

Solid specs and good components. It's a bit long in the tooth to run games like 'Watchdogs' but it will run most games, even new ones, on medium to high settings like Batman: Arkham Origins or similar titles. This motherboard does support overclocking. I never ran the PC or GPU overclocked normally, but I did overclock the CPU to 3ghz stable for a couple of days just to see if I could, and it did.

Windows 7 64-bit home premium is installed and the case has 2 CD keys, one for Windows 7 and one for Windows Vista home premium. Windows is updated, all drivers are installed and I took the liberty of installing Google Chrome, Nvidia Geforce experience and Java. This computer is ready to rock right out of the box. Install Steam/Origin and you're rolling. The case also has four drive bays so there is plenty of room for storage.

Coming with the tower above is an HP USB keyboard and laser mouse, driver discs for the PCIE wireless card and ASUS GPU, a couple CAT 5 cables, some extra hardware from the case and a rockin' Crysis 3 mouse pad that's brand new. Adds about 35 horsepower.

I have limited availablility and am not a department store. Email me and I'll try to find an agreeable time for you to come check the computer out."

Looks new, no scratches or wear anywhere, Center fire  Rifle model.

Comes with Leupold Golden Ring® Full Lifetime Guarantee

If any Leupold Golden Ring® product is found to have defects in materials or workmanship, Leupold & Stevens, Inc. will repair, or if repair is not possible, either replace the product or refund the purchase price, whichever you prefer. FREE. Even if you are not the original owner. No warranty card is required. No time limit applies. 

All air to glass lens surfaces in the Vari-X 2-7x28mm Compact that is the subject of this review receive Leupold's standard magnesium fluoride anti-reflection coatings for enhanced light transmission and freedom from glare. It is built on a 1"" diameter main tube made of 6061-T6 aircraft quality aluminum alloy and adjusted to be parallax free at a distance of 150 yards. The coin-slot windage and elevation adjustments are of the continuous friction type and are marked in 1/2 minute of angle increments. The eyepiece focus is by multiple turns of the ocular housing on fine threads and is secured with a knurled locking ring. Like all Leupold scopes, the 2-7x28 is sealed against moisture and nitrogen filled, making it waterproof and fog free.

The 2-7x28 Compact is shipped with Leupold's standard Duplex reticle. This type of reticle, with heavy a crosshair that becomes a fine crosshair near the center of the field, was invented by Leupold and has since been copied by virtually all other scope manufacturers. It is the best reticle ever designed for general purpose hunting applications. For the shooter who requires something different, the Leupold Custom Shop can install any of Leupold's 16 reticles (which include several specialized types not regularly available).

As its name implies, the 2-7 Compact was designed to be more compact than Leupold's regular 2-7x33mm variable power scope. It has a smaller front objective bell and is shorter and lighter than a standard 2-7 scope. This scope can be mounted low and overbore on most rifles, and will affect the handling and balance of the rifle less than a conventional scope. These are important advantages. Compact scopes are a natural match for today's lightweight, short action rifles.

There are two versions of the 2-7x28, one (intended for big game hunting) is adjusted to be parallax free at 150 yards, and the other (a Rimfire Special version) is adjusted to be parallax free at 60 yards and is supplied with a fine duplex reticle. They are otherwise identical.

The standard Vari-X 2-7x28 Compact reviewed here comes with a gloss black finish. It is 9.9 inches in length, and weighs only 8.2 ounces, making it one of the lightest 2-7x variables on the market. The 100 yard field of view is 41.7 feet at 2x and 16.5 feet at 7x. Optimum eye relief is 3.0-3.8 inches; the adjustment range is 80 MOA in both windage and elevation."

The Model 700 Varmint-Tactical Rifle (VTR) is a revolutionary system optimized for extended range precision and mobility. Its triangular barrel contour is a product of years of rigorous research and development focused on reducing weight, enhancing rigidity and promoting rapid heat dissipation. To decrease recoil and muzzle jump, this uniquely contoured 22"" barrel has an integral muzzle brake that's machined in during production. Along with the barrel design, brought together a host of other cutting edge features on this super accurate Model 700 platform. The results are nothing short of astounding. Chambered for the inherently tight grouping 22-250 caliber, this model is engineered with a rate of twist optimized for tactical style bullets, the Model 700 VTR is compact and swift handling thanks to its sleek lines and short action. The legendary three-rings-of-steel and the many other superior design elements of this rifle deliver the highest degree of out-of-the-box accuracy available today. Plus, it's matched with the X-Mark Pro Trigger system for the ultimate in crispness and shot control. For improved consistency, the green synthetic stock has a vented beavertail forend that promotes rapid cooling. Its overmold accents provide a firm gripping surface, and the dual sling swivel studs permit convenient attachment of a bipod and a sling.

I inherited this beauty from my late father who never settled for second best in anything he did.  It doesn't fit my needs so I am offering it to another skilled shooter who will put it to good use and maximize its capabilities.  If Dad put more than 200 rounds through this weapon I'd be surprised; the gun is in near-mint condition.

Designed from the ground up by Kimber as a concealed-carry personal defense weapon, the Pro Covert II with its aluminum frame weighs only 28oz empty, and measures 7.7"" by 5.25"" by 1.28"".  Kimber's Covert pistols come with Tactical Wedge tritium night sights and digital camo style Crimson Trace Lasergrips - if you can see, you can aim.  With a match-grade 4"" steel barrel (1/16 Left hand twist) and match-grade aluminum trigger (4-5lb break), the Pro Covert II will raise your personal defense capabilities to the next level.

In addition to original cleaning brushes and manuals, I will also throw in an Ace Case suede pistol case, 20 rounds of Winchester .45ACP 230gr SXT JHP ammo and three extra 8-round KimPro Tac-Mags.  MSRP for the gun is $1,657.  Asking $1,200 for the whole package.

I have two dies for 45 ACP the depriming/resizing and powder-thru expanding die. You will need a bullet seating die. But with the two shell plates and two turrets you could set this to load a different caliber. It is all working and just isn't something I use anymore. 

Give me an offer, I am in Cheyenne."
