Wickham contract M1816 musket converted to percussion by Leman. This example is full length, and unmodified. The ramrod is unfortunately broken to 33 inches in length, and there is a sliver of wood missing to the side of the tang (a common problem with converted muskets if the lock screws weren't loosened before the barrel was removed). The lock functions very well, and all internal parts have the same mating marks. The cone is in good shape, and air easily passes through the barrel. The cleanout screw is removable. The bore is dark, but would probably clean out better if so desired. No cartouches are present on the stock, but is does not appear to have been sanded. The barrel bands retain much of the original national armoury brown lacquer finish.

This is a hard one to part with. Regardless, my 4553 TSW is up for sale. Comes with three mags plus S&W plastic case. Also an aliengear holster that was orriginally made for a 45 recon. I used a cheap heat gun to fit it to this gun. Carries just fine. These are dead nuts reliable. I've cycled full mags of empties through it, no prob. Its DAO. I've put wolf springs in it to lighten the trigger press. Never had a light strike. Orriginal springs are included.

Guns history; bought it used a few months ago. Had no marks on the slide rails or slide face. I've since put about 250 rnds through it.

Only reason I'm selling is...
Last year I was on a quest for a non 1911 singlestack 45 (not that I don't like 1911s. I just already had one) for ccw. I wanted a sig220, but couldn't find the one I wanted for under a grand. Well today I found it, so my 4553 has to go. Really, I won't be heart broken if I keep them both.
I know the value of these guns and the price of mags. 575 takes this gun, 3 mags, holster, and case. Ill even give you the two mags of the hydrashoks (all the shop had at the time, plus they hit POA/POI perfectly in this pistol) I've been carrying.
Also must have ccw or purchase permit."

I need a area that is at least 30 yards wide X 75 yards long with a good backstop. This event would be held on 11/29/14 and last for about 2-3 hours. This contest will also serve as a Christian Bachelor Party for my friend. Let me emphasize CHRISTIAN Party. This means that there will be no drinking, foul language, inappropriate entertainment, etc.  I am willing to do the set up and clean up as well as a safety course before the activity starts. I am willing to pay a reasonable price but please don't try to take advantage of my kindness. If we are both not happy with a deal I would rather not go through with it. If you are interested please send me a message with the price and if possible Pics of the shooting area.

""With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue G-10 Piranha grips in black and grey provide maximum grip and a distinctive look."""

This one was produced in early to mid 80's I believe and between the original owner and myself, maybe 20 rounds through it. I have had this for about 5 or 6 years now.

The Westerner is a top loader and was considered by some to be slightly less desirable than the bottom loading models but actually it was easier to load and you never had to worry about the possibility of the trap door opening from recoil and dumping ammo.

The wood is a satin finish and in great shape and the blueing is still very nice. Any defects on it and there are a couple would be considered very minor. Has a padded, black nylon Winchester sling with a premium Limb-Saver recoil-pad I had installed 3 or 4 years ago.

Optional with the rifle is a 3x9 40 Zeiss Conquest MC #20 reticle scope, part number 3750887 in like new condition with steel, weaver style quick-disconnect rings, 4 screws on each cap instead of 2. 

Rifle is $700 and includes 2 piece weaver ring base, hard case and sling and the scope with rings is $400 or everything for $1,000 and price is firm at this time. Can ship if you want to cover the fee. 

If you're looking for a nice rig, this should do the trick.
Serious only respond please.

The VST folding front sight and gas block is an all-steel, flip-up design, with spring loaded detents. There is no lock so if the sight gets hit, the sight will fold down rather than damage a locking mechanism. The VST-1 series incorporates a QD sling swivel cup mount while the VST-2 does not.  All models use an AK47/AKM/AK74 front sight post. This allows the user adjust the sight, for elevation, with the use of a simple AK cleaning kit.

Despite the VST's solid construction, it actually weighs less than a standard A2 front sight tower.

The clamping system has been carefully designed to provide an unparalleled hold when installed properly.  During testing, the VST-1 withstood over 100 ft/lbs of rotational torque and is stronger than the barrel’s receiver indexing pin.

The owner before me did all the damage cosmetically and had it terribly spray painted black. The rifle still functions flawlessly. It does not come with any mags. It comes as pictured. The Egyptian aks are pretty rare. However given the condition of the exterior of the rifle, I'm not expecting an asinine amount of cash. Make a reasonably offer please. If not, don't message me."
