For sale is a Brand New in Box Browning Semi-automatic 22lr Grade 1.  This rifle is factory new and was only taken out of the box to take the photos you see here.  

In production for nearly a century, the SA-22 is unlike any other rimfire rifle on the market. Much more than ""just a 22,"" the history of this fine rifle can be traced back to the mind of the gunmaker himself, John M. Browning, and is a lasting tribute to his genius.

The SA-22 is sure to become your favorite plinker and varmint rifle. It is lightweight and easy to carry on a squirrel hunt, and easy to load for a day of plinking at the range. Construction quality and materials are top notch to ensure longevity and lasting beauty. The fine Walnut stock is sharply Checkered and polished to a sheen while the barrel and receiver are polished blued with a unique and classic engraving that is sure to impress.

The SA-22 ejects fired brass out the bottom of the receiver to make shooting a pleasure for right- and left-handed operators. Perhaps the most interesting feature is the ability to take the rifle down into two parts — the buttstock and receiver and the forearm and barrel — for storage or to simplify cleaning.

A popular upgrade for the SA-22 is to add the aluminum scope base and a scope. This combination makes shooting more accurate and more fun than ever. When the rifle is taken down, the base and optic stay with the barrel to help ensure zero is not affected.

This gun is not only a great addition to any gun collection, it is a versatile and effective weapon that will operate exactly as it is intended.  

Please feel free to email me with any questions, or if you would like more pictures.

Payment: Cash, Certified money order, or Cashier's check only.  No paypal or personal checks.  Trades will be considered on an individual basis.  

Shipping:  Shipping cost is $25.  If the item needs to be shipped, it will be shipped FFL to FFL via UPS or FedEx ground.  I need a copy of the your dealer's FFL BEFORE I will send.

Lets all start flagging as overpriced any 22LR ammo that is greater than 10 cents a round. That way we can set our own ceiling and maybe discourage some of the more outrageous resellers. The only way we are going to see ammo on a regular basis is to discuourage the heavy gougers.

You can buy 22 ammo for 5 or 6 cents a round at Walmart. Some of the Walmart resellers are marking this up 3 to 4 times. I've even talked to a couple guys who are reselling to gun shops. Holy crap!!

Lets all start flagging as overpriced any 22LR ammo that is greater than 10 cents a round. That way we can set our own ceiling and maybe discourage some of the more outrageous resellers. The only way we are going to see ammo on a regular basis is to discuourage the heavy gougers.

Chambered in 7.62x39. Original (Zastava military factory) Yugo hammer-forged barrel and receiver; in other words, the desirable AK heavy barrel and thicker, heavy duty RPK-style receiver with reinforced trunnion. Nice, clean surplus Yugo M70 wood furniture. Side optics rail. Sights are straight, bore and bolt face are pristine, and everything is tight, as expected for a brand new, unfired rifle.

Comes with two (2) 30-round magazines (one Combloc steel, and one Tapco), AK cleaning kit, box, and manual/papers. 

If you are looking for a well-built, rugged, good-looking AK, this is it! Perfect for shooting or showing off. Even has something for investors, as this M70 rifle is a limited Zastava factory production run from NOS parts, and is expected to increase in value comparable to other original factory barreled and receiver AK rifles that are no longer imported. 

You can still buy these at Atlantic Firearms, on sale right now for $699 (plus shipping and whatever you pay for transfers), see https://www.atlanticfirearms.com/component/virtuemart/shipping-rifles/zastava-ak-47-m70-pap-7-62x39-rifle-detail.html?Itemid=0, but once their stock runs out, these Yugo O-PAP rifles will only be available on the secondary market and prices will start to increase. Or you can buy this one, unfired, and inspect in person with no additional taxes/fees.

Don't miss this opportunity to own this classic and iconic AK rifle! Whether you are a new owner and want a top-quality rifle for your first AK or a long-time collector looking to fill a hole in your AK collection, this rifle has something for you.

I live in Birmingham, but travel to Huntsville and Mobile regularly. I can provide proof (e.g. pistol permit) that I am a good guy and as many references as you need from recent firearms transactions. Deal with confidence. I won't waste your time, please don't waste mine."

I have an extra set of build parts for a 7.5"" 5.56 upper. Everything is new, never assembled; these are quality components from Aero and BCM, not the craptastic stuff I see in so many cheap builds.

Aero Precision 7.5"" 5.56 barrel 
Aero Precision low profile gas block 
Aero Precision pistol gas tube 
Aero Precision cosmetic blem upper receiver complete with forward assist and ejection port cover 
Aero Precision BCG with full auto carrier, HPT/MPI, Carpenter 158 tool steel bolt

If you want a handguard as well, I can get you a good deal on a Midwest Industries handguard like their Gen2 SS, M-Lok or Keymod handguards. If you don't have the tools or inclination to assemble an upper, I can do it for you."

EXCELLENT condition Browning BL-22 Micro Midas Lever Action
I could probably get away with calling this LNIB, but there IS a slight nick in the clear finish of the front grip area, so...

Bought this little gem new last summer. We've just not used it as much as I'd thought we would. The nice thing about the BL-22 is its VERY short throw action - 33 degrees, I believe - so you can just pump them out if you like. We bought it so we could shoot whatever 22 rimfire (no magnum) ammo we came across, without worrying about whether it would cycle the action of a semi-auto. It's just a great little shooter, but it's not getting used much. Time to go.

This is the BL-22 Micro Midas Grade I model - just the right size for little shooters, and a handy size for bigger ones. It's taken out the center of plenty of small-bore bullseyes, and more than a few gophers, too! About 300 rounds fired in its lifetime. Cleaned and cared for properly. The little nick on the clear is the only blemish to be found. Never had a scope mounted to it.

Not much else to say: it's a Browning - one great little gun.

Cash price $400. Comes with all factory packaging (box, paperwork, manuals, etc). Including a 50 round box of CCI Mini-Mags.

FTF only within 40 mile radius of Argos. Show IN DL and LTCH, nothing recorded.

This gun has never had any issues, failure to feed or any other failures. I have dumped mags as quick as I could pull the trigger trying to induce at least a stove pipe, but nope. Smooth as silk. It just rocks it. Very smooth action. This Beretta has had trigger work done to polish and lighten the pull. It also has an internal LMS-1000 LaserMax laser sight.

It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

Not ""msrp"", but actual new cost. There are a lot of weapons for sale on this page that people are selling used, for MORE than they would cost new. That's ridiculous. Not that I don't have sympathy for folks who need the money, or are starting high in the expectation if dickering, but seriously be reasonable. Case in point: The Stoeger Coach Gun. You can pick up a really nice example of this online for $400 bucks just about anywhere, even with the single trigger. For a used, home painted version that's had the stock cut down to pistol grip by a non professional, a reasonable offer might be $200 bucks if he throws in a couple boxes of ammo. For anyone to be expecting EXTRA money because they modified a weapon to suit themselves, and sank time and money into is not realistic. You gotta think about it like a car... once you change it permanently, no matter how nice the work is, the next guy who buys it either is gonna have to want the EXACT same thing you did, or get it cheap so that he can afford to put the money in to make it his own. And the odds are heavily against the next guy wanting the exact same thing. So, just like most cars, you're gonna end up losing money. You drove it off the lot, and even tho you put time and money into it to customize it, it's still gonna be worth LESS than what you paid new. Hell, even if I restore a 1993 Dodge Neon to showroom condition at a cost of 20k it's still gonna book at WAY less than that. It's a used '93 Neon after all. Same thing applies to guns. So anyway, I'm done with my rant, and even if you don't agree at least give it some thought."

I have these in various sizes from small to 3x. They come with level 3a armor. They come with brand new concealable carriers inside of them as well. So this is a 2 for 1 one vest. Use the r20d for over the shirt purposes, or take it out of the r20d and wear it under your shirt with the concealable. The r20d carrier accepts 10x12 plates if you so choose to run them in conjuction with each other. The cost alone on these vests for JUST the carriers, no ballistics is well over $300. I'm asking $500 for the level 3a ballistics, r20d carrier, and concealable carrier.
