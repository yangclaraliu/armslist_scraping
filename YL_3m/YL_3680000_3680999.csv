This upper is VERY light and shoots great but I have no need for a threaded barrel on my MkIII.  These retail for $340 (see e.g., here: http://www.tacticalsol.com/2245-and-mk-series-upgrades/pac-lite-45-threaded-barrel and here: http://www.shootersconnectionstore.com/Tactical-Solutions-Pac-Lite-45-Threaded-No-Flutes-Matte-Black-P1689.aspx) but I am looking for $250 or a good trade.  I am specifically looking for a shotgun, a 9mm Glock, or AR uppers but feel free to offer anything.

Bring cash or offers of a trade.  This item is serialized and considered a ""handgun"" so the buyer must have a NH drivers license and pistol license.  Note that you will need to use the bolt on your 22/45 or MkIII with this upper."

With the increasing threat of terrorism in our streets to the evolving situations of combat applications, a new paradigm in firearms was required. In 1982, with the foresight of what the modern battlefield was becoming, IWI in a decade long collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Research & Development teams, developed the new standard issue weapon for the IDF. The TAVOR® was born. Mr. Zalman Shebs, known as the “father of the TAVOR,” spearheaded the team to develop a weapon system that was capable of moving from open field conflicts to close-quarter engagements and from daylight to nighttime capabilities – seamlessly on a single mission. In the late 1990’s through the early 2000’s, the TAVOR underwent unprecedented testing unlike any weapons system anywhere. The TAVOR began trials with IDF units testing for ergonomics. The TAVOR then entered the IDF NCO Infantry School for extensive field tests and finally, in 2002, the TAVOR was given to an army company in the Givati Brigade for real-world testing and use. By September, 2003, the IDF had chosen the TAVOR rifle as the standard issue for their infantry troops. Today the TAVOR rifles are in service with IDF Infantry troops and the IDF Special Forces in Israel along with many military and law enforcement agencies in the world. IWI and IWI US have brought the same dedication to craft and commitment to performance and reliability to the American customer with the TAVOR SAR rifle. TAVOR® SAR Features Include: -Bullpup configuration allows for short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy -Optimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease-of-use -Clean, long stroke piston operation -Detachable, cold hammer-forged barrel (CHF), chrome-lined with 1:7 twist, CrMoV steel -Optional 9mm Parabellum conversion kit with CHF barrel, 1:10 twist, CrMoV steel -100% ambidextrous configuration and operation with optional left-hand bolts for 5.56 NATO. No additional parts required to convert 9mm Parabellum to LH configuration -Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles with push button swivels -Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies -Mil-Std 100% interchangeability of all TAVOR SAR parts -Last round - bolt holds open on an empty magazine -All metal parts treated for corrosion resistance -Integral rubber recoil pad Keywords: Bull pup , Bullpup , SAR , Flat Top , Flattop , 5.56 , 556 , 2.23 , 223 , AR , TSB ,"

Lewis  Machine and Tool. A elite maker of the AR and because with all of their gov contracts, they don't persue Citizen sales as much. However, there is a reason they are elite and top of the line. Why special? Read on:

THE BARREL

LMT is unique amongst the big box M4 clones in that their barrels are something special. Unlike a conventional M4 that is acid etched to remove a layer of metal to make room for the chrome plating, LMT's barrels are CUT slightly over-sized when they are made, and THEN chromed. This creates a much more uniform chrome lining and a much more accurate barrel. LMT's barrels are made by Mike Rock at Rock Creek, one of the most esteemed barrel makers in the business, known for quality and accuracy. You can not get a more accurate M4! 


Chryo'd:
 On top of that accuracy process, the barrels then go through another unique process of being chryogenicly frozen, which is a process only the highest quality barrels have done. This process more evenly aligns the grain of the steel at a molecular level which results in increased accuracy and longevity of the barrel. 

Enhanced Receiver Extension 



In a way the receiver extension is the heart of the rifle, if it breaks the rifle ceases to function. LMT's receiver extensions are machined from 7075 alluminum. That's not all though, they are coated with a dry film lubricant inside and out (which is the grey color you see in the picture. They also have extra drainage holes that other extensions do not have. These are two features unique to LMT. 





Tactical Charging Handle 



LMT's tactical charging handle is one of the first and in my opinion the BEST of all the charging handle designs. Unlike a lot of tactical units, it is not overly large and obtrusive to get caught up on things, or to pinch your skin when you charge it. It is low profile, yet offers a distinct advantage when compared to a standard handle.

LMT's FULL AUTO BCG 



This rifle has been upgraded to have LMT's FULL AUTO BCG. Most LMT rifles come standard with a semi auto BCG, but this one has the full auto. The bolt is made out of C-158 steel HPT and MPI'd. You will not find a higher quality BCG on the market, the LMT full auto BCGs sell for almost $200 on their own! 



Fit / Finish + Little Details: 



The LMT really has the nicest lowers in my honest opinion. The fit and finish is outstanding, but more so than that is the attention to little details. Sure, the trigger pull is very nice, but it's the unique touches that I really like. Like the magazine bolt hold open paddle? Well, it is ridged on not just the paddle portion, but also on the small lower portion. LMT is the only one that does this. Also, the selector has the same grooves all over it. Again, another feature unique to LMT. 


OK so this one and specs:

Info / Specs
The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system (14.5"" barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

I would like to sell or trade my 1940’s era General Electric refrigerator that is in UNRESTORED but WORKING condition. There is minor SURFACE rust but nothing that goes deep. It comes with all the shelves, 1 drawer, and the hard to find original metal ice trays (x3). The original metal ice bucket. The interior thermostat is also completely intact as is the butter compartment and door. The interior is in good condition. This would be great to restore for your man cave or even to use in the kitchen. It would also make a really cool gun safe if you decided to gut and convert it. This is the perfect retro blank slate for you to put your custom mark on. Asking $1000 obo which is a fair price for unrestored in this condition. Restored these things SELL for around $4000.

My picture says it all!

If you didn't respond to my first one please read this and shoot me a good offer.  Thanks!

I got a new rig for my carry gun and it won't fit in the console of my car where I liked to store it, so now I will be keeping it at home when not in use. Now I need a little something in the car for just in case, for when I'm not carrying. (This is me finding an excuse to buy a gun)

What I don't want:
I know it's blasphemy but I will not own a glock.
No .380acp or .32 or .25 or .22lr pistols 
Nothing huge!
A few knicks or dings is fine but nothing beat to hell or with rust spots
No SCCY or HiPoint or Keltec, ect., I'd rather have well used quality than newer crap.

What I do want:
A semi auto or revolver, I already have firearms in 9mm and .45 so those would be ideal
Something a standard size, but on the smaller side is just as good
This is for a grown man, something I would be seen with, so nothing pink haha
A good deal, I'm not paying $50 under retail so don't bother, I won't respond

My other pistols are Kimbers, Sigs, CZs, and Springfields, all with actual hammers. Not a fan of striker fired pistols, but would consider one for a good price. This leaves a lot of options so surprise me. I know lots of you gentlemen have at least one gun that fits this bill that you haven't touched in at least a year, so I'm willing to take it off your hands now. 

I will respond to acknowledge anything I am interested in. After 2-3 days I will pick my favorite and make a deal. Would like to meet in person as near to my home as possible. The better your deal is the further I'm willing to drive.

I do not need holsters, ammo, boxes, ect. I am interested in a handgun only, with mags if applicable.

I have an SC CWP."

This gun has never been in a holster and it looks and functions as new, no marks, scratches or an other cosmetic issues. The gun is 46 years old but as new. I thought I would get into target shooting but I have carprel tunnel so bad I can't shoot the gun.

The Trijicon AccuPoint features advanced fiber optics and several intelligent features that make this scope the right choice for all light conditions and even the harshest environments. All models in the AccuPoint Series operate battery free-eliminating the potential for failure during critical moments in the field. They also feature Trijicon's Manual Brightness Adjustment Override, which allows you to control the light output of the fiber-optics during daylight. AccuPoint riflescopes include other advanced elements like multi-layer coated lenses for superior light transmission with no distortion, quick-focus eyepiece, long-eye relief, and precise windage and elevation adjustments. The AccuPoint's rugged construction protects it from the toughest elements. It's crafted from aircraft-quality, hard-anodized aluminum with a tube that's nitrogen-filled to prevent corrosion and eliminate fogging. A solid black-matte finish eliminates glare and light reflection, which could spook game. And, it's water resistant, so the AccuPoint is able to handle even the most challenging hunting conditions.

I have not shot it because I don't have any 300 Savage. I bought it expecting it to be chambered in 7.7jap so I could restore it, but a restore isn't possible here. The bore is crisp and chrome lined, and there is no rust. This will make a fantastic cheep deer rifle for someone, as well as come with some history. 
If a collector is interested as a parts gun, its all matching, Izawa Jyuko series 4, only 10,000 made at this arsenal in this series. The AA sights are in tact, mum ground. The bolt was heated up and bent 45*, but could be heated up and re-bent back to original. The stock is a total loss in terms of restoration. I need to get $140 to get my money back for the purchase price, and I am very open to trades.

This is basically only a cheap deer gun or a parts gun for a rebuild.
***I haven't fired this rifle, and it is slightly possible it is not chambered in 300Savage. based on possible cartridges that COULD fit based on being small enough case wise to fit, and short enough to meet the rechambered requirements, it could also be chambered in 308 Winchester. This is HIGHLY unlikely."

When purchased and moved to Lockport, NY in '77 the frames and slides were cast w/a zinc alloy and the inspection tolerances were expanded creating an inferior product.  The Sterling 300s are American copies of the Rigarmi/Galesi .25.  A tried and true design.  The Gasport manufactured .25s are very well made.
This pistol is a fine shooter.  Very dependable.  Blued.  Comes with 2 mags and an i/owb holster.  It's a King all leather.  Parts are readily available.  Field strip is a breeze.  Plenty of 'tube videos.

1911 Carry .45 Tacops with Threaded Barrel Sig Night Sights SAO Nitron

My email and text number are below as this sights emailing doesnt work often.

I got this gun in a multi gun trade from original owner, has Sig Night Sights, lock, 4 mags, original carry box and papers.  The trigger pull is Light and Crisp and it has a safety thats easy to disengage.

It is in great condition with some wear on barrel at extraction area and minor wear at the business end and very minor wear on grip.  I can send additional pics as needed.

Send all reasonable cash offers.

Must meet publically in or near Clermont which is just west of Orlando, near Winter Garden, Leesburg, Davenport, or Hwy 27 and I-4 If interested in trading then read all below so we dont waste our time.

I would consider trades plus cash or trade straight up or possibly add a gun or guns,  ammo or extras for the right AR in .308

I don't need anything so I'd be trading at what I could buy your gun new or used from the lowest priced listings on slickguns, CDNN, classic firearms or J&G when they are in stock, dont need anything full retail, craze inflated or BPS or Gander pricing.

I would prefer to buy things with my cash so I have the initial warranty but if its the right deal, I am willing to work on my guns price too, but since I prefer cash deal, its really going to have to be a trade I really want thats in great shape or new.

Send me a pic if you have a trade and make me an offer. Don't ask what I'd take as I'm not negotiating with myself. I need to see what you have and  condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's easier if you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. 

As for trades, I'm really looking for a Sig 716, DPMS REPR or SASS, Colt, DPMS Recon or Recon 2, POF, BRO, LMT, PWS, Ruger, Windham, Core, etc or similar price ranges $1000-$2000.....Will consider most ar's in .308, with no front post and Upper and lowers must be same manufacturer. Only factory built.  Must be new or like new.  I can add one or two guns for right deal, ammo or possibly extras.  I am not looking for one at MSRP, looking for a good to great price. Decent quality optics are a plus. Obviously I would love an LWRC or HK but I cant afford those, so please keep that in mind.

Also possibly interested in new or like new AK's prefer pistol..... plus cash, possibly rifle plus cash.  I would consider Zastava m92 PAP  (I know they are out of stock in some places, but they pop up weekly and I can wait)  others i'd consider if not canted  CAI Centurion 39 ,  Yugo M70AB,  Yugo Zastava NPAP,  CAI Centurion 39 Tactical AK, Draco or Mini Draco ....... No wasrs, not interested in saigas even though I know they can be great and arsenals are out of my price range.

Only handguns I want are new or like new .......Glock 19 Gen 4, possibly a 23, FDE/OD are plus..........  Or Gen 3 19/23 in FDE/OD,  Glock 30s, possibly Gen 4 21......no stippling please   (stock glocks are $475-515 new all over and low $400's used, so please dont tell me yours is worth $600)  Also might consider LCR if under $400 plus cash, prefer .357 but open to .38  I would trade even up for 2 Glocks also in different sizes or calibers even if one has more wear or one of Glocks listed above and another like new or new gun.  Holsters and self defense ammo are not really helpful for me.

No junk, old stuff, collectibles, cowboy, military, vintage, builds, shotguns or  hunting rifles Non felon, 21 minimum, DL and bill of sale  required. 

I will try to post my other guns I have for sale/trade today or tomorrow.  Sig Extreme P938 $625, Spikes Ar 5.56 $950, possibly Glock 27 with lots of extras $600, Spikes .300 aac in FDE $1350, possibly Mossy Tactical 12ga with lots of extras $500  all prices are asking prices assuming every one will negotiate, so I can be fair if others are with me.

First and foremost, the 500 is built to the same uncompromising mil-specs as the renowned Mossberg 590. Then a host of features are introduced - Quiet Carry dual-action bars, 3'' chambers and an ambidextrous safety, to name a few. Some models also include factory-ported barrels; the industry's first fully-rifled slug barrel and our Trophy Slugster.

Prefer cash for best price on my gun. 

Spike's Tactical Ar 5.56 / .223 SL15 Punisher Lower, Multi Caliber  Magpul Handguard & Front Grip, Metal Rear Sight, Spider Marked Grip, Stock and BCG   Lifetime transferable warranty....Can throw in extras depending on deal.

My email and text number are below as this sights emailing doesnt work often.

Only fired less than 100 rds through her to sight in.  Still in great condition and very accurate.  Only selling as it's duplicate and to fund other toys as listed below

I can send additional pics as needed.

Send all reasonable cash offers.

Must meet publically in or near Clermont which is just west of Orlando, near Winter Garden, Leesburg, Davenport, or Hwy 27 and I-4 If interested in trading then read all below so we dont waste our time.

I would consider trades plus cash or trade straight up or possibly add a gun or guns,  ammo or extras for the right AR in .308

I don't need anything so I'd be trading at what I could buy your gun new or used from the lowest priced listings on slickguns, CDNN, classic firearms or J&G when they are in stock, dont need anything full retail, craze inflated or BPS or Gander pricing.

I would prefer to buy things with my cash so I have the initial warranty but if its the right deal, I am willing to work on my guns price too, but since I prefer cash deal, its really going to have to be a trade I really want thats in great shape or new.

Send me a pic if you have a trade and make me an offer. Don't ask what I'd take as I'm not negotiating with myself. I need to see what you have and  condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's easier if you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. 

As for trades, I'm really looking for a Sig 716, DPMS REPR or SASS, Colt, DPMS Recon or Recon 2, POF, BRO, LMT, PWS, Ruger, Windham, Core, etc or similar price ranges $1000-$2000.....Will consider most ar's in .308, with no front post and Upper and lowers must be same manufacturer. Only factory built.  Must be new or like new.  I can add one or two guns for right deal, ammo or possibly extras.  I am not looking for one at MSRP, looking for a good to great price. Decent quality optics are a plus. Obviously I would love an LWRC or HK but I cant afford those, so please keep that in mind.

Also possibly interested in new or like new AK's prefer pistol..... plus cash, possibly rifle plus cash.  I would consider Zastava m92 PAP  (I know they are out of stock in some places, but they pop up weekly and I can wait)  others i'd consider if not canted  CAI Centurion 39 ,  Yugo M70AB,  Yugo Zastava NPAP,  CAI Centurion 39 Tactical AK, Draco or Mini Draco ....... No wasrs, not interested in saigas even though I know they can be great and arsenals are out of my price range.

Only handguns I want are new or like new .......Glock 19 Gen 4, possibly a 23, FDE/OD are plus..........  Or Gen 3 19/23 in FDE/OD,  Glock 30s, possibly Gen 4 21......no stippling please   (stock glocks are $475-515 new all over and low $400's used, so please dont tell me yours is worth $600)  Also might consider LCR if under $400 plus cash, prefer .357 but open to .38  I would trade even up for 2 Glocks also in different sizes or calibers even if one has more wear or one of Glocks listed above and another like new or new gun.  Holsters and self defense ammo are not really helpful for me.  Quality 1911's. Sig p226 or similar. MK25. Open to most quality brand pistols or AR pistol

No junk, old stuff, collectibles, cowboy, military, vintage, builds, shotguns or  hunting rifles Non felon, 21 minimum, DL and bill of sale  required. 

I will try to post my other guns I have for sale/trade today or tomorrow.  Sig Tacops 1911 Threaded $1025, Sig Extreme P938 $625, possibly Glock 27 with lots of extras $600, Spikes .300 aac in FDE $1350, possibly Mossy Tactical 12ga with lots of extras $500  all prices are asking prices assuming every one will negotiate, so I can be fair if others are with me.  



Text only between 8a-11p 407-701-410 zero or email KurtisM13@aol dot com  If reasonable offer, I will usually reply fairly quickly during those hours.

-Added Grip tape above slide
-Used cut bicycle tubing for better grip.
-Filed down side of plastic grip to form better with fingers.

PROBLEMS:
***-One side of the grip is cracked. The pressure from shooting and the bicycle tubing squeezing may have caused this. However, the crack is somehow perfectly formed to where the plastic grip is held solid in place along with the tubing, infect I had no idea it was cracked until later on, It caused no inconvenience so I haven't replaced it personally but I planned to buy new grips on ebay for midway for $25  

ACCESSORIES:
-Concealed Cary holster for the inside of waistband. skin side is black leather, outer side is plastic polymer. It was made for a Bersa Thunder and fits perfectly for the Cz, retailed at around 45$.
-Original Underarm Holster from Cz, It has a arm loop and two suspender straps that clip on to pants or belt for under arm carry. The holster itself is made from leather, although it is a inexpensive and discontinued item, it was made very well and I am pleased with it. 
-One Original Magazine.

-I also have 50 rounds of loaded 19x18 reloads. (our reloads are very reliable)
-I have the reloading dies AND casting mould for 19x18
-Spare shells, a mix of makarov and trimmed down 9mm Luger cases to fit, About 300 or so.

FOR SALE:
-Marlin Model 60 chambered in .22 Lr, Tube fed.
CONDITION: Slight Wear and tear, wood composite stock  FUNCTION: Perfect.
-Purchased brand new out of the box, no previous owner.
-I stripped down the rifle and lightly polished the internals, Its not a professional polish job, just a little something to make me feel better about it. (Often, owners like to polish the stock internals of Marlin60s)

ACCESSORIES: 
-Tactical Over the shoulder rifle holster. Can also be used for other rifles, offers a few zipper pockets around the outside, and velcro straps all over for various custom addons with other tactical stuff. 
-200 Rounds of .22LR

OTHER INFO:
I would hope for any extra accessories like 30rnd mag, extra mags, holster, grips, possibly ammo, anything extra would really help me out because once I make this trade I wont be able to afford any extra things for a while. 

I will be doing private security on a short sailing trip, and would prefer to have a glock for this. I feel that my terms of trade are fair for a glock 19 although I would greatly appreciate any extra accessories/ammo you would be willing to offer in the trade.

Factory correct 20 inch carbine barrel with integral front sight ramp, bore is sharp and mirror bright. The barrell and magazine retain 95% original blue. The receiver is mechanically fine, feeds, fires and ejects smoothly. Headspace is perfect. Receiver has the typical mottled finish from this era, the carbona blue just never held that well on the nickle steel Winchester used in the receivers. It has the Lyman 56 receiver sight which was a factory option. The wood is solid and tight, nicely grained black walnut that has a few very minor handling marks but no chips, cracks, extra holes or bad dents. This is a fine vintage Winchester that has that ""slick as glass"" feel when you cycle the bolt. A rare model 64 factory carbine from an era of fine craftmanship we will probably never see again"

This gun was inherited from my father and since I am not a gun person I have no use for it. All I know is what others who have looked at it have to say. Overall it is in excellent condition with only a very few minor marks. Barrel is clean inside and out as are all of the metal parts. The wood stock shows some very minor wear but is also in excellent condition.

Everything my dad owned looked new because he was so anal about maintenance and upkeep on his stuff. His work pants and shorts even had a crease ironed in them so you know he took good care of his guns.

This gun has the 30"" ribbed barrel with full choke. It has the factory recoil pad and the stock is very nice with great checkering. Bluing is in excellent shape as is the bore. Excellent shape overall considering its age.

My dad lightly hand scribed his drivers license number in small letters on the bottom of the receiver but other than that it is very clean. This could be easy to remove since it is not deep.

I can send more pictures if interested. Shipping additional to HI or Ak. Please feel free to ask any questions. Since I am new to this site we will need to complete this transaction through your local FFL Dealer for your safety and mine. If you are local to me we can bypass the FFL Dealer part unless the new law changes before we make a deal by 12/4/2014. The price is $500 or best offer.

I also have 16 boxes of 2-3/4 shells and a hard case I will include in this sale if you want them. Not sure I can ship the shells so they will be for locals only.

If you are serious please send contact info: Name, Phone, and best time I may reach you. NO contact info no reply or response since I only have time for serious inquires.

I would just like to sell this so I am open to offers or suggestions. Thanks for looking."

It also has the barrels brazed together which makes it much more sturdy and accurate than other models that are just joined by a clamp at the muzzle. 

Both barrels are immaculate on the inside. The action is crisp and the extractors work perfectly. Cosmetically, it's not the best looking gun, but it was well maintained. 

There is no screw-in adjustable choke. The gun also has 3/8ths inch grooves on top of the .22 barrel for a scope.
