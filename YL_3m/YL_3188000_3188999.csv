What’s more, the spring is removable from the assembly for custom tuning, and both the AR-15 and AR-10 versions of the JP Silent Captured Springs are functional in rifle- and carbine-length operating systems.

They come in 9"",12.5"", or 16"". They are in the popular caliber of 300 Blackout. These are some sweet guns. AAC did a great job on these weapons.

Advanced Armament Corporation complete MPW rifles are available in 16”, 12.5” and 9” barrels chambered for 300 AAC BLACKOUT. (*All NFA rules apply)

A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm  magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 9, 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.*

Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. 

Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by MagPul Industries. One magazine is included. Optics, mounts, and silencer are not included.

The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition.

Perfect for compact, concealed carry

Loaded-chamber indicator
Single-position Picatinny rail
Available in 3.3"" and 4""
To create the XD-S Centerfire Pistols, Springfield Armory took the best innovations of the award-winning XD Series and trimmed down the frame to a perfect size for compact, concealed carry. Metal parts on each gun are forged and machined from billet with utmost precision. Fully hammer-forged barrels enhance accuracy. Corrosion-resistant finishes are either super-hard black Melonite® or classic bead-blasted stainless steel. The Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied. Loaded-chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. Grip safety allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. A more pronounced texture on the XD-S ensures your grip is always secure. A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size with this feature. The XD-S trigger has a short travel along with a short reset, which keeps you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots. The low-profile rear sight is holster friendly. Fiber-optic front sight promotes easier and faster target acquisition. Customize your grip with two interchangeable backstraps. Includes rugged carry case, paddle holster, double magazine pouch, two interchangeable backstraps, two magazines, cable lock, bore brush and safety manual

I've owned this rifle for nearly 40 years and have only fired it about 50 times with no problems at all.

A little history about N.O. rifles. -First off, you should know that the National Ordnance rifle was never a military-issue weapon. National Ordnance made their own receivers, assembled the rest of the rifle with government surplus parts, and sold the results on the civilian market back in the 1960s. Now, that's not to say they're not good-shooting guns -- they're just not military-issue ones. The good news is, in1963, H.P. White Laboratory tested 3 of the N.O. receivers and found no weaknesses or flaws during the abusive and destructive testing If your looking for a shooter or something you can sporterize then this gun is for you. If your a serious collector of military  weapons, this is not what you want.  Standard rounds should work great but I would stay away from shooting extra high powered rounds through any older gun like this.

I really prefer a good trade.

The Spike’s Tactical Dynacomp is a 5.56 muzzle device designed to reduce recoil impulse and muzzle climb to provide faster follow up shots. The Dynacomp's accomplish this by balancing the direction of the blast along the vertical (upward) and perpendicular planes of the muzzle to lower muzzle rise, while the end of the device restricts forward energy to reduce parallel recoil. 

The ports on the Dynacomp are ball dimpled for smooth expansion of gases and rapid heat dissipation. The front of the device is 0.25"" thick to better handle the abuse of full auto fire. The entire device is Melonite treated to enhance these characteristics and provide a slick black finish. 

NOTE: The Standard model will bring a 14.5"" barrel to legal (non-NFA) length when pinned.

I have a like new springfield m1a scout squad 18inch with walnut stock. Shot roughly 30 rounds and isn't even broken in. These are based of the M14 that the military uses. These rifles are very sought after and are very accurate. Sometimes you need something a little different. A full sized battle rifle can be a tight squeeze in your truck or in the heavy brush. The Springfield Armory® M1A-A1™ Scout Squad™ combines the legendary power and reliability of the M1A™ with the quick handling and fast sight acquisition of a scout style rifle.
From the two-stage military trigger to the aperture style rear sight (adjustable for windage and elevation), you’ll find that the Scout Squad™ is packed with all the standard features that make the M1A™ great. The barrel is shortened to 18 inches – something you’ll appreciate on those longer hikes over the mountain and through the alders. The forward position scope mount brings you the added versatility of extended eye-relief optics. The Scout Squad™ also features a specially designed muzzle brake to help tame the recoil.
Whether you’re looking to save some space on your next big hunting trip, or you need a ranch rifle that will be a constant companion, the Scout Squad™ will give you the maneuverability of a scout rifle with the same power and features of a legendary American battle rifle.

Unlike any revolver you have ever seen especially in its unique design.
 As a Defense revolver, offers great concealability thanks to a very unusual profile. The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire. The versions of 2"" Rhino with Double Action only (item codes ending with ""D"" instead of ""DS"") do not have an external hammer.

Top Rifle: This rifle was put together by Surplus Ammo & Arms in Tacoma, and is an excellent shooter. The upper is SAA with 16"" free-floated stainless steel barrel with lightweight profile, and a MI 11"" freefloating handguard with rail on top that mates up perfectly with the receiver. The handguard has tapped holes that allow accessories or rail sections to be added easily and securely. The lower receiver is also made by SAA, and I swapped out a ALG QMS nickle plated trigger for the absolute best mil-spec trigger I've ever shot. Other accessories include an extended tactical latch charging handle, MFT Battlelink Minimalist buttstock with QD Sling points, Hogue pistol grip, and receiver endplate with quick attach loop for sling.
Optics - on top is a Vortex Viper HS 2.5-10x44 with the Dead Hold BDC reticle & 30mm tube. This scope has an unconditional lifetime warranty that is transferable, and not limited to the original owner. It is sighted in dead on at 200yds. It comes with a screw on sunshade (not shown in picture), and I still have the original box it came in. The scope is mounted in Warne all steel 30mm rings. Warne makes all of their rings in the USA.

Here is one of the best products from Turkish Gunmakers, the most competitive producers in the gun market. This is SAR Arms’s model B6P Compact 9mm, a slick made, credible clone of the tried and true CZ75 P01 Compact. Its price competition to both Baby Eagles and parent CZs themselves is making more than ripples in the firearms industry. Design, of course, descends from John M. Browning’s 1935 Hi-Power. Manufacturer is Sarsilmaz of Istanbul, Republic of Turkey. Importer is European American Armory, E.A.A., of Rockledge, Florida. Type is traditional single and double action blowback semi-automatic. Construction is steel barrel, slide, and internal parts all in a steel lined polymer frame. Finish is matte blue. Barrel is 3.5 inch 6 groove, hard chrome plated with matching full length steel guide rod and pressed in barrel bushing. Slide to frame fit is excellent, with full contact slide rails that runs the length of the slide. Weight empty is 25 ounces. Sights are three dot cp,bat configuration, dovetailed rear sight and rivet secured modified partridge front, 4 1/2 inch sight radius. Hammer is .315 black matte steel serrated skeleton Commander type, with .312 smooth face matching combat trigger. Double action pull is hitchy from a resting hammer, but smooth and consistent from the half cock position. Single action pull on the photo specimen measured 5 1/2 pounds with minimal felt creep. This pistol has a firing pin safety and single lever main safety for right handed shooters. Since the lever is the same as the larger, ambidextrous K2P9, an ambidextous setup is a distinct possibility, and EAA has always had excellent customer service. Lever safety will engage in all three hammer positions: full rest, half cock, and fully cocked for secure carry and single action cocked-and-locked readiness. The safety Does Not decock the hammer. Trigger guard configuration is rounded type front face, and the grip frame is serrated fore and aft, with light stippling cast into the panel areas that contain Sar Arms’s logos. Grip frame will accommodate a Hogue Handall if the owner feels the need to use a rubber. Magazine is Sarsilmaz’s own proprietary CZ type, blue steel body with steel spring, black polymer finger rest floorplate, and red polymer cartridge follower. Capacity is 13 rounds of 9mm Luger / Parabellum Ammunition. This is an excellent pistol. Fit and finish are excellent. Similar pistols from the parent CZ manufacturer command pricing upwards of $700 apiece. While we expect substantial price increases, we’re nevertheless offering the SAR Arms / EAA B6PL9 Compact in the photos, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 328.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, Maryland, or Massachusetts. Add any number of Mec-Gar CZ7516B 16 Shot magazines [subject to our stock on hand] at $29 per with gun purchase. Full size CZ Mags will protrude from the grip frame, of course. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 13 round magazines are restricted, $10 off with no magazines. We are working on 10 round magazines for these. CZ P01 Magazines will go into battery, but they leave some gap between the frame butt and the P01 Mag’s Finger Rest. The B6PL9’s magazine is a no go on a P01, because the floorplate interferes. Affected jurisdictions include Chicago Cook County IL, Connecticut, Hawaii, and New York. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $15 lower 48; $40 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, USPS Priority, insured with Delivery Confirmation.

It is in good shape overall but has a big cosmetic scratch down the front from a garage door mishap. Otherwise it is in good shape.

I also put some foam tape around the door sill because these things aren't a super tight fit and it would rattle a bit when I walked by the closet it was in.

DESCRIPTION: 	 

Up for sale is a HK USP 40 full size pistol, pre-owned and in very good condition.  This USP is the V1 variant, meaning it can be fired in single or double action, with a right handed safety/decocker lever.  This firearm comes equipped with Trijicon 3-dot night sights and comes with 5 magazines (One 13-round and four 10-round).  The firearm shows some minor wear to the bluing near the muzzle and a few spots on the slide.  There is also some light scratches on the bottom left side of the grip.  Hopefully these minor cosmetic flaws were captured in the photos.  Cosmetically I'd call it 90%.  Functionally the firearm is in excellent condition.  As with all of our pre-owned firearms, this was sent back to our gunsmith where it was disassembled, inspected, cleaned, function checked, and test fired.

These firearms retail for well over $800 new when equipped with night sights, and that doesn't include the mags we have.  As an added bonus, if you purchase this firearm and pick it up in person, we'll throw in a 100 round pack of Winchester White Box FMJ ammo.

Here is one of the best products from Turkish Gunmakers, the most competitive producers in the gun market. This is SAR Arms’s model K2P, a slick made, credible clone of the tried and true CZ75 Wondernine, as we called them in the 1970s. Its price competition to both Baby Eagles and parent CZs themselves is making more than ripples in the firearms industry. Design, of course, descends from John M. Browning’s 1935 Hi-Power. Manufacturer is Sarsilmaz of Istanbul, Republic of Turkey. Importer is European American Armory, E.A.A., of Rockledge, Florida. Type is traditional single and double action blowback semi-automatic. Construction is steel barrel, slide, and internal parts all in a steel lined polymer frame. Finish is matte blue. Barrel is 4.6 inch 6 groove, hard chrome plated with matching full length steel guide rod and pressed in barrel bushing. Slide to frame fit is excellent, with full contact slide rails that runs the length of the slide. Sights are Italian windage and elevation adjustable three dot configuration, dovetailed rear sight and rivet secured modified partridge front, 5 1/2 inch sight radius. Hammer is .315 black matte steel serrated skeleton Commander type, with .312 smooth face matching combat trigger. Double action pull is hitchy from a resting hammer, but smooth and consistent from the half cock position. Single action pull on the photo specimen measured 5 1/2 pounds with minimal felt creep. This pistol has a firing pin safety and ambidextrous main safety for right- and left-handed shooters. Lever safety will engage in all three hammer positions: full rest, half cock, and fully cocked for secure carry and single action cocked-and-locked readiness. The safety Does Not decock the hammer. Trigger guard configuration is SP01 type square serrated front face, and the grip frame is serrated fore and aft, with vertical scores on the panel areas that contain Sar Arms’s logos. Grip frame will accommodate a Hogue Handall if the owner feels the need to use a rubber. Magazine is Sarsilmaz’s own proprietary CZ type, blue steel body and floorplate with steel spring and red polymer cartridge follower. Capacity is 15 rounds of 9mm Luger / Parabellum Ammunition. This is an excellent pistol. Fit and finish are excellent. Similar pistols from the parent CZ manufacturer command pricing upwards of $700 apiece. While we expect substantial price increases, we’re nevertheless offering the SAR Arms / EAA K2 in the photos, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 289.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of California, District of Colombia, Maryland, or Massachusetts. Add any number of Mec-Gar CZ7516B 16 Shot magazines [subject to our stock on hand] at $29 per with gun purchase. For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where 15 round magazines are restricted, we will sub a 10 round Baby Eagle magazine for $10 extra, or $10 off with no magazines.

Im interested in WWII era guns & up to the 1950's military guns. I also like semi-auto rifles. Guns Im looking for are a British Lee Enfield, German K-98 Mauser, Jap Arisaka or any U.S. guns. The only Mosin Nagant Id be interested in is the Sniper rifle. But if your interested feel free to let me know what you have. This is a 1909 Mauser Rifle made in Germany by Deutsche Waffen-und Munitionsfabriken in Berlin. After production of the rifles they were sold to the Argentine Government. Along the line this gun was brought to the U.S. since a Mauser military rifle made excellent hunting rifles. This one was Sporterized & all the numbers still match. Who ever Sporterized this rifle turning it from a 7.65 to a 30.06 did a Beautiful job. This rifle is flawless. The wood stock is in excellent condition, the barrel has not one spec of rust or pitting anywhere & there is a upgraded trigger system & a new bolt. This bolt is completely different from a Mauser rifle & A LOT nicer to use. An the Bushnell scope is sighted in that you can shot a gnats ass at 100 yards. An theres more the Leather sling is absolutley beautiful it has a picture of a Buck & acorns on it."

I bought this great rifle from an elderly gentleman at a California gun show, a little less than two years ago. It was in pristine condition, still in the box. The gentleman stated he only fire the rifle twice, but it was too much going for him to handle at his age. 

It's been very well taken care of since. I've taken it black bear hunting, moose hunting, pig hunting, and other sorts of smaller predators for sport. Because of it shorter barrel and being lightweight but extremely powerful, I would also utilize it as a primary point weapon for thick brush, while hunting in grizzly country.

This shotgun is NOT C&R eligible. Here is an excellent Chinese copy, and in some respects an improvement on, the workhorse Remington 870. Since the 870 was introduced in 1950, its patent probably expired in 2000, hence these excellent tributes to the Wingmaster. Manufacturer is Zonghzou Machine Works, Jin An China, one of the former Norinco operatives. Importer is Interstate Arms in Billerica, Massachusetts. Finish is entirely matte black with classic corncob 870P type forends in black synthetic, and matching buttstock with a nice thick recoil pad. Sight system is conventional bead sight but also with frame mounted Tactical Picatinny Rail that accepts any Weaver Style Optical mounts or device. Weight empty is about 7 1/2 pounds. Note the mar on the finish. It's a safe assumption that none of the 981 Hawks will be cosmetically perfect. Credit finish mars to the rice paper boxes that these come in, even though Chinese boxmanship has improved over the last decade. Nevertheless these are solid, quality shotguns and attractive finishwise. All of them are brand new in their original boxes, and we take great pains with rice-boxed guns when we ship them. Note the high visibility orange follower. Barrel is 18 inch Cylinder Bore, .718-.720 at the muzzle. Magazine capacity is five plus one round of 12 gauge 2 3/4 inch shells, or four plus one round of 3 inch magnum. Note the extended section of the magazine forward of the barrel lug. We have added an FM brand, Brand New Electronic Green or Red Dot Sight, adjustable two colors with brand new mounts, all excellent quality and all manufactured in the same neighborhood as the shotgun itself. All the owner will need to do is put the rings on the sight, screw it down to the rail, and zero it in. We have also added a polymer heat shield, similar to the famed Trench Guns of World War One. A Remington 870 tricked out like this one commands prices in the $700 - $800 vicinity. We're offering these excellent 870 clone shotguns, however, complete with shield, mounts and sight, each for only $ 219.00. This shotgun is NOT C&R eligible. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $20 flat fee lower 48 states; $60 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, UPS Ground with full insurance coverage.

This shotgun is NOT C&R eligible. Buyers help us connect the dots, please fill in your FFL's info on your GA forms. This listing is for One shotgun, dealers and law enforcement, however, may take any number of extras we have on hand at the same per-gun price and with no additional shipping charges. This is our #LG982T. Here is an excellent Chinese copy, and in some respects an improvement on, the workhorse Remington 870. Since the 870 was introduced in 1950, its patent probably expired in 2000, hence these excellent tributes to the Wingmaster. Manufacturer is Zonghzou Machine Works, Jin An China, one of the former Norinco operatives. Importer is Interstate Arms in Billerica, Massachusetts. Finish is entirely matte black with classic corncob 870P type forends in black synthetic, and matching buttstock with a nice thick recoil pad. Sight is the classic and popular military Ghost Ring peep sight setup. Weight empty is about 7 1/2 pounds. Note the mar on the finish. It's a safe assumption that none of the 982 Hawks will be cosmetically perfect. Credit finish mars to the rice paper boxes that these come in, even though Chinese boxmanship has improved over the last decade. Nevertheless these are solid, quality shotguns and attractive finishwise. All of them are brand new in their original boxes, and we take great pains with rice-boxed guns when we ship them. Note the high visibility orange follower. Barrel is 18 inch Cylinder Bore, .718-.720 at the muzzle. Magazine capacity is five plus one round of 12 gauge 2 3/4 inch shells, or four plus one round of 3 inch magnum. Note the extended section of the magazine forward of the barrel lug. We have added a polymer heat shield, similar to the famed Trench Guns of World War One. Own one of these fine shotguns for only $ 219.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of New York City, or any jurisdiction where 6 shot pump shotguns are restricted to law enforcement only. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> $20 flat fee lower 48 states; $60 Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico, UPS Ground or USPS Priority with full insurance coverage.
