I believe that only a few hundred have been made.  You can purchase this rifle from Dennis Quakenbush cheaper than my asking price but you may have to wait years to get on his waiting list and then another year for one to be made.

I purchase this as a range toy but I will not be able to play for a few years because I decided to go back to university to complete a few more degrees.

The standard walnut stock is a work of art!  I can see no flaws on this gun.  It was removed from the shipping box  to take pictures and then was repackaged.  It is in mint, unfired condition.

Preppers love these air rifles.  You can take the largest american game with off the shelf(or out of the mold!) .45/70 bullets up to 500 grains.  If you have a supply of lead, a mold and fire, you will always be able to hunt when the SHTF.  You can fill either from a hand pump or a scuba tank.  The reservoir is rated for over 3000 PSI.

From the DAQ website...

""A 25” barrel, this rifle is 44” overall.  It weighs approximately 8lbs. 6oz.  The stock is familiar to tens of millions of shooters because the stock is the same shape and proportion of modern center fire rifles, like the Winchester model 70 and the Remington 700.

The LA Outlaw shoots a 430gr bullet at 732fps, which is 509fpe.  This rifle will produce two powerful shots from its reservoir on one fill.  It doesn’t need to be line fed from a scuba bottle, it doesn’t have the dependency of life support from a remote air source. 

The .458 cal. barrel is made expressly for airgun use.  It is not a firearm barrel.  This barrel has the correct rifling configuration and twist rate for an airgun.  I chose .458 cal. for this rifle so the shooter could use any of the ready-made bullets or bullet molds intended for use for the 45/70 cartridge.  Because the barrels are made from solid bar stock they are machined to the exact bore size without exception.  This way the standard size bullets fit the barrel; it is not some oddball caliber""

This is a cash, in person sale only to persons 18 years of age and older...this is NOT a toy.  I would take a partial trade...what do you have?  I do have permit as well as a C&R license."

 This thing is GREAT on gas, even with the performance upgrades it can get 180+ miles out of the 5 gal gas tank. Mechanic owned so every maintnence thing has been taken care of and this bike has been babied. i bought it to get back and forth to work and save on gas. Would make a great toy for someone thats looking for some reliable fun times.

 1. Savage Arms repeating bolt-action rifle 30-06 110: LNIB, Less than 10 shots fired

Safe King: Bought in Fall of 2013 and placed in Safe, only removed for regular cleaning. Was taken out last year for deer season, sighted in, and never shot (deer came on first day, in first 30min of hunt at 6am...should have shot :\  

Asking $375 with Scope, $325 without Scope

Why is this more expensive than other Savage 110s on Armslist? This gun has been stored in a humidity controlled gunsafe its entire life, I don't have to tell you what moisture can do to a gun, and is in Like new condition with less than 10shots fired, technically its not even broke in yet, so your getting a brand new 30-06 at a discounted price that has the ability to shoot 700 to 800yards. If purchased face to face you will also have the ability to shoot 1 full mag (5 shots) at steel and paper targets , distances from 25yards up to 140yards, on personal 3 acre Target/Run and gun course on personal farm for free. How many people have there own personal Run and gun/target course ranging from 25yards to 140yards spread out over 3acres where you can test everything on the gun, for free with purchase?  Bench site includes 3 steel targets, one at 100 yards, one at 130yards, & one at 140yards. &  3 paper silhouette targets at 50, 75, and 100 yards. What more do you need? 

Scope is already Zero'ed for 110yards, Consistent 1.5 - 2inch groups, ammo depending, at 140yards.  Perfect practice and gun for Deer Season, at half the expense. 

***Will save you more money than you think on Range Fees and Ammo, plus Rifle is pre-zeroed, so if you don't know how to zero a scope or its been awhile, no problem, I've got you covered. Ask yourself, truthfully how much ammo you use when you zero your scope, now think about how much you would save ***

Perfect shotgun to introduce young ones into hunting and shooting. 20gauge has very little recoil compared to all other shotguns  
Safe stored in humidity controlled safe and cleaned regularly.

Features

 - American walnut wood stock and pump handguard
 - Receiver & Barrel are richly blued and highly polished 
 - A wide array of barrel and choke options make it very versatile for various hunting requirements

Asking $ 500

Why is this more expensive than some Remington 870's on Armslist? This gun has been stored in a humidity controlled gunsafe its entire life, I don't have to tell you what moisture can do to a gun, and is in Like new condition with less than 50shots fired, technically its not even broke in yet, so your getting a like new 20g Shotgun at a discounted price. If purchased face to face you will also have the ability to shoot 9 birdshot loads at paper/steel targets (18total spread out over 3acres), distances ranging from 25yards up to 140yards, on personal target/Run and Gun course on personal farm for free. How many people have there own target/Run and Gun course ranging from 25yards to 140yards where you can test everything on the gun, for free with purchase?   


I also have more HD pictures of the entire gun, which really shows how pristine her condition is in. Have multiple pics of pump handguard (both left, right, and bottom) which is in pristine condition, the entire barrel, and the entire left side. To many pictures to post, Just shoot me an email and I can send them right to you, no problem.

The ELCAN M145C 3.4x Combat Optical Sight, Torque Knob Mount (ELCM145C) was developed specifically for the U.S. Army to be used as the main battle sight.

The Rotary Knob on the side has 1 Off position and can be adjusted through 11 Brightness settings for the illuminated 10 - 1200m Ranging Reticle. Rear and front lens covers flip down for storage and transportation.

The Torque Knob models incorporate ballistic compensation in the Reticle only. This sight can be mounted to any MIL-STD-1913 rail in seconds, and will retain zero when removed and re-attached to your weapon, time after time. This is the kind of dependability that you should come to expect from ELCAN.  The M145C is built to stringent specifications and is designed for extreme-duty applications where only the most rugged equipment will suffice.

Receiver date is June 1943!  Might have seen action in Korea as well since it has a May 1951 barrel

It has a Springfield Barrel, Trigger Group and Bolt. 

ME is 2 and TE is 3+.  Bore is bright with string rifling  

I bought a ME and TE gauge because the store I bought this from usually over classifies the measurements, erring on the higher rating.

There are 8 rings on the ME picture so you can see that the 2 ring is clearly visible. I'd rate it a 1.5 or a 1+

 The 3 is right under the receiver in the chamber, so again I'd rate it as a 3 not a 3 +.

LG405 Grip
The LG-405 laser sight is the latest design in Lasergrips® for the wildly popular Smith & Wesson J-Frame revolver line. Featuring a front activated laser that is engaged instinctively when the revolver is held in a natural shooting grip, the LG-405 laser sight is manufactured with a rubber overmold material over a polymer base. In addition to the enhanced sighting provided by Crimson Trace® Lasergrips, the LG-405 also features an innovative air pocket on top of the backstrap that effectively reduces felt recoil up to 30%. The LG-405 on a J-Frame is ideal for deep concealment."

I have owned this Sig for a long time. I dropped it off to have it Cerakoted and the smith fucked it up. The magazine release has a spring loaded pin that needs to be depressed before being removed. My guess the ""smith"" used a punch and knocked out the tiny portion of the frame the pin catches on. I had it rewelded but it was too soft and the release has since worked itself out. It worked flawlessly for the several hundred rounds before it failed again.

Its a shame because finding West German made sigs in good condition is getting harder to find. The pistol has had a trigger job and spring kit installed in the last couple years. I have even used it in IDPA occasionally at the Master level. 

You can use it for parts, or have a competent smith fix this very easily.  I just recently acquired a mk25 and x5 so I have decided to not pursue repairing this one.  From what I have seen just the complete slide and barrel sell for I think my price is more than fair for a complete pistol."

I have owned this Sig for a long time. I dropped it off to have it Cerakoted and it was damaged by the gunsmith. The magazine release has a spring loaded pin that needs to be depressed before being removed. My guess the ""smith"" used a punch and knocked out the tiny portion of the frame the pin catches on. I had it rewelded but since switched it to right hand release. Works flawlessly. With just some work you can switch it back ti the original side. 

 Its a shame because finding West German made sigs in good condition is getting harder to find. The pistol has had a trigger job and spring kit installed in the last couple years. I have even used it in IDPA occasionally at the Master level."

Heckler & Koch M700009-A5 VP9 9mm Pistol, Striker Fired, 4.09 Inch Barrel, 15 Rd, Night Sights
In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.
Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.
The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitor’s. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.
The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.
VP9 pistols have an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.
The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

The rifle has had 300 rounds of non-corrosive steel-cased ammo fired for sighting in and function checking. Sights are straight, action is smooth, very accurate. 

Finish is the stock Arsenal paint; in other words, looks great, but not particularly tough. There are scratches on the front sling attachment, small rub marks from MI rail and side rail usage, and wear in the usual spots from firing and manipulating the safety, but overall in very good condition.

Includes buttstock cleaning kit, 10-round Bulgarian waffle magazine, 30-round Combloc steel magazine, and Blue Force Gear AK sling.

If you are looking for a rugged, good-looking AK-47, don't miss the opportunity to pick this one up, as the 107CR has not been imported for many years and has become hard-to-find due to lack of supply. Perfect for shooting or showing off, very compact when you need to transport or store. 

Whether you are a new owner and want a top-shelf, factory-built rifle for your first AK or a long-time collector looking to fill a hole in your high-end military firearms collection, this rifle has something for you. Already has wonderful balance because of the combo FSP/GB, but would make a terrific SBR.

I live in Birmingham, but travel to Huntsville and Mobile regularly. I can provide proof (e.g. pistol permit) that I am a good guy and as many references as you need from recent firearms transactions. Deal with confidence. I won't waste your time, please don't waste mine."
