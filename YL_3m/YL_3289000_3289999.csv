DESCRIPTION:   
Velocity Works is proud to offer the custom-built VW Sniper Mosin Nagant. 

The objective of this custom-built rifle was to produce a capable and attractive heavy caliber, long-range precision target rifle that fires inexpensive ammo and can be had for hundreds less than an off-the-shelf item in the same category. 

We started with a conventional 91-30 round-receiver Mosin Nagant.  We then removed the action and barrel from the wood stock, and completely degreased, cleaned, inspected, and function checked the firearm.  All the steel was then polished and professionally hot blued on site to bring out the luster of the steel and protect from corrosion. 

For mounting optics, we went with a top-of-the-line picatinny scope mount.  These heavy duty mounts are precision machined out of 6061 aluminum here in the USA.  The mount utilizes 3 mounting points and has a hard coating to resist chips, scratches and corrosion.  These mounts have been tested up to 800 yards with sub-MOA results, quite impressive considering the kick of a 7.62x54R round.  We had the mount professionally installed by our on-sight gunsmith, who measures, fits the parts, and drills and taps the necessary holes to secure the mount. Included with the mount is a custom down-turned bolt handle which allows the clearance to move freely under the scope.  The bolt handle and body were polished to a high-shine finish. 

For optics we mounted a Sniper Precision Optics 4-16x50mm scope.  Features include a red or green illuminated reticle, locking windage and elevation adjustments, and a removable sun shade. 

To increase the precision of the platform, we installed a Timney Trigger on the receiver.  The light, crisp, 2.5 lb pull has to be felt to be believed.  The action was then fit and installed into a Pro Mag Archangel Mosin Nagant stock.  This new-age, ergonomically friendly, composite stock features a fully adjustable length-of-pull and cheek rest, a small storage compartment, and accepts the included 5-round detachable magazine (10-round mags are available as well).  A Caldwell tilting bipod rounds out the whole package. 

Each of these rifles is fully tested and absolutely ready to fire and enjoy.  If you are looking for a time-tested, heavy caliber, attractive, long range precision target rifle that fires cheap and readily available ammunition while costing hundreds less than the alternatives, purchase one now, or contact us about building one of these custom rifles for you!

DESCRIPTION:   
Velocity Works is proud to offer the custom-built VW Sniper Mosin Nagant. 

The objective of this custom-built rifle was to produce a capable and attractive heavy caliber, long-range precision target rifle that fires inexpensive ammo and can be had for hundreds less than an off-the-shelf item in the same category. 

We started with a conventional 91-30 round-receiver Mosin Nagant.  We then removed the action and barrel from the wood stock, and completely degreased, cleaned, inspected, and function checked the firearm.  All the steel was then polished and professionally hot blued on site to bring out the luster of the steel and protect from corrosion. 

For mounting optics, we went with a top-of-the-line picatinny scope mount.  These heavy duty mounts are precision machined out of 6061 aluminum here in the USA.  The mount utilizes 3 mounting points and has a hard coating to resist chips, scratches and corrosion.  These mounts have been tested up to 800 yards with sub-MOA results, quite impressive considering the kick of a 7.62x54R round.  We had the mount professionally installed by our on-sight gunsmith, who measures, fits the parts, and drills and taps the necessary holes to secure the mount. Included with the mount is a custom down-turned bolt handle which allows the clearance to move freely under the scope.  The bolt handle and body were polished to a high-shine finish. 

For optics we mounted a Sniper Precision Optics 4-16x50mm scope.  Features include a red or green illuminated reticle, locking windage and elevation adjustments, and a removable sun shade. 

The action was then fit and installed into a Pro Mag Archangel Mosin Nagant stock.  This new-age, ergonomically friendly, composite stock features a fully adjustable length-of-pull and cheek rest, a small storage compartment, and accepts the included 5-round detachable magazine (10-round mags are available as well).  A UTG tactical bipod rounds out the whole package. 

Each of these rifles is fully tested and absolutely ready to fire and enjoy.  If you are looking for a time-tested, heavy caliber, attractive, long range precision target rifle that fires cheap and readily available ammunition while costing hundreds less than the alternatives, purchase one now, or contact us about building one of these custom rifles for you!

Both of my guns are working and clean and I've only taken them to the indoor range a handful of times and thoroughly cleaned them right after. Putting glass on either is a huge pain in the ass and I'd really like to be able to put my new scope on something. The side mount on the Saiga is looking like a good option that won't break the bank if I could trade one or both (if warranted and fair for both parties) depending on what you have. If you happen to have a Saiga in .308 then I have a couple spam cans of ammo for the SKS I wouldn't need and could either sell or include. I know the going cost for my guns as well as the Saiga so I'm not looking to low ball or lose my ass on a trade but of its reasonable I'm open to ideas and offers.... I'm sure there is an equally beneficial trade we can work out.

This one was sent to me from Afghanistan by a very close friend who is a SFO. This laser is amazing it is built like a tank and his totally indestructible. You can follow the beam even before dark and after dark it looks like something from STAR WARS. Yes you will go to jail very fast if caught with this laser especially mounted to this rifle. Yes it will light a Match in a second. Comes with 2 tail caps one pressure and one click and zero tool. This rifle is all new never fired and comes with all paper work and manual. The only other AIMSHOT LS8300 I have ever seen sold on GB about a month ago for 859$ and it didn't have the factory mount.

This compact gun will make a good concealed carry or home defense weapon and is very accurate for a snubbie. Sorry, no box or papers. Price shown is for a face to face cash sale in the Aiken area."

Leupold VX-1 3-9x50mm Rifle Scope

Leupold VX-1 3-9x50mm Rifle Scope offers professional performance on an amateur's budget, combining the high quality optics that Leupold is known for with a very sensible price tag. These Leupold rifle scopes offer the advantage of a 50mm objective bell to allow a larger exit pupil to be offered to the user for more comfort and greater control. The VX-I is a great riflescope for the white tailed deer hunter, the predator hunter, and anyone else needing the maximum amount of light from his or her scope. That's because each Leupold VX-1 3-9x Riflescope utilizes Leupold's standard multicoat lens system to allow the maximum amount of light to reach your eye, thus improving the scope's brightness. Minute adjustments in windage and elevation are easy to make with the Leupold VX-1's micro-friction windage and elevation knobs, which have a click rate of 1/4 MOA and can be adjusted even with gloves. The VX-1 rifle scope is built with a classic lockable eyepiece to keep focus constant, and their rugged 1"" tube is completely waterproof for added durability. A rugged and reliable rifle scope with a wide magnification range and plenty of brightness, the Leupold VX1 3-9x50mm Multicoat Rifle Scope can revolutionize your next hunt.

The Mossberg MMR Hunter with its 5.56 NATO chamber makes a great choice for cost efficient AR-15 patterned rifle. Mossberg incorporates a fixed A2 style stock, Stark SE-1 pistol grip, aluminum free float handguard, optics ready flat top upper, and dual front swivel studs into The MMR.

One of the many new models that made its debut this year is the LC380. The Ruger LCP has been a huge hit in the modern-day concealed-carry market, but even its fans didn’t think it was perfect. The frame was just too small to get all your fingers on it, and the sights…well, some LCP owners might be surprised to hear their pistols actually have sights.

While the capacity of the LC380 stays the same (7+1), recoil will be less. Being chambered in a less powerful cartridge, the recoil spring for the LC380 is lighter, so the slide is easier to rack. If you are small or weak, buying a gun whose slide you can’t rack or which hurts you every time you shoot it does not encourage regular practice sessions. The .380 you have with you, and have practiced shooting, is better than the 9mm you don’t.

This new gun also allows Ruger to sell a .380 ACP in certain places it couldn’t before because the LC380 has more safety features than the LCP; more on that later.
The LC380 is a bit big for a .380 ACP but still small enough to fit in most pockets. It is 6.0 inches long, 4.5 inches high, and only 0.9 inch wide. It weighs 17.2 ounces unloaded."

first is the Yugo M92, which was converted from a pistol. It is 922r compliant and has been duracoated. It has had several hundred rounds fired through it, but functions flawlessly. Depending on the trade/sale it can come with a second side folding stock, a number of yugo bolt hold open mags, 75 round drum mag, and even ammo (again, for the right trade). I can certainly provide additional detail upon requet)

the second is the M85, which is an underfolder. It has also been converted from a pistol but has not been fired. It is chambered in 5.56x45 and is also 922r compliant. For the right deal it can also come with a number of the steel (not polymer junk) AK mags, and ammo.

I would be willing to trade each one individually, or both depending on what is being offered.

Please understand that while these are both 'AK's', they are not poor quality, everyday models. They are not the easiest to find, and the configuration that each one is in is even less common. These were made by the Zastava factory, and not in someones garage on a 'no name' receiver.

Starts with an 870 express mag, upgraded the mag with a parkerized 7 shot version.  The follower has been upgraded to a stainless version, also have a new extractor to fix any low brass FTE issues.  The recoil from 00 has now been tamed with the mako recoil reducing stock as well as the enidine hydraulic buffer assembly.  This thing is a cream-puff to handle now!  Also the furniture has been upgraded to the rubberized ergo pistol grip and the hogue rubberized forend so you don't fumble with anything in a pinch.

This holster is priced at $69.75, plus taxes, and shipping and handling charges. Priced at $60, this holster is a steal. It's already broken in, you don't have to deal with taxes or extra charges, or an insufferably long wait time to have it shipped to you. For $60 you get a high quality holster delivered to you in essentially hours instead of weeks or months. At the time of posting, the Crossbreed website says they are just now starting on orders from July 4th. So you are looking at a two week delay before they even start making your holster.
