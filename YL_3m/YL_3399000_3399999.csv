Barrel Busing and Spring plug    Stainless Steel w/ Black Oxide Finish. CW Accessories 
This is part of the CW Accessories Performance Enhancement series.  This system incorporates a custom stainless steel barrel bushing and a custom stainless steel  spring plug designed specifically to fit the GSG/SIG barrel and slide.  Designed to work without using the barrel screw.  This eliminates the problem of changing the point of impact every time you re-torque the barrel screw.    CW Accessories has an instructional video on how to install the hole cover screw.

Frame hole plug kit - This kit includes two stainless steel screws (One extra) with black oxide finish to plug the hole left in the frame when you remove the factory barrel screw. Kit also includes the proper size tap to tap the frame hole. This gives the gun a finished look and does not effect anything if you want to return the gun to stock condition. This is designed to be used with the CW Barrel Bushing and Spring Plug.  Instructional video is on the CW web site.  


These were taken from my working 22 1911 SIG and they function properly.  It was only used for about 1 month before I decided to sell it.  I sold my SIG and do not need these anymore."

I purchased this gun awhile back, shot about 30 rounds through it. I love the feel and barely any kick back! Perfect for the tactical enthusiast who wants to deck it all out or the casual weekend trap shooter like me. I decided to upgrade to a bigger gun more suited for competition trap shooting. Comes with the gun case as shown! 

I got it for $457, im taking a hit and selling it for $330 or OBO!

This is a fine example of a pre frame, grip, and rail Glock update that the third generation Glock series received.  Clean very low round count, personally only fired 39 rounds to test for function. I am not aware of how many rounds were fired but the wear is very indicative of a low round count.  In my research of the serial number I believe the date of manufacture is around 1995. 

Has factory installed Truglo TFO night sights which are dim but still point nice. This will come with two G23 13 round magazines. One is brand new which I bought as I prefer to have at the very minimum two magazine per firearm. 

Proper credentials will be required for state of MN residents only as all documents will be verified by myself and the sale will be conducted at an agreed upon FFL for a 4473 filled out in the purchasers name.

I used a quick Google search to fix the problem but that did not help me.

I then decided to get professional help to solve my problem. After having received many quotations from various companies, I decided to go ahead with Online Tech Repair (www.onlinetechrepairs.com). 


Reasons I chose them over the others:

1) They were extremely friendly and patient with me during my initial discussions and responded promptly to my request.

2) Their prices were extremely reasonable.

3) They were ready and willing to walk me through the entire process step by step and were on call with me till I got it fixed.


How did they do it?

1) They first asked me to state my problem clearly and asked me a few questions. This was done to detect any physical connectivity issues with the printer.

2) After having answered this, they confirmed that the printer and the laptop were functioning correctly.

3) They then, asked me if they could access my laptop remotely to troubleshoot the problem and fix it. I agreed.

4) One of the tech support executives accessed my laptop and started troubleshooting.

5) I sat back and watched as the tech support executive was navigating my laptop to spot the issue. The issue was fixed.

6) I was told that it was due to an older version of the driver that had been installed.


My Experience

I loved the entire friendly conversation that took place with them. They understood my needs clearly and acted upon the solution immediately. Being a technical noob, I sometimes find it difficult to communicate with tech support teams. It was a very different experience with the guys at Online Tech Repairs. You can check out their website www.onlinetechrepairs.com or call them on 1- 914-613-3786.

I would definitely recommend this service to anyone who needs help fixing their computers.

Thanks a ton guys. Great Job....!!

I have for sale my beloved Springfield TRP Operator 1911. You can go to Springfield’s website and read up on how f*ck!ng awesome this thing is; I’ll spare you the details here for the sake of brevity. 

I got this piece a year ago and put 150 rounds through it →EXACTLY!! It has since turned into a safe queen, which is a shameful life for this hand cannon. 

Price includes 300+ rounds of ammo, (mix of ball and hollow point in a Cabella’s ammo can), handful of 10 round magazines (Chip McCormick or Mec-gar), a KT Mech light compatible holster (for Surefire X300 Ultra), a Surefire x 300 Ultra, and some magazine pouches (3x BLACKHAWK! Kydex and 1x BLACKHAWK! Leather). 

Asking price is $1850. Feel free to price everything out; you’re getting a deal!! Serious offers will be considered but, PLEASE don’t send me bullsh!t offers with how cheap you can get this gun. I’ve done my research and know this is a fair and reasonable price. I also GUARANTEE you will not find this package, for this price, anywhere else. 

ONLY trades that will be considered are an Aimpoint Pro or Micro w/ mount +cash or a Glock 17 gen 3 or 4 +cash. Not interested in any other offers at this time nor selling anything individually at the moment.

Buy with confidence!!

YES, this is the FIRST edition and as I understand, they made less that 3,000 of these full metal pistols before they went to the polymer version.  According to Colt, this is #1856 of 3000. This is a real deal COLT 9mm!
This is an awesome piece of history! This would be a great piece for a collector and with so few of them made, they have tripled in value in recent years and they just continue to go up. Anyone that has handled this pistol to does not know what it is and it certainly is a conversation piece! They made very few of these pistols as they had a poor reputation for a few reasons. This particular pistol was just received back from Colt for maintenance, work and a recall to address many of those issues. I have not fired it since I have received it back, however it was TEST FIRED at the factory. *IF* you can find one without all the recall work done, you can find them cheaper. This one was all serviced at Colt April 2014 and it should be better than new (and more valuable)! See attached paperwork!

CONDITION: It is in good condition currently. It comes with one 15 round magazine. One scratch on the slide and a few other tiny imperfections.

HISTORY: The Colt 2000 or All American 2000 is a polymer or aluminum-alloy framed, locked-breech, rotary bolt, semiautomatic 9mm handgun with a magazine capacity of 15 rounds. Designed by C. Reed Knight (Of Knights Armament) and Eugene Stoner,(Designer of the M16/AR-15) as Colt's entry into the marketplace of the high-capacity polymer framed handguns of the early 1990s; it was believed by Colt that this pistol would recapture their stake in the police market as Police Departments across the United States switched from double-action revolvers to semiautomatic pistols. It was hoped that sales of this pistol might save the troubled company from bankruptcy on the heels of recovering from the UAW labor strike.

FUNCTIONALITY: The Colt 2000's internal workings were based on older firearms designs from the early twentieth century. The rotating barrel, for example, was based on that of the Steyr 1912 and the roller-locking mechanism was based on a design used by the French Manufacture d'Armes et des Cycles de Saint-Etienne since 1914. These features allow the barrel and slide to work as a unit moving to the rear until the barrel lug rotates into the cam-block and stops. The barrel lugs then align to allow the slide to continue its travel to the rear and extraction and ejection of the spent round occurs. The pistol breaks down into seven major parts for disassembly.

I will only sell to a CCW holder on a Bill of Sale or we can go through an FFL.

The Good : REB 4x4 Amphibious vehicle. built in the 80's, fiberglass body, 12.5 Briggs Stratton engine , Bilge pump in you get water inside, has reverse/low/high ,3 Liter gas tank, racks in front and back, roll bar, 12"" tires. reaches 20mph on land and 2-4mph in the water , had it in some water and floated fine ..parts are all ""farm"" parts and very easy to replace and work on, you can tear the hole thing down with just a couple wrenches. Fits in the back of my 1500 (its exactly 4ft wide and ~7 1/2ft long)

The Bad : there is a crack on the inside of one fender but its just fiberglass and an easy fix , has lights (some need hooked up, but the wires are there) , some of the tires have a little dry rot but hold air fine, missing a U joint in the front left (can see in pic, runs fine without it just doesn't have ""power"" on that tire), sometimes it will ""bounce"" out of gear but i put a little bungie on it and it stays in fine (the shifter is under the front of the seat, could make slots for each gear very easily), seat has tears in it and needs reupholstered has burlap on it-I even have some more camo burlap if you want it to put on the seat ...... ...

obviously needs a little TLC , but runs great and idles fine , will crawl all over, could take it right out in the field now for hunting or whatever, or could fix it up to be quite the crawler
