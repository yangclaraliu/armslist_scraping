 The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.

 TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.

 Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.


 I've put less than 500 rounds through this gun, function & performance have been absolutely perfect. Gun comes with 2 mags & all accessories in pictures.

Beautiful condition and all matching serial number Norinco Type 56s-1 underfolder. This is a true Pre-89 AK-47(s) imported by BCI, USA, making this unit at least 25 years old. Very clean bore and workings. The gas operation rod has the typical carbon build up and looks like the factory was in a hurry and the detent pen, spring and retaining pen was not installed on the front sight post. This is the mechanics that hold the muzzle break on to the threaded barrel, firmly. Also the guidrod that supports the spring is only half there with no signs that the hinged second parts was every installed. This is a non-essential part that only aids in the compression of the spring, during assembly. This firearm performs flawlessly without it. Not quite a safe queen but in beautiful condition. This is a true AK-47(s), all made in China, by Russian type machinery. This is as close as you will get to a type III Kalashnikov."

Beautiful condition and all matching serial number Norinco Type 56s-1 underfolder. This is a true Pre-89 AK-47(s) imported by BCI, USA, making this unit at least 25 years old. Very clean bore and workings. The gas operation rod has the typical carbon build up and looks like the factory was in a hurry and the detent pen, spring and retaining pen was not installed on the front sight post. This is the mechanics that hold the muzzle break on to the threaded barrel, firmly. Also the guidrod that supports the spring is only half there with no signs that the hinged second parts was every installed. This is a non-essential part that only aids in the compression of the spring, during assembly. This firearm performs flawlessly without it. Not quite a safe queen but in beautiful condition. This is a true AK-47(s), all made in China, by Russian type machinery. This is as close as you will get to a type III Kalashnikov."

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers. 

 The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitrite finish. 

 Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator.

The .223 Wylde hybrid chamber was designed by Bill Wylde of Greenup, IL to exploit the accuracy advantages of the .223 Remington chambering without pressure problems or compromising the functional reliability of (semi) automatic weapons like the AR-15 family when using 5.56×45mm NATO military ammunition.  Coincidentally, it shoots the relatively long and heavy 80-grain bullets commonly used in the sport of Highpower Rifle Competition very well and is one of the preferred chambers for that use. The Wylde chamber is used by a few rifle manufacturers who sell ""National Match"" configuration AR-15 rifles, barrels, and upper receivers."

The wood furniture is in beautiful shape, the bluing looks great too, only a couple minor scratches. The one issue with this rifle is the rear sight is bent to the right side as seen in the picture. I received the rifle like this, so I am not sure how it occurred. You can purchase rear sights that mount onto the back of the receiver that tend to be better than the original sights. Besides this, the rifle functions as it should. It comes with a weaver rail, which is currently mounted to the rifle, and a Bushnell scope, unknown model. The plug screws that go in place of the rail screws are missing, the rail was mounted when I got the rifle. Comes with 40 rounds of .30-30. Email me with any questions.

However I am not sure how useful it would really be for the .308. Then I was looking at 1-4 and 1-6 scopes but not sure which one to get. I know ZERO about rifle optics and scopes. But basically I would like to be able to have a red dot style scope for close quarter but I also need a long range scope for ""sniper"" style shooting. I would also like to get the most bang for my buck. I was willing to spend $1,000 on the Eotech but I'm not sure about spending that much on a long range scope... maybe 300-500? Any ideas guys?

I picked it up from a family member that no longer wanted it. fired it to test function and accuracy cleaned and oiled it.

Its very unique and well built/designed its hefty made of metal not plastic, metal receiver and metal bolt it really soaks up the recoil.  It has a quad stack 30 rd coffin style magazine. It has a decocker switch so you can cock, decock it, and then it will be in double action for the first shot, then single action after that. you can also leave it cocked and locked in single action like a regular fire arm. the double action allows the operater to be ready to shoot with the safety off but with a safe long double pull trigger 

I am only getting rid of it because i have some other guns i want to get. its a great collectable firearm thats been in a safe for over 10 years. round count is close to 100.  the last picture shown here is from Leon the Professional where he is handling the full auto version.

LT724 offset QD with the cost-effective H-1, to make a perfect combo, with the competition shooter in mind. The LT-724 positions the H-1 off to the side, providing all the benefits of a red-dot simply by rotating the rifle a few degrees for rapid transition to close-range targets. This combo is Ideal for those who don't need, or desire the lowest settings needed for night vision equipment, or the extra waterproofing to dive down past 15 ft (H-1's are still waterproof).

Just released this month.  This is one of the first models ever manufactured.  It is exactly the same as the standard LC9, minus the trigger and that goofy loaded chamber indicator.  The new LC9S only has a small peep hole in the chamber.

The new striker-fired trigger is amazing!  So much better than the standard LC9.  Smooth, short take up with a crisp, clean 4 lb break.  Even nicer than my Glock 26 trigger!  

I'm only selling it because I just got a great deal on a P938 and prefer a 1911 style handgun.

MSRP is $449.  Gander Mountain and Cabela's have these listed for around $430 on their websites (plus taxes, background check fees, etc.).  

$385 cash.  Must meet face to face at FFL of your choice in or near Erie.

It still holds honest 1.5"" groups at 100 yards, just as it did back in 1999.  I'm not talking about those ""3-shot group that would have been 1.5"" except for that flier"" groups. I'm talking 1.5"" honest average groups -- so-called ""fliers"" included. Due to a neck/shoulder injury, I just can't shoot it any more.

They are made with 1/2 inch Oak or maple plywood and top line 2X4s and hand painted then covered with three coats of urethane so they will last a long time.

Have title for the boat.

The trailer has been previously stripped to bare metal, primed and painted (by me) and is in very good condition (2"" ball). Trailer has newer tires, rims, grease bearings, trailer jack wheel, winch and trailer slides.

The boat is solid and was previously stripped, primed and painted (by me) with Hunter's Specialty olive drab on the exterior and marsh grass on the inside. Seats are covered in marine carpet. The boat has a solid transom and is equipped with an anchor, manual anchor hoist and battery operated (9V) lights for night running. There is a home-made built in pressure treated wood storage compartment in the front and an anchor point for a dog. The top of the compartment makes a great place for a secured dog to sit.

Included in the sale are:

12V 55 lb. thrust Minn Kota electric trolling motor
Motor extension handle
Battery, battery box, circuit breaker (fuse) and charger
Oars
Life jackets
Burlap Goose decoys (I think there are 6)

With the electric trolling motor only, it pushed 3 larger hunters, a dog, decoys and all the hunting paraphernalia easily on inland lakes. Didn't break any speed records but it moved.

Looking for $1250 cash out the door (firm). Cash sales only for now.

You won't be disappointed. I put a lot of time and hard work to make this a nice functional and dependable rig. I will miss it but getting too old to use it. Makes a great inland lake waterfowl boat or also a good inland lake fishing boat."
