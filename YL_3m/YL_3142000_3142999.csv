It is being sold because of a bad financial situation only! If I had my choice I would keep this for life. Over $3400 invested in this gun and it shoots better than it looks. This is a Remington 700 rebuilt to be a competition bench-rest rifle. It has a 1.5 oz (up to 3lbs) jewel trigger, custom fully floated Teflon coated Lilja 1:8 twist match grade heavy barrel, Bell and Carlson stock, PTG custom bolt matched and trued to the gun. The gun includes an Accu-shot monopod and a Harris Bipod when not being used as a benchrest gun. It also has a Sight Mark 10-40x56mm scope which is impressive for what it is. This gun shoots 1/4 MOA easy and probably better with a better operator. I bought this gun, rebuilt it over a winter, broke in the barrel and built the loads in the spring, once I found the best load I put it in the case where it's been for 3 years. This gun looks and is brand new minus the break in procedure. It will shoot normal .223 ammo at 1/2 MOA all day, but shoots better with longer 77-80gr custom loads. This is the last thing in the world I want to sell, but my financial situation doesn't give me any other option. There is over $3400 worth of labor and parts put into this gun and it can be yours for far less. I am asking $2300 or best reasonable offer. I also have competition reloading equipment for sale as well. Please email me with any questions. The gun will be in a shop on consignment until it is sold, so if you want to check it out shoot me an email and I will let you know where you can go to check it out."

I am the second owner, the first claimed to have never shot it, and I never have myself. It is essentially new in the original box, with all accessories (sling, cleaning kit, oil bottle, bayonet, etc), including three 30 round magazines that are still in the cosmoline stained bags.  It probably goes without saying, but this is an original all numbers matching gun; the receiver, the receiver cover, the bolt carrier, the bolt, and the trigger guard. The only exception is the stock which is unmarked, likely because the SKS-D was never issued as a military weapon and the stock had to be specially made for this civilian D model. Some of these rifles came with matching serial numbered magazines, but I can’t tell through the bags and I’m not going  to open them to check.

This is a very early edition (probably mid 70’s I’m told), imported from Norinco by CSI in Dallas, Texas (God Bless Texas!) It is definitely NOT one of the later and much more common “sporterized” models; the ones with the metal glob where the bayonet  used to go and those awful thumbhole stocks,  most of which look and feel like they  were hacked out of a old plank by a chimpanzee.  In addition to the intact bayonet lug and nice stock (with cleaning kit storage), early models had screw in barrels instead of pinned, this has the stripper guide bolt carrier, the AK style “butterfly” mag release, the steel-lined magwell,  and this not only still has it’s bayonet, it is the correct SKS-D tooless removeable type (the bayonet is rare all by itself).

I had the guys at Ron Peterson’s take a look at this gun and I was told that for insurance or a collector ""it should be worth well over a thousand dollars, maybe up to $1500”. I am only selling because I have two and  I’ll never take this one out of the box to shoot it. I’m not trying to rip anybody off, the price almost exactly what I paid (after estate agent escrow fees , shipping and handling, insurance, plus my FFL) to rescue it from the New York State ban. I could sell it on an regular auction site and probably get more money, but I’d rather have it stay here in New Mexico where it’s safer from most of those “must be surrendered for proper disposal”  Yankees back east.

Price is firm, cash only, low-ballers will be ignored, and not interested in trades. The only thing I don’t have and still want is a G27. Maybe if you have a nice OD one, we can discuss a partial trade.  Email, or call/text REDACTED, Thanks."

Gun is in perfect working condition and excellent cosmetic conditon  I bought the gun from the original owner about 3 years ago and he bought it new in 1997. I have personally fired 70 rounds through the gun and I dont believe it has been fired much more than that.  The original owner used it for hunting once a year. These guns are highly collectible and sell for a large range of prices. Anywhere from 1500 to 3000 and even more for rare or pristine models. I have been offered 1200 by Gander Mountain just to sell it to them and that was when I first bought it 3 years ago. Value has gone up since. I will entertain any serious offers over 1600. I think it is not unreasonable from what ive seen for this gun to be worth 2000-2200 if sold on Gunbroker. You can call/text me at REDACTED May be willing to accept partial trades plus cash on your end as I do collect firearms. However cash is best. Otherwise the reason for me selling the gun is that I want a small outboard for my boat 15-25 hp. If you have one to trade feel free to offer that as well. Thank you for your interest."

Beretta 92 FS INOX with Crimson Trace Grips, 4 (15 Round) Magazines, Hogue Grips, and Stock Beretta Grips.

Beretta JS92F500 92 FS Inox 9mm 4.9"" 15+1 Blk Syn Grip Inox Stainless

The 92 series of semi-automatic pistols operates on a short recoil, delayed
blowback system with a safe and time-proven double/single action.
Chrome-lined barrels provide extreme corrosion resistance and a deeply
recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. The open slide design
virtually eliminates jamming and stove piping and allows the chamber to be
loaded one cartridge at a time. The attached disassembly latch simplifies
field stripping. The user may retract the slide single-handedly by pushing
the rear sight against the edge of a table, door, etc. The external hammer
design provides the energy to the firing pin, virtually eliminating the
possibility of misfires due to light primer, and provides immediate
indication of cocked/uncocked status. Each pistol features a lightweight,
forged frame made from extremely strong aircraft-quality aluminum alloy.
These Inox models have a stainless steel slide and barrel with an
exceptionally corrosion-resistant and durable gray-anodized frame to match
the color and finish of the stainless components. The other metal parts
(trigger, hammer, safety, magazine, etc.) are black finished.

tactical edge that no other gun accessory can equal. The laser is located
high on the grip panel, in close proximity to the barrel centerline, yet
shielded from the abuses of heavy recoil and muzzle blast. Dual-side
sensory activation allows complete, effortless control of the laser's
on/off mode.

The 1998A1 is a 'near custom' production handgun that has as standard features the ""extras"" that only custom makers put on their pistols. The 1998A1 is a gorgeous piece of work which is not only pleasing to the eyes and hands but supremely accurate, durable, and is a tightly machined example of the highest quality production firearms.

The 1998A1 is the product of many years of work by Master Pistolsmith John Jardine of Jardine's Custom. His vision was to create a handgun of the finest materials that would have the performance, look and feel of a custom gun right out of the box.

Mr. Jardine's design has been an ongoing project which has taken years to accomplish. During John's long career as a pistolsmith he made note of each item, part, or procedure that he found to be beneficial to a 1911 style handgun. As the years passed he added these new procedures or design ideas to his 'ultimate' design and eventually he was ready to mass produce his dream pistol and began to look for a suitable manufacturer.

During the course of his normal business John had been contracted by Valtro Stocchetta of Italy as a consultant helping them to improve the quality and reliability of their firearms. One thing led to another and a deal was struck for Valtro to produce the pistol Jardine had always dreamed of making.

It cycles smooth with low recoil and is incredibly accurate. I hate having to give up my rifle, but I am in a tough position financially and need the money. Asking $1000 which includes two magazines.

The Luger Pistol
From Gun Digest Book, 11th Edition, 1957.
By: Fred A. Datig | April 20, 2009
The 1936 was the last year that Mauser used the traditional straw bluing on the small parts. Wartime production was starting up and demand required that the trigger, thumb safety, locking lever magazine release were converted to salt bluing in early 1937. Pre WWII manufacture means it was made as good as they ever were.
Beginning in 1936 Krieghoff, like Mauser, dated his products with the year of manufacture in numbers. A few examples may be encountered bearing dates of “1936″ and “1937″ which do not conform to the proper serial number range. These were pieces assembled from already numbered surplus parts at those later dates. These will have the 1936 S/42 upper all matching and all lower all matching. Some of the Mauser-made Lugers will be found bearing not only the commercial Mauser Banner but also carrying a date-stamp over the chamber. Such arms were originally intended for commercial sale, but when the German military forces demanded more Lugers than normal Mauser production could supply, pistols previously set aside for the commercial market were merely stamped with a date and accepted by the Army as regular issue weapons. In 1936 the secret code names were augmented. Mauser was assigned the code number “42″ in addition to the “S/42″ already in use.

It is not unusual, then, to find Lugers bearing the code name “S/42″ and, for example, the date “1936,” and also to encounter “42″ pieces having the same date. To add to the confusion, pieces were also produced bearing the same date, “1936,” and inscribed with the commercial Mauser Banner.

I have for sale a Ruger LCR 22LR 8 shot. it's only had 32rds through it. Purchased it last month. 

The Ruger LCR, (Lightweight Compact Revolver) represents one of the most significant new revolver designs in over a century. This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted, specially coated, stainless steel cylinder. Each of these components give the LCR a unique advantage over traditional revolvers.

The lightweight, chemical-resistant polymer fire control housing contains the entire fire control mechanism, providing a tighter dimensional relationship of the components than if divided between a traditional grip frame and cylinder frame. The end result is that the fire control components are assembled with less hand fitting involved, resulting in a highly consistent, quality product at an affordable price.

From Troy's site...
""The Troy Industries Battlemag is an advanced polymer 30-round magazine for AR-15 style firearms in .223 Remington. The polymers used in the magazine are chemical, biological and impact resistant. The feed lips have been reinforced and the mag uses an anti-tilt follower. The mag body features a aggressive scale texture that provides a sure grip but will also extract from magazine pouches easily. The spine of the magazine is designed to prevent over-insertion common with some polymer mags. The floor plate features a shock absorbing pull tab, or can be used with the flush locking plate. Functions with all M4, M16, AR-15, HK416, and FN SCAR rifles."""

This firearm has hardly been shot and contains all original parts from the factory. This revolver has the optional Magna Porting on its barrel.

The Freedom Arms Model 83 was the first commercially produced revolver chambered in 454 Casull. Freedom Arms is the original manufacturer, partly owned by Dick Casull, that invented the 454 Casull cartridge. Most Freedom Arms guns are custom made to order, and current wait time is approximately 11 or 12 months for single action revolvers.

This Model 83 is the Field Grade variant. The Field Grade is made with the same materials and machining tolerances as the Premier Grade. The Field Grade has a more economical matte finish for less glare and the rear sights are screw adjustable for elevation and drift adjustable for windage.

Product Description
 Bushmaster's Optics Ready Carbine is designed to provide a platform for your imagination: any optics, any purpose, anywhere. The ORC comes with a receiver-length Picatinny optics rail and two 1-1/4"" riser optics blocks (perfect for holographic sites, scopes, or red dots) without a lot of extra factory accessories that you're going to replace anyway. But the ORC isn't a bare-bones rifle by any means. Its 16"" M4 profile barrel is chrome-lined in both the bore and the chamber with an A2, birdcage-type flash hider to control muzzle flash. A heavy oval M4-type handguard provides a fore-grip while maintaining the ORC's immaculate balance and control. The ORC's six-position telescoping stock reduces overall length by 4"" when collapsed for convenient carry. This ORC includes an operator's safety manual, a magazine, a gun lock, and a black sling.
