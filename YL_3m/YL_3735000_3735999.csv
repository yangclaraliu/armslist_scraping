Here is a REVIEW from the internet:
I had the chance to spend several days with the I-12 last summer on an incredible duck hunt in Uruguay. The variety of species and the sheer number of ducks were astounding. Bag limits there are liberal, so you can really burn through a lot of ammo. You need a gun that can take the sting out of high-brass duck loads, and the I-12's recoil reduction system did that with ease.

The first line of recoil reduction really comes from the I-12's Inertia Driven system. Here's how it works: Instead of having a heavy gas cylinder in the fore end, which adds weight and can make guns feel clubby, the I-12 doesn't rely on pistons or valves. The mechanically simple system features a free-floating bolt that compresses an inertia spring as the gun recoils. This, in turn, cycles the action. The result is a slender, lower-profile forend that really feels great—even for guys with smaller hands like me. And eliminating the big gas cylinder and hardware up front also gives these guns a nice balance—quick-pointing and smooth-swinging without feeling whippy.

An even bigger help toward reducing felt recoil is a unique, two-part recoil pad. The pad has a special gel insert, but unlike some recoil pad designs, this one is open on both sides, which allows the gel insert to deform outward to spread the kick over a much wider area.

When the gun is fired, the special rubber part of the pad maintains the pad's shape. At the same time, the gel insert starts to deform outward, spreading the recoil out and cutting down on all the shock to your shoulder. After compression, the gel insert returns to its original shape in a fraction of a second.

We burned through a lot of shotshells in the course of our trip. Moreover, the weather was unseasonably warm, so by mid-morning we were hunting in shirt-sleeves without the benefit of any extra padding from heavy coats. Despite all the shooting we did, my shoulder never got sore.

The I-12 I used came in a flat-black finish (a good all-purpose color choice), but for a few dollars more, these guns can also be purchased in Advantage Timber HD for turkey hunting, Advantage MAX-4 for waterfowling or traditional satin-finished walnut. All represent a great value, too."

First of all - this is considered a Destructive Device and you will need approval from ATF ($200 tax stamp - I believe).  This also has to go through a class 3 dealer that has the stamp for dealing in destructive devices (IF located outside of the state of Ohio) -- If live in Ohio, per ATF, does not even have to go through a dealer.  You just have to file the paperwork. 

Only a few hundred of these got into the country.  These are extremely rare.  The last one sold at auction through - icollection.com for $6500 plus a buyers fee of $1300.  That shotgun came with 2 stick mags.  Mine come with 3 - 10 round stick mags and 2 - 20 round drums.  This has never been fired.  The guy at auction paid $7800 - I am asking $8000 FIRM , but will take offers higher.  If you are an Ohio resident we do not have to go through a class 3 dealer but you will still have to apply through ATF and pay a $200 transfer fee.  If you are outside of Ohio this will require a class 3 dealer.  Dealer fees and shipping will be your responsibility.  There will also be a $500 deposit required until you get your paperwork completed and back from ATF.

 .  I have 00 LE rounds, and 000 military rounds and some finned Sabot rounds - sorry but if I sell this, I will not have any use for the ammo so it will have to go.  Any offers over $9000 will not be required to purchase the ammo, but it will be offered separately if he / she wishes to purchase.  Considering 000 goes for $1 per round and the finned Sabots sell for $2 per round, it is a good deal.

The above rate of fire is probably for the full auto, but if you are shooting 00 buck mag loads - 12 pellets per round, and have a 20 round drum, that comes out to 240 - 30 caliber projectiles going down range in under 30 seconds.  That's a lot of lead.

The SD variant of the Beretta PX4 Storm is the result of the U.S. military’s Joint Combat Pistol program of 2005. The premise behind this program was to replace the aging stock of M9 pistols currently in use with U.S. armed forces with a superior weapon. It stipulated that the weapon be chambered in .45 ACP, more resistant to salt spray be capable of mounting a sound suppressor and be capable of firing 5,000 rounds without failure. Furthermore, the replacement pistol should have a grip no larger than the standard M9, feature a low-glare finish and ideally be in FDE.

-----------------------------
Sig Sauer SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace
SIG SAUER® introduces the SB15 Pistol Stabilizing Brace, a shooter’s aid that is designed to improve the single-handed shooting performance of buffer tube equipped pistols.

This veteran-designed and U.S.-manufactured accessory enhances accuracy and reduces felt recoil when using an AR-style pistol.

Made from high-quality, elasto-polymer, the SB15 is manufactured to close tolerances and fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0” – 1.2” in diameter. The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.

Features

    Fits all pistols equipped with an AR-style buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter.
    ATF compliant*
    Veteran designed
    Made in USA

Ive had this rifle for about 1 year now. It has performed flawlessly. The rifle is in good condition overall. Comes with an EGW 20 MOA rail. Also I recently had a gun smith perform a trigger job. The trigger is now at a crisp 2 pounds with no take up and almost no over travel (almost as good as a Timney!) Also I had the extractor replaced. 

The rifle comes with 46 rounds of hand loaded ammo. I have shot upwards of 300 rounds through this rifle (all hand loads) and settled on my current load (which I have 46 rounds of). This load produces 1/2 inch groups. I had a Leupold Mark 4 mounted on this rifle when shooting (Sold). The bullet is a 162gr Hornady SST traveling at 3100 FPS. Long range shooting is my hobby so I strive for accuracy and consistency. This rifle with this current load has that ability! Not only is this ammo good for long range shooting but it al makes an excellent hunting round. 

I am also selling other reloading supplies (powder, bullets, primers, brass) that I used for this rifle. (click on All Ads by rem700.7mm to see ad for the reloading supplies)

Flat top upper, internals are in nice shape, externally the rifle has lots of finish wear.
These rifles were the property of SOC LLC a private security contractor that provided guards on US bases in IRAQ.
These DPMS rifles were brought back to the US after the contract ended along with some wasr10/63 ak47 rifles and various bushmaster and american spirit rifles.

These rifles were then sold by SOC LLC to Century Arms who then sold them to various companies earlier this year. There are alot of discussions on various forums about these rifles, Do an internet search for DPMS or WASR 10 Iraq bringback rifle and you will find alot of interesting discussions.

The condition of these rifles obviously varies alot, The one i have has been carried quite abit but not fired a whole lot (at a guess)
These rifles were issused to mainly Ugandan guards working on US bases in IRAQ guarding checkpoints, chowhalls, portapottys ect 

These guns are quite unique in the fact that these will be the only modern surplus rifles used in the Iraq War and then sold to the public. Will they be a collectors item in 20 years? i dont know but if nothing else they will make a decent beater/truck rifle with a neat story.

I have the original furniture, G.I mag and dirty 3 point sling that came with this rifle, Its a flat top and did not come with the carry handle although i do have a replacement i could throw on it, I also have a new set of magpul furniture that i could add to a trade, I have removed pretty much all the damn sand and dirt from this rifle (hopefully that didnt ruin the collectors value haha)

Please feel free to ask questions and i will do my best to answer to the best of my knowledge

The pictures don't do this rifle justice. Not a scratch on it. Ceracote is perfect and the wood is beautiful. If you don't know much about BRNO CZ see below.
BRNO CZ 98 is a bolt-action carbine designed and produced in Czechoslovakia from 1924 to 1942. It was developed from the famous Mauser Gewehr 98 line, and features a very similar bolt design. The rifle was designed in Czechoslovakia shortly after World War I, featuring a 600 mm (23.6"") barrel which was shorter and considered more handy than the 150 mm (5.9"") -longer Gewehr 98. The carbine followed a similar trend in weapon design at the time, that a short rifle gave away little in ballistic efficiency at combat ranges, but was easier to handle on account of its shorter length.During World War II, the BRNO CZ 98 was produced for the German armed forces during its occupation. The rifle was also produced in nearby Slovakia, a German ally and puppet state during the war.

From my research I believe this to be a 1935 manufacture, it's beautifully engraved, and has a beautiful stock.  The only mar to the overall form is the aftermarket recoil pad that's been installed. Stock metal plate pads are on eBay for $35 or so, I kept the pad on because it kicks less that way.

******************BUSHMASTER Patrolman AR15 Rifle Specifics:*********************

Patrolman AR15 M4 Carbine, .223/5.56 16"" W/Detachable Carry Handle, Telescoping Stock, Black Finish 30 Round Mag
Chrome lined barrel and chamber. Features A2 bird cage style suppressor. A3 type removable carry handle features 1 MOA elevation and 1/2 MOA windage adjustments. Picatinny type rail base. Flat-top upper receiver. Non-reflective mil spec hard anodized aluminum receiver. Six-position telestock. Shipped with 30 round magazine, carrying sling, chamber flag and operator's manual.

One of our ALL TIME BEST Carbine models, the M4 Type features a distinctive Military Barrel Profile and Six Position Telestock – great for 3 Gun Match Shooting, Home Defense and Law Enforcement use.

The Bushmaster A2 & A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbines are modeled after our M4 Type Carbines, but with additional barrel length to make them legal for sale to individual officers (semi-automatic configuration with 16"" barrel).

The 5.56mm/.223 Rem. caliber 16"" barrel is chrome lined in both bore and chamber for long wear life and ease of maintenance. For control of muzzle flash and muzzle rise in rapid fire, a “birdcage” type suppressor is factory installed. A mil. spec. manganese phosphate outer coating insures protection against corrosion or rust on the barrel and all critical steel parts of the weapon. 

Forged, lightweight 7075T6 aircraft quality aluminum receivers are designed for simplicity of maintenance and reliability of operation and they incorporate all M16A2 design improvements including cartridge case deflector, bolt catch assembly and raised ribs for protection against accidental magazine release. A six position telescoping buttstock offers light weight, carrying ease and quick handling. 

The telestock, pistol grip and two piece handguards are all molded of strong black thermoset composite material. The handguards are internally shielded against barrel heat build-up. The dual aperture M16A2 rear sight system on these carbines offer both windage and elevation adjustment calibrated in meters. 

The A3 Type Patrolman’s Carbine includes a Removable Carry Handle - adjustment range is from from 300 to 600 meters (1/2 M.o.A. elevation and 1/2 M.o.A. windage).

Once the Carry Handle is removed, a wide variety of scopes, red dot or holographic sights, or night vision equipment may be mounted on the Upper Receiver’s integral Picatinny rail. Iron sight zero is completely repeatable when the handle is reattached by means of its knurled knobs. 

You must be of legal age and a Washington resident. I will only meet locally here in the Lacey area for transaction and you must have $1,200 cash only.

InstAlert is an automated image processing feature that highlights the strongest heat signatures in the image in red, instantly alerting boaters to people who have fallen overboard or hazards along the way. Still rugged, lightweight and easy to use, First Mate II is the best family of handheld thermal night vision cameras on the water today."

I bought this gun and proceeded to tear it apart and restore it. Every piece has been checked for rust, function and appearance. I sanded down the stock, which needed much sanding. Then tung oiled it numerous times, then sealed with a satin finish, then applied 4 coats of Thompson’s Water Seal. The lower butt plate area has been repaired (see photos) but is a solid repair. Also, since I had to sand the hell out of it, the hand guard needed to be “bolstered” in order to be tight enough to retain the bands. So I fabricated two small dowels that fit were the cleaning rod would go (does not have cleaning rod) then to ensure a tight fit, added a plastic zip tie around hand guard. It is now very tight, and does not affect function whatsoever.

I went through all the metal and reblued using a cold blue, it is not 100% but looks very good. The bayonet is intact and functions perfectly. All the metal parts are 100% with absolutely no rust. The sling hardware has been polished and so has the hand guard metal. The butt plate has been highly polished by hand and now looks similar to chrome as well as the whole bolt assembly. Each piece of the bolt has been hand polished and is very smooth and very shiny, you could not tell it is over 57 years old (manufacturered in 1955). 

I cleaned out the chamber with a shotgun brush and steel wool, so that it would not have a sticky bolt issue...it works great. The chamber is very clean. The bore is very good with strong rifling and has NOT been counter bored. 

I bought an aftermarket sling (black, not green) as well as a cleaning kit and Mosin firing pin tool. Neither of these come with the Type 53, But they are included with mine.

Also include are 110 rounds of ammo, 90 of which are on stripper clips.

It also comes with an extra rubber butt plate to extend length of pull.

I have taken to the range to insure it is 100% functional and it shoots great.

Numbers DO NOT MATCH

As you can tell, I have spent much time and effort getting this rifle in the condition it is in today. This is a good shooter. If you are looking for a collectors item this would not be the one to get (only because numbers do not match). But if you didn't know it you couldn't tell. If you are looking for a FUN little Mosin carbine (40"" overall), this is the one. It also has an built in bayonet which is VERY COOL INDEED.

I am asking $190 and will entertain any reasonable offer. Lowballers will be ignored. This is a very fair price considering its condition and the fact it has been restored.
