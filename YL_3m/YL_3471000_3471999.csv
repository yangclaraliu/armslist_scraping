AS NEW... 
manufacture date of Jan 2014. It comes with everything you need but ammo. I have fired 100 rounds down range with out any problems. It comes with (4) 7 round mags with pinky extensions and (1) 7 round flush mag. I have everything that came in the box. It also comes with a Cross Breed appendix holster that works great. I love the way this pistol just fits in your hand. It is very accurate and a smooth shooter. I now carry a PPQ and don't need it. Below is what is listed on Sigs website. Holster was $65.00, mags were $45.00 each and the pistol runs around $730 plus tax. 

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITEÂ® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue G-10 Piranha grips in black and grey provide maximum grip and a distinctive look."

It's quite rare with only 8000 ever made and of those about 2000 were imported into the USA. 

The Rasheed was based on the Swedish AG42b Ljungman rifle as was it's big brother the Hakim. 

These rifles are typically pretty beat up from the rough service they saw in Egypt. However this one is not, and it's in excellent condition. Metal and wood finish is 95% or better. Then the bore is bright and shiny. It's 100% mechanically as well. 

Make no mistake the Rasheed is equally capable to the SKS so it has a considerable amount of firepower. I've seen detachable 20 round mags for sale from time to time on GunBroker as well which would make this little rifle even more capable.

I believe it would be difficult to find a better Rasheed than what I'm offering here - especially one in original and not refinished condition.

Asking $795 FTF local sale only with pickup in the Brandon area. Buyer must be a Florida resident who is still least 18 years old.

Great lightweight scope, SIMILAR capabilities as an ACOG without the illumination and cost. (please don't try to say that I think this an ACOG or equivalent)

Comes with Nikon's P-series mounts. This is a great little scope and would be a great start if you're getting into 3 gun or tactical rifle and want/need magnification. 

I can't find any flaws on it other than one small chip, if you can find flaws when you go to buy it, call me out and we can work out a lower price. 

Costs about 200 new with the mounts. I think $100 or the equivalent value in 9mm or .223 is a fair deal. 

Holds a zero well and I don't have any complaints on it, very impressed with this low cost scope.

Item # SP91PBBK:C91PBBK,
If you want to Google it.

Spyderco C91 Pacific Salt is designed to offer reliable high performance with a never-rust H-1 steel blade. Now it's available with a black coated blade, lessening the steels aective qualities and subduing the blade  presence. Spyderco  Salt Series shines in fresh and saltwater staying rust-free even if put away wet. Hollow-ground, the H-1 blade is PlainEdged and coated in long-lasting black carbonitride. It's  similar in shape and size to Spyderco's bestselling Endura model but with more rounded tip.

All internal steel parts are treated as well making them impervious to rust and pitting. The blade hole is enlarged to 14mm for easier opening/closing with gloved, wet or cold hands. Textured in a Volcano Grip pattern, the black fiberglass handle has a grippy texture and is fitted with a black Titanium pocket clip that reverses position for both left and right-handers. The addition of a lanyard hole offers a backup method of attachment (thong or lanyard cord) for use around water where once dropped, a knife is often lost or elusively hard to retrieve.

I appreciate the time you've taken to read the ad and show interest, but I'm not interested in any sort of trade. Also, I'm not willing to do a distance transaction on this, so local (Oklahoma) buyers only please. I'll be more than happy to send more detailed photos of the scope if there's something else you would like to see on it.

First, while not technically a firearm it still has the intrinsic value of one. 
I have a .300 blackout AR-15 upper with 30 flawless rounds through it. It's incredibly accurate, I was key holing my groups at 40 yards with the iron sights. Comes with an A2 rear aperture and a flip up front sight. It will also come with a kit to mount a rail and a foregrip and a sling mount. The only reason I'm selling this is I decided not to buy a.  300 blackout surpressor. 
Second is my pre ban AP9. It is the upgraded version of the infamous TEC9/KG9. These can no longer be purchased as they were banned from new manufacture/sale by the 1994 assault weapons ban. It's a great little gun and is a nice piece of American gun history, and is useful for pissing off those anti gun liberals. Also, with the impending ban of private sales,  this may very well be your last chance to get this piece of American history without being in a government database."

Check these websites before buying these over priced guns people want to list on here.  Just because they paid way too much for something means they try to sell you a now USED gun for way more than the gun goes on the open market BRAND NEW. 

SDVE about $300, KAHR CW about 315-340... etc.  People are asking way more than $100 over these prices for the same guns that have now been used.   Be smart and do some research.  Don't let these people inflate prices bc they bought something in a panic and paid way too much.

Buds lists FFL dealers in your area and show how much they charge.  Many can be found for $25 or so, depending on your location.  BUDS and Cheaperthandirt sell with free shipping on firearms.  Just because local gun stores try to sell KAHR products in the $500 range doesn't mean that's what you should pay, many can be hand brand new on websites for $350 range.

Does not hinder performance in any way.  Quad rail is ready for an Aimpoint micro or PA micro red dot.  Ammo is worth $300, parts alone are worth $250.   Magazines are worth $120 for the surplus and $120 for the tapco.  I put the total setup at $1250.

Make your gear the color or pattern you want for far less than the cost of buying a ""wrapped"" weapon. Wrapping or hydro dipping does not have the durability or the protection that DuraCoat offers many times over. 

I offer sandblasting, refinishing, and restoration for your hunting and shooting gear. If you have an item that has seen wear and tear, is blemished, or pitted with rust I can make it new again. Maybe it's just old and is needing to be refinished, and you want a quality, professional job done please feel free to contact me. Make sure your gear is protected forever, invisible to wary eyes and impervious to the elements by DuraCoating it. 

Cleaning is done in no time with DuraCoat. Simply wipe it with a damp rag and you're done. Or leave it, that's fine too, a little dirt will help you blend in when you head back into the great outdoors. 

I can camouflage anything and specialize in application of DuraCoat which is an extremely durable and excellent two part epoxy finish. If you'd like to see all the available colors you can check it by googling Lauer Weaponry or by going to this webpage http://lauerweaponry.com/   

I can do binoculars, bipods, range finders, magazines, helmets, comm gear, stocks, barrels, scopes and bases / rings, knives, bows,  and anything else that needs to blend in to complete your camouflage breakup or just needs a new finish.

Patterns include digital, multicam, tiger stripe,  woodland, shadow grass, winter twig, brush, and on and on. In any color combination you like. You tell me what you want, and I'll make it happen.

My work is top notch and second to none, I guarantee it. 

I have been painting for 16 years and have been to many Technical Schools involving paint systems, preparation, methods, and application. I have been into shooting sports my whole life and I truly love seeing my work and the looks on people's faces when I return their gear to them fully customized.  

If you're interested or just have any questions feel free to e-mail me.  Please include information about what you have you'd like to be DuraCoated to include all parts (example: Remington 700 with scope and bipod, would like the entire rifle and scope done in a brush pattern). 

Thank you for your time and interest."
