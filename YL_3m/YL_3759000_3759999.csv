You should be glad these guys are providing a valuable service for you sissies that stayed home and slept while they went and got them for you.  Now you can still get one for less than retail and you didn't have to do anything to earn it!

While you were sleeping, they:
got up in the middle of the night, drove maybe 60 miles (I did), wait in line for 4 hours (or up to 6), hope there is enough to go around, hurry during the rush, get lucky and get one, wait in line for up to 4 hours to do the paperwork and pass the check, pay the sale price, pay sales tax, drive back home, do the paperwork for the rebate that will come in 6 weeks while they pay interest on the credit card.  And if they didn't have a CWP they get the pleasure of going back to the store again to pick it up a few days later.

And if they bought one they want to sell you expect them to sell it to you for $299?

Good luck with that dipstick.  I suspect you are one of the 49% of the people that leach off those of us that work for a living.

I heard a new saying the other day; The early bird gets the worm.  Maybe you should remember that.

And if you knew anything you'd know this is not a straw purchase, unless someone bought one for you.  Which evidently didn't happen which is why you are crying about it."

I'm selling because I'm not a huge fan of the AR-15 platform, and would just assume to get some of my money back. I'm completely aware I just about overpaid, but at the time there wasn't such a surplus of AR's due to the gun control scare. This gun has a red dot (NcStar red green blue Dot Sight with Cantilever mount) and a mounted (CenterPoint 3-9x32 @ 50yds) small scope. Also a mounted bi-pod. This is a good gun for beginners, or anyone else who likes to shoot the AR platform. I will take offers, but please don't insult the little intelligence I do have. $600 seems fair.

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or available SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

This was a former LEO trade in That I picked up on a trade for my wife because she wanted it. Well she held it and and says its to heavy and she now wants a gen 3 Glock -19. The weapon does have holster wear and has been used not sure of round count . This Beretta was definitely not a safe queen but It works like a Beretta should . I put 50 rounds through it and is a typewriter like my Beretta 9 mm centurion. It comes with the factory trijicon night sight ,but they are dead as a door nail and need new inserts installed. Last time I checked tooltech and trijicon will install new inserts. This gun has the ambidextrous safety/de-cocker.I'm getting rid of it because my wife doesn't want it and I'm not really a fan of 40 s&w.

The pistol has close to 600rds through it with zero issues. Has some holster wear but is still in good shape. 

I take exceptional care of my firearms, this has been thoroughly cleaned and lubricated after every range session. I love this gun; only reason I am selling this is that I'd like to get something in 9mm.

Has 3 mags, speed loader, Hoppes boresnake, box, and all the standard issue Glock paperwork.

Would prefer to sell outright but will accept trades for similar valued 9mm. PLEASE do not waste my time and yours with an offer for some BS gun. I am also interested in certain Sig Sauer pistols and I would throw in money on top of the value of this gun.

I'm looking to trade my AR15 for something else. I bought it this summer so my GF had an AR and she isn't a fan of anything besides my .22 rifle. Shot the rifle about 60 times and functioned fine with the Remington UMC .223 I shot. It grouped fairly nice at 50 yards and was content with the accuracy. The specs for the rifle are as follows:

-MPI BCG Semi Auto Profile
- Thor Industries Barrel, Carbine length gas system that is Government profile
- CMMG Lower with A2 style stock, Troy Ambi Bolt release, Magpul MOE+ grip and KAC winter trigger guard.
-Free float tube that looks to be DPMS
- PWS FSC 556 muzzle brake (I can replace this with an A2 if you want)
- USA flag enlarged rear takedown pin
-Nickel Boron Extended Charging handle

The rifle has is hydrodipped in Snake skin and it is professionally done and is even throughout the rifle. This can be removed from what I understand fairly easy with the right tools but from my use of the rifle it seems hard to scratch off.

Any questions feel free to ask. Hit me with some offers!"

It is not new but has a low round count (estimate less than 1000). I still have the box though it is beat up. It has the black Arsenal handguards and stock but the Arsenal pistol grip has been replaced with a Palm grip. The only problem I see with the rifle is the front handguard retainer lever is loose; it is not as tight as I am used to in AKs but the handguards themselves are tight with no problems. The pictures show it well oiled which is how I store it in my safe. Price is $900. 

The only trade I am interested in is a VEPR 12. Will give $100 in boot for a NIB VEPR 12. Will trade even for a VEPR 12 in similiar condition as the SGL.

Trigger pull is nice and consistent and the lack of an external hammer insures that it wont snag on your shirt when you take it out.  Cleaned it every time I took it to the range.  Only draw back is the five shot capacity, but you probably wont need to worry about that with a 357.

My main interest is another titanium rifle and this one is being offered for trade only.  I do not wish to sell it at this time.  Pics available for serious inquiries.  Thanks"

Salter Brecknel APD-100 Automatic Powder Dispenser
Conveniently dispense powder with precision to the charge weight you specify. Never overshoot or undershoot your target charge weight again. Enter up to 128 user-defined loads into the unit’s memory, including cartridge number, powder type and target weight. Different powders dispense at different weights, but that’s not a concern with this dispenser. Its exclusive powder-select button lets you program in the rate at which you want the powder to dispense. Measure in grains, grams or ounces. For convenient storage, the system takes down easily, and the reservoir tube stows in a compartment under the scale. Along with the scale, you receive an AC adapter, 30-gram calibration weight, cleaning brush, metal scoop, J-hook, clear reservoir tube, precision powder reducer, clear dust, draft shield and a tube cap.

Armscor/Rock Island M1911-A1 CSP 1911 Compact GI .45ACP

The Rock Island Armory 1911 series consists of a product line of single-action recoil operated semi-automatic pistols. They are designed and manufactured by Armscor in Marikina City, Philippines, and distributed in the United States by Armscor USA, located in Pahrump, Nevada.

RIA (Rock Island Armory) 1911s are clones of the US Military G.I. M1911-A1, the standard issue US Service pistol from 1911 to 1985. Most RIA models are targeted for the low-end price point of the 1911 pistol market and are basic entry level MIL-SPEC versions of the 1911, however, the RIA Tactical, Compact, and Match models offer additional semi-custom high end features. The Compact model features a skeletonized hammer and beavertail grip safety while the Tactical model also adds a target-grade hammer and trigger as well as an ambidextrous safety, and enhanced contrast combat sights. Armscor is an ISO 9001 certified-compliant company which manufactures Rock Island pistols using CNC (Computer Numerical Control) equipment. RIA 1911 series pistols are constructed of 4140 chromoly steel with a cast frame, and are available in .45 ACP, .38 Super, 9mm Luger, and .22 TCM chamberings.

The M7X is a strong side belt holster that uses a butt-forward cant to enhance concealability. The open top makes the draw quick and easy, while the lateral tension when worn does an amazing job of retaining the pistol securely. Unlike so many other harsh, mechanical-looking plastic holsters, the Matrix resembles a hand-molded Galco leather holster.

With the increasing threat of terrorism in our streets to the evolving situations of combat applications, a new paradigm in firearms was required. In 1982, with the foresight of what the modern battlefield was becoming, IWI in a decade long collaboration with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Research & Development teams, developed the new standard issue weapon for the IDF. The TAVOR® was born. Mr. Zalman Shebs, known as the “father of the TAVOR,” spearheaded the team to develop a weapon system that was capable of moving from open field conflicts to close-quarter engagements and from daylight to nighttime capabilities – seamlessly on a single mission. In the late 1990’s through the early 2000’s, the TAVOR underwent unprecedented testing unlike any weapons system anywhere. The TAVOR began trials with IDF units testing for ergonomics. The TAVOR then entered the IDF NCO Infantry School for extensive field tests and finally, in 2002, the TAVOR was given to an army company in the Givati Brigade for real-world testing and use. By September, 2003, the IDF had chosen the TAVOR rifle as the standard issue for their infantry troops. Today the TAVOR rifles are in service with IDF Infantry troops and the IDF Special Forces in Israel along with many military and law enforcement agencies in the world. IWI and IWI US have brought the same dedication to craft and commitment to performance and reliability to the American customer with the TAVOR SAR rifle. TAVOR® SAR Features Include: -Bullpup configuration allows for short rifle convenience with long rifle accuracy -Optimized ergonomic design for increased comfort and ease-of-use -Clean, long stroke piston operation -Detachable, cold hammer-forged barrel (CHF), chrome-lined with 1:10 twist, CrMoV steel -100% ambidextrous configuration and operation. No additional parts required to convert 9mm Parabellum to LH configuration -Integral ambidextrous front and rear quick detachable sling swivel receptacles with push button swivels -Simple field stripping into easily serviceable subassemblies -Mil-Std 100% interchangeability of all TAVOR SAR parts -Last round - bolt holds open on an empty magazine -All metal parts treated for corrosion resistance -Integral rubber recoil pad"

Some factory info for those who are interested:

""The Eotech 553 A65 Holographic Weapon Sight was developed after extensive testing of various optical sights, and US Special Operations Command has standardized on the Eotech Holographic Weapon Sight as its 1X weapon optic for close quarter and urban combat zones. To meet the stringent requirements set and demanded by our elite fighting forces, EOTech has developed the EOTech Holo Sight M 553, modeled after the ever popular, battle proven Eotech HWS design. The EOTech M553 Holo Sight incorporates many additional features required within the SOPMOD Block 2 program. The advantage of EOTech 553 A65 Holographic Weapon Sights is its holographic reticle patterns that are instantly visible in any light condition, instinctive to center regardless of shooting angle and always remain in view to achieve lightning quick reticle to target acquisition without covering or obscuring the point of aim. The magic of EOTech Holographic 553 Weapon Sights is the edge they provide to you in close quarter or urban combat zones. The EOTech Holographic M553 Weapon Sight will remain fully operational even when the laminated window is obstructed by mud, snow, rain, or even damaged/shattered, as long as you can see through any portion of the laminated window, the entire reticle pattern will be visible on target with point of aim/impact being maintained and fully functional, the operator can still engage with confidence. Pick up this Red Dot Sight for maximum shooting performance!"""

North Carolina. Where every PARA 1911 is born. Each a brainchild of the most innovative, influential minds in pistol design. Made by hand, on a bench, one at a time, by men as passionate about building firearms as they are about shooting them.

Sure, we have no shortage of state-of-the-art equipment. But a machine can’t feel. It can’t hold a pistol in its hands and know exactly what’s working, and what isn’t. Our guys can. And every PARA must go through their hands before it ever ends up in yours.

Craftsmanship is the engine that runs this place. And you can feel it in every firearm that proudly wears the PARA name.

It is actually a model 330 but I don't think the average gun owner would know that just by looking at it. Looking for mechanically functional and safe. Overall finish isn't that important but no rust/pitting or cracked wood. Big long barrels, full or full/mod choke, and no rubber- buttpad are my ideal features.

Pictures are for reference, especially  of the forearm.

Let me know what you have and what you are asking for it. Have a valid drivers license (carry permit would be great too but I don't have one) be willing to meet public and write out a bill of sale from seller to buyer, and buyer to seller. What I think would be perfect is we meet at a range and I'll bring a case to shells, that way I can test the gun, we are in public (sort of), and in a firearms-friendly environment. It's a long shot but like I said, having a tough time finding one in a store and even online. Thanks."
