Based on the Colt M4 carbine, the Colt LE6900 is an AR-15 from a company that knows a thing or two about AR-15s. As noted, Colt's Manufacturing Company LLC was responsible for the original production of the AR-15 and the M16 and would go on to sell millions of units worldwide. Though it was originally developed by Eugene Stoner for Fairchild ArmaLite, the rights to the platform were sold to Colt in 1959. The rest is history, and Colt has been manufacturing high-performance weapons systems based on the AR-15 for the military, law enforcement and civilian markets ever since.

As noted, the Colt LE6900 is an AR-15 based on the Colt M4 carbine. Marketed as a law enforcement model and marked ""LIGHT CARBINE"" on the receiver, the LE6900 shares many of the same features as its battle-proven relative, including a six-position telescoping stock and a receiver-length MIL-STD 1913 rail for the attachment of the shooter's preferred optics. The difference between the new Colt LE6900 and the company's high-end models lies in the removal of unnecessary components, which not only lightens the load, literally, but also reduces its price point. One thing, however, is certain: the Colt LE6900 benefits from the same reliability, performance and accuracy characteristic of those firearms carried by the United States Armed Forces.

The Colt LE6900 features a 16.1-inch, full-floated barrel alongside an overall length of 35 1/2 inches, which can be reduced by several inches via the telescoping stock. Both the 4140 chrome-moly steel barrel (1:8 inch twist rate) and the chamber feature a hard chrome lining, which serves to protect both components from rust and corrosion as well as give them higher resistance to wear and an extended service life. Also included is the aforementioned synthetic six-position telescoping stock. When combined with the light weight of the 7075 T6 aircraft-grade aluminum upper & lower receivers, you get a carbine that weighs in at just six pounds. Additionally, each carbine boasts a forged aluminum hand guard that has been drilled and tapped to allow the attachment of rails. Other features include an optics-ready flattop receiver, a single-stage match-grade trigger, an oversized one-piece trigger guard and an ambidextrous quick-detach sling swivel. As noted, the LE6900 is chambered for the 5.56x45mm NATO and .223 Remington cartridges.

242,000 miles. 
Car has been my daily driver since 2001. 
Leaks oil, not a lot, maybe a quart every 5K miles. 
Body in decent shape, has seen better days though. 
AC ran this summer, but will need to be evacuated and recharged.
Car will start, but will need work to be drivable, specifically, a new flange is needed on the exhaust system. Estimate from Midas is $150-$250 depending on if a sensor needs to be replaced on part of the pipe which needs to be replaced with the sensor. 
After that car should run great. 
New rear drum breaks, entire assembly, installed by Dobbs in 2013. New radiator in 2012, front break pads 2012, power steering pump 2010 or 2011. Sony HD head unit, may need new rear speakers. 
Reason I am selling; we currently have 5 cars, two of which are new and I no longer need the saturn.
Due to the flange on the exhaust being needed, no test drives. You can start the car though. 
Possibly trade for Sig, HK, Colt, Smith and Wesson."

Shotgun appears to be unfired.  I have to say appears because the original owner said he never fired it (but I have no way of confirming it) but I have never fired it.  The gun is just way too beautiful for me to take out shooting.  I am a shooter, not a collector so this should go to someone else who can appreciate it as such.  Or someone who wants the prettiest gun in the field when it comes time to do some bird hunting.  
As you can see, the grain on the fore and butt stocks is incredible.  Pics do not do it (or the engraving on the receiver) justice.  Only flaws I can find on the wood is a small ding near the bottom of the receiver and a small mark on the bottom of the butt stock. 
Email me for more detailed pics.  The couple I posted cannot do this shotgun justice.
Gun comes with original box (rough shape due to someone disassembling it and folding it), but does come with a brown Ducks Unlimited case.
Prefer FTF.  Willing to drive a couple of hours to meet up if needed.  
Would ship, but buyer would bear those additonal costs.  No California.

This is a special edition Taurus revolver designed for Cowboy Action shooting, and designed to look very similar to the Colt Single Action Army.   It is a single-action revolver made of heavy steel and having composite checkered grips with the Taurus insignia in the place on the grips where the Colt insignia normally would be.   The Gaucho uses the later cylinder latch feature of the Colt SAA, the one used after the conversion to smokeless powder.   The cylinder is removed from the frame merely by depressing the base pin, instead of a screw having to be removed first like on the original Colt SAA.   The fit and finish of the Gaucho are excellent, with all parts operating smoothly and cleanly. The finish is Sundance Blue. 

I also have a box of Winchester PDX1 DEFENDER 38special +P 130 grain.

I will ship, but as a ""modern"" handgun, it would need to go from an FFL at this end to an FFL at yours.  Came to me in a trade and it's not something I collect.  I have owned several of these guns, like them and think they are well made.  This one in stainless is pretty rare, most all were blued.  I have not fired this gun, but did clean and lube which confirmed to me that it has a very low round count.  Bore is bright & shiny with strong rifling.  The gun is still pretty stiff which also makes me think it has had minimal use.   Pictures tell the story, and I can send more on request.  I am a resident of northern Kentucky but could meet a buyer at a Cincinnati, Ohio or Lawrenceburg, KY area FFL to sell in those states."

Product Information
Lyman 2-Cavity Bullet Molds are made from solid leaded-steel and machined to an exact and smooth super fine finish. The molds are then heat treated (that is why they are blue in color) and feature hardened steel alignment pins to provide many years of bullet casting service. Sprue plates are made from solid steel, ground flat and held tightly in place with tempered steel spring washers and screws. In addition, break-in is often half the time required for iron molds. Round Ball molds will cast perfect balls with a minimum sprue to help ensure that consistent shot to shot accuracy that target shooters have come to expect from Lyman molds."

I have for sale a very nice 1936 Allis Chalmers WC that has been restored but does not run at this time. It has the hand crank start but also a battery and starter has been added. The battery probably needs replaced.  The body is straight and the overall condition is very good. The tires are like brand new all the way around.  I had this tractor checked over by a mechanic and this is what he told me. Basically the tractor was stored outside with the exhaust uncovered. This allowed water to enter the valve cover gasket and caused probable corrosion that has the valves locked up on cylinders #2 & #3. He said more then likely all that would be needed is to remove the valve cover and head and clean every thing up and replace the gaskets and any other small parts that might be needed. I do not have the time to mess with this myself so my loss is your gain. I am asking $900 and selling “as is.”

Great to get the Mrs. to pack heat, October 08, 2011
Got one for my wife to convince her that I wanted her to be able to defend herself and our children, and not just buy another toy for myself. She likes it so much, we now have two (a black one for me) for when my 24/7 is just too bulky. Light recoil, surprisingly accurate but LOUD!!!! Do not fire steel cased ammo as it tends to jam. Fires hollow points, poly tipped, and FMJ ammo with no problem."
