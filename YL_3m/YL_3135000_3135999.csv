It comes with the original box and an extra AAA battery.

This is the older model, which has been superceded by the newer ""HD7 Gen III"".

Why am I selling this?  I had this mounted on my Tavor (see picture below), but I just got the Meprolight M21 because  (1) it's the ""proper"" optic for the Tavor, i.e. the M21 is what the Israeli Defense Force use on their Tavors, and (2) my buddy has an M21 on his Tavor, so if he goes down during the fight with the blue-helmet wearing zombie-robots from the U.N.-F.E.M.A.-D.H.S., I can simply grab his Tavor and keep fighting without any adjustment.

The shooter in the picture is cross-eyed dominant.  With iron sights, she has to shoot left-handed, but with the red dot optic, she shoots right-handed without any problem.

Here are some video reviews.  In the second video, the HD7 is submerged in water for over 10 minutes, and keeps working.

Barrels have 1-in-9 twist ratio as is common for .223 Remington semiautomatic rifles. The M96 is gas operated, with a fixed gas cylinder and moving piston connected to the operating rod and bolt carrier. All variants are equipped with a gas regulator, which allows fine-tuning for low or high powered cartridges, outside temperature, etc. and is probably unique for a civilian rifle in this caliber. The bolt carrier has been specially designed for strength and slow cyclic rate for improved reliability. The M96 bolt is a six-lug design somewhat similar to an AR-15 bolt but with larger, stronger lugs. The M96 receiver is stamped stainless steel with a special blackening treatment. The barrel is parkerized chromoly steel and the stocks are molded plastic. Incidentally, the buttstock is the one part of the M96 that is interchangeable with the Stoner 63. The M96 has adjustable military-type sights (rear aperture and front protected post) and does not have a standard scope mount or Picatinny rail."" Rare and unusual rifle in excellent condition. Has been fired, but very little. No marks on gun. This is the Rarer 16"" ""Recon Carbine"" version. No magazine. (uses standard AR15 mags)"

In 1937, SIG acquired a license for Petter's system in order to develop a replacement for the Luger Parabellum 06/29 which had been in service since 1900. Development was slowed by WWII. After testing various experimental models, the P210 entered Swiss military service in 1949. Some previous series (original designation SP47/8) were tested by Swedish Sport Shooters and by the Danish army.

Our pistols are authentic Swiss Army P49, 210-2s and were imported into the United States directly by CO Gun Sales. All of the P210-2s we have available for purchase have matching serial numbers and come with one original P210, eight round magazine.

I bought this to put on my Ruger LCR-22 with laser (which is also for sale , click on ""Listings by this user"").  However, shortly after buying the LCR-22, I found a Smith & Wesson 63, so I'm selling the LCR.  

Officially, XS does not make a sight for the LCR-22 , this is for the LCR 38/357.  However, various users on the internet (for what it's worth) says it works fine on the LCR-22.  Others say it works, but changes the point of aim.   I got the LCR-22 as a self-defense pistol for a family member who has no training at this point, so my intention was for her to use the XS sight to index the pistol for room-distance shots at people-size targets, _not_ for precision shots.  The laser would be used if a precision shot was necessary.

The photo below of the clam-shell package is the actual item for sale.

The other photo, of the sight on the LCR, is a stock photo from Amazon.

Everything needed to install the sight is included with the package.  And XS provides how-to installation videos at

It usually comes in the same configuration as the WASR-2. These have known problems with jamming or failure to feed. This may be due to low quality magazines, or their followers. The WASR-3 was originally supplied with surplus 5.45x39 AK-74 magazines, which do not reliably feed the 5.56/.223 cartridge. People have used Weiger magazines with some success. Century Arms eventually began including Romanian copies of the reliable Weiger magazine with these rifles. Some switch the follower of an AK-47 magazine with one from Robinson arms.[5] Israeli Galil steel magazines are also known to work without modification in 
the WASR-3. Some owners have also modified the rifle to accept Bulgarian Circle-10 5.56 magazines, or Polish Beryl 5.56 magazines. These sometimes require some material to be removed from the receiver center support bar."

The original Ruger box, soft case, manual, factory padlock, and spent-shell casing, are all included  ( I can send more pictures via e-mail;  ArmsList only allows three ).

Why am I selling this?  I purchased this in early 2014.  Shortly afterwards, I found a deal on a Smith & Wesson 63, which I wanted.  So I'm selling this to (1) fund the S&W, and (2) adhere to the one-in-one-out rule

The spent shell casing is dated March 2012, so this was two years old when I bought it. 

I can meet you at an FFL dealer of your choice to conduct the transfer, in accordance with stupid state laws.  Unless otherwise agreed:  1)  buyer is responsible for paying all transfer and CBI fees, and 2) in event of trade, we are each responsible for paying our own transfer and CBI fees.

“The .22 Caliber Killings” by Mark Schorr.
New York Magazine.  May 7, 1979
The last four years have seen a slew of professionally performed .22 killings; most of the victims were FBI informants...


http://www.tactical-life.com/online/tactical-weapons/israeli-mossad-22-lrs/
""Israeli Mossad .22 LRs""  by Nick Jacobellis.  
Tactical Weapons.  May 2009
...in February of 1969, Israeli Sky Marshal Mordechai Rachamim engaged several heavily armed Arab terrorists as they attacked an EL Al airliner on a snow covered runway in Zurich. Despite the odds against him, the young Israeli sky marshal expertly used his issued Beretta Model 70 pistol to kill one of the Palestinian terrorists, moments before the Zurich Police arrived and took the remaining terrorists into custody. The three surviving male Palestinian terrorists received 12-year jail sentences for attacking a commercial airliner with machine guns and explosives that resulted in the killing and wounding of several passengers and crew. Sky Marshal Mordechai Rachamim became an instant hero at home in Israel.

Rachamim told the author that during this engagement at least two of the rounds fired from his Model 70 hit the mark and were responsible for one of the male terrorists being KIA — pretty good shooting, considering that Rachamim single-handedly charged the enemy position while he emptied his .22 caliber pistol at the heavily armed terrorists. Even though Israeli Sky Marshal Rachamim was only armed with a .22, far too much was at stake for him to miss his target. Failure was not on option.

In May of 1972, Rachamim participated in another daring and equally dangerous tactical operation involving aviation security when he and other members of Israel’s elite Sayert Matkal commando unit rescued passengers and crewmembers onboard a hijacked Sabena Airline flight at Lod Airport (now, Ben-Gurion) in Tel Aviv.
. . .
Once again the Israeli sky marshals and Sayert Matkal commandos proved that you do not necessarily need to be heavily armed with sub-machine guns and major-caliber pistols to stop terrorists and criminals. Just like David killed Goliath with a slingshot and a small rock, the Israelis in more modern times used .22s to eliminate a different type of monster from the field of battle..."

MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

Item G-37063-7.
Make: Mossberg  Model: 46B (B)  Year of Manufacture: 1947-1949 
Caliber: .22 Short, Long or Long Rifle
Action Type: Bolt Action with Tubular Magazine
Barrel Length: The barrel is 26” long. 

 The stock is one piece walnut with a smooth pistol grip, cheekpiece and a black plastic butt plate.  The butt stock and the forend have a sling swivel mountings.   This rifle retains about 90% of its metal finish. There is surface loss on the front edge of the barrel and front of the magazine tube rod, and some light rust on the front of the barrel. The rest of the barrel shows light handling marks.  The knurling on the magazine tube rod is sharp with one small spot of surface loss.   This is a very unique looking vintage rifle and it’s hard to imagine anyone producing a similar rifle today at an affordable cost. Mossberg made this same model in 3 different configurations (e.g. 46B, 46B(a) and 46B(b). The 46B, produced from 1938 to 1946 used the S-104 rear peep, while the 46(a) produced from 1946-1947 and used the S-100 rear peep. The 46B(b) used the S-130 rear peep, and was made from 1947-1949. Mossberg also made almost the same rifle in about 10 other models with tubular & clip magazines, standard and heavy barrels, different stocks, and different combinations and types of sights. Spare parts for old Mossberg rifles can be found at http://www.havlinsales.com/ The old Mossberg rimfires are said to be very accurate. This one has a nice bore and solid action, and ought to make someone a Great plinker.

Also included are 2 extra wolf hammer springs, one 14lb and one 13lb, the 12lb spring is installed. One speed strip and Also a pachmayr presentation grip that came on the gun when purchased. It is currently wearing factory wood grips I purchased separately. They fit perfect.

I received it in a trade about a week ago and I think I'm going to go in a different direction. There's nothing wrong with it, I'd just rather buy a pistol or two. It's fully ambidextrous and chambered in .308. It's in great shape, the only marks being a ding near the shell deflector, and some brass marks on the deflector. Overall I'd give it an 8/10. I don't know the round count, but I'd say it's around a few hundred. 

Upgrades on the rifle are a Midwest Industries free float 15"" rail, Magpul CTR stock, AAC  muzzle brake (supressor ready), a Hogue pistol grip, and a new set of Magpul MBUS sights. It will come with two 20 round PMags loaded with Federal XM80. 

Cash price is $1300 firm. For $1500 I'll throw in 8 more 20 round PMags, 108 more rounds of ammo (48 of which are reloads), and a brand new SureFire SOCOM supressor ready brake. 

I'm also interested in trades for quality revolvers in .357 or .44mag, 1911s, and quality pistols chambered in 9mm or .45ACP. I'm OK with multiple pistol trades if your offer doesn't meet my cash price, or trades +cash. 

If interested you can text me any time at REDACTED, or email me through the armslist link above. Let me know if you'd like higher quality pictures and I'll shoot you an email. Thanks for looking."

There were only 306,057 M1's made in that time frame, which is low production numbers for the amount of time, which make them very hard to find! Late production guns are highly desirable for their rarity and lack of battle wear which also improves on chances of excellent accuracy. I disassembled the gun and we took pics of all the part drawing numbers to show it is 100% correct for the gun's year of production. The parts still had packing grease on them from long term storage which I wiped away to see the parts numbers, but I didn't clean it all off for protection from future rust. The pics will also show the lack of wear on all of the parts and the original finish. They will also show that the stock has never been refinished and retains the original acceptance proof and Dept. of Defense Cartouche. The ME( muzzle erosion) of less than 1.5 and TE (throat erosion) of 2.5 which denotes an almost new barrel. The barrel is dated 1955 and is the original barrel to this receiver.

This is a high quality Serbian (former Yugoslavia) rifle made in the legendary Zastava factory.  This gun is not a Romanian WASR, with its legendary quality issues.  This gun is not an N-Pap, which is a different Zastava AK47 from my O-Pap.  What is the difference?  If you don’t know, you may want to google it, because there is a big difference.  First, the O-Pap is no longer available.  Only the N-Pap is.  Second, my O-Pap has a 1.5mm thick RPK-style receiver with a bulged (stronger) trunnion.  The N-Pap has a much thinner 1.0mm stamped receiver, the same thickness as the Romanian WASR and other low-end AK rifles.  The thicker receiver is stronger and many people feel is way more desirable.  My gun also has a few really nice upgrades, like a new rear sight that has adjustable windage, a shock buffer, a notched safety lever and a trigger group pin retention plate.  With the windage adjustable rear sight, you can adjust your bullet strike point to the right or left on a target without having to move the front sight left or right with a special tool (good luck getting it to move) or with a hammer.  The upgraded sight allows micro-precise adjustment with the turn of a knob.  The shock buffer is a small item, but it stops the bolt from slamming the receiver with each shot.  The notched safety lever allows you to hold the bolt open as is required by many ranges when the gun is not being shot.  I did not notch the original lever—I notched one I bought so the original is still intact and comes with the gun, as does the original rear sight, a slant muzzle brake, and the original muzzle nut.  The original cleaning rod is also included.  The gun also comes with a sling, 3 magazines and I will throw in 100 rounds of ammo.  If sold in person in or near Dublin, Ohio, the sale will be cash only, and the buyer will be asked to show a drivers license or CCW, and also to sign a Bill of Sale.  If I ship the gun, I must first receive payment by Postal Money Order and I must also receive a copy of the recipient’s current FFL.  Shipping fully insured to the lower 48 States will be $40.

Looking to trader for Glock 19, 26, or Glock 27. Must have similar trade items (Glock, Night Sights, At least 2 Mags, if you have no box then i'll have to keep mine).

I've shot roughly 300 rounds through it, used this as my concealed carry so there is some holster wear.

I am really looking to trade this vs selling it but if there is a cash purchaser, I am FIRM on $450.

Freshly cleaned and lubed up so ready for its next owner!
