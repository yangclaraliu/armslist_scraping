The rifle has mounted on it a leupold plainsman scope which appears to be in excellent condition. This was the first model scope that leupold made. This one appears to be an early model as well. The scope mount is made by E C Herckner Co which appears to be from the same period as the scope and rifle.

The tac light has been shot on this weapon and has a burn spot on top of the light from the muzzle flash but doesnt affect the light at all. I also have a momentary switch that replaces the paddle switch for the light that would work great for home defense. Lots of money invested in this package deal that will work for any shooter.

This is a single shot pistol, approx 10"" barrel, with dry fire capability.  

Left handed use for medium to largish hands.

Accuracy is per the test target.  This is NOT machine rest, but is 20 rounds at 50 Meters.  This accuracy is about as good as most precision target .22 rifles for that number of shots.

The gun can not be converted to RH use easily.  The grip also has a slight cant (images on request).  The sights can be canted.  The front sight also can be moved rearward to change the sight radius, tune the barrel, or add a muzzle brake or silencer (muzzle is NOT threaded at this time).  Due to the long barrel, the noise level from the gun already is very low, making it ideal for in-home ranges.

Trigger pull adjusts from about 1.5 oz to about 12 oz.

The manufacturer is Pfuff, Germany.

Includes a wood case.

Please email if additional images are desired.

A LH Steyr, and RH versions of these guns also are available, but at higher prices.

In the USA, these guns are used primarily for pistol match competition, and hunting.  In Europe, also for training, intelligence, and police work as well.

Shipping with wood case, $30.

    The .22 caliber HK 416 is loaded with authentic features. From its appearance, feel, and operation, right down to the sling swivel incorporated into the stock, the 416 D145RS is a replica in every sense.
    Like all the .22LR H&Ks offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22 rimfire rifle. It is engineered and built in Germany by Carl Walther with a match grade precision barrel, upper and lower metal receivers, a retractable stock, and a machined rail interface system.

These have the Full Auto bolt and also comes with the F/A trigger pack (NOT installed but was part of the factory original kit...the G2 trigger pack is currently installed) These are highly sought after for those who want an SBR Krinkov AK47 or a real M92 as well as Class III dealers who want to build a Military Full Auto AK for a dealer demo. This is a genuine Krinkov Yugo Military M92 SBR rifle put together by Velocity Arms on a correct 1.5mm NoDak Spuds Krinkov Receiver making it one of the best shooting AK47 out there!!

Rossi Single Shot Rifles combine simplicity, accuracy and practicality in a rifle built for generations of shooting enjoyment. Each of these rifles is equipped with a scope rail and hammer extension that accommodates all popular optics. The heavy barrel models are button rifled for extreme accuracy. Rossi varmint rifles and their standard profile counterparts all feature a black synthetic stock with removable cheek piece and are equipped with Rossi’s soft recoil pad and distinctive white line spacer, button rifled barrels, adjustable fiber optic sights and sling swivels. Centerfire models have an extra wide positive action extractor to ensure easy removal of the spent case when you open the breech, while the rimfire models carry a powerful ejector that reliably kicks the spent or unfired shell clear. These rifles combine four safety systems to make them as safe and enjoyable as possible. The Rossi single shot rifle incorporates a transfer bar mechanism that stops the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the hammer has been cocked and trigger has been pulled completely rearward. This helps prevent accidental firing from drops or impact. All Rossi rifles incorporate our breech lock system, which prevents the action from being opened or closed when the hammer is cocked, along with our manual hammer block safety and Taurus Security System. Over 100 years of firearms design has taught us that safety comes first and foremost. Every Rossi full-size and youth-size rifle is equipped with fully adjustable fiber optic sights and are drilled and tapped to accommodate the Rossi scope mount base. These single shot rifles are perfect for training first-time shooters, fun and affordable target shooting and all types of hunting.

It has an extended tube and will hold 7+1 of 3 inch shells. The furniture is from Choate. It has a little wear and there are two spots on the receiver where the finish has chipped off. I tested the gun and while it fires and cycles flawlessly,the carrier release sticks and you will have to open the bolt to reset the carrier release(a google search shows this is a common problem with these guns). If this is something that you can fix or you aren't worried about doing a quick reload while under fire because it could stick then send me an offer.  I have this up as a curiosity to see if somebody out there would want to trade for it.

Each of these rifles is equipped with a scope rail and hammer extension that accommodates all popular optics. The heavy barrel models are button rifled for extreme accuracy. Rossi varmint rifles and their standard profile counterparts all feature a black synthetic stock with removable cheek piece and are equipped with Rossi’s soft recoil pad and distinctive white line spacer, button rifled barrels, adjustable fiber optic sights and sling swivels. Centerfire models have an extra wide positive action extractor to ensure easy removal of the spent case when you open the breech, while the rimfire models carry a powerful ejector that reliably kicks the spent or unfired shell clear. These rifles combine four safety systems to make them as safe and enjoyable as possible. The Rossi single shot rifle incorporates a transfer bar mechanism that stops the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the hammer has been cocked and trigger has been pulled completely rearward. This helps prevent accidental firing from drops or impact. All Rossi rifles incorporate our breech lock system, which prevents the action from being opened or closed when the hammer is cocked, along with our manual hammer block safety and Taurus Security System. Over 100 years of firearms design has taught us that safety comes first and foremost. Every Rossi full-size and youth-size rifle is equipped with fully adjustable fiber optic sights and are drilled and tapped to accommodate the Rossi scope mount base. These single shot rifles are perfect for training first-time shooters, fun and affordable target shooting and all types of hunting.

It comes with 5 factory magazines.  Also included in the price is a Comp-Tac International holster suitable for competition use.  The gun has the following upgrades:

-CZ Custom competition sights (black rear, fiber optic front)
-Cajun Gun Works Short Reset Kit
-Cajun Gun Works 13 lb mainspring
-Cajun Gun Works extended firing pin (will ignite any primer)
-Cajun Gun Works lighter weight firing pin spring, firing pin block spring, and trigger return spring
-CZ Custom Cocobolo wood grips (original plastic grips included)
-CZ rubber base pads on all magazines

All stock parts are included, so if you'd like to revert to stock it can be done easily.  The Omega trigger system is very user-friendly and simple to detail-strip.

The gun has a light trigger job, and with the upgrades it will give a custom shop CZ a run for its money for less than half the price. The trigger is smooth and light in both double and single action, but not too light. Swapping in the stock mainspring will give you a heavier DA pull if you desire.  The gun is 100% USPSA Production legal if you are looking to compete with it.

It has approximately 1,900 rounds through it and runs like a top.  It will reliably function with any 9 mm ammo.  I am the original owner.  I bought it new in March 2014. It is in excellent condition.  It was always cleaned after every trip to the range.  There is some very very minor holster wear on the trigger guard, but otherwise the gun is very clean. The mags show some wear but all function perfectly.   

If you do not wish to buy the holster, I will drop the price by $40.

The firearm will be transfered to the new owner via FFL.  If local, I will pay half the transfer fee, the buyer will pay the other half.  If you wish to have it shipped to your FFL, you will have to pay the entire FFL fee.  I will not ship to states that have any restrictions on magazine capacity or any other restrictions applicable to this firearm.  If you have any questions let me know."

Each of these rifles is equipped with a scope rail and hammer extension that accommodates all popular optics. The heavy barrel models are button rifled for extreme accuracy. Rossi varmint rifles and their standard profile counterparts all feature a black synthetic stock with removable cheek piece and are equipped with Rossi’s soft recoil pad and distinctive white line spacer, button rifled barrels, adjustable fiber optic sights and sling swivels. Centerfire models have an extra wide positive action extractor to ensure easy removal of the spent case when you open the breech, while the rimfire models carry a powerful ejector that reliably kicks the spent or unfired shell clear. These rifles combine four safety systems to make them as safe and enjoyable as possible. The Rossi single shot rifle incorporates a transfer bar mechanism that stops the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the hammer has been cocked and trigger has been pulled completely rearward. This helps prevent accidental firing from drops or impact. All Rossi rifles incorporate our breech lock system, which prevents the action from being opened or closed when the hammer is cocked, along with our manual hammer block safety and Taurus Security System. Over 100 years of firearms design has taught us that safety comes first and foremost. Every Rossi full-size and youth-size rifle is equipped with fully adjustable fiber optic sights and are drilled and tapped to accommodate the Rossi scope mount base. These single shot rifles are perfect for training first-time shooters, fun and affordable target shooting and all types of hunting.

Each of these rifles is equipped with a scope rail and hammer extension that accommodates all popular optics. The heavy barrel models are button rifled for extreme accuracy. Rossi varmint rifles and their standard profile counterparts all feature a black synthetic stock with removable cheek piece and are equipped with Rossi’s soft recoil pad and distinctive white line spacer, button rifled barrels, adjustable fiber optic sights and sling swivels. Centerfire models have an extra wide positive action extractor to ensure easy removal of the spent case when you open the breech, while the rimfire models carry a powerful ejector that reliably kicks the spent or unfired shell clear. These rifles combine four safety systems to make them as safe and enjoyable as possible. The Rossi single shot rifle incorporates a transfer bar mechanism that stops the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the hammer has been cocked and trigger has been pulled completely rearward. This helps prevent accidental firing from drops or impact. All Rossi rifles incorporate our breech lock system, which prevents the action from being opened or closed when the hammer is cocked, along with our manual hammer block safety and Taurus Security System. Over 100 years of firearms design has taught us that safety comes first and foremost. Every Rossi full-size and youth-size rifle is equipped with fully adjustable fiber optic sights and are drilled and tapped to accommodate the Rossi scope mount base. These single shot rifles are perfect for training first-time shooters, fun and affordable target shooting and all types of hunting.

I am a gun lover no matter what, and the value of any gun to me may not be the same as it is to you. We all use the internet for most of our education and that allows us to obtain a perceived value of what I think something is worth to us. I have bought guns for a ridiculous price and sold some for what I thought was crazy as well. I have been advertising three Smith & Wesson guns with a lot of extras and have everyone telling me that I am $50 to $100 too high on all three. Well if you want them for $50 or $100 cheaper than make your offer. Don't  just email me to tell me how overpriced they are. I have 3 junk guns. Sorry, they are all Smith & Wesson mid 1990's model and just because they are all three in pristine condition, I guess that means that they are still just junkers. I will take your lowest offer for these junkers and just make you offer, you will be very SURPRISED at what I will take for each of these junkers. Please just look up the value of the junker and then add the value of the extra stuff that I am offering along with each one of the pieces of junk, and give me your best cash offer.  915 9mm blued, 410S stainless .40 caliber, 4506-1 .45 acp Fresno Co Sheriff Issue.
