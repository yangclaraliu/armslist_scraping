These are all in darn near perfect condition---been read but not abused. They have been stored in a box in the closet so have no damage from moisture or rodents. Some of these can be ordered from the publisher if they happen to be available but they charge from $4 to $7.50 a copy. I usually include shipping in my price, but since there are a couple of options with these you have choices to make. The ones in binders won't fit in the small flat rate box so would take the large flate rate box or media rate if you are not in a hurry. Keep in mind that the media rate usually takes 1-2 weeks.The loose copies and the binders will not all fit in the flat rate box together.

These are all in darn near perfect condition---been read but not abused. They have been stored in a box in the closet so have no damage from moisture or rodents. Some of these can be ordered from the publisher if they happen to be available but they charge from $4 to $7.50 a copy. I usually include shipping in my price, but since there are a couple of options with these you have choices to make. The ones in binders won't fit in the small flat rate box so would take the large flate rate box or media rate if you are not in a hurry. Keep in mind that the media rate usually takes 1-2 weeks.The loose copies and the binders will not all fit in the flat rate box together. 

Sorry but I would prefer to NOT break up the groups.

71,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3857071,For Sale:  Kahr CM40,"Randleman, Greensboro, North Carolina",$ 319,"Listed On: Friday, May 8, 2015",Handguns,Kahr                                                                                ,40 S&W                                                                                ,Double Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"NEW UNFIRED!

The CM Series, which debuted in spring 2011 with the CM9, takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel, 9 mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM4043 has the same external dimensions as the PM4043, which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel.

The CM4043 is chambered in a .40 S&W caliber, has a 3.1"" barrel and an overall length of 5.47"", with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 15.8 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models include: the CM4043 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; and finally, the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines.

The CM40 boasts real sights, which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally, the slide does lock back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of other value priced compact semi-auto pistols.

The CM40 slide is machined from solid 416 stainless steel with a matte finish and is only .94 inch wide. Each gun is shipped with one 5 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush floorplate. Magazines are made in the USA, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after many uses.

Just like the CM9, the new CM40 will include all of the great features that make Kahr pistols one of a kind. Kahr's seven patents result in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today:
- The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds.
- Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety), and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations. Many lower cost compact semi-autos on the market today do not have firing pin blocks in their design.
- Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame, and since there is no hammer, the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots.

Kahr offers the CM series at a great value price, but did not compromise on the features, accuracy and reliability found in all Kahr pistols.

Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB9, a micro-compact 9mm pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Notice: Due to potential cyclical problems involving recoil energy, Diamondback Firearms does not recommend the use of any 9mm SAMMI Specification ammunition in bullet weights exceeding 124 grain.

The use of +P, +P+, reloaded, or NON-SAMMI Spec ammunition will void the firearms warranty.

DISCLAIMER: Crimson Trace Corporation© DB .380 specific laser mount is not designed for the DB9. Use of the CTC laser mount on the DB9 will void the manufacturers warranty.

The PSL is chambered for the same venerable 7.62x54mmR (rimmed) cartridge as the Dragunov, and feeds from a ten-round detachable box magazine . The magazine used on the PSL differs from that of Dragunov models in that it is stamped with an X shaped pattern on the side, rather than the waffle style stamp found on the Russian and Chinese magazines. The magazines, though they are similar in shape and size, are not interchangeable between the Dragunov and PSL without modification.

The PSL has been in service in Romania since the 1970s and is widely sold on the world market. They are frequently encountered in Iraq where they appear to be quite popular. The simplicity of the rifle makes it ideal for soldiers to use and maintain. The action, being a variant of the AKM's, is extremely reliable despite lack of maintenance, and is particularly forgiving of sand and other debris. The scope's reticle pattern is easy to use and makes range estimation quick and reasonably accurate without any mathematical calculations necessary. With some simple instruction an average individual can be issued a PSL and successfully engage targets at ranges that far exceed the accurate capabilities of non-scoped assault rifles like the AKM, AK-47, etc. Accuracy varies greatly, however, between individual rifles to a greater extent to other rifles in its class, probably due to insufficient quality control during the manufacturing process. In the hands of a capable shooter and with quality ammunition such as 7N1 and 7N14 a PSL is capable of 1 Minute of angle (approximately 1"" at 100 yards) or less while the rifles on the other end of the spectrum are only capable of about 3 MOA.

PSL rifles have some notable features, the skeleton stock is somewhat similar to the Dragunov's but includes an interesting corrugated and spring-loaded stamped steel buttplate. When the rifle is fired this helps reduce the felt recoil to a degree. The cheek riser on the comb of the stock is angled to benefit the right-handed shooter primarily. Some owners feel the cheek pad is not high enough to adequately attain a rigid cheek weld and have to make do with a chin weld.

The butt stock is much shorter than most Western shooters are used to. This is because Romanian soldiers often operate in very cold climates and wear thick winter coats while operating. In theory, a rubber stock extender is to be fitted during warm weather but one is not issued with the rifle.

The PSL's telescopic sight is made by the Romanian Optical Enterprise (IOR) in Bucharest. IOR is a Romanian company which has been making optics since 1936. They currently use German made Schott glass coated with the Carl Zeiss T-3 system to eliminate glare and maximize light transmission. It is unknown what glass and coatings they used at the time they produced the PSL's scope, however IOR had a long association with western European optics manufacturers and maintained these despite being caught within the Iron Curtain. In 1967 IOR collaborated with various German manufacturers and in 1975 an association was established with Carl Zeiss which led to even more expansion and modernization.

The PSL was originally issued with the type 1 version of the LPS telescopic sight. This 4x24 scope was more or less identical to the Russian PSO-1 telescopic sight with a battery-powered reticle illumination and an IR detection filter. These scopes stopped being produced around 1974 and are rather rare today with collectors paying a premium for them. Shortly afterward the LPS scope was technically revised to simplify the maintenance and construction of the scope.

The PSL rifle is typically issued with a 4x24 optical sight called LPS 4x6° TIP2 (Lunetă Puṣcă Semiautomată Tip 2, or ""Scope, Semi-Automatic Rifle, Type #2"") which is a simplified version of the Russian PSO-1 telescopic weapon sight. This optical sight features 4x magnification , a 6° field of view , and the objective lens is 24 mm in diameter. It shares the basic design and stadiametric rangefinder found in the reticle of the original Russian PSO-1 scope. The LPS 4x6° TIP2 elevation turret features bullet drop compensation (BDC) in 50 m increments for engaging point and area targets at ranges from 100 m up to 1,000 m. The BDC feature must be tuned at the factory for the particular ballistic trajectory of a particular combination of rifle and cartridge at a predefined air density. Inevitable BDC induced errors will occur if the environmental and meteorological circumstances deviate from the circumstances the BDC was calibrated for. Marksmen can be trained to compensate for these errors. Besides the BDC elevation or vertical adjustment control of the reticle, the windage or horizontal adjustment control of the reticle can also be easily dialed in by the user without having to remove turret caps etc. The reticle illumination of the LPS 4x6° TIP2 is provided by (radioactive) tritium . The tritium light source has to be replaced every 8–12 years, since it gradually loses its brightness due to radioactive decay. [2]
The LPS 4x6° TIP2 is issued with a lens hood that can be attached to the ocular to reduce/eliminate image quality impairing stray light and a covers to protect the objective external lens surface against foul weather and damage"

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Diamondback Firearms is proud to present the DB380. A micro-compact .380 automatic pistol made entirely in the USA. Designed with safety in mind, the DB380 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol.

A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp smooth, trigger pull. The DB380 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

The Ruger M77 MkII VLE is Ruger's little known Law Enforcement tactical rifle. The rifle is based off of the M77 MkII VT target/varmint rifle but has a few changes. All the metal work is a flat black finish vs. the flat grey color of the VT rifles. The VT and VLE rifles have a laminated stock which is nicely contoured with a very wide forend. The VLE stock is different in that it is composed of darker grey colored laminates, vs the brown colors of the VT. Both rifles are the same beyond that. The barrel is a 26"" medium weight barrel. The barrel is not as heavy as most tactical rifles, which keeps weight down a little. The trigger is a decent 2 stage trigger, which I personally prefer. The scope mounting system is typical ruger with the integral scope mounting rails for the provided rings to mount to. The bipod has been removed and I no longer have it."

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth.

Our exclusive ArmorLokt™process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

The Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18 1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem™ Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail.

Designed with safety in mind, the DB9 features a ""ZERO-Energy"" striker firing system with a mechanical firing pin block, a steel magazine catch to secure a sheet metal magazine and real windage-adjustable sights, all in a lightweight pistol. A steel trigger with dual connecting bars allows for a crisp, smooth, trigger pull. The DB9 features a FEA (Finite Element Analysis) designed slide and barrel that is stronger than any comparable firearm, resulting in durability with less felt recoil, and the absence of removable pins or tools makes field stripping easier than ever. The slide, barrel, and internal parts are coated to resist corrosion, making this pistol a lifetime investment.

Notice: Due to potential cyclical problems involving recoil energy, Diamondback Firearms does not recommend the use of any 9mm SAMMI Specification ammunition in bullet weights exceeding 124 grain.

The use of +P, +P+, reloaded, or NON-SAMMI Spec ammunition will void the firearms warranty.

Hey all,
	I recently picked up a new “interest” in a project, so I have to let one of my other favorites go. I have available a Hi-point 995 (9mm) carbine. It comes with a lot of extras and shoots great. Here is what it comes with: 3 front sight posts, one front sight base, one full rear sights assembly (unused), 5 magazine (2 are from an older style so they look slightly different but i never used them), BSA Red Dot sight, original factory stock, aftermarket/995TS tactical stock, “through-stock” dual magazine holder, factory “heat shield” rail, Hi-Point Barrel compensator, various small screws/wrenches for the stock and parts.  I have put probably 1-200rds though this and not had a single issue running some of my JHP reloads and regular factory FMJ.It shows signs of use and isn’t the “Belle of the ball” but it is a blast to shoot and would be a great base for you to add on extras or continue modifying. 
	I am mainly looking for cash, but i would ""maybe"" consider trades for a good 30/30 lever, Mossberg 835 12 gauge or ""tactical"" model (maybe), a decent semi-auto rifle (not in .22 rimfire or .17 caliber), “possibly” even decent bolt-action guns or a decent 357 mag with adj sights or maybe even cheaper 1911s. Honestly, Im kind of open on trades, but please be fair and reasonable with your values and I will as well. I have cash or ammo i can include to “trade up” if you have something i really want, but for the most part it would have to be in my favor a good amount for me to be able to include cash or ammo (this time of year at least). Shoot me text at REDACTED or a message on here with any offers and we can go from there! I need to meet in or very close to Norman on this due to my schedule.
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

This is not your normal cz-52 or even one of the normal CAI 9mms (of which only a couple thousand were ever made.) This has been called the best reference example of the 9mm out there. The normal ones that were made into 9mm in the factory have been refurbed multiple times and usually have more stamps than an exec's passport. This one however is a one off direct from the factory non-refurb with a serial matched barrel from the factory. If you are a fan of CZ's or Roller Lock pistols this is the HOLY GRAIL.
(Yes my images come up in google, it's been shared many times by collectors i can assure you it is actually the one in the pictures.)

From the Vortex website:

Designed specifically for the AR platform, the Spitfires combine an impressive array of high-performance features into rugged, ultra-compact packages. When fast target acquisition in close- to medium-range shooting applications is a priority, the Spitfires excel. Laced with advanced features, the sophisticated prism-based design allows for a more compact optical system without sacrificing optical quality. Selectable red/green illuminated reticles with five intensity levels to match specific conditions, are etched directly on the prism to assure consistent point-of-aim at all times—regardless of whether or not illumination is engaged.

It comes with the hard case, 2 7 round mags with grip extensions, 2 5 round mags,  1 extra base plate extension for a 5 round mag, paddle holster, magazine holder that holds 2 mags and can go on the waist. Gun lock, cleaning brush.  This pistol has 2 interchangeable backstraps so you can put whatever one you prefer on the pistol. I also have the interchangeable grip extensions for the 7 round mags so everything will line up no matter what backstrap you have on the pistol. I also have a little bit of ammo that I can throw in with the pistol. I'm asking $500 obo but would prefer to trade for a nice glock, 92fs or M9, s&w m&p. Also open to other nice full size pistols.

Great drum, can be swapped out with feeders for the 10/22 and PPS conversion. Excellent drum mag for your conversion or dedicated .22 AR upper.

From Blackdog:
THIS WILL NOT FIT THE SMITH AND WESSON RIFLE ALSO KNOWN AS THE S&W.22 LR.

Features: Built with an interchangeable feed tower. You can easily disassemble the drum, slide your AR-22 tower out and replace it with the new Black Dog 10-22 or S&W.22 feed towers.

Material: Polycarbonate & Glass Filled Nylon

We do not guarantee that the drum will work in full-auto setups. However, many customers report that with a little fine tuning they can get the drum to work in full-auto.

Recommended Ammunition: Federal, CCI/Blazer, American Eagle. Use a round nosed bullet. Stay away from hollow points. Ammunition not listed will not feed well in our products.



Black dummy rounds: The plastic black dummy rounds are an important part of the drum assembly. They feed the ammo from the drum body to the tower. BDM does not recommend using dummy rounds as real bullets.

Clear rubber bands: Each drum is assembled with one clear rubber band and two extra bands taped to the inside of the drum box.

Spring Tension: If you come across feeding issues, the drum spring may be too tight causing ammo to rush up and out the tower. You may also have feeding issues if the spring is too loose.

This somewhat rare P224 is in the SAS version, which means the usual squared-off edges are smoothed/rounded off, making for better concealment and also making it easier to take in and out of a holster, your pocket, or however you choose to carry it.  It also features the SIG factory Night Sights, and the Short Reset Trigger (SRT) in conjunction with the DA/SA (Double Action/Single Action) de-cocker, as well as a black solid steel guide rod.  This weapon has between 150 to 175 rounds of factory ammo through it.  It shoots like a dream.  No misfires, jams, or any other mechanical problems whatsoever.  Perfect Concealed Carry/Backup firearm.  The posted price includes the one twelve-round factory magazine that came with the weapon from the SIG Sauer factory.  Four additional 15-round SIG factory extended-grip magazines available for $50 a piece (less than I paid for them).  This is a great weapon at a heck of a great price.  Additional photos available upon request.

This is the same scam that occurred for this ad: For Sale: SCAM Arsenal SLR-101S Bulgarian Milled AK-47 SCAM.  I contacted them regarding the GSP Commemorative.  They agreed to $900 and did not want to use a FFL.  The emphasis was always on the money and how soon they could get it. I wanted a FFL point of contact and dealership. They never provided this said they didn't need one. I told them it's law. After 3 days off and on trying to arrange a sale. Today Sunday they said they had a FFL please send the money order for the money and their FFL would contact me. I said that will not work I want the contact info and I will contact the FFL. 
Money (per the person initiating this scam) was to be sent to 
 Helen C Mcloon
 1434 Secret Hill Lane
 Jacksonville FL 32234
 This person (who told me her name was Helen Mcloon via e-mail) used a text number of REDACTED (area code from Idaho, but address in Florida ??) for the SLR 101S and used a REDACTED (Checked it Missouri number for the GSP transaction. When I called the number after I recieved her first text, went to some answering machine. Left voice mail. Called different times and the call always went to voice mail. The person then replied via text that they were at church and could not text nor call. 

Email used was the same for the SLR 101S scam: REDACTED
I asked the right questions and they got pissed when I called them on it.
 If a price is REALLY good and the person listing the ad is unregistered, PLEASE just ask for some basic questions, such as contact info or who the FFL gun is going to ship from.
They were in a hurry to get the money. I reversed the pressure which led to exposing them and also ran the number and turned up several complaints against this woman.
This is a great website, it's just pathetic we have people who have no qualms with ripping others off.

 If I've broken any rules of Armlist (which I didn't see), I apologize.

 Please note, I am not from Florida. I live in a different state which was why I wanted and pressed for FFL information which they tried to avoid.
I am contacting the authorities in Jacksonville.  BTW they even furnished toward the last of the exchange a driver's license which I am sure was faked.
1/12/2015 UPDATE. Called Jacksonville Florida Sheriff's Department and was told to start a report through my local Sheriff's Department. Thought this was incorrect since this person perpetrated a crime through a Jacksonville Florida address.  I initiated a report through my Sehriff's Dapartment. Provided them all that I have and am putting the text messages together in order at present.  My POC here knows someone in Jacksonville law enforcment so wheels are turning.  Hopefully they will catch the person. Hard to say but at least I have tried."
