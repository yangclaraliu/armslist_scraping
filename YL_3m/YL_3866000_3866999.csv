The .40 is very nice and powerful. Excellent home defense round and very accurate out of this gun. I just prefer to keep the Glock 17 as it was a gift, as opposed to buying a Glock 22.. I will trade straight across for a 9mm, glock 17 mag version of this gun. I will entertain other trades."

Remington Overview:

Remington brought the hunting-rifle prowess, and a leading manufacturer of modular repeating rifles introduced us to the 308 Win platform. What emerged is a masterwork of game-dropping performance and hunt-specific features that will load any camp’s meat pole with unrivaled efficiency – the new Model R-25. An advanced, highly lethal blend of accuracy, fast followups and light recoil chambered for three of today’s most popular short-action hunting cartridges – 243 Win, 7mm-08 Remington and 308 Win. This rifle is everything varmint and predator hunters love about our R-15 in a beefed-up design that easily handles cartridges suitable for big-game hunting.

For peak accuracy, its precision-crafted 20"" ChroMoly barrel is freefloated within the machined aluminum fore-end tube. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block keep weight to a minimum and facilitate rapid heat dissipation. The barrel also features a recessed hunting crown to protect the rifling and aid in more consistent bullet flight. When it’s time to make the shot, the R-25’s ergonomic pistol-grip gives you unmatched control and rock-steady aim. As a whole, this rifle has a balanced, stable design that makes it deadly from the offhand position. True to our hunting market, the traditional two-stage trigger found on AR-platform rifles has been exchanged for a crisp, single-stage version that comes from the factory set at 4 1/2 to 5 lbs.

Its carefully tuned upper and lower are machined from rugged aluminum forgings. The entire gun is dressed in Mossy Oak® Treestand™ camo that makes it virtually invisible in the field. We included a 4-round magazine, and the R-25 is compatible with DPMS 308 Win-type magazines and accessories. front and rear sling swivel studs are installed.

Compatible with most any M1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG (Angled Fore Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore grips, the AFG helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

Made in the FN Licensed plant in Argentina (FM) to military specification (parkerized not blued). Comes with one factory magazine.

Improvements/mods/extras:

Magazine safety removed (still have if you wish to reinstall)
Hogue wood grips (have original military rubber grips).
Extra Hammer springs.

Pistol shoots wonderfully and reliably. I have put probably 200 rounds of 9mm FMJ through it. I also tried two magazines worth of hollow points and it cycles and shoots them beautifully. 

Only issue is missing rear sight (I took it off and can't find it for the life of me). I was going to upgrade sights but I want something different. FM90 Model I believe."

** I've had numerous inquiries as to whether or not I will sell the upper with it. I will sell it with the upper, but I do not wish to. So, add $650 to the price, if you want the upper with sights and a BCG. It is a 5.56 upper completely assembled by RRArms. Yes, you can buy a brand new one for that price.

From AimSmall:
""80% AR15 Jig
This jig has hardened steel drill bushings for your side holes unlike other jigs that are just aluminum. The hardened drill bushings will allow you to use the jig many times with no damage, while aluminum ones will start getting loose and sloppy after the very first use. This jig uses locating pins for the top plates to ensure plates are located precisely, other jigs rely on the bolts which is not as accurate due to slop and can result in a poorly finished receiver. An added bonus with this jig is that it will hold uppers so you can easily assemble upper halves while the jig holds the receiver firmly in a vice for you. This jig is designed specifically for use with billet AR15 lowers and standard mil spec forged lowers. """

I’ve had this rifle for a couple decades and now it’s time for someone else to enjoy it.  If you send a low-ball offer, are rude or nasty I will not reply...  If you don’t include your contact information in your reply I will most likely not reply either as I’m aware of all the BS on the internet and I don’t have the time to bother with it.

The SS Compensated Barrel and Tungsten guide rod/spring combination reduces muzzle flip and greatly reduces felt recoil.  I fired exactly 3 mags, (45 rounds) with the barrel and guide rod so it is like new.  Also included is a Ghost 3.5 lb Trigger Control Connector, this connector reduces trigger pull by 25% and also shortens the trigger pull stroke by 60%.  Allows shooting faster and better.  In addition there is a Lone Wolf Extended Slide Lock and Extended Slide Stop Release

KKM Precision Stainless Steel Barrel for Glock 29 Match - 10mm Drop in -  with 10mm Compensator Part # G29G1C.  The compensator reduces muzzle flip and also reduces felt recoil.  All KKM barrels are made using U.S. manufactured 416R Stainless steel bar stock which is then heat treated and vacuum tempered to 42RC. All Barrels are CNC machined to obtain superior dimensional tolerances. Using our unique Button Rifling process, all KKM barrels offer superior accuracy over stock barrels. Our Glock barrels come with fully supported match chambers for shooting factory or reloaded ammunition as well as lead or jacketed bullets.  The compensator has a few places where the finish is scratched and will be priced accordingly.

Super Heavy Duty Tungsten Guide Rod and 21 lb Spring – Fits Glock 29, 29SF, 30, 30SF, and 36.  This spring and guide rod reduces felt recoil in half.  You can shoot the hottest loads comfortably with this installed.  Just drops in, no gunsmith needed.  The 21 lb spring enables reliable feeding of the hottest 10mm loads available.

Ghost Connector shortens the total length of trigger pull and reset enabling you to shoot faster and better. Faster because the total distance the trigger has to move to fire your pistol is reduced up to 60%. Better because once the pistol fires the trigger movement is stopped. Stopping the trigger after the pistol fires is critical to bullet placement. No trigger movement + no pistol movement = no sight movement on the target-this eliminates accuracy robbing over-travel. The bullet goes where you aimed it! Shorter & faster reset-because the Connector eliminates all over-travel of the trigger so that the trigger moves less in both directions.

I paid:  
KKM SS Barrel with Compensator  -  $275.00 + $10.00 shipping = $285.00
Tungsten Guide Rod & 21 lb Spring - $69.95 + $7.50 S&H = $77.45
Ghost Ultimate Trigger Control Connector - $35.95
Extended Slide Lock & Slide Stop - $22.41

Total Invested  $420.81  Asking $370 for everything.  You will get exactly what is pictured.  FTF transaction will be cash only, if shipping a postal money order is required."

By now, their innovative double action pistols are traditional classics. In 2004, Sig Arms launched their Revolution series descendants of John M. Browning’s Colt 1911, traditional pistols with excellence and innovation that we expect from the company. Recently, Sig has gone to using the conventional 1911 name. This is Sig’s 1911 XO variant, Sig’s counterpart to the Colt Government O series. The 1911 XO, writes the SIG SAUER® staff, is an all business full-size non-railed 1911 made for those that want a rugged shooting pistol. Outfitted with contrast sights and Ergo Grip™ XT extreme use grips, the 1911 XO features SIG’s durable Nitron finish designed for rugged use ... The all stainless steel frame and slide of the XO are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance. The frame features 25-line per inch checkering on the front strap and both the frame and slide are de-horned for comfortable full-size carry. Like all SIG SAUER products the new 1911 XO pistols contain only premium internal parts including a match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. For safety the 1911 XO features a beavertail grip safety with speed bump, extended thumb safety, firing pin safety and hammer intercept notch and ships in a plastic gun case with cable lock. As far as other specs, manufacturer is Sig Arms of Exeter, NH. Caliber, of course, is .45 ACP, .45 Automatic. Construction is black Nitron finished stainless steel but with serrated face coated alloy trigger with overtravel adjustment. Trigger pull is 5 pound vicinity with minimal felt creep. The 1911 XO has dovetailed black anodized sights in three white dot configuration, both of them dovetailed into the slide. Grip frame is checker serrated fore and aft; extended magazine release and main safety with beavertail grip safety and serrated top skeleton Commander style hammer. Barrel is 5 inch stainless. Weight empty is 41.6 ounces, with center of gravity at the trigger guard to frame junction. Magazines with the photo specimen are factory 8 rounders, polished stainless body with slot style black polymer floor plates and blue steel cartridge followers. The followers, interestingly, bear a Check-Mate patent number. This pistol will accept any 1911 Government type magazine that fits a full size grip frame. Similarly equipped Colt Pistols command prices upwards of $1500 apiece in our area. We’re offering the Sig 1911 XO in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 659.00.

Sig Sauer, then Sig Arms, commenced setting new standards of excellence in handguns as early as the 1970s. By now, their innovative double action pistols are traditional classics. In 2004, Sig Arms launched their Revolution series descendants of John M. Browning’s Colt 1911, traditional pistols with excellence and innovation that we expect from the company. Recently, Sig has gone to using the conventional 1911 name. This is Sig’s 1911TTT variant, Sig’s counterpart to the Colt Gold Cup Elite series. The 1911 TTT – or Triple T, writes the SIG SAUER® staff, is a two-tone 1911 with Nitron® slide and black controls on a Natural Stainless frame. This non-railed pistol is accented by beautiful custom wood grips and topped off with adjustable combat night sights. The all stainless steel frame and slide of the Triple T are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance. The frame features 25-line per inch checkering on the front strap – while the mainspring housing has 20-line per inch checkering – and both the frame and slide are de-horned for comfortable full-size carry. Like all SIG SAUER products the 1911 TTT pistol contains only premium internal parts including a match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The 1911 TTT features a beavertail grip safety with speed bump, extended thumb safety, firing pin safety and hammer intercept notch … . As far as other specs, manufacturer is Sig Sauer of Exeter, NH. Caliber, of course, is .45 ACP, .45 Automatic. Trigger is serrated face coated alloy with overtravel adjustment. Trigger pull is 5 pound vicinity with minimal felt creep. The 1911 TTT has dovetailed black anodized Siglite® sights in white bar rear / dot front, both of them dovetailed into the slide. Note that the rear sight has Novak style contours, but is windage and elevation adjustable. Grip frame is checker serrated fore and aft; extended magazine release and main safety with beavertail grip safety and serrated top skeleton Commander style hammer. Barrel is 5 inch stainless. Weight empty is 41.6 ounces, with center of gravity at the trigger guard to frame junction. Magazines with the photo specimen are factory 8 rounders, polished stainless body with slot style black polymer floor plates and blue steel cartridge followers. The followers, interestingly, bear a Check-Mate patent number. This pistol will accept any 1911 Government type magazine that fits a full size grip frame. Similarly equipped Colt Pistols command prices upwards of $2000 apiece in our area. We’re offering the Sig 1911 TTT CA in the photos, however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 689.00. Not transferable to civilian residents of Massachusetts. California DOJ Approved Roster Status good until 10/02/2015.

This double action deploys a special mechanism to switch the safety off, chamber a round and cock the trigger. The whole process takes less than a second. Remarkably the holster never jams and works perfectly in harsh temperature conditions and even after its been in contact with sand, mud & water. A Glock has to have a loaded magazine inserted, but no round in the chamber. If there was a round in the chamber – it will be ejected and a new round will be chambered.

But I have to tell you that the FRONT SIGHT on this Hi Power flew off, and I can't bring myself to ruin the bluing by resoldering it back on. Nor do I want to undo the ""all original"" factor with new sights (which requires heavy metal modification on the slide).

I still HAVE the sight, as seen pictured, but it is not seated permanently. 

Slight hair scratch/blemish here and there on the surface, with minor pitting on the passenger side of slide. So basically what you have here is an 80% Blued T-series waiting to be modded.

Grips are original with red backing and probably in 70% condition. The compression on the photos of ARMSLIST makes images look crummy, but I assure you this firearm is a beauty, despite it's age.

If you're looking for a project or don't mind the blue scarring from resoldering, then this piece is for you."

We were wrong. Here is a Glock that takes that now-famous accuracy up a couple notches, the 17C Compensated and Ported variant. This is a pistol you can shoot all day long and never tire of. Manufacturer is Glock Inc. of Smyrna, Georgia. Construction is steel barrel, slide, and internal parts in a steel impregnated polymer frame. Type is double action only blowback action, striker fired semi-auto pistol. Caliber is 9mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Barrel is 6 groove, 1:9.84 twist 4.02 inch, with dual 3/8 inch ports positioned at 11 and 1 o’clock 1 1/4 inches back of the muzzle to eliminate barrel rise, dissipate heat, increase accuracy, and virtually eliminate felt recoil. Slide is ported as well, as the photos show. Sights are stake on white dot front and dovetailed U shaped white outline rear. Trigger is .400 smooth face combat type, but with Glock Trigger Safety that augments the firing pin and drop safeties. Glocks do NOT have magazine safeties; that is, they will fire single shot with no magazine. Trigger pull is a smooth consistent 5 pounds. Finish is black matte. Weight empty is 23 ounces. The Generation 3 frame has an integral single slot Picatinny accessory rail, textured interval finger groove front strap, stippled surface laterals, and checkered serration back strap surface. Sight radius is 6 1/4 inches; height is 5 3/8 inches from the top of the rear sight to the magazine floorplate, slide thickness is 1.05 with frame thickness of 1.17. Overall length is 7 3/8 inches from the muzzle to the top of the grip frame strut. Each specimen is new in its box with factory paperwork, fired brass case, cleaning rod and brush, total of two magazines, red cable lock, and magazine loading tool. We’re offering the Glock 17 in the photos, Factory Number PI1750203, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 469.00.

Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc. (NYSE: RGR) is excited to introduce the Ruger® SR1911® Lightweight Commander-Style pistol; an aluminum frame version of the popular SR1911 Commander-Style pistol. This new model features a black anodized aluminum frame with a satin stainless finish on the slide, resulting in an attractive two-tone appearance in a gun that weighs 7oz. less than the all stainless steel version. It comes factory equipped with an integrated, polished titanium feed ramp and features thin, hardwood grip panels for concealed carry, as well as front strap serrations for improved grip.Ruger engineers took a hard look at how they could utilize new materials to improve the performance of the aluminum-framed 1911. Most aluminum frame pistols tend to show excessive wear on the feed ramp, particularly when shooting modern hollow-point ammunition. This can result in unreliable feeding and may be expensive to correct. The new SR1911 Lightweight Commander-Style pistol comes factory equipped with an integrated polished titanium feed ramp for a lifetime of reliable performance.Since entering the 1911 market in 2011, Ruger has quickly become known for producing some of the best quality 1911's available today. These American-made, CNC machined, series-70 design 1911's come standard with many features typically found only in custom manufactured pistols. All SR1911's feature Novak LoMount Carry 3-dot sights, a lowered and flared ejection port, and a titanium firing pin. In addition, each Ruger SR1911 features a precision barrel and bushing which are machined to match from the same piece of bar stock. The frames have an integral plunger tube, beaver-tail grip safety, oversized magazine release, extended thumb safety and a skeletonized hammer and trigger for fast, accurate shooting. All of this, without the price tag of a custom gun.With the addition of this aluminum frame, commander-style model to the SR1911 line, customers now have a lightweight carry option with the rugged reliability of a Ruger.
