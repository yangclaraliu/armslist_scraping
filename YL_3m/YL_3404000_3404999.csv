Smith quality in a crazy powerful handgun.  If you've ever held the Taurus copy and the Smith Governor at the same time/place, you'd never consider the Taurus again.  The Smith is just that good.

As you should know, this first 45 Long Colt, 410 shotgun shells (which is really fun) and 45 ACP (with the star adaptors).   Not sure, but I've only fired maybe a box through this with an insane lethal effect.  I show two Smith pictures ... mine is blued therefore it is black in color.

I am only culling my pile for a overseas assignment so willing to part with this and associated ammo at a fair price.  The box, papers and such are included.  Ammo can be negotiated.  

Face to face with cash. ID and paperwork required. Ask questions if you have them and you're welcome to look to judge for yourself.

The Hungarian SA-85M are considered to be one of the absolute best AKM imports around. Made by FEG in Hungary, they feature Hungarian receivers and chrome lined hammer forged barrels. They accept regular mags without modification. They come standard with a well constructed very strong and reliable thumbhole stock, and blond beech wood hand guards. Beautiful blued finish throughout. 

Although they lack threaded muzzles and bayonet lugs, they can be easily and precisely reconfigured into original format with surplus parts. These are easily one of the best built if not the best built and finished AKs around, and they typically go for around $1,100-$1390. One thing to note is that some of them use a shorter gas system, and will need proprietary gas tubes if you need spares. They are hard to find in brand new condition for sale for less than 1200 dollars, go look on the internet and see for yourself.

THIS INFO BELOW FROM SA-85 BLOG PAGE.......

The picture below shows the second rifle as I purchased it from the previous owner who had replaced the original wood furniture with a synthetic ATI Dragunov stock. To restore the rifle, I replaced a sufficient number of parts to make it 922 (r) compliant for a pistol-grip configuration. The beech wood furniture is from www.ironwooddesigns.com and was finished according to the ""how to"" instructions on their web site. Note the distinctive shape of the pistol grip and ""bulged"" lower front handguard which are characteristic of Hungarian AKs.

SECANT OGIVE DESIGN Pioneered by Hornady for use in hunting bullets, this technology broke new ground in ballistic engineering and is now used in bullets for everything from match to varmint shooting.

The secant ogive is a geometrically developed design that creates the most ballistically efficient profile, yet retains the optimum bearing surface. The combination of the slender point and increased bearing surface results in lower drag, increased stability, flatter trajectories and amazing accuracy.

294,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3404294,"For Sale:  Hi Standard Olympic ISU pistol, .22s, LH","Far NE IL, Illinois, United States",$ 760,"Listed On: Monday, October 20, 2014",Handguns,no type,no type,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Hi Standard Olympic ISU pistol, left handed grip.

This is the improved version of the Hi Standard pistols that were winning guns at the Olympics.  There were only 3 US manufacturers whose handguns had Olympic gold medals. The first was at the the beginning of the modern Olympics in the 1800s, with the Colt military revolvers.  The S&W free pistol also was a winner in that category on one occasion.  Other than that, Hi Standard has been the only US gun with a win of that type.  

This model, the ISU, moves the muzzle brake into the barrel itself.  The guns used in Olympic competition were used without their add-on muzzle brakes (""stabilizers"" in the old Hi Standard terminology) because these worsened the accuracy significantly.

This gun also has vents along the length of the barrel.  Trigger pull weight is adjustable.

One magazine included.  No box or papers.

This is NOT an NIB or ""perfect mint"" collector's gun, and has been used in competition and related activities.  There is some finish wear, the grip shows age from hand contact, and there are a few tiny areas of loss in blueing.  Also, no box or papers, and only one magazine.  It has both German proof marks and US re-import markings.  The barrel has upper ports, which are not common in the US-sale guns.

FFL transfer only, even for IL FOID permit holders.

Although considered a competition gun, these guns are superb for defense and protection use due to their extreme accuracy, rapid fire capability (5 rounds per second with precise accuracy), and very low bullet penetration into secondary objects or unintended targets.

Additional images on request.  Offers considered.

Hi Standard (Hamden, Hartford) and High Standard (TX) Victors also available.  

This gun is one of several target and ""other use"" pistols available, which are NOT listed on Armslist.  For a complete list and EXPERT'S SELECTION GUIDE to these guns, please email.  The guide and list are free.

Prices on the Victors range from the $500 range (TX, in box and excellent) to around $1000 (Hamden, steel rib, with weights), and stuff in between."

Each Mil-Spec comes with a beautiful pair of cross-cannon emblazoned walnut grips that are held in place with slotted grip screws."

The smoothest pump action you will ever feel!

Taken from Wikipedia: 

The Heckler & Koch Fabarm FP6 is a pump-action combat shotgun that was manufactured by the Italian firearms company Fabbrica Bresciana Armi S.p.A. (FABARM) and merchandised by Heckler & Koch. It was intended for civilian and law enforcement use.

The machined receiver is manufactured from lightweight Ergal 55 alloy and is drilled and tapped for scope mounting. Three of the four variants were sold with an attached Picatinny rail for mounting optics or accessories and the bottom forward edge of the forend is also drilled to accept an accessory rail. With the exception of the short-barreled model, FABARM shotguns are sold with their Tribore barrel which is a deep-drilled, machined barrel with three separate internal bore profiles. Beginning at the chamber and forcing cone, the bore is enlarged to .7401"" to soften recoil while the second profile is in the middle of the barrel gradually choking down to .7244"" to emulate a cylinder bore profile to increase velocity. The final bore is the FABARM choke system which consists of standard choking followed by a cylinder profile at the muzzle which serves to improve shot patterns and distribution.[3] The muzzle is threaded to accept one of five different chokes or a muzzle brake/compensator. Some models were sold with a ventilated barrel shroud.

Features of the weapon include a chrome-plated trigger, slide release, and shell carrier. There is also an oversized triangular push-button safety. The trigger group is held in the receiver by two pins which makes removal for cleaning and maintenance very easy. Some models have a flip-up frontsight (which serves as a low-profile sight when closed) while others have a small blade sight. Other models were issued with ghost-ring sights.[1]

The forend and buttstock are synthetic black polymer with the latter having a synthetic rubber recoil pad mounted on the end. One model was issued instead with a heavy wire gauge folding stock and pistol grip. Models were available with either a black anodized protective finish, matte finish, or were finished in carbon fiber."

Comes with Original case and all original accessories and two clips.  I really enjoy firing this guy and for those who enjoy light recoil, cheap ammo and fun the range this guy not only looks classy but also feels it at the range.  It's a perfect home defense weapon and a real joy to shoot.  I've owned Beretta's version (the 8000) and I must say I can't tell the difference between the two except I get a little better accuracy out of the Stoeger.  I mostly attribute this to being a later model and improved sights however could also be that I'm a more experienced shooter as well.  Nevertheless for the money - it's looks, accuracy and feel are hard to beat.  I've added a brief review below.

Also - I have a Taurus Millenium Pro PT145 in black .45 ACP.  She's a subcompact .45 at about 3"" and is an excellent choice for those who want stopping power, concealment and a cost effective solution.  I won't rant and rave over it's accuracy as to be honest I haven't shot it much being that the .45 ACP round is fairly expensive to practice with at the range.  However, I will only say that I haven't had a single FTF, FTE or FTFd over the 200 rounds and several years of ownership.  She simply eats everything I've put in it and asks for more.  You again really couldn't ask for a better gun for the money.  While looking fairly plain she does look pretty nice too considering the price.

Now for a quick FAQ:

Why are you selling?  ~ Simply put, I have over a dozen handguns in various calibers and don't have a single shotgun currently.  I'm not interested in a $1k shotgun and most my other pistols are $1k plus therefore it seems the most rational choice to offer up a trade in the $3-7 range to acquire one.  Also - being that I have quite a few semi auto's in the $1k and above range I have little money left for additional toys unless I'm looking for a divorce and even then it will likely cost me more.  :)

What are you interested in for TRADE?  ~ I'd entertain almost any SHOTGUN or REVOLVER in the $3-7 range for either one or both the aforementioned firearms up for trade.  I'm not afraid to add money or to receive it for various trades so don't hesitate to throw something out there.  Worst either can say is no.  I don't have a shotgun or a revolver and am interested in both.  Nothing in .22 please unless it's a Walther P22.

What are you asking for both?  ~ That's subjective however I'm very fair with all trades and don't want any more than a reasonable person is asking.  If you are looking for $500 for your trade citing another website for that price I'll generally apply the same website as a good reference for mine.  Please keep it honest and real as that is my full intention as well.

Where are you located and how far are you willing to travel?  ~ I am located in the North Fort Worth region near 820W/N.  I'm willing to travel 30 min in any direction for the right trade.  No shipping as it defeats the purpose for me.  I can walk down to Cabella's and trade in both guns to get a Mossberg 500.  I'm looking for a like minded individual as if we are to survive this fun game of trying out other guns we should stick together right?  Not to mention save money.

Any requirements?  ~ Yes, follow the law.  Nothing more or less.  FTF only and bill of sale is a MUST.  It protects both parties and again ensures Texas law is followed accordingly.  Any additional questions please don't hesitate to contact me."

Developed to improve precision and accuracy with any style or caliber of weapon, the Trijicon RMR (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) is designed to be as durable as the legendary ACOG. The RM06 is an LED sight powered by a standard CR2032 battery. Housed in rugged forged aluminum, the RMR is extremely tough yet lightweight. New easy-to-use adjusters with audible clicks allow for quick windage and elevation adjustments. 

With eight available brightness settings, the reticle can be manually adjusted by pressing the plus or minus buttons on either side of the unit. To switch to auto adjust mode simply press both buttons simultaneously and release. To save battery life turn the optic off by pressing both buttons simultaneously and holding for 3 seconds.

The Trijicon RMR is tougher than any alternative and suitable for military, law enforcement and hunting applications.

The CZ 2075 RAMI is a sub-compact semi-automatic based on the proven CZ 75 line of pistols. Just like the 75, the RAMI is double action/single action, allowing it to be carried in different conditions depending on the shooter’s preferences. Several safety devices are used including a firing pin block and a manual safety.

Incorporating the CZ double-stack magazine design, the little RAMI ships with a 10 round flush-mount magazine and 14 round extended magazine in the 9mm Luger version, or 7 and 9 round magazines in .40 S&W. A low capacity-compliant version of the 9mm is available with two 10 round magazines.

With a 3” barrel and an unloaded weight of less than 26 ounces, the black polycoat, alloy-framed RAMI is ideal for concealed carry.

The gun was built by Mean Metal Guns in Spring Valley, IL, and boy can they build a rifle!! This is by far one of the best rifles I have ever had the pleasure of shooting. This thing is just a tack driving machine out at long ranges and has killed many a critter since I've owned it. I originally bought the gun to do 3-gun competitions, but that adventure has been since put on the back burner. I use quick detach optics for my hunting and competition shooting, and the stuff holds zero! Here are some of the specs for the rifle:

>Seekins precision milled/ matched upper and lower.
>22 inch stainless steel bull barrel (capable of shooting 1/2 MOA groups)
>1:8 twist rate
>Will shoot 5.56 -OR- .223
>Rifle length gas system
>Standard 5 lbs 2-Stage trigger
>Mil Spec BCG and buffer system
>Seekins 13.5 in quadrail
>Oversized take down pins
>Oversized forward assist button
>Oversized Bolt release 
>Houge rubberized ERGO grip
>A2 synthetic stock
>BUILT IN AMBI BOLT RELEASE (the option that sold me on the rifle and is only available with seekins precision)

I have added and will include in the sale:
>Bravo Company GUNFIGHTER charging handle- MED size ($45)
>Spikes Tactical- Dynacomp muzzle break ($90)
>Magpul gen 2 AFG ($35)

>>>EOTECH, OFFSET IRON SIGHTS, AND BIPOD NOT INCLUDED IN SALE<<<

NIKON P-223 4x-12x precision AR optic with Spot-on BDC reticle (orig. $250)
Butler creek flip up lens covers (orig. $30 for both)

Again, if I didn't absolutely have to sell this gun I wouldn't ever consider it. I have approx. 1500-1750 rounds of high quality brass (HORNADY, PMC, OR LAKE CITY) through the gun with no failures. Gun was always thoroughly cleaned after every shooting session. This is not a safe queen, I actually believe in using my guns, so it does have some minor normal wear marks on it. I can pick this gun up any day of the week, and smoke a pop can size target out at 300 yards. This rifle is more than capable than going beyond that range, but my current shooting range is limited. Longest coyote kill shot was ranged at 250yards with Hornady 55 grain V-max ammo. 

You wont find this good of a deal anywhere else right now. Bought the bare rifle new a year and a half ago for $1700, only asking $1200 with add ons. Will negotiate a reasonable offer.

AAC's MODEL-7 rifle is chambered in the new 300 AAC BLACKOUT cartridge which offers an accurate, light weight, and compact package for hunting or target shooting. 

The action is made by Remington to AAC's specifications. It has all the features and safety you come to expect from a Model-7 action (a shorter version of the Model-700), A 20 MOA scope rail is mounted to the receiver using M24 type 8-40 screws. The X-Mark Pro™ trigger is factory set for 3.5 lbs and provides the feel needed for precision shooting. The barrel is a 5R 1:7 twist and threaded 5/8-24. A thread protector is included. The nitride surface of the barrel, bore, and chamber provide maximum service life and durability - longer than even hard-chrome but with the accuracy potential of a stainless barrel. Corrosion and wear resistance of the bore is extreme.

XDs-9
Is it possible for a pistol small enough to carry every day to have all the features and capacity that you’d expect in a larger pistol? If that pistol is the XD-S® from Springfield Armory®, the answer is yes. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack 9mm offers so much that you’ll be astonished that it all fits in the small, concealable profile.

The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol.  Use your XD-S® Single Stack with an X-Tension™ magazine and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Use a flush-fitting magazine when you carry it, and it shrinks such that you’ll forget it’s there.

If you’re looking for the most available capacity in the most concealable package, you should pick up an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack  in 9mm. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice size for capacity. Hold an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

The following is an excerpt from Wikipedia:
""The [DP-51] is a compact, lightweight pistol with an unconventional trigger mechanism called ""fast action"". The frame is composed of an aluminum alloy with a matte finish, while the slide is of blued steel.

The ""fast action"" trigger mechanism allows the hammer to be decocked while still keeping the mainspring compressed. A light pull on the trigger causes the hammer to flick back, after which the pistol would behave in conventional single-action (SA) mode.

The pistol can also be fired in conventional single- and double-action (DA) modes. The ""fast action"" mode allows the trigger travel of DA mode and the trigger weight of SA mode. This allows a more accurate first shot due to the lighter weight of the trigger. It is also safer due to the longer trigger travel required to fire the pistol. The factory magazines hold 13 rounds. Smith & Wesson 59-series magazines are compatible with the DP51 but will protrude slightly.

The pistol also has an ambidextrous safety and three-dot sights. It is also equipped with a firing pin block which (as its name implies) blocks the firing pin from moving forward unless the trigger is pulled."""

The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.

The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber. The SR9c is available with a glass-filled nylon frame and through-hardened slide in either a brushed stainless or black nitride finish. State compliant variations are available where necessary and ship with two 10-round magazines.

Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

The bottom of the frame is still dark, but the case coloring is all but gone. 

The forend and buttstock both had cracks that have been professionally repaired and the stocks have been refinished with a beautiful oil finish. cracks in the stocks of these guns was common. Buttstock cracks usually developed from the stock not being tightened down properly. There are a couple of small dings on the barrels, but nothing shows internally.

Overall, this is a fine example of a '50s gun (no serial number) and should give you a lot of pleasure in the field or at the range.

I'l take $325.00 for it picked up in Midtown Houston, or I will ship to your FFL for $35.00. I will consider firearms trade offers, but cash is king.

The CZ 75 P-07 Duty has unlike the overwhelming majority of pistols of the CZ 75 family the barrel locked into the ejection port. Defining the barrel height and its axis centricity is secured by the protrusion located at the rear section of the locking block. The slide handling facilitates eight clean-cut grooves. The original shape of the slide results from beveling of its upper lateral edges thus facilitating placing and withdrawing the handgun to and from holster. The slide carries sights, the front sight in longitudinal and the rear sight in transverse groove, with the sight radius extension made by elongating the rear sight visual area up to the rear edge of the slide. The integral part of the slide is of course also automatic firing pin block safety. Spent cartridge case extraction is provided by robust extractor placed on the right side of the slide. Ejection of cartridge case or any not discharged cartridge is facilitated by pretty large ejection port. The slide’s recoil spring is made of rectangular profile wire. The Duty model basic disassembly is essentially the same as for the standard CZ 75, so there is no tool necessary. In case of need for more thorough cleaning the trigger and firing mechanism can also be easily and in effect almost completely disassembled.

Nearly identical in size to the CZ 75 Compact, it weighs in at a full 1/4 pound lighter owing to its forged aluminum frame, making it more comfortable for everyday carry.

Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator. 

Also includes AKER OWB leather holster, and only has about 50 rounds down the pipe."

FROM THE MANUFACTURER:

JOSEPH TETI is a veteran of both US military and US government special operations units. He is a former Force Recon Marine, Army Special Forces “Green Beret”, and a former operator in a highly classified government counter-terrorist unit.
He is a combat veteran of both OIF (Operation Iraqi Freedom) in Iraq, and OEF (Operation Enduring Freedom) in Afghanistan. He planned and conducted a broad range of special operations missions covering the entire operational continuum. These missions gave the President of the United States an option when overt military and / or diplomatic actions were not viable or politically feasible. Operations of this nature required rapid response with surgical application of a wide variety of unique skills, while maintaining the lowest possible profile of U.S. involvement. He participated in numerous classified direct action missions with several Tier 1 SMU’s (Special Mission Units).
Joseph has performed high-risk PSD (Personal Security Detail) operations in Afghanistan and Iraq for U.S. government and civilian clients. He was also a member of a U.S. State Department close protection team assigned to several high profile government officials and visiting diplomats in Israel. Working out of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, and the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, he operated in high risk areas throughout the country to include Ramallah, Abu Dis, Jericho, The Gaza Strip and the West Bank. He has extensive experience and training in fully armored vehicle operations, advance team operations, motorcade operations, CAT (Counter Assault Team) operations and surveillance/counter surveillance operations.
A graduate of over 30 formal schools in regards to special operations, his skill sets and experiences are highly diverse. He has attended several survival schools over his career and is one of a few individuals in the world that hold an instructor certification in tactical tracking operations from legendary tracker and former Rhodesian SAS (Special Air Service) and Selous Scout,
David Scott-Donelan.

He has held a TOP SECRET-SCI with polygraph security clearance, the highest security clearance awarded by the U.S. government.

Glock 24C, 6"" long slide, ported, Gen2. .40S&W.  Not marked with ""c"" only G24, but is factory ported, serial matches on slide, barrel, frame.  All original with box, etc.  Have changed sights to solid black steel rear sight with wide notch, blackened dot on front sight.  Have sight tool and can change sights to stock, change front sight to Glock OEM steel front sight, etc.  Changed them to suit myself as I shot indoor GSSF with this.  Includes three, 10 round mags, which are perfectf or indoor GSSF as that sport limits loading mags to ten rounds, and with the 10 round mags one doesn't have to count his rounds, just reload.  Mags wearing blue baseplates to keep separate from full capacity mags.  Can include black baseplates if buyer wants to change them back.  Depending on offer can include some full capacity mags as well.  ALSO have Glock factory non-ported barrel, which is nice to have if using white dot front sight, as the 6"" guns are ported on top of the barrel, not the side, and gasses are expelled toward the front sight, turning it gray over the course of a match.  The non-ported barrel prevents this.

Condition is superb.  See photos.  (Please note the photos show the original sights.  Those have been replaced.) Factory competition trigger is nicely broken-in and and this pistol shoots beautifully.  The second generation frame fits any hand no matter your finger thickness or length as there are no fingergrooves on this one.  Additionally, you can drop a G22 or G35 slide on this frame if you prefer it and want a pistol the factory never offered.  I tried this with my Gen 3 G35 and it worked perfectly.  

Ohio sales only, prefer to sell to someone with ""good guy"" credentials such as a Concealed Handgun License, any law enforcement ID, military ID (along with OH residence ID of course), etc.  Will consider short travel to meet.  

I will consider offers.   No trades, sorry.
