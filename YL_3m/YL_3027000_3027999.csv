Parts list:
*Upper*
-Fulton Arms 16"" Dissipator Upper (About 1000 rds through it.  1:7 twist)
-Magpul MOE Handguards (Rifle Length)
-Daniel Defense Bolt/BCG
-BCM Gunfighter Ambi Charging Handle
-Magpul BUIS
-Primary Arms Aimpoint PRO clone (batteries dead)
-UTG Metal Foregrip

**Lower Receiver**
-PSA Lower
-PSA Lower Build Kit
-MagPul MOE Furniture

Rifle has about 150 rounds through the lower, and probably 1000 through the upper.  Always kept clean after shooting, and only used with brass-cased ammo.  

This is a Dissipator-style rifle.  It has a gas block under the handguards, and a false gas block further forward to mount the handguards and sights to.  This has the benefit of giving you a carbine-length (16"") weapon, with the sight radius and grip length of a rifle-length (20"") weapon.

I also have ammo available.  Montana Ammunition Company brass-cased 55gr - ~700rds @ $0.35 CPR

Make an offer.  Not really interested in trades unless it's for a CZ SP-01.

RIFLE DOES NOT COME WITH ANY MAGAZINES.  Does come with a rifle case, though!

I may or may not have some 20/30rd USGI (some teflon-coated, some not) rebuild kits with MagPul Anti-Tilt followers that I'll sell.  Price will depend on quantity desired."

Hard to find!

The Colt 9mm carbine is exceptionally well-suited for law enforcement organizations requiring a lightweight, compact, highly-concealable, for close confrontations. It is constructed with a modular rail system that allows for the easy mounting of ancillary devices, fires from a closed bolt, has a collapsible butt stock, and is easily field-stripped without the need for any special tools. The straight-line construction, coupled with the low recoil of 9mm ammunition, provides highly accurate fire with less muzzle climb, especially in rapid fire. Less recoil also facilitates ease of training and improves accuracy.

Description
M952V
The M952V Millennium® Universal WeaponLight attaches by means of an integral Swing-Lever™ rail clamp to long guns equipped with a Picatinny rail. It utilizes one sealed LED unit to produce both brilliant white light and invisible infrared radiation for use with night vision devices. The white beam is configured for close- to medium-range applications. Changing back and forth from white output to infrared output is accomplished by a push/twist action on the M952V head, which self-locks into the selected output mode. The tailcap switch assembly features a momentary/constant-on pushbutton switch and a momentary-on tape switch (7-inch cable) that attaches to your preferred location via self-stick Velcro® backing. Available in Black (BK) or Desert Tan (TN) body color.

I put a magazine tube extender on it and it now holds 10+1. You cannot hunt with the tube on but I was using it for practice. Look up the reviews, these are one of the best hunting Semi autos out there. I had a barrel clamp on it and apparently it was not tight enough and superficially scratched camo coating on the barrel when I fired it. I touched it up with flat military grade paint. Unfortunately on that same trip someone stole the hard case with the manual (free from Beretta), extra chokes ($10-$15) and stock forend cap and spring ($36). I am selling the gun alone with a soft case. My uncle paid $1400 new, I got it from him and put $100 tube extender on but I don't have the time to hunt and it is just taking up space in the safe. They go for $1000-$1400. Open to trades or multiple trades, no hi-points, antiques or junk, looking for a nice 357 magnum with a 4 inch barrel, Glocks, XD's, Sig, 1911, no bolt action or other hunting rifles.

Howdy,

I'm selling 2x VLTOR modular uppers WITH the forward assist that are brand new, never used. Both are in the box, one of them I unwrapped to check condition. I was going to build these into rifles but life had other plans.

I live in the Tri-Valley of the East Bay Area but go to San Jose during the week. We can meet at either end or in the middle. I prefer a FTF sale but I will ship at the buyer's expense.

The picture I attached is a stock picture; I will be taking and uploading pictures when I get home. Here is a link to VLTOR's site with their $200 + Shipping price tag:

745,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3027745,For Sale:  New Tac-Con 3MR Trigger,"Bellevue, Seattle, Washington",$ 450,"Listed On: Monday, May 5, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"For sale is a brand new Tac-Con 3MR 3rd Mode Drop-In Trigger.  These triggers are very easy to install without a gunsmith or any tools. The Tac-Con's semi-auto mode competes with any competition single-stage drop-in trigger with a 3-3.5 lb. pull weight. The third mode on the other hand allows for lightening fast rapid fire at a rate of roughly 600 rounds per minute. 

The technology enabling this rate of fire is a positive reset that dramatically reduces the split times between shots. The positive reset characteristic is achieved by transferring the force from the bolt carrier through the trigger assembly to assist the trigger back onto the front sear. As a result, this gives the firearm the fastest reset possible.

The links below provide some additional third party reviews as well as a short video highlighting the trigger's capabilities.

It is a Remington 700 action with a 26"" bull barrel cambered in 7mm-08.  The 7mm-08 is a cartridge born from the 308 necked down to .284. There are a few great advantages to this  the bullets used will have a higher BC( ballistic coefficient ). Which means the bullet flies farther, straighter, truer, greater velocity, high energy, and less recoil. It is ballistically far superior to the .308. I was able to shoot 3/4 moa with un-tuned loads very easily  this is a 1/2 moa gun at 100 yards easily.  It is set in a bell and Carlson A5 completely adjustable stock comb height, length of pull, and cant. Red hawk also installed a badger ordinance enlarged bolt knob, a talley 20 moa picatinny scope mount, lapped the bolt lugs, and tuned the trigger. This action is slick has been well taken care has only had 200 down the pipe. It comes with 1lb of imr4350, 40 rds of ammo, a set of RCBS dies, and assorted bullets"

I have everything that comes with the rifle new including manual, oil bottle, sling, cleaning kit, etc. I bought it brand new a week ago and like I said fired it once, 6 - 10 rounds to zero. Bought as a gift for my brother but he just picked up another 7.62 without me knowing. Comes with 680 rounds of Wolf 7.62x39. I'm selling it as a package, NO TRADES. FYI, this rifle is in brand new condition there's nothing wrong with it. The only thing worth mentioning is the folding stock does not stay latched when folded, it came like this from the factory and is common as I have had several other SLR models. It works perfectly when extended out in the firing position. Thanks!"
