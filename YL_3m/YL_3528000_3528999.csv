The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market.

The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

This will help you to be sure that you are not breaking any laws and that you will be able to use your body armor how you see fit. If you are caught purchasing or utilizing body armor in a locality where it is prohibited, you may have to suffer many significant consequences for your actions.
This product is not offered for sale or shipping to CT and is subject to the export control laws of the U.S. Government.
If you are a convicted felon and are caught wearing body armor, you will be subject to many legal ramifications. If you knowingly buy body armor as a convicted felon, you could end up in jail for your actions.WARNING:

No body armor is 100% bulletproof. Level III Plates are not designed to stop steel core armor piercing rounds (Level IV armor should stop most steel core armor piercing rounds). If you are shot with body armor on, it will hurt quite a lot. There might be plenty of bruising - no matter what. Also, you could suffer broken or fractured bones or even die due to an injury. Therefore, you should never purposefully be shot while wearing body armor because you will become injured to some degree - sometimes fatally. The armor may stop the bullet from hitting your body, but it won't stop all of the inertia from the bullet transferring to your body and causing some damage.

Equipped with a decocking lever, the PCR is designed to be decocked before holstering. After decocking, the trigger safety is much like that of a double action revolver. While there is no need to flip a safety lever off, the relatively longer and heavier trigger pull for the first round requires the conscious decision to pull the trigger before firing. Other additions to the PCR include rubber grip panels, serrated front and back straps for improved handling and a loaded chamber indicator."

Doesn't have to be pretty, and I'm willing to replace or paint the furniture so the wood doesn't have to be great.  What it does have to be is 100% functional and reliable.  

I'm admittedly shooting for a low price but I've seen them offered for this much or less so I figure I'm in the ballpark.  Would pay a little more for one that already has the extended mag tube; really not into pistol grips (especially the ones with no butt stock).  

Must be a 500 - no 88's (I want the tang safety on top).  Synthetic stock is better for my purposes, but wood's OK too.  

If you have one that meets these general parameters laying about that gets no use I promise it a good home.  I'm over 21 (for a while now), legal to buy, an Ohio resident, and have cash.  Feel free to email me via the system and I promise a response even if I'm not interested in yours."

The Spacesaver UWR completely prevents weapons from movement, vibration, shock and abrasion. All of our transport components passed accidental shock and load tests by keeping weapons safe and secure. The weapons storage system can be tilted 90 degrees in any direction without weapon becoming dislodged, or coming in contact with each other or with other components in the rack."

This is the Smith and Wesson Model 1000 M Chambered in a 3"" Full Choke 20 Gauge.
Smith & Wesson is well known for high-quality handguns, but it is not generally known that this firm also produced shotguns. A gas-operated autoloader called the Model 1000. The gun has pleasing lines and a generally attractive appearance. Both stock and fore-end are well-figured, dark brown walnut with a high-gloss polyurethane finish. Cut checkering on the pistol grip and fore-end is about 20 lines per inch and of generally excellent quality. Fitted to the stock are a black plastic buttplate and grip cap separate from the wood by white plastic spacers. A round plastic inlay in the grip cap bears the Smith & Wesson monogram in silver-color letters on a blue field.
It is light and easy to get on target. Great shotgun for the game bird hunter.

Listed for 2599 but give me your BEST OFFER! 

Please serious inquires only. No lowballs.  I'm not in a rush to sell.

I'm also interested in a Salient Arms International Tier 1 or possibly a Zev Tier 3 Glock 9mm (17, 19, or maybe a 34) or may be talked into a SAI S&W 9mm for trade.  But that's really it.  

As you see in the pictures, there's barely a turn line, so it seems like it's never been turned much either. I'm not the original owner. I bought it to start my collection, but I've found I'm not a collector! I would like to sell it to someone who'll really appreciate it.
(and use the money from the sale for a Salient Arms International or Zev Glock :o) 

Please look at all the pictures. I'm not a photographer but tried to capture all the angles I've seen listed by those who sell collector grade firearms on GB. If you need more Pictures, just send me a message and I'll get them to you ASAP. 

I don't have the box or any paperwork to go along with this Colt. 

I may regret this someday, but I've always been a slave to instant gratification and the thought of a ninja race gun in my hand on the range beats an amazing collector in my safe anyway of the week!! 

If FTF sale, you must have a SC ID plus be willing to sign a bill of sale.

 Email come to my phone too, so I can get back to you pretty quickly.  


If your from another state & need it shipped read on. Otherwise Thanks for looking!!

also listed on GB

ADMINISTRIVIA: Please make sure it is legal for you to own this firearm in your state. You're responsible knowing your own State's laws. Educate/Inform/Question yourself before you bid please because I'm selling as is/where is and final.  USPS Money Order Only and payment is expected w/i 7 days of auction close. I'll also need a copy of your FFL's license so I can show it to the Shipping-Nazi at my local fedex sorting facility. You're FFL must accept shipments from Non-FFL (that's me) and you'll have to pay for actual shipping cost as well. As you know because I'm not an FFL, shipping will be around $90 overnight air to your FFL via FEDEX as required by them. I've tried to price this collector's grade firearm fairly so I'm hoping someone who''ll appreciate it more than I do can grab this and add it to their collection or be the first one to fire it if that's more your style!!

The class is the NRA Basic Pistol / FL Concealed Weapons Permit class.  It covers safety, hands on classroom training, live fire training at the range, personal gun selection, cleaning/caring for a firearm and the laws/rules/procedures for the FL Concealed Weapons Permit. I also have a section of the class dedicated to personal defense with a firearm.  It is not necessary to own a firearm to attend the class as I have demo models.  If you own a firearm, I encourage you bring it to class so you can train with it.  We typically spend 3 to 3 1/2 hours in the classroom and about an hour on the range.  I hold the classes either at Homewood Suites Hotel Conference Room or Pensacola Indoor Shooting Range depending on availability.   My class is $85 per student and may be paid in cash, money order or local check.  Price includes class and all training materials.  Since we must complete live fire exercises there is an additional range fee of $15.  Additional charges apply if you wish to use a rental gun or purchase ammo.  Pensacola Indoor Shooting Range offers a large variety of rental guns if you wish to try out different models. Once you complete the class you will receive a certificate that satisfies the requirements for the FL CWP.  You then fill out an application, have your fingerprints and picture taken and submit the application.  The cost of the actual permit is $70 and the fingerprint / backround check is $42.  The permit is good for 7 years.

Has the poly handguard and original bipod. The bipod had some rust and missing paint when I got this upper, I wire brushed and oiled it to prevent further rusting. There is no rust on the upper, 57 rounds fired through it total.

The MkIII is the one with the fixed firing pin, so don't be nervous about the crap on the internet about these. The MkII and older had a problem with a mushrooming firing pin that would jam and hangup. The newer one has a differently shaped firing pin and also hardened.

I'll be including the clearanced bolt catch (so you can use your lower for the .50 BMG and your normal upper, the .50 would hit a stock bho catch) and Wolf heavy hammer spring, as well as the billet scope rings it came with - they'll fit 1"" or 30mm tubes.

Will add pics soon.
