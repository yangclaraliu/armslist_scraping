One of the issues with a 3 inch .45 lies in the variety of guide rod systems used. As the picture shows this pistol's guide rod group centers on a full length stainless unit (just like the best five inch pieces do). It is rock solid and it is all steel. They say this pistol has the best entry level trigger on a 1911... I'd guess it is at most five pounds. This gun is not just super accurate, but also shoots any kind of ammo you can think of. From 230 grain target, to JHP, to my brother's hot (and long) reloads, this one loads, shoots, and ejects them all. Comes with three seven round ACT-MAGS with ""half-pinkie"" bases (enough room for my big hands) and a Citadel hard case. I bought this piece, cleaned it up, and put some rubber double diamonds on it with stainless hex screws. Has a couple spots from being carried by previous owner, but its still in really nice shape. Feels great in the hand and tucks easy with an IWB. Not looking to trade right now, selling to fund another project. Text to: 614-nine hundred-5111 for faster response.

-The SAM7SF
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7SF. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its unique right-side folding tubular butt-stock to its 24x1.5mm muzzle threads with muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7SF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7SF rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7SF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequaled strength, precision and durability

The Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design
that tames the prehistoric characteristic that most revolvers possess. The
Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the
key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel
lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in
line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability""
while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both
recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target
faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of
ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing
any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the
typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. With choices from 2""
to 6"" barrel lengths and sight options, the Rhino is truly a multipurpose
handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking
game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single
action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed
hammer to prepare to fire.

RIS II Rail INFO
Daniel Defense is the Sole Source Provider of the RIS II to the United States Special Operations Command!

 The Daniel Defense Rail Interface System (RIS II) was designed at the request of the United States Special Operations Command (SOCOM) for the SOPMOD II program. SOCOM had a specific requirement for a free float M203 solution and Daniel Defense responded, designing a revolutionary product to meet the government’s need. The Daniel Defense RIS II allows the individual operator to free float the M203 grenade launcher without additional parts. As importantly, special tools are not required to mount the M203 grenade launcher. This was accomplished by integrating all of the needed parts to free float the M203 into the rail itself. The Daniel Defense RIS II is to be used in conjunction with the MK12 Low Profile Gas Block.

 The Daniel Defense RIS II free-floating Picatinny rail systems are designed to allow individual operator to quickly, and without special tools, mount M203 Grenade Launcher and precisely mount SOPMOD accessories to host weapon without effecting point of impact. The Daniel Defense RIS II is an innovative upgrade to the M4 platform and is available for commercial purchase directly from Daniel Defense or any authorized distributor

413,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3438413,For Sale:  Eberlestock G2 Gunslinger II Pack,"Claremore, Tulsa, Oklahoma",$ 250,"Listed On: Wednesday, September 3, 2014",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Eberlestock G2 ""Gunslinger II"" Pack .

The G2 is the latest evolution of the original GS05M Gunslinger pack, and both are in wide use by elite military, police, and civilians all over the world -- snipers, marksmen, and regular folks who appreciate the overwhelming utility and versatility of this product. It's a mid-sized pack with a full-width scabbard to better accommodate weapons with larger cross-sections or bulky optics. The wide scabbard also allows it to serve as an excellent laptop or military radio compartment, and because it's also wide at the bottom, users have the option of carrying weapons butt-down or butt-up. Like the G4 Operator pack, it features both front loading and top loading features, giving exceptional versatility and flexibility of use

The newest version of the G2 comes standard with our Intex-II frame system. The Intex-II is an Eberlestock innovation; it out-performs both traditional external frames and internal frames, and has the best qualities of both: the structure of an external frame without the noise and with minimal weight, and the close-ride and comfort of an internal frame pack. The Intex-II adds a new level of support and stability to the Gunslinger II, making it a compact and tough heavy-load capable pack. It can be interchanged with our Endo frame, as well as more compact, softer frames (sold separately and coming soon), or can simply be removed, which effectively reverts the pack back to the traditional G2 platform.

Drum is an olive green (not the bluish green post war Yugo color) there are no date, maker or Waffenamt marks visible, but there might possibly be beneath the very thick paint. When I purchased it, this drum came with two other drums and a carrier (these three items are not included or offered for sale), all over painted in the same olive green paint, the carrier was not marked, the other two drums were marked, one was “ddf” and the other had a very faint “WC 41”, almost unreadable due to the extremely heavy paint and apparently light marking strike. The olive green paint, I believe, is Norwegian, as the Norwegians reissued German MG34s and MG42s after WWII and painted them in this color. Beneath the olive green is Panzer grey, and beneath that is the red-brown primer, very commonly used by the Germans during the war. Overall, very good- excellent, used condition, inside of drum shows wear from use, much of the paint is gone, or the red-brown primer is showing, drum is very usable for a working firearm or for a display. Fifty round belt is NOT included. Stamped into the bottom is the characteristic arrow, seen in most all of the German manufactured drums (although some of the earlier ones were painted) Most Yugo drums did not have the arrows, the ones that did, had a very different, more simplistic, less detailed arrow stamped. Drum perfect and recommended for use in semi automatic and fully automatic MG34 and M42 machineguns. Drum can be used with some slight modification, with .308 – 7.62x51 NATO ammunition (I added three layers of thick cardboard to the bottoms of mine to space the .308 out to  properly feed).

Only interested in a high end desktop computers. Mainly interested Alienware products. Minimum of 16GB of ram and i prefer a setup with a SSD and a HDD, Gigabit ethernet.. etc.. . Just let me know what you have and ill let you know if i am interested. I will try and respond ASAP!!!

I'm not interested in laptops at this time. 

The AR Pistol in the picture is not part of the deal, but i would part with it for the right trade offer. The trade offer for the entire setup goes for HIGH END COMPUTERS AS WELL AS FIREARMS. If you are offering a computer for the entire setup you need to be realistic that this item will hold its value much longer than a computer will. 

Firearm trades must be in the area of $3000 trade offer. I will listen to any and all offers.

I will ship any where this item is legal. I will pay for shipping as well. Remember this AR is considered a pistol. So you must be 21 to accept this item at your FFL as far as i know. OR no FFL required to ship the ACOG or RMR.  Email me if you need specs on these items. Honestly I don't think I'll find a computer worth the entire trade value. So mainly looking to trade the acog. Like alienware aurora r4.. Also have many other AR items I can trade!

Distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and forearm, in place of conventional checkering, provides a positive gripping surface and complements the innovative engineering of the Nova Tactical. Dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, allows the Nova Tactical to handle everything from light loads to 3-1/2"" magnums. A magazine cut-off on the forearm allows for safe carry with a full magazine and empty chamber.
The Benelli Nova Pump Tactical is one of the most versatile pump-action shotguns ever made.

Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes conventional gas-operated action with annual (ring-type) gas piston, which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip. Standard sights include front post, installed on the M16-style removable base, and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight.

Set up for SAS cowboy type shooting by previous owner. Barrel cut down to 23"" or so. Modified to accept screw in chokes. Comes with a colonial arms flush fit modified choke. Action has been worked on so it works very smoothly. If you are looking for a collectors item this is probably not the gun for you due to the modifications. However if you are looking for a unique classic shotgun this is an awesome and very versatile shotgun.
The only issues with the gun are: the bluing is worn especially around the bottom of the mag tube, few scratches on the stock but the grain is beautiful, and the slide release is takes a special touch. It works, but sometimes you have to push is just right. You should be able to see the cosmetic issues in the pictures. Nothing out of the ordinary for a gun this age. 
I do not really want to get rid of this gun but my safe is getting full again and I want to fund some new toys. 
Make a cash offer or let me know what you have to trade. Looking for a new 1911. Preferably 3"" model or lightweight model. Ruger 1911 5"" or commander. Ithaca 37. Remington 870 tactical or something similar."

Yeah it sucks but everybody knows they aren't worth what we paid because we were duped, and lets not forget now we shot those guns and mags so THEY ARE USED. And that's exactly what happened. Remember the first time the big O ran for office? We all scrambled to buy black guns then too and apparently we didn't learn, or maybe we did... every price gouging ass hole on here has sent me hate mail telling me how the end of black guns still hangs over our heads. Thats pretty funny because I would be willing to bet my hard earned money if you go to any gun store, and I dont mean Buds or centerfire but get off your lazy ass and go to a real gun store you will see brand new guns  for far far less than these fucktards are trieing to tell you their used guns are worth. I've been talking with many gun store owners who don't understand why nothing is selling and yet heres these ass holes in the classic sense of the meaning of asshole wondering why they cant double their money on their DPMS with a Wal-Mart red dot... but it comes with a box of steel case bull shit ammo... oh let me reconsider! 
 I've pulled my listings and I suggest that anubody with a backbone at all follow me and walk away from this bullshit. I am pulling my ads from every online marketplace starting tonight and continuing on the rest tomorrow and will not advertise for the next month. Maybe just maybe I can get enough of you guys to follow my lead. I can live without selling or trading for one month to discourage these bottom feeders from praying on the ignorant for one month. We can do this by  thwarting the shit bags by posting links to new guns at lower cost than these shit bags post their used crap. Anybody with me or has this site completely fallen into a sham? Lets see what we get or if everyone just throws in the towel and lets the gouging bastards win."

767,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3438767,For Sale:  Ruger Redhawk .44 magnum package,"Birmingham/Warrior/Cullman, Birmingham, Alabama","$ 1,000","Listed On: Wednesday, September 10, 2014",Handguns,Ruger                                                                                ,44 Magnum                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Revolver,"Ruger Redhawk, .44 Rem Magnum, 7.5"" barrel. It comes with the following: 
* Hogue Monogrip
*Weigand Picatinny no-tap scope mount
*NC Star 2.5x30 eye relief scope with adjustable illuminated reticle 
*Two HKS speed loaders
*Nylon holster rig
*Bulldog speed loader pouches
*leather thumb-break holster
*Ruger box with the original grips and iron sights
*Scope box with instructions, spare battery, and spare rings
*262 rounds of Winchester 240 grain jacketed soft point
*20 rounds of Winchester Partition Gold 250 gr hunting ammunition
*+/- 5 boxes of once fired brass.
This set up has everything you need and nothing you don't and yeah, the NC Star scope does the job, but it was a placeholder until I bought a Leupold or Simmons to replace it. Anyone who knows Ruger's big revolvers knows that Bill Ruger engineered the Redhawk for hand-loaders to use maximum SAAMI pressures on it and the revolver's a rugged beast. I've shot around five boxes and it handles well with manageable recoil. I traded for it and set it up for hunting, used it last season, and now I'm back in university full-time, so I know I'll not have the time in the next two years.
With this package, I value it at $1,000 cash or $1100 trade. Trade options include Sig/Sauer, Walther, Heckler and Koch, Steyr, and CZ pistols only. I have absolutely zero interest in anything Taurus as I already own the only two Taurus models I've ever wanted and no interest in Ruger pistols. I do have some interest in select S&W revolvers or possibly a S&W99.
Anyway, just message me, the worst I can say is ""no"" and I don't have to sell it, but it's just been gathering dust and with hunting season coming up, I thought someone may be able to put it to proper use."

This holster is priced at $69.75, plus taxes, and shipping and handling charges. Priced at $60, this holster is a steal. It's already broken in, you don't have to deal with taxes or extra charges, or an insufferably long wait time to have it shipped to you. For $60 you get a high quality holster delivered to you in essentially hours instead of weeks or months.

These are Russian made AK's and have now been banned from importation.  This is by far the best quality and most heavy duty AK that you can buy.  I have both Saigas and Veprs and the Vepr's quality blows Saiga out of the water!  Molot is the Russian factory that produces the RPK Machine guns.  The Molot Vepr AK74 has a 50% thicker receiver than the standard AK as well as a heavy barrel and side scope mount.  

It has a factory threaded barrel and has been tapped for a bullet guide but does not have one installed.  The wood on this is beautiful and the Vepr thumbhole stocks are the best feeling and quality stock of any AK out there.  This comes with both a factory 5 and 10 round magazine.

The 5.45x39 round is the very flat shooting round that the Russians developed the AK74 for and is what they used in Afghanistan.  The Afghanis called it the poison bullet because it was so devastating!  The bullet drop on this is only 6 inches between 100 and 300 yards!

I am asking for 750 dollars for this lightly used Vepr or will trade for a comparable quality AK in 7.62x39."

The Micro-Blaster IIx3 will allow users to break much larger masses of rock or concrete than with just the single head models. 

Users will need to supply a source of compressed air or CO2 (minimum 75 psi, 7 gallon portable air tank recommended) to trigger their systems. If working in remote areas a ""T"" handle bicycle pump and our 1/2 gal aluminum air tank will allow for a very portable triggering system. Note that you will need to outfit your air source with a quick coupler (1/4"" Industrial Interchange) to connect to the hose on the MB IIx3 Manifold/Valve to your air source.
