This rifle does have a Finnish (Terni) stamp on the barrel.  If you're not familiar with the Carcano model 38, it's the rifle that Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly used to assassinate JFK (though his was chambered in the more common 6.5x52mm).  These rifles have a lot of history and have been used to fight wars from World War II up to recent events like the Libyan Revolution of 2011.

This rifle has been been drilled and tapped for a scope mount, and includes a detachable Weaver mount and scope (the scope is a low-end model and should really be replaced if you plan on hunting with this rifle).  

As far as I can tell, the only things missing from this rifle are the bayonet and lug, the sling, cleaning kit, and a small screw that holds the rear sight from moving (I'm not sure if the sight is accurate as I've never used it).  

Also included are two full boxes of milsurp ammo on en block stripper clips (6 clips total), and another box of loose milsurp ammo (58 rounds in all).  Please keep in mind that this ammo is very old, and while it's still functional, you may encounter an occasional dud.  I've personally fired this rifle roughly 100 times and have had 6 rounds that did not function properly.  New ammo for this rifle is available online for around $24 for a box of 20.

Its clear your lack of education is the bane of your existence. Its called supply and demand. Low supply equates to higher demand and that is what sets the true value. I know for a fact stores like bimart are getting less then 10% of their normal quantitys of .22lr.  If you want to make a real difference, spend your days making trips to Bimart, Fred Meyer, Dick's, Sportsmanship Warehouse and if you're lucky enough to get a box or two put them on armslist and sell for what you paid. Then and only then might you be an arms list hero. Besides there are several other sites to sell firearms and ammo than armslist so your current efforts are futile. Oh...and don't claim to know my political party. I believe the two party system is for the sheep in this country who can't think.

My response to this scalper:

Indeed, there are other sites for thieves and worthless low life scalpers like yourself to use. If my efforts were so futile, filthy scalpers like yourself wouldn't bother responding to my suggestions. I will keep flagging your ripoff scalper's prices, and take solace in the fact that it bothers at least some of you scalpers to some degree. I have what I need in my gun safe. I'm no hero, just an American, sick of filth like you, trying to rip people off. Take your sorry worthless ass out and get a job, and you would not be able to scalp up all the ammo as soon as it's put out at the places you mentioned. Worthless scalpers like you are the reason this ammo shortage continues, and your lord obama appreciates you for it, I'm sure."

There is a gold figure of Alcatraz, the Warner Brothers logo and the Golden Gate Bridge. Included with the gun is a plaque describing the design which was made by Condon with the gun (see photos).

The LadySmith version of Smith's model 3913 is referred to as the 3913LS. It has a stainless steel slide with an aluminum alloy frame. The 3913LS had a different look to the slide and frame, that appeared to some to be ""racier"". It is chambered for 9mm only. It has a 3.5 inch barrel and the magazine holds eight rounds.[4] It is one of their third generation semi-automatic pistols that S&W refers to as a ""traditional double action"". This refers to a mode of operation wherein the first pull of the trigger is longer and heavier, and causes the hammer to rise from its resting position and then fall to strike the firing pin and fire the cartridge in the chamber. After the pistol fires that first time, the pistol is in what is called ""single action"", wherein the hammer stays cocked and subsequent trigger pulls are much shorter and lighter. The safety/decock lever on the side of the slide can be lowered which will (a) safely drop the cocked hammer, and (b) prevent the pistol from firing by disconnecting the trigger and by rotating a block between the hammer and firing pin. It is the firing pin block that makes dropping the hammer with the decocker safe, albeit somewhat unnerving. The original 3913 has been popular with law enforcement officers that need to carry their primary sidearm concealed.[citation needed] The Lady Smith is very flat because it has a single-stack magazine and only a single thumb safety on the left side compared to the two-sided ambidextrous safety on the frame

The CZ 52[1] (also known by the Czechoslovakian military designations vz. 52, for ""model of 1952"", and CZ 482) is a semi-automatic pistol designed by two brothers, Jan and Jaroslav Kratochvíl, in the early 1950s for the Czechoslovakian military. Around 200,000 vz. 52s were made by Česká Zbrojovka in Strakonice from 1952 to 1954. The vz. 52 replaced the 7.65 mm Browning caliber (.32 ACP) Vz.50, which had acquired a reputation for unreliability and was underpowered for its role as a military service sidearm. After 30 years of military service, the vz. 52 was eventually replaced by the 9×18mm Makarov caliber vz. 82. Cz-USA began importation into the US market in January 1998 with the designation CZ 52.

With a heavy heart I have decided to sell my M1 Garand. After many trials and failures I have come to the conclusion that my eyesight has deteriorated too much to be able to shoot it with the consistency that I should have. I have been mulling it over for some time and this is what I am going to do. I am not a gun collector and have no desire to have guns that I do not shoot or shoot well. My loss your gain.
I bought this rifle from the CMP as a Springfield Special grade. This grade is sold out and not accepting orders. Other Special grade rifles are listed for $995. You can see the description [url=http://www.thecmp.org/sales/m1garand.htm#Special]http://www.thecmp.org/sales/m1garand.htm#Special[/url] 
I have had the rifle for 5 years, it is a great shooter and a great looker. Finish is good wood is beautiful with some use marks. The top hand gard has a small repair from where it cracked somehow, barely noticeable, but wanting to disclose all.  CMP case included. This is an excellent functioning and shooting rifle, no surprises. I am an Instructor here in IN. for the Appleseed Program.

After 30-plus years of making history, the powerhouse rifle that started it all is still leading the pack. With its low felt recoil and self-loading action, the Model 82A1 offers rapid, accurate firepower that never slows down.

For more than three decades, the Model 82A1 has been carefully honed, studied and then refined again. The result is a feat of engineering so infinitely precise it is hard to believe it's man-made.

As the first and only semi-automatic .50 caliber rifle available, the Model 82A1 continues to blaze new territory. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments. The muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make this iconic rifle comfortable and exciting to shoot.

The CZ 52 (also known by the Czechoslovakian military designations vz. 52, for ""model of 1952"", and CZ 482) is a semi-automatic pistol designed by two brothers, Jan and Jaroslav Kratochvíl, in the early 1950s for the Czechoslovakian military. Around 200,000 vz. 52s were made by Česká Zbrojovka in Strakonice from 1952 to 1954. The vz. 52 replaced the 7.65 mm Browning caliber (.32 ACP) Vz.50, which had acquired a reputation for unreliability and was underpowered for its role as a military service sidearm. After 30 years of military service, the vz. 52 was eventually replaced by the 9×18mm Makarov caliber vz. 82. Cz-USA began importation into the US market in January 1998 with the designation CZ 52.

Nothing major or harmful of course. It's just not 100% perfect even though it's straight from the factory. Note that the last photo with the Glock 26 is just for size comparison. Glock 26 isn't for sale. Asking $625 for the G34 and everything it came with from the factory. You can't even get a black one for this cheap. You'll need permit to purchase or carry and we'll sign a bill of sale which I'll provide. I know all that is not required. I'm a man of overkill so I like to be a bit more sure I don't sell a firearm to a felon and get myself in to trouble. Unless you have a Glock 17L I'm not interested in trades."

This is a GREAT opportunity to get something for cheap since the LEO will NOT compensate people that are turning their weapons/ammo in at all.  Below is the official flyer for the event.

On Saturday, May 10, 2014, the Lincoln Police Department’s Center Team, in cooperation with NeighborWorks Lincoln, is conducting a Gun Amnesty Day. The purpose of the event is to offer citizens the opportunity to drop off any unwanted firearms and ammunition. The effort is completely anonymous, no questions asked.  The goal is to remove unwanted firearms and ammunition from circulation.

From 11 a.m. – 1:30 p.m., personnel will be on hand to take possession of any unwanted, legal or illegal firearms and ammunition. Citizens are encouraged to bring those items to the NeighborWorks Lincoln parking lot - located on the northwest corner 23rd & Q Streets. No identification will be requested, no identification is required, no questions asked. No compensation will be given for any firearms or ammunition surrendered.

Firearms should be transported in the trunk or back seat of a vehicle in an open box, bag or container. Once at the drop off site tell the person that contacts you at your vehicle where the firearm is located and let them retrieve the firearm.  It is preferred that firearms be surrendered unloaded and any breaches, slides, bolts, cylinders or actions should be open. However, if citizens are not familiar with how to unload their firearm and attempting to do so would create a hazard, transport the firearm to the site and inform the person that contacts you at your vehicle that the weapon may not be unloaded."

The Henry Pump Action Octagon .22 rifle joins faded jeans, Mom’s apple pie, a restored ’57 Chevy as an all-American icon. Now fitted with a blue octagonal barrel, it resurrects the great old days of the traditional shooting gallery. The Henry Pump Octagon, available in calibers .22LR or .22 Magnum, is one gun that is built for fun.

It also sports a grooved receiver for mounting a scope, and Marbles semi-buckhorn fully adjustable rear sights with standard 3/8″ dovetail slots enabling you to change sights if you choose to do so. Beautifully finished American walnut is used for the stock. The .22LR version can hold 15 rounds of .22LR and as much as 21 rounds of .22Short. The capacity of the .22 Magnum is 12 rounds. If you must extract an unfired cartridge from the chamber, we have included a grooved release button at the right front of the trigger guard. When pressed back, the lever unlocks the forend allowing it to be retracted to eject the unfired round.

Shooting the Henry Pump Action rifle may be more fun than most people deserve to have. But we won’t tell."

Executive Carry is the Executive Elite modified for carry. for those who prefer a commander size 1911, but insist on complete reliability of a traditional front bushing rather than a machined bull barrel. slide is minimum possible (4.25"") without significantly impairing the legendary reliability of the 5"" slide. frame has Bobtail housing which reduces the projecting butt of the mainspring housing without sacrificing the full size frame and magazine capacity. Bobtail minimizes the print under your jacket when carrying and reduces weight. Unpopular 3 inch Officer's frames reduce magazine capacity and limit grip, while keeping the projecting, sharp butt. Slides shorter than 4.25"" are notorious for reduced reliability. These problems are eliminated with the Commander Bobtail configuration. 25 LPI checkered frame and ""half checkered"" Bobtail.

This rifle shot under 1 MOA as seen on the test target from the factory. Cash only, no trades.

The PredatOBR 7.62 (AR-10) was designed for those who are searching for a hybrid cross between the standard OBR and PredatAR 7.62x51 Rifles. The PredatOBR takes the highly accurate OBR 7.62 design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least-possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for.

The most remarkable feature of the PredatOBR is its ability to be completely “broken down” and stored into the optional Rollup Bag and Toolbox. The PredatOBR handguard has a locking stainless steel QD Lever system on each side. Once the levers are released, the handguard slides off of the upper assembly in seconds. The PredatOBR's barrel can easily be removed with the supplied PredatOBR Barrel Wrench, unscrew the Barrel Nut from Receiver and pull the Barrel Assembly free from Receiver. No need to remove the gas tube, gas block or muzzle device. Reverse the process to reinstall. Hand-tighten Barrel Nut and torque approximately 1/8-turn past hand-tight (Approximately 40-50 foot pounds). Once reassembled correctly, the point of impact (POI) shift will be 0.0 to 0.5 MOA of the original.

PredatOBR barrels are chambered in 7.62x51mm, and feature rifling in a 1/10 twist rate. All barrels are threaded in 5/8 x 24. Like the OBR and PredatAR riles, LaRue has eliminated the conventional AR barrel nut and bolt the handguard directly to the proprietary upper receiver, creating a true “free-float” barrel. The handguard does not touch the barrel or barrel nut at any place. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though it has been lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy.

The PredatOBR has threaded stainless-steel hard-points over the entire length of the handguard at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions. These hard-points have an integral spine built-in for structural support. Provided with the system are three 3-inch MIL-STD-1913 rail sections that can be positioned anywhere along the handguard, per operator preference. These rail sections are attachable/detachable using a supplied tool (Torx® T-15 wrench). The rail sections are CNC-machined from billet aluminum. This robust solution provides a perfect precision mounting space for aiming lasers, illumination and bipods.

The PredatOBR's Port Selector Technology™ (PST) gas block is adjustable, to aid in the optimum function when using a sound suppressor. This special gas block contains a dual port mechanism that is operated by rotating a lever from one side to another. When the lever is rotated to the right-side of the rifle, the gasses are reduced, to compensate for the extra blowback created by the suppressor. When rotated to the left side, the gasses are increased for use without a suppressor.

The LaRue Tactical 6-position Retract Action Trigger (R.A.T.) Stock comes standard with every PredatOBR. It is ergonomic, has protected control surfaces and contains a set of cleaning rods in an internal compartment. Since the height of the 12 o’clock rail is at the optimum position, there is no need for a cheek riser as part of this system.

Suppressor Compatibility:
LaRue 7.62 rifles with Port Selector Technology (PST) have been optimized for best-performance with SureFire suppressors. We understand that there are dozens of 7.62 suppressors to choose from on the market at this time. We feel that SureFire suppressors fall somewhere in the middle-range in regards to effect of performance with gas-operated rifles. Many users have met with success operating different models of their choice. Combined with variables in ammunition, 7.62 suppressor owners have experienced a large spectrum of conditions (much greater than seen with 5.56 suppressors). This range of variables is easy to manage with a bolt-action 7.62, but with a gas-operated system it is not. While we made a concerted effort to design a gas system that will work with a wide range of suppressors, we can not guarantee proper-function with suppressor hardware other than SureFire.

About the “Black Gold” Trigger:
We are very proud to announce that we’ve selected the American Trigger Corporation AR Gold trigger to be installed in LaRue PredatOBRs going forward. These are a single stage trigger with take-up and a super short reset, similar in feel to a best-grade 1911 trigger, providing the optimum trigger action for a wide variety of shooting styles and disciplines. AR Gold Triggers have been used by some of the best competition shooters in the world for the last few years and dominate the top of the 3 Gun competition world.

We have been testing and evaluating these triggers for well over a year, to ensure that they're up to our standard of quality. Our evaluation has shown the AR Gold to be magnificent and we're proud to include them as part of our new product line. One thing that is unusual about these triggers installed in our LaRue PredatOBRs, is they are treated with an IonBond black instead of American Trigger’s normal IonBond Gold. This is a custom color that is only available on LaRue Tactical rifles."

Gun will include the original box, 2 17 round magazines, and everything else that was included in the original box. 

I did upgrade it with BT Taco guide-rite bushing. Will include the stock spring retainer as well. I don't think it really made a difference but it is an upgrade. Will also include a reduced power firing spring for a light trigger, but will have the stock spring installed. 

Bought it this year. Graduating soon and need the extra cash. Plus the wife says I have to.

Complete with cleaning kit in buttstock.  Was fired 50-100 rounds.  Selling off duplicates in my hand picked collection.

Barrel is bright.   The bolt had grease on them before I cleaned them. The magazine follower did not appear to have been loaded.  The stock and mag is in great surplus shape with minor bumps and scratches.  Overall, they rifles look surplus refurb new and only fired a few times.  

Yes, I know you might find a SKS rifle for $100-$150 cheaper, but they are nowhere near the condition of this SKS. This is Zasatava factory stamped and you might agree they are one of the finest versions of the SKS rifles ever made. 

Prefer cash.
