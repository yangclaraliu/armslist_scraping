This would make an awesome first rifle for a kid, or a good plinker. The stock was originally gray, I got bored this winter and did a TERRIBLE rattle can job on it, but it doesn't affect the functionality of the weapon. Looking for $100 for the rifle, it has had probably 500 rounds through it, never had a problem, I kept it cleaned and lubricated and took care of it. I have owned it for less than a year, bought it at Cannon Air Force Base in New Mexico when I got out. 

$100 gets you the rifle, scope, 10 round magazine, a bunch of cleaning stuff including a bore snake, and a tupperware full of .22LR ammo, probably between 100 and 200 rounds, not entirely sure, but they are all Remington brand rounds as well as a few boxes of Aguila hollow points.

The scope is the stock Remington one that came with the rifle. It is horrible, to be honest, but it is better than nothing, although it is almost impossible to zero (it could just be my incompetency at zeroing).

It has zero issues hitting six inch plates at 200 yards. It also has the new bolt carrier that Ruger designed to fix carrier tilt along with a special anti-tilt buffer. It comes with the full length, free floated quad rail made by Troy. The feed ramps are M4 profile. The barrel is outstanding. It is a fluted, cold hammer forged, chrome lined barrel. It also has the flash suppressor built right into the barrel, making it a true carbine length upper at 16.1"" long.

The bolt carrier group is chrome and is of a one piece design. The piston and push rod are also chrome as well. The gas regulator on this rifle is four position -- ideal if you plan on running a can on the end of the muzzle.

The 5.5"" Super Blackhawk is considered to be the most well-balanced of the Blackhawk barrel lengths and has a rounded trigger guard. Be aware that the ""dragoon"" style trigger guard on other Super Blackhawks are notorious for beating your knuckles to pulp.

This is a revolver I purchased new approximately two years ago and have gotten much enjoyment from. I've decided to sell it only because I do not have reloading gear for this particular caliber. The revolver has been meticulously cared for and I hate to see it go.

It has had roughly ~200 rounds fired through it and has always been cleaned immediately afterwards.

The only blemish I can find is that it is starting to develop a slight turn line on the cylinder as all revolvers do.

The pictures included are the actual firearm.

This is a great opportunity to own the most popular configuration of a legendary revolver at a great ""almost new"" price.

Let me know if you have any questions.

The original case and all original paperwork comes included, just as if you bought new.

Desperate for firearms during WWI, the French re-arsenaled many of their old Gras rifles by fitting new barrels in the then-new 8mm Lebel. This is one of those rifles. These saw service even beyond WWII throughout Europe and the old French colonies around the world. This is an above average example with excellent bore and a correct sling, cleaning rod, and bayonet (sorry, no scabbard). This is a good shooter and the ammo is still available with searching. I have two of these and am selling one to finance more old blackpowder cartridge rifles. Would consider a trade toward an 1873 Springfield Trapdoor or an 1871 Mauser."

 For those confused about preban and why they are valuable. Here in the  state of Massachusetts  we have an assault weapons ban to contend with. If you have a newly manufactured rifle you can't have things like an  flash hider , you have to have a muzzle break or compensator  pined and welded on, you can't have a collapsible butt stock or bayonet lug but if the lower receiver  was manufactured before 1994 it is grandfathered in and I can have all of those evil features that you can't have on a post ban rifle."

Thank you to everyone who has responded.  If payment is not received, I will notify everyone who sent me an inquiry about this gun.

This is a beautiful 16-Gauge Browning A-5 ( 5-shot ) Semi-Automatic Shotgun.  This gun was made in Belgium in 1931 based on the serial number and barrel notations.  It has a modified choke (per the ** engraving).

You will see in the pictures that the engraving on this shotgun is fantastic.

This has always been a hunter's gun.  You can see some wear on the bluing but nothing major, and there are some cosmetic marks on the stock.  However, this gun is completely functional and shoots great.

This was my Dad's gun and he passed a couple years ago.  He absolutely loved this gun and running with his dogs.  I hate to see it go to waste.  If you're looking for a great reliable gun that has some natural eye-catching beauty, this is it!

Note: This is my very first posting here on Armslist.  I will communicate well with you and I will treat you fairly.  I had the gun looked at in a local gun shop, and they told me the gun should sell for $500 easily, and he showed me the value in a book that showed it should bring between $500 and $650.  I'll let it go to a good owner for the $500 I'm asking.  Price is firm at this though.

I will accept cash, cashiers check or money orders only for this.  I cannot accept credit, since I'm an individual seller.  Contact me to make arrangements.

Looking to pay up to $200 total, but higher asking price may be considered, depending on manufacturer and model, carry case or equipment included, ammo included, or LNIB finish and overall appearance/condition.  Email only please; can meet in southern half of Indiana, preferably along I-65 corridor, if interested.  Sorry, nothing to trade at this time."

Israeli Military manufactured ammo that features a dark gray tipped bullet loaded with a Tear Gas agent.  

Based on what I was able to find - this ammo was produced in extremely limited quantities for a few months back in 1961.  

It was  designed to be able to deliver a dose of tear gas at much greater ranges than the larger caliber gas launching guns of the day were capable of (typically limited to about 150 yards). 

The idea was to shoot at a hard surface near the intended target thereby releasing the Tear Gas agent. 

Ammo comes in it's original factory box and is in excellent (near perfect) condition.  

There are 20 rounds in the box that are loaded on four 5 round stripper clips.  

The ammo you see in the pictures is what you get. 

Primers are sealed with a purple color military sealer. 

This ammo is ever bit as deadly as any standard military ball round so it's not a novelty and must be treated with the same care as any live 7.62x51 ammunition. 

Price is $160 with pickup in the Brandon area. Shipping is available via UPS ground. Actual cost will be determined by your location. You must be at least 18 years old to purchase."

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.

The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

Price is $249 plus tax.

Goliath Targets are .22-Sensitive Binary Exploding Targets.  Compared to other .22-sensitive Targets on the market, I have tried to make these both as loud and safe as possible.  Each package comes with seven foldable stand-alone targets, a bag of catalyst, a mixing container with the other necessary composition, a scoop, and directions for use.  Because these are shipped as completely inert, with the explosive components chemically separated, the purchaser is legally considered the manufacturer of the explosive and I am able to ship both safely and at regular “Ground” rates without any Hazardous Materials Fees.  Each target does contain cardboard and a minute fire hazard, so do not shoot them where a fire-warning is in effect.  Tannerite Targets are the only fire-free alternative for those worried about starting a forest fire, but they are not .22-sensitive."

First of all, yes ma'am, it will slam. Just like the Model 97 and the early Ithaca Model 37s, the Model 12 was never built with a trigger disconnect, so it is slam-fire capable.

Second, it is a true takedown weapon. The Winchester Model 12 breaks at the receiver, so the mag tube and the barrel come off together. The net effect is that the package breaks into two short, neat pieces:  the barrel/mag tube at 19 inches, and the buttstock and receiver at a little less. Both will fit neatly into your bugout bag. 

Which brings me to my final point.

This is a 1954 12-gauge, American-made pump-action shotgun, made of real walnut and blued steel. The only plastic in the whole damned gun is the buttplate, with Winchester proudly embossed in it. This isn't a Ruger 10/22 takedown. If you're serious enough to pack a bugout bag, you might as well put a serious weapon in it. 

Anyway, I'm interested in trades, plus or minus some cash. Specifically, a bolt gun; I have a warm spot for sporterized Mausers, especially 7x57 or 6.5mm. I also collect vintage Mossberg 22s and would gladly consider a Mossy 42m, 44, or 144LSB. Side by side doubles, especially old Ithacas or Fox Model Bs are welcome. Shoot me an offer; the worst I can say is no thank-you. If you've got nothing to trade, $400 cash would be acceptable, and you pay for the NICS. I have two FFLs kind enough to do them for the mandated $10."

Les Baer is still the king of custom built 1911 pistols in addition to being a well known aficionado of high performance American muscle cars. That’s why Les named his newest 1911 model after the Boss 429 Mustangs he admires above all other cars.

Boss is guaranteed to shoot 3” groups at 50 yards.

If you're looking at this ad, you know the quality of this rifle.  I bought this rifle as a starter for my kids as they were growing up.

Les Baer is still the king of custom built 1911 pistols in addition to being a well known aficionado of high performance American muscle cars. That’s why Les named his newest 1911 model after the Boss 429 Mustangs he admires above all other cars. Like our entire pistol line, our newest .45 is based on our popular Premier II, but it has enough thoughtful extra touches to really make it the new Boss of custom .45s.  the new Boss is guaranteed to shoot 3” groups at 50 yards.

Change caliber, frame size, you name it.   Subcompact version in 9mm with night sights.  I got this because it has a lighter DAO pull to the P290RS and is close to the same size and cost a bit less.  Also, were I to be interested in switching to a .45 for carry, it is only what, $250 for the conversion kit?  Never fired, I just got this (April 2014 manufacture date) and decided not to keep it.  I already have four other CCW guns and were I wealthy, different story.  No doubt the inherent, proven Sig quality will give the owner round after round reliability for many years.  It comes with one flush mag (you can get the extended, with an x-grip) and a plastic paddle holster.  Box and all papers included.

This is a private sale, so no sales tax!    NO, I am not interested in trades, so do not bother, thanks!"
