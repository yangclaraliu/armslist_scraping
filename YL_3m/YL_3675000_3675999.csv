Grips have been stippled and trust me, even if you are not a fan of stippling,  These grips are 10 times better than what came with the gun.  Comes with one magazine.  Price is firm. Brought brand new for a truck gun and have since gotten a different gun.  Do some research online and you'll find out that this gun is worth every dollar as a budget home defense pistol or boat/truck gun.  In my opinion it is not a good carry gun since it is rather bulky. If however it I only had this as a carry option, I would have no problem in trusting its reliability.

I am the first owner and have shot 60 rds through the gun with zero issues. Only used brass ammo (indoor range regulation). I've shot with and without the brace; much more stable and fun with the brace.

-Will sell for $600 firm
-Value is $700 for trades 

I'm not trying to get top dollar for this. Considering how little I've shot it I'm asking for way less than what I paid for both gun and brace, which combine for higher than the trade value. Only contact me if you intend to pay $600 or are willing to trade something close to the trade value. Will only accept firearms, cash, or a combination that comes very close to $700. Prefer meeting location to be within 30 minutes of Navarre. Travel limit is Cantonment or Panama City Beach, not Panama City.

I keep numbers and email addresses of past ""no-shows"". So for example if you ask for pics and, after I send them (even though they're already shown here), you either take too long to respond or say you've found something cheaper after telling me you're ""very interested in purchasing"" (there actually was someone who did this recently) then I won't deal with you. I say again, I WON'T deal with you. I do not wish to give guns to people who waste my time, cheap lowballers, people that disrespect by not replying, etc. I don't sell/trade junk and usually sell for way below what I paid for while taking into account how many times I've used what I sell/trade.

Comes with two magazines - 19 round extended and 17 round flush. Strong alloy frame and nice balance - this gun feels great in your hands. Safety and Decocker model allows for carrying ""cocked and locked"" similar to a 1911. Comes with the original plastic grips and the wooden Taurus brand grips.

This is essentially the same gun as the Beretta M9 but made by Taurus. In fact, in 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, Taurus has taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever.

Possible trade for 45 ACP and 9mm handguns, high end 380 or 40 caliber handguns, or a nice 1911. Other firearms or combination of firemarms/ammo. No Chinese rifles or junk guns."

Hey, either you love them or hate them but I've had no problems with this pistol. It does not have a box/paperwork but it does come with 20 rounds of Hornady ammunition.

I like snubbies but I dont like this one as much as other J frames Ive had.

I'd like to trade it for a Ruger LC9s (NOT interested in a standard LC9) or SR9c/SR40c, M&P Shield 9/40 , or possibly similar 9mm pocket sized guns. Would also be interested in a Glock 42, but that's the only .380 I would consider. No Kel Tecs or Tauruses please, and not interested in rifles or shotguns, if the right deal doesn't come along I'll keep it.
For the right deal or ammo I can include 50 rounds of 158 grn hollow point .38 special.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.
The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.
