She’s in excellent shape, cycles perfectly, and I have added all the necessary accessories, and have tried to steer clear of any frivolous ones. 

Mainly, I have replaced the Ghost Ring/Red Plastic Rectangle sights (if you have ever owned or shot a Sub-2000, you know what I’m talking about – if you haven’t, google it!) with a legitimate notched ‘eagle eye’ rear sight that flips down, should you want to mount optics, and a legitimate fiber-optic green front sight, as shown in the pictures. It is now outstandingly accurate at 30 yards (1-inch groups), which is the farthest I’ve shot it.  At 100-yards, the 16” barrel produces as much velocity as a .41 Magnum at point blank range. Pretty damn cool. 

Accessories I’ve added:
-	TandemKross Eagle Eye Rear Sight 
-	TandemKross Sub-200 Front Fiber Optic Sight 
-	TandemKross Front Sight Screws (Originals were RED PLASTIC that were notorious for breaking)
-	Tacticool Recoil Buffer 
-	Tacticool Bolt Tube Cover 
-	Front Rail Adapter W/ Fold-Down Grip (willing to remove if buyer doesn’t want)

Also comes with a Red Head stainless steel foam-lined case that is cut to fit the Sub-200, and two magazines; the original 10-round magazine and an aftermarket 23-round magazine.

I have well more than $700 invested in this project, but I do understand that a buyer often doesn’t want to pay for accessories on a used firearm that they wouldn’t have put on the gun themselves, so the price is a compromise, and is firm. 

She has been kept in a dehumidified safe when not in use, and stays thoroughly cleaned and oiled after any range time. 

Prospective buyers are, as always, welcome to fire it before they purchase.

NO TRADES please! And Tulsa area only! Thanks!"

The Hungarian AMD-65 is one of the more ubiquitous designs produced as a result of this experiment. Think of it as commie version of the M-1 Carbine – but with a little more bite…

Though once obscure, the AMD-65 has seen a bit of a renaissance lately due to its service in Afghanistan and the recent importation of parts kits. In fact, semi-auto AMD-65 builds made from surplus parts kits are a fairly common sight in gun shops around the country.

 Thompson Center ICON 22-250. I bought this rifle new a year ago, mounted my scope, zeroed it (tack driving accuracy), killed a couple yotes with it, and then had to rob the scope off of this one to put on my deer rifle. I sent it back to T/C then for the recall, so all is good there.  It’s just been sitting ever since. I’ve got a total of 27 rounds through the tube so for all practical purposes it’s a brand new rifle. It’s got their 3 piece walnut laminate “Ultrawood” stock which makes it warp-proof, aluminum bedding block integrated into the stock which matches up with 3 recoil lugs on the bottom of the receiver. The trigger has three different adjustment points on it, sear, overtravel, and weight of pull. It’s got picatinny style bases made onto the receiver. They make more than one bolt handle, so you can swap them out if you don’t like the one that’s on it. Half a box of Hornady Superformance Varmint 50 gr. V- MAX (4000 fps at the muzzle) goes with her - $625.00 FIRM – NO TRADES
You’ll have to come to the house to pick it up though; I can’t drive anymore due to health reasons.

Brand new, never fired AR Pistol.

A great deal of thought and consideration was put into the design of this pistol, and all of the components selected were chosen specifically with performance and ergonomics in mind. This is NOT your neighbor's uncomfortable and clumsy slapped-together gun-show AR pistol.

I started with a matched Anderson Mfg AM-15 lower and A3 upper set, and paired that with a DPMS lower parts kit. The match grade 10.5"" Rainier Arms .223 Wylde heavy barrel (.223 Rem/5.56 NATO) and GunTec low profile gas block fit perfectly under the 10"" full floating quad rail handguard with integrated forward QD sling point.

Under the hood is a PSA full auto nickel boron bolt carrier group for extended performance and easy cleaning, coupled with an extended tactical latch charging handle. Unlike the constant problems people have with shorter pistol-length gas systems, this has a carbine-length gas system to ensure dependable operation and perfect timing. Fully headspaced with both Go and No-Go gauges.

The extended buffer tube with positive stop keeps the Sig Brace firmly in place, standing it off a bit from the back of the receiver for a very comfortable shouldered position, and won't interfere with a QD sling. That, in combination with the Magpul K2 grip which is canted forward to a more vertical angle makes this AR ""pistol"" as close to a super comfortable SBR as you can legally get without crossing into NFA regulations.

This AR pistol already has all of the upgrades you would have to pay extra for, when buy a ""standard"" off the shelf or cheaply built AR pistol and realize how uncomfortable and inaccurate it is. Does NOT disappoint.

Included as original equipment on my rifle and have since swapped out to something different. Rifle is new and unfired and this buttstock can be considered brand new. Incredibly comfortable and beard-friendly, but I wanted a different look for my gun. Here's the description off the Daniel Defense website:

The Daniel Defense adjustable buttstock is constructed of a proprietary blend of glass infused polymers and finished off with soft touch rubber overmolding in strategic points.  The new buttstock is precision formed for mil-spec receiver extensions to have very little forward or lateral play that is so common in many other buttstocks.  This eliminates the need for a tensioning device or friction lock.  All of this results in a durable buttstock that will give the shooter a comfortable and repeatable cheek weld and unprecedented control of the firearm.  The buttstock can be run with one of two included buttpads or without any buttpad at all to custom fit the rifle to whatever gear the operator must wear.  The buttpads come in two sizes: a thicker convex shape (0.8”), and a thinner concave shape (0.5”); designed to keep from snagging when shouldering the rifle.  Limited rotation QD swivel attachment points are integrated on both sides of the buttstock for ambidextrous sling connection.

WEIGHTS AND DIMENSIONS
7 Inches Long
5.5 Inches Tall
1.75 Inches Thick
Weight: 0.50 lb
For Mil-Spec receiver extension tubes

Sells for $69.95 + s/h on the Daniel Defense website. Will let it go for $55 cash. No trades. Please no texts asking if I will take less - this is a great deal and you're saving close to $25 if you were to buy this from the manufacturer and have it shipped.

Thinning my collection to make room for some other items, so one of the Enfields has to go.  This one is a ""DP"" marked No 1 Mk III*in .303 that saw service after at least one refurbishment in India.  It has been marked on nearly every part ""DP"" which supposedly means ""drill purposes"".  I'd call the bore ""good"".  The bolt locks tight on a GO gauge, barely closes on NO GO and does not close on a FIELD gauge, which is well within British specs.  I have never fired this particular rifle.  Before firing you'll have to have the headspace checked.  The rifle is the way I purchased it over 10 years ago minus the cosmoline that I cleaned off in order to sell. 

Please ask any questions and I'll provide additional pictures upon request.  Asking $250 obro. Trades considered. I prefer milsurp firearms but will consider newer production firearms as well.  Not interested in non-firearm related trades (reloading equipment excluded)."

517,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3616517,For Sale:  New Vector Mini .45 IMI Uzi Carbine,"Vancouver, Washington, United States","$ 1,150","Listed On: Saturday, October 18, 2014",Rifles,Israel Weapon Industries                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Up for sale is a factory new, unfired, Vector Arms Mini UZGI Carbine, chambered for the popular .45 ACP cartridge. This firearm is a copy of the rare IMI Mini Carbine. It is built with many original Israeli parts and has an original side folding buttstock. It comes complete with 2 magazines, and it is backed by a 5 year complete and transferable warranty.
The Israeli Uzi, designed and sold by IMI for decades, is one of the most famous and recognizable SMGs of all time. It was built to withstand the harshest environments and to be easily operated. The IDF kept it in frontline service for over 3 decades because it just worked. It has been used by dozens of other nations for over half a century now. It has also been accepted by hundreds of law enforcement and security agencies, including the US Secret Service.
As good of a design as it was by the standards of the 1950s, by the 1980s, the fullsized Uzi was looking old fashioned, large, heavy, and just out of date. So IMI introduced the Mini Uzi, with a shorter receiver, forearm, barrel, and bolt. It also had redesigned sling swivels, and a new pattern of right side folding buttstock. The Mini Uzi was both shorter and lighter than its bigger brother, so it was an instant success with special forces and police.
The Vector Arms Mini UZGI Carbine is a very close copy of IMI's semi-auto Mini Uzi Carbine from the 1980s. It is built with many original Israeli parts, and has all of the features of the original. These include: 16"" long quick removable barrel, bayonet lug, adjustable sights, top cocking action, sling swivels, and the shorter Mini Uzi handguard. Since this firearm is a carbine, it is able to have an original IMI right side folding buttstock. This is a great stock, which is both easier to operate and more ergonomic than the IMI underfolding type. It also gives a 1"" longer length of pull.
This is Vector's new Mini Uzi chambered for the popular .45 ACP cartridge. It uses a standard grip frame, and It feeds from standard IMI Uzi magazines and the newer ones made in the USA by ProMag. It is finished with a tough milspec type parkerization, so it won't rust or scratch easily. It can be converted to fire 9mm without tools too. Just the barrel and bolt need to be swapped out is all.
This Carbine is 100% factory new, and just in from Vector this month. It comes complete with 1 - 25 rd extended and 1 - 10 rd compact IMI pattern magazines (made by ProMag) and operator's manual. It all comes in a Vector box, with their excellent 5 year warranty. They stand behind this warranty, and it is even transferable with the firearm. If you have any questions at all, feel free to contact me anytime. Since IMI only offered the original Mini Uzi Carbine in the USA for 2 years, they are quite rare and expensive when found today. The Mini UZGI has the same look and feel, and is every bit as reliable and durable. Vector has been building Uzi type firearms for over 15 years now, so they have a bit of experience and know how to do things right. Thank you very much for your interest. Not interested in trades."

At the end of the day, I want some gun spending money so I'm selling doubles and the like. As you can see, the super nice metal heat shields, muzzle break and all that come with it. 

The Kel-Tec PLR-16 is a gas-operated, semi-automatic pistol chambered in 5.56 NATO, manufactured by Kel-Tec Industries of Florida USA.

The PLR (Pistol, Long Range) was designed for recreational target shooting, and small game, varmint, or predator hunting.[2] Due to the PLR's 9.25 in (235 mm) barrel, the 5.56×45mm bullet's velocity is slightly reduced compared to its velocity from a traditionally 20 in (510 mm) barrel.

The PLR-16 combines the multi-lug rotating bolt design and breech-locking system of the AR-15 with a gas piston system. The pistol accepts the same STANAG magazine that is used in the M-16, AR-15, and other NATO rifles chambered for 5.56×45mm.

The PLR-16's frame is constructed of reinforced polymer, making the pistol both durable and light-weight. The frame incorporates an M-1913-style Picatinny rail molded to the top of the receiver to accept various optical sights."

It is in the original box and is in as new condition.

This handgun has been a safe queen since 2008. I have only fired 2 magazines, it is as new and The MK 23 comes with original hard case, 3 ea 12 round mags, original warranty card (still blank and not yet filed), one factory fired 45 brass, replacement ""O"" rings and tool, and operators manual. 

HK Heckler & Koch
Mark 23 .45 ACP 5.8 Inch Barrel Black Finish Polymer Frame 12 Round
Recoil operated with locked breech and tilting barrel. Grips made of glass fibre reinforced polymer with corrosion proof metal inserts. Ambidextrous safety with separate de-cocking lever for the hammer. Steel magazine with 12 round capacity. Integrated support rail for aiming units. Open square notch rear sight with contrast points.

 The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns - yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun.



The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more.

One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces.

On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1.

During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch. There were four groups of .5 inches, with 5 rounds going through the same hole!
