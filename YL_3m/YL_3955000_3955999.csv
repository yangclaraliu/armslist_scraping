Lower Receiver Manufactured by Lewis Machine & Tool. 
20 Inch Heavy profile barrel. 
Rear Site is fixed in the upper receiver.
Currently sporting Magpul Furniture with Ergo Grip. 
(I find the gun feels better in hand with Magpul Furniture). Not everyone feels that way, I get that.
Will come with Magpul and original GI furniture.

I've found this gun to group extremely tight, and have had no problems with its operation.  The gun did not come with a round counter, so I have no clue.

Serial Number indicates this Lower Receiver was manufactured before the implementation of the Brady Bill.

To my understanding this makes the lower receiver a Pre- Ban era receiver.  
What difference that makes in Oregon I have no idea.  

I've really enjoyed owning and shooting this gun.  I've not shot another 20 inch rifle that has handled as well.

I have only shot it once when a friend of mine bought a box of bullets and talked me into shooting it with him. 1 box, 20rnds. I then came home and spent way more time cleaning it then I did shooting it. Shoots great. This is one of the guns they made in their custom shop after they stopped production in 1999.  They made these custom guns from 2001 to 2003. I have looked around and this gun is up to around $3000 on other sites. I will take $2500 and no less. The PDT means it was ported, drilled for a scope base and tapped right at their custom shop where it was made. These guns are steadily increasing in value. The only way I will come down on the price is if you had some of the ammo I need. 22lr, 22mag, 223, 5.56, 9mm, or 762x39."

The 92S is a double/single-action semiauto pistol that employs an open-slide, short-recoil delayed locking-block system, which yields a faster cycle time and delivers exceptional accuracy and reliability. In particular, the open-slide design practically eliminates “stove-piping” and helps flawless cycling and feeding even after thousands and thousands of rounds. The recently-renewed contract with the US military speaks clear: when it comes to dependability even in some of the world’s most extreme conditions, the Beretta 92S still has no match. Period.     

Regardless of the wonderful reputation it may have, the true test for a tactical pistol’s worth is at the shooting range. The 92S consistently bests the US military requirement of a 10-shot group of 3” or less at 50 meters (just short of 55 yards). While this type of  match-grade accuracy is impressive, it is no magic. At Beretta, we know that absolutely precise tolerances keep performance consistent shot after shot—which not only gives the 92S its extraordinary accuracy, but it makes all factory parts interchangeable within the same model. Couple this to the ability to reliably feed every variety of commercial ammunition, and it is easy to understand why the 92S remains the best pistol in its class.

The original hand operated powder drop is included, but also included is a lee double disk with the pro upgrade as well as the double disk kit and a micrometer adjustable charge bar for pistol kit. I used the lee disk kit because it frees you from having to buy caliber conversion kits, assure you have the correct locator buttons, shell plate, and purchase lee dies and you don't have to buy a caliber conversion kit for each caliber you reload. The lee universal rifle charging die is included and it works with most calibers. Lee three pistol die sets include a powder drop for that caliber. 

Also included is a forster collet bullet puller with multiple collets. 

Begin reloading 223 with the included lee die set, 500 pieces of federal brass, 500 hornady 55 grain fmj bullets, 1,000 cci small rifle magnum primers, and two pounds of IMR 4064.

Lee 9mm dies are included. 

CaseGard primer flip tray, Well used Lyman case trimmer with 223 guide, lyman chamfer tool, and some extra parts for the press are also included. 

In order to start reloading you would need a powder scale and calipers. Once you get through the clean brass, you would also need a tumbler, media, and other brass prep equipment as you see fit.

Price is $$500

Additional dies are negotiable, i have available, 30-06, 357/38, 44 rem mag/special, 45acp, and others tthat could be included instead of the 9 or for a quick sale if thats what is required. If you want to be able to reload 40 smith I could set up a turn key operation for this press that way as well. 

Available in Johnstown evenings and weekends, I could meet in Denver or at another location, but it would be dfficult to see it all before you buy it then and I will not be quiet about it if you ask me to cart it all to a location and change your mind once I get there.

The Millennium Pro pistols offer many improvements over the standard models, but were introduced as enhancements to the originals, not to supplant them. Pro counterparts have now been released for nearly all of the original models. Some features of the Pro line include optional increased magazine capacities, larger and easier to operate controls, a single-action/double-action trigger mechanism on some models with reduced trigger travel and an improved smoother and lighter trigger pull, an enhanced frame, and an improved more ergonometric grip design. Other Pro improvements include the contrast enhanced Heinie ‘Straight-8’ sighting system, as well as optional night sights, a loaded chamber indicator which can be felt as well as seen, and a feature labeled 'posi-traction' which consists of an alteration to the number and layout of the slide serrations resulting in an improved gripping surface.

Features a lightweight polymer frame, the Millennium Pro weighs in at only 22 ounces. The thin profile makes it easy to carry every day, and the ramped 3.2"" barrel is capable of great accuracy. The newly designed Millennium Pro may be the ideal concealed carry handgun. The Millennium Pro also showcases high-profile sight and an aggressive, textured grip and melted edges provide added comfort and easy concealment.

The Millennium Pro also features many intuitive safety devices. Complete with a loaded chamber indicator, manual safety, Taurus Internal Security System, and an automatic trigger safety.

NIB - Henry Repeating Arms US Survival Rifle .22 LR ABS Plastic Stock Teflon-Coated Camo Finish (MSRP: $350) U.S. Survival AR-7 Rifle - Don’t Leave Civilization Without One Since 1959 the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on should they have to punch out over a remote area. Through the years the AR-7’s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game. Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5″ long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.

It is a Plainfield Machine version which is highly collectible yet still reasonably priced (versus the one or two most collectible versions which sell for a thousand or two easy when they're posted, and the best condition examples either don't get posted for sale or get so much money you can't even think about them).

This was made by Plainfield Machine Co. in the mid 1970s (most likely).  It was purchased by my Father as a young police officer in New Jersey, off the rack in K-Mart.  One of his fellow officers told him he could get an amazing deal on a high-quality, historical rifle at the local K-Mart and he happened to get one as they were being delivered... He claims to have fired it a few times in the 1970s, put it away... took it out once when I was a young child in the mid to late 1980s, and then once more in the time leading up to the AWB of 1994.  It then went into storage and has not been fired since, to the best of our knowledge.  We are not even sure if it has been fired a full box of ammo... if so, we are talking minimal shooting here.  My Dad is not and I repeat NOT a gun guy, to him they were just tools of the trade for work, and he surely wasn't a rifle guy by any stretch of the imagination.... When he was issued a new semiautomatic 9mm Glock in the 80s that was his gun, and it was good enough for him.

So this is for sale because it is of little use to me , and little historical value.  It's not like it was a family heirloom piece or he used it on some special mission or in some special times, not at all.  To be honest when he was telling me about it, I thought it was an M1A and I was so excited to have a possible M1A in storage, my heart was secretly broken when I realized he wasn't accurate in his descriptions and it was an M1 Carbine lol.

It is in excellent condition, probably needs a thorough cleaning and lubrication before any use but other than  that, should make an EXCELLENT ranch rifle or personal protection piece of firearms history.  It's nice enough to be a collection piece in addition to a user-shooting gun but functionable enough to be a shooter, not a safe queen.

$800 gets it done

FINAL NOTE- The Manufacturer is Plainfield Machine of Dunellen, NJ - This was a very well known and boutique-style arms-making factory that was acquired by Iver Johnson I believe in 1978?  I am pretty sure through serial number research that this was either made right before the aquisition/merger or perhaps right after and before the machine tooling was changed to a new stamp etc.  The rifle reads Plainfield Machine Dunellen NJ .30 M1 and has a 5-digit serial number in the 60,000 - 's.  A piece of history that could be cherished and used.  -- I did some research, and apparently the Plainfield Machine carbines that feature the Dunellen NJ markings are the best that Plainfield produced- they are Plainfield-made receivers with Plainfield-made barrels, and then all USGI parts.  They also have some of the best stocks you'll find under $1000 models.  Several sources online refer to Plainfield Machine Dunellen-models as the best M1 Carbine you can buy if you are at all interested in shooting, as they are head and shoulders better than anything under them and the models above them are either extremely expensive or just too nice/valuable/pristine to shoot .  This is a perfect combination of function and features so the collector/shooter loves them."

We have for sale a OD Green Kel Tec KSG 12 gauge fitted with a Silencerco Salvo suppressor.  

Several companies have created  ""gadgets"" to overcome the fact that the KSG is NOT threaded internally to accept choke tubes.  Instead, we have threaded the barrel internally using a CNC Lathe to the exact choke tube adaptor from a Silencerco used (not just the specs for the adaptor).  This creates optimal performance.

The gun and suppressor are only sold as a package that includes the choke tube adaptor as well.  Price is $2485 with Michigan residents paying 6% sales tax.  Credit card fees apply if needed.  All NFA Rules apply.

Note: gun is pictured next to a FNH SLP Tactical shotgun for size reference.

These Trijicon night sight sets were purchased in bulk by a wholesale firearms retailer.  The retailer repackaged them for resale and this is how I acquired them.  They do not come in the ""original"" Trijicon packaging (see pictures in the ad), but are 100% authentic, new and most likely unused.  The manufacture date on these particular sights is 2011 (you can tell this from the ""11"" printed on the sights).  

Trijicon guarantees their tritium sights for 12 years.  You have these under full warranty until the year 2023.  If you have any issues with them, Trijicon will repair or replace at no cost.  From my experience, these sights last much longer than the ""guaranteed"" period.

All sighting systems that contain Trijicon brand tritium lamps are clearly marked with the “Trijicon®"" brand. Other markings include a two digit date code, which reflects the year of manufacture, and the periodic symbol for tritium, “H3”.  Please see my picture in the ad that gives a visual description of Trijicon's markings and what they represent.

You will not be disappointed with these sights.  They glow nice and bright and are priced less than anywhere else you will find."

It has an 18.5"" unported barrel. I also added scope mounts, but no scope (the open sights can still be used with the mounts on). I have the original box containing the offset hammer spur, screws that were removed to install the scope mounts and the original paperwork.

It has a Marlin serial number of 91xxxxxx (Remington numbers started with MR), which means it was made in 2009. It still says New Haven, Ct on the barrel but has a REP stamp. The receiver looks to be a Marlin part, but the serial number is in the Remington location. My research indicated that this one was probably built in Ilion, NY with mostly Marlin parts. It looks and works as well as an older Marlin guide gun that I had, unlike some that I've heard about.

I have the remaining 18 rounds of Hornady ammo that will go with it for a full price offer.

I'm looking for a local sale/trade only. If the ad's still here it's still for sale."

The new price on this optic is over $2800.00
 The ELCAN SpecterDR 1.5-6x is the second evolution in the family of Dual Role Optical Sights. Based upon the battle-proven SpecterDR design, the SpecterDR 1.5-6x provides higher magnification to enable greater precision and longer engagement ranges, while at the same time providing exceptional field of view in CQB mode.

The SpecterDR 1.5-6x enjoys ELCAN’s famous crystal-clear optics as well as a generous eye relief, making it the ideal instrument for designated marksman rifles and other long range applications. As with all SpecterDR sights, the magnification and field of view can be changed instantly with the throw of a lever. Depending upon the situation, the user may adjust the sight to illuminate the crosshair or just a brilliant red dot in the center. Because the reticles are etched in glass, they are plainly visible even in the case of loss of electrical power due to battery failure or EMP.

The SpecterDR family offers the best single solution for Long Range and CQB engagements and is designed to withstand the rigors of modern professional use.

I'm the second owner. The guy who had it before me took care of it mechanically. I'm unsure of round count, I think he said 3-400 and I have put 150 through it so far. The frame has been cerakoted, I assume C-series, FDE and he added grip tape over the side textured area and the dimple above that. Other than that it is stock. The cerakote shows some wear but any wear on the gun is purely cosmetic.

The ideal concealed carry pistol would have all the features, performance and power you’d find in a full size handgun, but in a smaller package. The XD-S 4.0? Single Stack from Springfield Armory does exactly that. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD and XD(M) lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S 4.0? Single Stack. The XD-S 4.0? Single Stack is a mid-sized single stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory. The sub-compact frame extends to full size length when you insert an X-Tension magazine. Combined with the 4.0? barrel, this gives you a pistol that’s ideal for a day at the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S 4.0? Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD pistols safe and easy to use. But the strengths of the XD-S 4.0? Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with a flush fitting magazine, and you’ll find that your range pistol has shrunk into something that carries so easily that you’ll forget it’s there. Choosing a multi-purpose handgun doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power or size. And you certainly don’t have to take a gun to the range that you’d rather not even shoot. Put an XD-S 4.0? Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable. Prefer to sell to somebody with concealed carry permit."

Sharing all the family traits of the world-famous Desert Eagle pistol, Magnum’s Micro Desert Eagle pistol, chambered in .380 ACP, is the ultimate in compact personal protection. Small enough to nest comfortably at home, in a pocket or in a purse, the double action only Micro Desert Eagle is proudly made in the U.S. and weighs less than 14 oz. But don’t let its size fool you. The Micro Desert Eagle provides big-time protection with a gas-assisted blowback system for ultimate reliability and amazing accuracy. Which only goes to prove that good things do indeed come in small packages."
