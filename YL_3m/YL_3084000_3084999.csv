Being a matched set, there really isn't any discernible play in the receiver, giving this rifle excellent mechanical repeatability.  The barrel is a Yankee Hill Machine 16"" Melonite barrel chambered in 5.56, with a 1/7 twist, and is chrome lined.  Attached to the barrel is a Spikes Tactical Dynacomp muzzle brake, providing excellent controllability.  The stock on this rifle is an Ergo F93 Pro.  These stocks integrally clamp to the proprietary buffer tube, providing the flexibility of an adjustable stock, but the rigidity of a fixed stock. All of this combines into one very solid rifle!

This rifle is topped with a Trijicon Accupoint 1-4x24 scope that uses a combination of Tritium and fiber optics to illuminate the reticle meaning there are no batteries, and it never has to be powered on before you are ready to fire.  The scope is mounted in an American Defense QD mount.

Last, and certainly not least, the trigger is a Rock River 2-stage National Match, so it is light, and very crisp.

The rifle has had approximately 20 rounds fired to verify functionality and zero the scope.

Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. For decades, Ruger® Mini-14® rifles and Mini Thirty® rifles have been the choice for applications ranging from the farm and ranch, to the deep woods, to personal defense. Their short barrels and overall short length make them favorites in any application where maneuverability and ease of handling are priorities. 

With a variety of configurations from the standard Ranch Rifle, to the extremely accurate Mini-14® Target Rifle, to the Tactical models with collapsible stock or compact barrel with flash suppressor - there is a Mini-14 or Mini Thirty to meet any demand. 

Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles."

I purchased this M&P 9mm about two months ago in AZ. Has an Apex trigger upgrade, reduced recoil spring, Robar extractor, reduced striker spring, reduced firing pin spring, and titanium firing pin. Standard three dot sights, no mag disconnect feature. Comes with two mags, two extra back straps, owners manual, lock, and case.

This firearm has never been fired except for the factory test fire. Selling becuase I have another project that needs funding. Selling right now for 800. Cost of gun around 600 out the door at about any shop. Cost of upgrades is 360. So 800 is not a bad deal for an upgraded gun out of the box.

If interested, please email me with your phone number. I will only suopply pictures through text to people who leave their number. If you lowball offer me, you probably wont get a response. Not looking for any trades at the time since I will be moving back to AZ shortly."

The MKII has an extended beavertail to prevent hammer bite.  I mounted Herrett walnut stocks but the factory finger-groove grips are also included.

This pistol is likely unissued; blued slide rails do not show finish wear, and no powder residue inside.  I have detail cleaned it and left the magazine safety out.  In order to facilitate future detail cleaning I also left the ambi right side safety lever off, since these are a terror to get off (the Israelis staked the pins; I can reinstall at buyer's request).  All factory parts are included, along with the factory cleaning rod and case.  .

I contacted them and have copied their response below. Although they have the God given right to run their private business as they see fit, my family intends to stay away from this target rich environment.  I replied to this response requesting the allow conceal carry and have not heard back.

 ""Thank you for taking the time to reach out to us. The issue of gun ownership or gun rights has become one of the most contentious debates in the country. Chipotle has never taken a position on this issue, as we focus instead on our mission to change the way people think about and eat fast food. 

 Recently participants from an “open carry” demonstration in Texas brought guns (including military-style assault rifles) into one of our restaurants, causing many of our customers anxiety and discomfort. Because of this, we are respectfully asking that customers not bring guns into our restaurants, unless they are authorized law enforcement personnel.

 Historically, we felt it enough to simply comply with local laws regarding the open or concealed carrying of firearms, because we believe that it is not fair to put our team members in the uncomfortable position of asking that customers refrain from bringing guns into our restaurants. However, because the display of firearms in our restaurants has now created an environment that is potentially intimidating or uncomfortable for many of our customers, we think it is time to make this request.

 We acknowledge that there are strong arguments on both sides of this issue. We have seen those differing positions expressed in the wake of this event in Texas, where pro-gun customers have contacted us to applaud our support of the Second Amendment, and anti-gun customers have expressed concern over the visible display of military-style assault rifles in restaurants where families are eating. The vast majority of gun owners are responsible citizens and we appreciate them honoring this request. And we hope that our customers who oppose the carrying of guns in public agree with us that it is the role of elected officials and the legislative process to set policy in this area, not the role of businesses like Chipotle. 

 We always welcome the exchange of ideas and opinions: it is one of the many things that make our country such a special place. But this issue is not central to the operation of our business, and we do not feel that our restaurants should be used as a platform for either side of the debate.

 All the best,

I got the Galloway trigger transfer bar and hammer mod last summer and have put about 100 rounds through my LC9 with it. The trigger pull is much better than the stock, however since I've now decided to carry my LC9, I'd like to return it back to its factory stock condition. The Galoway kit reduces the trigger break point by half and therefore also feels lighter. I'd like to trade my entire Galloway kit (transfer bar and hammer) just for your stock LC9 hammer (I already have a replacement transfer bar). The mod cost me about $50 from Galloway.

I live in Ashburn and can travel within a reasonable distance.

Onkyo TX SR604 7.1 channel Receiver
See all reviews by qvp2007by: qvp2007 ( 466 )
Pros: Very easy to uses, good input/output. I hooked it up with JBL L830, polk csi3 center speaker, and Polk PW305 woofer. The system sound marvelous. Receiver makes those speakers sound so good. The receiver produces the power that it lists. Great receiver for the price that you pay. I owned a Harmon Kardon AVR 520 before this one. I would say that they are about the same, but the Harmon kardon is much more harder to use. 

Cons: Does not look that fancy compared to other system like harmon kardon, denon, etc.. Otherwise, system is excellent.

This receiver was purchased to accomodate an HTPC digital sound library 
with enough pure clean power, to drive a custom built, old school JBL (4311 platform) Paragon system, to its full amphitheater potential. 
A great match, of low THD, WRAT power, and 
driving impedence forgiveness. (4 ohm to 16 . . . . it does not care) 
The connectivity options are amazingly diverse.

Onkyo TX SR604 7.1 channel Receiver
See all reviews by qvp2007by: qvp2007 ( 466 )
Pros: Very easy to uses, good input/output. I hooked it up with JBL L830, polk csi3 center speaker, and Polk PW305 woofer. The system sound marvelous. Receiver makes those speakers sound so good. The receiver produces the power that it lists. Great receiver for the price that you pay. I owned a Harmon Kardon AVR 520 before this one. I would say that they are about the same, but the Harmon kardon is much more harder to use. 

Cons: Does not look that fancy compared to other system like harmon kardon, denon, etc.. Otherwise, system is excellent.

This receiver was purchased to accomodate an HTPC digital sound library 
with enough pure clean power, to drive a custom built, old school JBL (4311 platform) Paragon system, to its full amphitheater potential. 
A great match, of low THD, WRAT power, and 
driving impedence forgiveness. (4 ohm to 16 . . . . it does not care) 
The connectivity options are amazingly diverse.

I got it home and it fired just fine at first.  Now it's having a trigger reset problem. I heard snap caps could bring it out of this problem so I bought a pack of 5 but haven't messed with them to much. Ruger wants $30 to look at it. I'm not a gunsmith I just want working guns. I paid $400 for this gun and $15 for the snap caps. I'm asking $400 for the gun and snap caps. If you have something firearm related to trade I will think about a full or partial trade.
