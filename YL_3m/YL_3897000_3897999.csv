The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

93,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3897093,"For Sale:  I do Glock Trigger/Action Jobs. Polished Internals, Custom Parts Install, etc.","Sneads Ferry, Jacksonville, North Carolina",$ 25,"Listed On: Friday, January 9, 2015",Handguns,Glock,no type,no type,no type,"I have done countless Glock Trigger/Slide jobs on my own Glocks as well as many, many others. I do not own a shop, I do this as a hobby and to help people with cost. I will however do the same if not better job then you will get at a gunshop for a fraction of the price! I enjoy gunwork and I do this as a hobby, I have been for many years and I am very familiar with Glocks.

I will completely disassemble the gun(slide and frame), clean the entire gun, polish all friction prone internals and reassemble for $25. I can also put a 3.5lb connector in for an additional $10, this will drop the trigger pull from Factory 5.5lb's to 3.5lb's

......The polished internals coupled with the 3.5lb trigger pull will make your Glock operate as smooth as possible and make every trigger pull break like glass, polishing removes anything that can cause friction or cause internals to get caught up making the trigger pull ""sloppy"". The polishing alone will make a dramatic difference in used Glocks and will make a pretty noticeable difference in new Glocks but will set the new ones up for a successful future. Pull the trigger on mine, then try yours.....you will feel the difference!

If there are custom parts you want installed we can arrange that too.

Browning's AB3 Composite Stalker gives you legendary A-Bolt accuracy and performance in a value-packed platform. The AB3 Stalker combines a matte blued finish barreled action with a rugged matte black synthetic stock to create a high-performance hunting rifle that won’t blow a hole your budget.

•
 Button-rifled barrel is triple-checked for straightness and interior finish and then air-gauged to ensure a consistent diameter throughout the bore’s length.

• Every AB3 barrel is individually finished with a hand-reamed chamber for tighter tolerances and more precise headspace.
• The barrel’s target-type Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy.
• The free-floating barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the barrel to perform consistently and accurately and reach its full accuracy potential.
• The receiver is drilled and tapped for scope mounts using two 8-40 screws for each base to provide a rock-solid optics mounting platform.
• The AB3’s unique integrated trigger design provides a crisp 3½-pound pull that ""breaks like glass.""
• The generous trigger guard opening allows easy access, even when wearing gloves.
• A robust, precision-machined standard-length steel action allows you to mount your scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between the bore centerline and the optical centerline.
• The fast 60° bolt lift keeps your thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion.
• The bolt body is plated with matte electroless nickel for smother operation and added corrosion resistance.
• The Bolt Unlock Button allows you to unload the chamber with the safety in the on-safe position for an added margin of safety.
• The top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. You can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.
• The detachable staggered box magazine has a rugged formed steel body and feed lips for added durability, plus a tough polymer baseplate and shoulder that’s designed to stop the forward movement of the cartridges. This helps prevent recoil-induced bullet tip deformation and bullet setback in the cartridge case.
• Magazine capacity is 3 rounds in magnum calibers, and 4 rounds in standard calibers.
• The innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from your face when firing to reduce felt recoil and flinching.
• A durable matte blued steel finish on all external surfaces minimizes reflection and provides resistance to corrosion.
• The rugged synthetic stock with molded-in matte black color and textured gripping surfaces can stand up to virtually anything you (or Mother Nature) can dish out.
• Steel sling swivel studs are pre-installed for easy mounting of your sling or bipod."

The ammo includes 168 A-Max(99 rounds), subsonic 220 gr (119 rounds) and supersonic 115 gr (85 rounds) Remington along with Hornady 110 V-Max (20 rounds). I am willing to sell the upper with out the troy sights and /or the AAC flash-hider. I also have reloading dies and some used brass (150+ rounds). You can also make an offer for the ammo only. Asking price for the total package is $1100 if you want to make a different offer let me know but don't insult me. The items would cost over $1300 before sales tax and/or shipping charges if purchased separately.  This is not something I must sell but would like to go a different direction.

For sale in the Roanoke Valley is a Coonan Classic 1911 chambered in .357 Magnum. This pistol is stainless steel with adjustable sights and in outstanding shape.

Yep, you've read that correctly so far. It fires the rimmed .357 Magnum, just like in your revolver. Coonan's advertising says:
""Looking for your first pistol? This isn't it.""

I prefer my much longer slogan better:
""If this can't stop the problem you need a hand gun for; you shouldn't have screwed with it to begin with.""  

They are a BLAST to shoot and will turn some heads at the range. Very controllable in my opinion, maybe a bit snappier than your standard 1911, but not bad at all. It even comes with the extra recoil spring so you can shoot .38 Special through it if you like.

A few features of the Coonan:
- .357 Magnum
- Linkless Barrel
- Recoil Operated
- Pivoting Trigger
- Extended Slide Catch and Thumb Lock for One-Hand Operation

This Coonan comes with:
- 5"" Barrel
- Smooth Black Walnut Grips
- Custom Factory Carry Case
- 1 Magazine (7 round capacity)
- Lock
- .38 Special Recoil Spring
- Magazine Loading Tool and Coonan Keychain
- Owner’s Manual
- Factory Bottle of Gun Oil
- Factory Fired Casings"

At first glance you would think that the Colt 901 is just a .308 Win./7.62 NATO version of a standard AR-15, much like any other .308 AR out there, but it is a lot more than that. The Colt LE901-16S is a “Modular Carbine,” which means it can be adapted to any AR-15 platform upper. This isn’t a new concept, because there are of course a whole bunch of different caliber uppers for ARs. The difference is in all the other ones, they have adapted a standard size AR magazine to boutique calibers and cartridge designs. The Colt 901 is different. It can be adapted from .308/7.62, using standard P-Mags, to .223/5.56, using standard AR mags, and back again, in literally seconds. The design uses one proprietary part, and you have to swap out the recoil system. It is that simple, and it works fantastic."

The BA’s modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods and more.

The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series — built for pinpoint accuracy. The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like no Savage we’ve ever made.

The Savage Law Enforcement Series is now the official precision rifle of the New York State Police Mobile Response Team. Every heavy contour barrel in this series is button rifled for enhanced accuracy and features a recessed target crown. There is no need to lap the bolt, because the floating bolt head ensures both lugs have full bearing on the locking surface. And the headspace on every rifle is set at absolute minimum. Standard features in this series include an oversized bolt handle that permits rapid acquisition for follow-up shots."

If you aren't familiar with the Cougar design it is the precursor to the Beretta PX4 and uses a rotating barrel action to improve accuracy and lower recoil.  Identical to the Beretta Cougar aside from the name on the slide; Beretta transferred the tooling and manufacturing equipment to Stoeger, Stoeger being a subdivision of Benelli, which is in turn owned by Beretta.  Has the same manual of arms as a Beretta 92/M9, so its a great choice if you're looking for a more compact version for carry.

Has some light holster wear from being carried but overall is in good shape, bought new about two months ago and only has about 200 rounds through it.  Will come with two 13 round magazines. Depending on what you have I can also include an extra 15 round magazine (modified Beretta 92 mag) and I have a fair amount of 9mm ammo.

This shotgun is almost new and lightly used with only about twenty shells through it. If you are not familiar with this shotgun it is made in Turkey by the same factories that make the Canik CZ75 clones and TP9, Winchester SXP, and many other quality firearms. This is a 5+1 pump action that will chamber 3 inch shells. Has a built in recoil pad and pistol grip, as well as a nice set of fiber optic ghost ring sights, a receiver mounted picatinny rail, a removable breacher choke, and is VERY lightweight. This is a Benelli pattern shotgun and will accept extended benelli magazine tubes. Very similar to a Benelli M3 (sans the semi auto functionality) for a fraction of the cost.

Im interested in several things in trade. Ive had a few shotguns with pistol grips and ring sights and Ive found that I prefer a straight stock with a bead sight. This shotgun retails for $299, Id like to trade it for a similalrly priced 12 gauge shotgun with a straight stock, bead sight, and 18-20 inch cylinder bore barrel, such as a Remington 870, Mossberg 500/maverick 88, winchester sxp, or similar. Only looking for combat/hd style shotguns, absolutely not interested in field guns, sorry.
Might also be interested in a Taurus M85 or similar snub .38 special revolver, or a Polish P-64, or similar PPK style pistol in .32 acp, .380, or 9x18mm. Maybe a Ruger LCP or LC9, Taurus 709 or 740.
Would also be interested in a case of 5.56 ammo or a Vortex Strikefire red dot and magnifier.
Im also looking for a progressive reloading press, my turret is just too slow for the volume I reload.
Might consider other firearms but no .22's or household junk. Looking for a trade value of $300-350, will consider partial trades plus cash.

If not interested in trading I will sell for $200 firm. I also have a decent amount of ammo, 50 shells of buckshot and 50 shells of various birdshot I can include for $50 extra. 

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

Thanks!"

512,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3897512,"For Sale:  Kahr CM40 40S&W 3"" Black Polymer Carry Handgun","Rogers, Arkansas, United States",$ 220,"Listed On: Friday, January 9, 2015",Handguns,Kahr                                                                                ,40 S&W,no type,no type,"The CM series which debuted in spring 2011 with the CM9, takes the value priced features from Kahr's CW series (3.6"" barrel, 9 mm, .40 S&W and .45 ACP models) and incorporates these features into a smaller 3"" barrel package. The CM4043 has the same external dimensions as the PM4043, which make it ideal for concealed carry by licensed civilians and law enforcement personnel. 

The CM4043 is chambered in a .40 S&W caliber, has a 3.1"" barrel and an overall length of 5.47"", with a height of 4.0"". The pistol weighs in at 15.8 ounces plus 1.9 ounces for the stainless steel magazine. Differences between the CM models and PM models include: the CM4043 has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel on Kahr's PM series; the CM slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CM series slide has fewer machining operations and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; and finally, the CM series are shipped with one magazine instead of two magazines. 

The CM40 boasts real sights, which are drift adjustable in the rear and a pinned-in polymer front sight featuring a white bar-dot configuration. Finally, the slide does lock back after firing the last round - another feature missing on a number of other value priced compact semi-auto pistols. 

The CM40 slide is machined from solid 416 stainless steel with a matte finish and is only .94 inch wide. Each gun is shipped with one 5 rd stainless steel magazine with a flush floorplate. Magazines are made in the USA, plasma welded, tumbled to remove burrs and feature Wolff Gunsprings. The magazine catch in the polymer frame is all metal and will not wear out on the stainless steel magazine after many uses. 

Just like the CM9, the new CM40 will include all of the great features that make Kahr pistols one of a kind. Kahr's seven patents result in benefits not available in other compact semi-autos on the market today: - The black polymer frame features patented 4140 steel inserts molded into the frame in the front and back for added rigidity and strength, which can withstand firing thousands of rounds. - Kahr's incomparable cocking cam trigger system employs a patented cam to both unlock the firing pin block (passive safety), and complete cocking and releasing of the firing pin. The system provides a ""safe-cam action"" and unbelievably smooth double action only trigger stroke, fast to fire in critical defensive situations. Many lower cost compact semi-autos on the market today do not have firing pin blocks in their design. - Kahr's two patents covering the offset recoil lug and the trigger bar attachment allow Kahr's barrel to fit lower in the frame, and since there is no hammer, the shooter's hand is further up the grip resulting in less felt recoil and quick follow-up shots."

Product Information

Starline Brass prides itself on producing the highest quality brass case available. Their brass is comprised of 70% copper and 30% zinc and is vertically drawn during the manufacturing process which results in more uniform wall thickness. Cases are annealed between each draw to ensure consistent metallurgy in all lots. Each brass case is hand inspected to guarantee the highest quality possible. 

Starline Brass is located in Sedalia, MO and has been in business for over 30 years. Trust Starline for your next reloads, you won't be disappointed. New, unprimed brass. This is not loaded ammunition. Bulk brass should be full-length sized, trimmed and chamfered before loading. 

Technical Information
Caliber: 10mm Auto 

Preparation:
Due to the manufacturing process and/or shipping, case mouths may not be perfectly round. To ensure a round case mouth, cases must be sized (or have the expander ball of the sizing die run through case neck) and deburred/Chamfered prior to loading.

Notes: 
A light ""staining"" may be found on the case neck of new brass. This is due to annealing. Annealing is a process, performed by the manufacturer, which involves rapid heating to a specified temperature followed by rapid cooling. This process imparts cases with the proper hardness to securely hold a bullet as well as gives flexibility to expand and contract upon firing and repeated forming. The ""staining"" is a residue from this process. This stain may be removed by tumbling before loading.

Two detention plates for V1 and V9, and extra magazine base plates.

The V1 plate lets the gun function as follows: DA/SA with safety and decocker on the left hand side.

The V9 plate causes the gun to function as follows: DA/SA with safety, but no de-cocker.

These switch out in less than a minute when you field strip the gun to clean it.  Just allows the owner to have the choice of having a V1 variant USP or a V9 variant.  All about personal preference.  V9 functions basically like a 1911.

Gun is excellent, functions flawlessly, very very light wear. I will not part this out.  If the buyer would like to sell off the magazines or some of them at the $50-60 they go for, that is fine with me.  Same goes with the holsters.

I have test fired it (about 100 rds through it) and it runs great. No FTF, FTE, or misfires. I haven't take the time to sight it in but it is hitting consistent at about 100 yds. The rifle comes with one bulgarian 30rnd magazine. If the buyer doesn't try to screw around with me too bad on the price I'll throw in a bulgarian sling and mag pouch to go with it. AK-74s are great rifles; low recoil, simple design (as are all AK rifles), and nasty ballistics on the 5.45x39 round. I am somewhat flexible on the price but don't waste my time and I assure you I won't waste yours. Always extras thrown in to those who are reasonable. If you're interested email or text me at six0six-5nine4-eight2six3."

I converted the Russian made Saiga by moving the trigger group to its correct location, adding a hogue pistol grip, and adding an Arsenal NATO length AK stock.  It has the correct number of US parts to be 922-r compliant, with or without US magazines.  I wanted a good, reliable, light weight magazine fed semi-auto shotgun, and this fits the bill.  It's spent most of its life in the safe, and shows very few signs of use.  It's in very good condition.  

FFL required - preferably around the Loveland area.  I'm asking $900 and open to trades."
