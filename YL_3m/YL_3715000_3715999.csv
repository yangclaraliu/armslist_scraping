It has minor scratches throughout on the flat surfaces that I am confident I can handle, however, the dreaded idiot scratch extends into the trigger relief cut which is of a different finish.  I have got some really good info from YouTube, but all the DIY videos avoid this area simply because it is a different finish.  I've already started working on the scratches with pretty good results, and before I move onto the next phase I would like to take care of the remaining problem.

Be over 21, and have a Florida Drivers License and be a non felon. I will fill out a bill of sale.

It features a black polymer frame with integral steel rails from Walther, a silver stainless steel slide and a ChromeMoly steel barrel: all machined and assembled in the USA. It retains the Walther ""Anti-Stress"" trigger with its short, consistent 5lb pull. The gun has three integral safeties and a manual decocker that can reset the single-action trigger to a firmer double action for added security making it one of the safest guns to carry or keep at home.

The frame comes with three switchable back straps to vary the size of the grip, a fully adjustable rear sight and five interchangeable front sights for varying elevation and windage. The MR9 comes with two 15-round magazines, a cable lock, and an injection-molded carrying case that keeps everything securely in place.

The MR Eagle Series from Magnum Research is a joint American/German effort featuring a black polymer frame with integral steel rails imported from Walther in Germany, a 416 stainless steel slide and a 4140 CrMo steel barrel machined in the USA and assembled and shipped from the Pillager, MN factory. The MR Eagle is a striker fire design and is available in two popular calibers, 9mm and the .40 S&W. Additional features include a fully adjustable rear sight for windage, three replaceable palm swells for various hand sizes and shooting styles, interchangeable front sight blades of different heights, hammer forged barrel, full Weaver style accessory rail and internal safety devices.

It has plenty of storage capacity plus a nylon shoulder strap for easy carry. It also has leather belt loops sewn on the rear for belt carry.

Also included is a complete cleaning kit that has a stiff nylon brush for normal cleaning and a brass brush for seriously dirty bores. Additionally there is a felt tip cleaning rod that fits the bore snuggly and eliminates the need for patches.

Then there is a adapter for firing any .22LR ammo safely that handles .22 Short and Long too.

Finally there is an assortment of 26.5mm shells as follows: 2 Czech orange smoke for daytime signaling. 2 Czech single green star, 2 German four red star & finally 2 German four white star. So you have everything you need for emergency or survival use.

Lyman has recreated the legendary sight that the Lyman Gun Sight Company was founded on in 1878. Like the original, the #2 is constructed of blued steel and features height index marks on the aperture post, with maximum elevation of .800"" for long range shooting. The #2 Tang Sight's greater sight radius means an inherent increase in accuracy. The #2 Tang Sight includes both a .093 diameter quick sighting hunting aperture and a .040 diameter Large Disk Target Aperture. Also included is a replacement rear stock screw and front tang screw. This Marlin version features a special adapter which allows mounting on the tang without damaging the serial number. Please Note: All Marlin lever actions will need to be drilled and tapped before mounting. This sight will not work on new rifles with a tang safety.      Shipping is $ 6.00"
