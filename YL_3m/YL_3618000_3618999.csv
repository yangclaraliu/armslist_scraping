Its in good shape with a little bit of carry wear but nothing major worth mentioning. Comes with two 8 round magazines. Has an excellent trigger, light and breaks very cleanly with a short reset. If you aren't familiar with these they are very similar to a Kahr CW9, basically the single stack 9mm Glock has yet to make.

It carries nicely but I prefer to pocket carry so I'd like something with a shorter grip. I'd be interested in a Ruger SR9c or LC9s or an M&P Shield in trade. Might also consider J frame sized .38 special revolvers or possibly a used S&W Model 10 or the same guns mentioned in .40.

The lower was used very little....fired approximately 40 rounds with it. As you can see in the picture, I did attempt a home ""color-fill"" on this lower. Other than that it is in like new condition. The lower is pictured with Magpul parts on and the stock parts are sitting next to it. 

I am offering this lower in one of two ways: you can purchase it with the magpul parts on it (for more, of course) or you can request to have the stock parts put back on. The Magpul parts include: A Magpul CTR stock (paid $75), the Magpul ASAP sling mount (replaced the stock receiver end plate, paid about $28), and a Magpul MOE plus rubber grip (paid $23).

Now for prices: the lower with the stock parts will cost $250. It will be complete and in ready to use condition. The lower with the Magpul parts in place will run $325. 

Note: I am not desperate for money. In fact, I am building another rifle and could certainly use each of these parts for that build but I am going another route. SO, do not start your offers with half of my listing prices because you will be ignored. Negotiate? Sure. Give away the lower and parts? Absolutely not."

• Why doesn’t POF offer chrome lined barrels?
All of our barrels are Case Harden Nitrate Heat-Treated to 70 RC.  The steel case is softer than our chambers. Our case hardened barrels shoot consistently better groups on all of our weapon systems then chrome lined barrels. Our barrels are easier to clean and don’t copper foul like chrome lined barrels. Our case hardened nitrate heat treated barrels are 10x’s thicker in the hardness area of the barrel (case hardness .005” thk., chrome lined .0005” thk.).  Chrome lining can delaminate (peel away from barrel surface) from heat, and the chrome lining doesn’t plate evenly on the entire surface of the bore and grooves.

• What is the normal-use barrel life of the POF barrels?
You can expect to get at least 20,000 plus rounds out of our Nitrate heat-treated case hardened barrels. All of our barrels are over 2x’s harder than MIL-SPEC  and hammer forged barrels. We know of a few weapons that have 40,000 plus rounds through them, and still no need to replace the barrel.

• What is the recommended break-in procedure for my POF barrels?
There is no break-in required. When you first get your weapon clean the barrel properly using proper cleaning equipment prior to shooting. After shooting properly clean the barrel using proper cleaning equipment. The barrels are case-hardened Nitrate heat-treated to 70 RC. All of our barrels are over 2x’s harder than stainless steel, MIL-SPEC and hammer-forged barrels, and 10x’s more corrosion resistant."

This is clearly a special order gun with target stocks, target hammer and target trigger and a McGivern gold bead front sight. It is a 4 screw model shipped in 1958 as stated in the factory letter, which is included in the purchase.

The revolver is in excellent condition, as can be seen in the pictures. Stocks are in excellent condition too with some marks on the left side probably from ejecting spent casings. It is in perfect mechanical condition.

The only major flaw I can see is a very small scratch, about 1mm in length, right below ""Wesson"" on the left side of the barrel."

So not sure that I want to trade, but I'm going to post this anyway to see what offers I get...The only pistols I would be willing to trade for is one with a hammer that I could bet my life and families life on....My glock 23 has 3 mags, box and can throw in holster. The trade needs to be the same 3 mags with holster. My glock does show holster wear as I carry it every where I go, it stays with me. So if you're looking for a glock that's in tip top shape and extravagant, well that's not me (that's not saying that my glock isn't cared for and hasn't been cleaned, cause it's important to keep your stuff clean and cared for). There is no point in having a gun if you wont/don't carry it and/or use it. I cant tell you how many rounds have been through it so don't ask. All I can say is it's a glock and it eats any ammo I've put in it...as far as caliber goes, I prefer 40, but if you have different caliber, I'll trade my ammo for your ammo...I'm in Winston salem, and I'm not looking to go out past Greensboro or too far out past Yadkinville. So if interested, or have something to offer then you can email me or text me at 336-seven 0 five - 3 one 2 four. Thanks for any interest...

This has been shot a few times at the range for test fire.  Purchased as a gift for wife.  It was a ""bad choice"" surprise.  She prefers jewelry!
My loss, your gain for an asking price of $540.00 with no sales tax (that saves you a lot of money).  For a local purchase, I use L.E.P.D shooting range at 999 Bethel Road, Columbus Ohio 43214 and we can do gun purchase from me there and you can test fire at the same time.  Purchase being made through mail must be sent to F.F.L dealer for you to pickup and have back ground check made.   F.F.L. dealers charges can be as low as $20 and sometimes less.  Some are higher.  You can shop around before having gun transferred.

This is a preferred ""women's"" pistol because it is very pretty and easy to handle and fire.
It doesn't mean a guy can't own it but it does look very flashy in appearance.
I also have a HOUGE Grip for this pistol for an extra $10.  Picture available upon request.  That's at least half what you would pay buying off the shelf.  The Houge grip is very comfortable.  I use one on my Sig P238 Sport model."

For AR and carbine shooters, Burris bundles a 3 MOA FastFire III with the rugged AR-F3 mount. It’s the simplest and most effective way to mount any FastFire on an AR flattop as a stand-alone sight or as a co-witness for iron sights. The FastFire sits low in the mount and a pair of metal wings on each side of the lenses protects the sight from impact or unintentional abuse. For added convenience, a lower compartment offers storage for a spare battery, open-end wrench and Torx® wrench. Fits any Weaver or Picatinny-style base.

There are three very small, light, marks on the compensator visible in the picture. They are very light and he has no idea where they came from. I could have touched them up with bluing and you'd be none the wiser. However I thought it best to let the end user decide if they care about it, and if so how they want to deal with it, if at all. 

I'm not a collector, and every gun I own I run the snot out of. After purchasing a new unfired sig p210 and unfired 8"" blue python, both of which I promptly traded for guns I would shoot (I think I traded the p210 for an LWRC REPR, and the python for a SCAR) I decided no more guns in my collection I'd be afraid to shoot. 

 like I said above, we will entertain offers. This isn't a ""need to sell"", it's a ""could use the room so if it sells great."" But I also want to be fair. We are fine shipping FFL to FFL or if you're local can meet at an FFL convenient to both of us.

Please no shotguns or .22 unless it's coming with a lesser value handgun bundle. The ammo alone cost me 74.99 plus tax so please no ballers you won't even get a response. Put a deal together and let's trade! Texting is fine 937-760-8781 thanks

TOOK it to Cabela's for evaluation. They have one there in a little better condition for $1500. Based on their evaluation I am dropping the price to a more realistic amount remembering a have 40 of the rare rounds to go with. $700

Stock Configuration & Condition: The stock is original condition and original finish wood. The wood to metal fit is proud at the tangs which would allow for refinish. There is darkening of the wood. There are scattered marks and depressions, there are a couple of cracks. This is good for an old Winchester.
Type of Finish: Blue & Case Color Hardened Finish Originality: Factory Original.
The bore is almost bright and the rifling is a bit worn. 
This rifle retains about 60% of its Factory Original metal finish. The balance of the finish shows thinning on the barrel edges and a general light drift to patina. The frame shows a bit more thinning of the finish, with some muted case colors. There is a screw missing. The markings are crisp. Overall, this rifle rates in about good condition.

I have fired the rifle and it is quieter than my air rifle. Although this one is chambered for 22 short (I have 40 rounds left which I will include), it will receive a 22 LR. Some of these where chambered/stamped for 22 LR.

I would consider an interesting trade plus cash to equal the asking price.  Thanks for looking. I have other photos on serious request.

Wiki history: The Winder musket was the brainchild of Colonel C. B. Winder, who advocated marksmanship training with a rifle of similar size and weight to a service rifle but chambered in .22 rimfire, which was both economical and suitable for indoor ranges. The Winder musket was based on the Winchester Model 1885 single shot rifle.

Although it was never officially referred to as the Winder musket, the weapon was informally named in honor of Colonel C. B. Winder, and has since generally been referred to as the Winder musket.
Winder muskets were used for target and training purposes well into the early Twentieth Century. Many were purchased by the United States Ordnance and many were issued to American N.R.A. affiliated rifle clubs. The Winder musket was superseded by the 1922 Model bolt-action training rifle, and remaining Winder muskets were sold."

If it sells today, I'll throw in 3-30rd Magpul magazines, 1-20rd Magpul magazine, and 60rds of 5.56 ammo.


Brand new, never fired AR Pistol.

A great deal of thought and consideration was put into the design of this pistol, and all of the components selected were chosen specifically with performance and ergonomics in mind. This is NOT your neighbor's uncomfortable and clumsy slapped-together gun-show AR pistol.

I started with a matched Anderson Mfg AM-15 lower and A3 upper set, and paired that with a DPMS lower parts kit. The match grade 10.5"" Rainier Arms .223 Wylde heavy barrel (.223 Rem/5.56 NATO) and GunTec low profile gas block fit perfectly under the 10"" full floating quad rail handguard with integrated forward QD sling point.

Under the hood is a PSA full auto nickel boron bolt carrier group for extended performance and easy cleaning, coupled with an extended tactical latch charging handle. Unlike the constant problems people have with shorter pistol-length gas systems, this has a carbine-length gas system to ensure dependable operation and perfect timing. Fully headspaced with both Go and No-Go gauges.

The extended buffer tube with positive stop keeps the Sig Brace firmly in place, standing it off a bit from the back of the receiver for a very comfortable shouldered position, and won't interfere with a QD sling. That, in combination with the Magpul K2 grip which is canted forward to a more vertical angle makes this AR ""pistol"" as close to a super comfortable SBR as you can legally get without crossing into NFA regulations.


This AR pistol already has all of the upgrades you would have to pay extra for, when buy a ""standard"" off the shelf or cheaply built AR pistol and realize how uncomfortable and inaccurate it is. Does NOT disappoint.

Included:

Anderson Machine AM-15 Lower w/ DPMS LPK
Anderson Machine A3 Upper
Rainier Arms UltraMatch .223 Wylde Barrel - 10.5""
GunTec Low Profile Gas Block
Full Floating 10"" Quad Rail Forearm

SigTac Sig Brace SB-15, w/ ATF Compliance Letters
Magpul MOE K2 Pistol Grip - More comfortable angle for short LOP weapons
Magpul MOE Trigger Guard
Magpul ASAP-QD Quick Detach End Plate



NOT Included:
- Muzzle brake/flash hider - I bought a Ferfrans CRD for this build but never mounted it, and I'm keeping it for the next build.
- Optics/Sights - I put an Eotech on this without any BUIS, and I'm keeping that too.

2nd owner of this Ruger New Model Single Six revolver 6.5', barrel, .22 Magnum / 22 WMR caliber, Adjustable rear site, wood grips and comes with a heavy-duty leather hunter's holster reading 'DG 206' on the back. Going by the serial # of 67-002xx & looking on the Ruger site (link below) it appears the pistol was made 1979 or 1980. There is a little holster rub in a few small areas but over-all condition is very good inside & out. It's been a safe queen & well taken cared of & stored in a clean dry case. 
The hammer is heavy and the lock up is tight. Please review the photos for condition.
