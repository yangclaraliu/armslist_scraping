Elzetta calls this light the scorcher. You can check it out on the web. Last is the AIMSHOT LS8300 green laser. These are only sold to SOF on military letterheads only. You can contact Jeff at AIMSHOT in Atlanta to verify. This one came from Afghanistan by a close friend of mine who is a SFO. Its the brightest laser you have ever seen and yes it will light a match and get you thrown under the jail. You can follow the beam at night and the dot is crazy bright.

Introducing the SIG556xi, rewriting the standard for modularity, reliability, and performance for the modern rifle platform. 

Based on the legendary SG 550, the SIG556xi will change the way military, law enforcement, and responsible citizens look at adaptable rifles. Utilizing the time-tested rotating bolt and adjustable gas piston operating system, the SIG556xi allows operators a choice of caliber, barrel length, handguard/stock configurations and lower receivers. 

A removable barrel allows the operator to select the necessary length for a given mission. Adding the appropriate bolt, the SIG556xi can be changed to any of three calibers, 5.56x45mm NATO, 300 Blackout, and 7.62x39mm NATO. Users can also quickly change out the non-serialized lower receiver, allowing the use of either AR-style STANAG magazines or rock-and-lock AK-style magazines. The SIG556xi upper receiver is the serialized part, making the lower an easy to purchase part. 

Polymer handguards accept all Magpul® light and rail kits, while the aluminum and carbon fiber handguards accept 2”, 4”, and 6” M1913 rails. Barrels are available in 10”, 14.5”, and 16”. Truly ambidextrous, the SIG556xi features an ambi safety selector, magazine release and user swappable charging handle (right- or left-handed). Optional receiver end plates allow for the use of either AR receiver extension tubes and buttstocks or M1913 compatible stocks"

Here's the perfect package, ready to go.

Savage 11/111 Bolt Action rifle; lightweight hunter model--weighs 5.5lbs; lightweight laminate stock, fluted bolt, 4-round magazine.

Chambered in 6.5 Creedmore; this cartridge is a flat, fast, accurate round with very light recoil. Ammo is commercially available from Hornady--not that you'd need any for a while, as the rifle will come with 211 rounds of ammo (and 9 empty cases); 111 rounds of 140gr Hornady A-Max, 100-rds of 129gr Hornady Superformance SST.

Glass is a Leupold VX-I, 3-9x40 in Leupold mounts.

And, finally, it all comes in a Plano Protector hard case. All manuals included.

I am selling this rifle for a friend, but I have shot it--it shoots very, very well; accuracy is, like all Savage rifles, excellent. He bought it for a hunting trip out west that didn't materialize.

Prefer the seller has PTP/PTC."

HK45
The HK45 was developed as a product improvement of the highly regarded USP45, first released in the 1995. The Caliber .45 ACP HK45 includes several user-inspired enhancements including changeable grip panels (backstraps), a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 accessory rail, better ergonomics, and more ambidextrous controls.

Along with the HK45 Compact, the HK45 was developed as a possible candidate for the Joint Combat Pistol (JCP) and Combat Pistol (CP) programs administered by the U.S. military in their search for a new service handgun to replace the 9-millimeter M9. These programs were suspended before completion and no pistols were selected.

The HK45 uses an HK proprietary O-ring barrel for precise barrel-to-slide lockup and optimal accuracy. HK45 barrels are made using the famous HK cold-hammer forging process for superior performance."

It has been sitting in my safe since I bought it (I haven't even shot it) and it is in great condition. I hate when people call a used gun new but this one is close to new as you will get.

When I say ""converted"", I don't mean that some parts were added.  This gun has had some serious work done to it.  The FCG has been moved forward.  The trigger is probably the lightest trigger you will shoot with a shotgun.  Breaks like glass.  The bolt, carrier, and FCG have been polished for increased reliability with low brass ammo.  Also unlike most saigas, you can load this one with the bolt forward.  Most saiga shotguns have to be loaded with the bolt locked to the rear.  This gun also has work done to the piston and gas port.  I have shot bulk walmart Federal through it with no issues.  It has an ACE folding stock along with an ACE folding mechanism.  Most of these so called ""converted"" saigas just have some cheap buttstock and pistol grip added.  This actually makes the gun quite bulky.  Comes with 3 10 round magazines.

Like I have said earlier I am in no rush to sell.  I know what they are going for.  I know what I want for it.  If you don't like it than move on.  This gun was done right by professional gunsmiths that specialize in AK type weaponry.  I don't need emails from people trying to compare it to some cheesy version they saw on Gunbroker.  This gun will out shoot 90% of guns on Gunbroker.  If you have a serious offer please feel free to send me an email  Thank you for looking."
