This pistol has been flawless...It runs as smooth as silk, easy to rack the slide, easy to re acquire targets, and very accurate. ... and with its size and weight it can be used as a bludgeoning weapon if you run out of ammo...lol....All kidding aside this pistol is a pleasure to shoot.

For those who don't know, the vz58 is a czech rifle designed in 1958 to adopt the 7.62x39. While it looks like an ak in silhouette it shares no parts. It has a short stroke gas system akin to the sks, a striker fire trigger mechanism, and take down pins similar to the ar15. It is also a milled receiver with a last round bolt hold open system.  Sks stripper clips can be used to charge the mags as well."

For sale is a Marlin 81 DL (Deluxe) .22 rifle.  

Known originally as the  “.22 Cal Bolt Action Repeater Model 81-DL”; this is a rare tube fed bolt action that can hold 25 short, 20 long, or 18 long rifle .22 rounds.  

The rifle features a 24” round tapered blued steel barrel with Ballard type rifling and a crowned muzzle.  

It also has an American walnut military-type finish and one piece buttstock.  

It has what I believe is an original Williams peep sight on the receiver which has both windage and elevation adjustments.  This rifle also features a ramp front sight.  

The wood on this rifle is immaculate as is the finish which I think to be all original.

I’ve been digging on the internet (uh-oh) and based on that believe I have narrowed the age of the rifle down.  Somewhere after ~1952 Marlin switched to Microgroove barrels.  This is not stamped as having that barrel which makes me believe the rifle was built between 1941 – 1952.  It also appears to have the “beavertail stock” which was standard from 1941 – 1942.  That makes me think it was made from 1941 – 1942.  

I had it to the range last year and had no issues with it.  I filled it with .22 LR rounds and had a good day at the range.  I then brought it home, cleaned it, oiled it, and there it has sat.  These days I’m oriented toward .308’s and distance shooting so this is for sale.  

This was built in an era when quality mattered and things were meant to last and be handed down many generations.  It was also built at a time when craftsman knew the value of a solid rifle that wouldn’t fail.  When you hold this it feels like a real rifle and not a dainty piece of plastic that might get brittle in the cold.

These are not easy to find anymore.  They are a lot of fun each time they offer the opportunity for functionality and nostalgia to meet in an ignition of powder.  

This tube fed .22 was designed to look like the popular M1 Carbine on what is basically the proven frame of a Marlin Model 99.  

I believe this rifle was manufactured between 1964 – 1968; I am basing that on this model starting production in 1964 and it having no serial number – which was required after 1968.  

The rear sight on this rifle is intact.  These alone are highly sought after by Model 99 – M1 collectors.  

I did another inspection of the rifle and I think even the leather sling is an original.  

“Starting in 1964, Marlin produced a modified variant of their popular Model 99 rimfire rifle, stylized to look and feel like the WWII- M1 Carbine. They took the standard 22-inch barrel of the design and cut it down to 18, the same length as the M1. This also produced an overall length of 37-inches, within a bullet's length of the original. Since the Marlin was a .22LR and not a .30 carbine, the action and barrel were lighter, at 4.75-pounds. Forgoing the detachable box magazine of the M1, Marlin kept the under barrel tube mag but shortened it to hold just 10-rounds to keep the profile of the gun similar. A stock redesign and military style ramp sights completed the transformation.”

Offered for your consideration is a beautiful Mossberg Model 320B Boy Scout Target Rifle. It is a single shot and is chambered for the .22 Short, Long & Long Rifle cartridges. Manufactured from 1960 until 1971, this model was very popular with beginning shooters. One of the main attractions which made this model an excellent fit for young, beginning, shooters was the automatic safety feature. When the action is opened, and the bolt pulled rearward, it engages a lever which moves the safety into the “Safe” mode. 

Overall, this rifle is in excellent condition showing very little signs of use. With Christmas rapidly approaching, and with the receiver grooved for tip off scope mounts, plus the Mossberg S330 peep sight, it would make an excellent present for a young, upcoming, hunter or possibly competitive shooter. Or for that matter, it would be an excellent addition, or upgrade, to a Mossberg .22 caliber collection. Additional pictures upon request.

As you can see in the pictures, this is the blued model with the ""Kim-Pro"" finish. I purchased this gun from the original owner that ran very few rounds through it for the Break In period. The gun does not show wear from ever being carried. It was well kept and cleaned after every time it was took out to shoot. This is basically Kimber's finest .45 when it comes to 1911's and certainly packs a punch. It does include the original box as well as all paperwork and the gun does come furnished with factory night sights. If you have any questions, feel free to call or ask. Thanks for looking and have a great day!

Local because I don't want to ship. Second, let me start off by mentioning that I'm not interested in selling the Beretta- it's up for trade only. Not for sale. I'm not in a hard spot for cash, thank God; I only want to trade this safe queen for:
a decent AK47 type rifle, Saiga, WASR
a good 5.56x45/.223 bolt gun
a good 7.62x51/.308 bolt gun
a pair of black powder Confederate Navy pistols with accessories
If your trade isn't up to value, make it up in cash. 

Second, I appreciate all the interesting offers but I'm pretty firm about what I'd trade it for. 

Beautiful deeply blue/black Beretta 92F Compact with walnut grips, in the factory box with manual, cleaning brush and two 15-rd magazines. They will be blocked to 10-round capacity before transfer BUT, if you someday move to a free state, you can remove the blocks for the original standard load of 15 rounds. 

Included are the factory plastic box, 2 cleaning brushes, manual, 2 CA-compliant magazines (formerly 15-round mags but currently neutered to 10 rounds) and a Blackhawk SERPA holster.

Sorry; no shipping. Handguns have to be shipped by an FFL to an FFL. It's too much of a pain in the ass to deal with due to stupid California laws.

- 1200 Rounds of 5.56 NATO PMC X-Tac 62 Grain Green Tip- L/Armor Piercing
- 1000 Rounds of 5.56 NATO PMC X-Tac X193 Ball (Red Lacquered for Waterproofing) 
- 900 Rounds of 5.56 NATO American Eagle 5.56 NATO on Stripper Clips 
- Full Auto Takedown Pins
- I have the Sear for this AR to go Full Auto. You must have an NFA Class III Permit, and a CCW. 

I am looking for around $5,350 for all of this above. The gun alone is worth more than that including the PMAG's which you have to either be Law Enforcement or Military to purchase. I am including 25 of them. You will also be getting $1200 worth of AMMO. 

Call me if you are interested. This rifle is owned by an Captain (O-3) Marine so it has been shot well, never abused, and this rifle CLEAN and lubricated. If you are looking for a $1200 AR, I have one to sell to you, but it's not this one. If you are looking for a $3000 AR, I have one for sale,but again, it's not this one. 

Call me or Text Me at REDACTED. 

Thank you,

.22 Long Rifle Conversion Kit for 20/21

FACT:  You will have paid for your ADVANTAGE ARMS, INC. conversion kit after shooting 1000 rounds of .22LR.

Why buy an ""Advantage Arms"" .22LR Conversion Kit?

It allows you to shoot inexpensive .22 Long Rifle ammunition so that you can shoot longer and more often.
Turns your Glock or 1911 into an ideal pistol for first time shooters.
Makes a great tool for teaching women and young adults how to safely shoot a pistol without the intimidation of larger calibers.
Less destructive to targets and surrounding structures when used for law enforcement training.
Advantage Arms .22LR kits come with our exclusive ""Last Round Lock Open"" feature not offered by other manufacturers.
Made In The USA


********* 
EXCLUSIVE FEATURES OF OUR CONVERSION KIT:  Six great reasons to purchase our .22 LR conversion kit

1.  ADJUSTABLE SIGHTS
The front and rear sights are removable GLOCK style sights. The rear sight is adjustable for both windage and elevation. 

2.  LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR Conversion Kits for the GLOCK pistol.

3.  INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4.  FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5.  THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot."

Daewoo Precision Industries K2 assault rifle was developed by the, South Korean, Agency for Defense Development and manufactured by S&T Motiv (formerly Daewoo Precision Industries). It is currently the standard service rifle of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces. Shoulder-fired and gas-operated, the K2 is capable of firing both 5.56x45mm NATO and .223 Remington ammunition. The K2 supplanted the M16A1assault rifle for the Republic of Korea Armed Forces since its adoption in 1984. 

Comes with a Chinese Norinco 120rd AR-15 or Daewoo drum magazine chambered in .223 or 5.56mm. These were most likely made for the Daewoo series of rifles but will fit any AR-15 rifle. Made just like the standard AK-47 drum magazines, these are durable, easy to load, and can be kept loaded and unwound for many years. The C-Products or cheaper polymer double-snail drums require lubrication and constant maintenance for reliable operation – not these. They will run, and run, and run . . . round after round . . . and almost never fail to fire. These of course were imported well before the Clinton ban (1989 era) and so are “pre-ban” – never to be imported again due to the arms restrictions with China."

The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."

For sale here is a very special package deal for the right person. This gun comes with all of the accessories listed below and is competition ready. It also comes with about 500 rounds of 38spl loaded ammo, and about 200 rounds of 357mag loaded ammo. This gun was used to shoot IDPA and Steel Challenge matches. It is in pristine condition with only slight cylinder wear. The cylinder has been machined to accept moon clips, but can still be used without them as well. The trigger is an excellent crisp double action pull and a hair single action. The gun is about 3 years old and has about 1500 rounds through it at best. I have the original box and papers for the gun as well as all of the stock parts. Bid with confidence, as this is a truly wonderful gun, and I will miss it, but I am looking to get into photography and want to buy a new camera. So something has to go! Any questions please feel free to email me, I will have pics available of detail of the gun as well.

The Tactical variant of the SP-01 utilizes an ambidextrous decocker in place of the manual safety on the standard SP-01.

The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.61” bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV)."
