Firearm Transfer Fee is $15 for 1st transaction, each additional firearm is $10
Transfers for Law Enforcement, Fire Fighters (active or retired) is $10
We accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Cash, Money Orders
You should contact us prior to and after purchasing if having a firearm shipped to us.​

Transfer Infomation for local Idaho Customers
Incoming Transfers from a FFL dealer:  We are already listed with most online retailers on their FFL listings, If not I will need to know how they accept a copy of my FFL licence usually either through fax or email, although some dealers require a hardcopy mailed to them. After I send a copy of my FFL licence to the dealer they will ship the firearm to me, I require that the shipping dealer include a copy of their FFL licence and your contact information with the shipment. When the firearm arrives I will contact you and you will need to come to my office to fill out the paperwork.The process is simple, you come in fill out the ATF 4473, present your picture ID or carry permit and I handle all the paperwork, do all the checks required and get you on your way. Generally this process takes no longer than 15 munutes. 

If Purchasing from an Individual
I will send the individual an email with the first 3 and the last 5 digits of my FFL licence, and a link to the ATF web site to verify my shipping address. I will also need the individual to send me a copy of their drivers licence (which must have a physical address on it, no PO boxes). When the firearm arrives I will contact you and you will need to come to my office to fill out the paperwork so we can transfer the firearm to you.
​
Outgoing Transfers
If you have sold a firearm that needs to be shipped out of state it can only be shipped to an FFL. I will need a copy of the FFL's licence, and what type of firearm you are shipping. We generally have shipping boxes for Handguns available at no extra charge, for Long guns you may need to provide a box or there will be a small extra charge for us to buy a box for you.

Important Note on Outgoing Transfers
In the case of firearms shipments there is no law that prevents an individual from shipping a firearm to an FFL holder. Some FFL's do not accept shipments from individuals (We Do), and handguns need to be shipped next day air through shipping companies. The fact that as an FFL we can ship handguns through the USPS, it is sometimes cheaper for you to pay our transfer fee plus the shipping then to ship it yourself. There will also be times where it might be cheaper for you to ship a firearm to an FFL yourself. It depends on the type of firearm, and the distance it is traveling.
Just remember you can only ship a firearm to a Federal Firearms Licensee. When in doubt check the laws or give us a call and we will try to assist you.

Any questions or inquires please feel free to call or email us.

 In 2003 the gunsmiths and engineers at Smith & Wesson wanted to deliver maximum power for serious handgun hunters. The power they sought required an entirely new frame, the massive ""X-Frame™,"" and was the basis for the new Model S&W500™, the most powerful production revolver in the world.  This ushered in the era of the ""big gun"" and was only the beginning.   For ultimate power and velocity there's nothing even close to an X-Frame model handgun.

We have a small number left with no guarantee that after this one selles, another one will be available. The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

 The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

It's the original gold anodized barrel. Selling because I have put together another setup for myself. Obviously well cared for and competition ready. This is my 4th modified 22/45 Lite.

Has an 18"" barrel - snipe zombies from 500+ yards like the badass you are.
Shoots .308 - fuck yea, big stopping power.

4x-16x optic - BEC Gold Label optic - not great, but you will have no issues seeing and stopping those zombie motherfuckers before they get close. 

10 twenty round mags - Need to stop lots of zombies? Got you covered.

I've shot 60 rounds through it.  It was fucking awesome.  Don't have the space to use the full potential of this gun.  Want something else I can use more regularly.

The rail system is UTG and is one-piece that comes off easily and is made for a mini, as itslides rigth over the front of the barrel/stock.

The serial numbers start with 186-630xxx indicating that this is the model run from 1991-1999 I believe and this gun was made in 97/98.

Take off the stock and the true ""mini"" is in incredible shape. The last two pics show the internal front and back of the chamber and I couldn't get my camera to take a decent pic of the inside of the barrel but it is bright, shiny and the rifling is great. The gun shoots perfectly. The action is smooth and crisp. The magazine go in tight and crisp and snaps right into place, where I've had other minis that you fought with the darn thing to get it in there.

The barrel and top of the gun are very very clean and the only blemishes on the thing are a couple nicks on the suppressor and the stock has use marks.

This would be a perfect gun to throw an optic on and use as it is or to take off the stock and rails, sell them, and build whatever you want. I'd put a tactical folding stock on it from tapco or some other brand and just use a regular scope mount with a 3-9x30 myself. Or one could just put a nice red dot on the upper rail of this setup and go.

Anyhow, I hope this better explains the gun. I wish I had the original stock for it, but I don't. The nice thing about these mini's is that there are hundreds of cheap things that can be done to customize them on ebay, amazon and all over. Or if someone wanted a cheap really light mini, take off the rails in about 5 minutes and use the peep sights and go spray some lead at the coyotes.

$500 and thanks for looking. 

Any questions or more pics, call/text (515) 6six4-5nine78. Thanks."

Here's all you need to defeat the Taliban when they come to terrorize your coffee shop!

A Mossberg 500A 12-GAUGE PUMP SHOTGUN with Pistol grip and Shoulder stock, a Blackhawk Tactical sling with 15-rd shell holder, and 60-rounds of 12-gauge ammo!

Comes with 25-rds of Winchester #4-shot, 15-rds of Remington OO-buck, 5-rds of Remington Rifled Slugs, 10-rds of Federal #4-Buck, and 5-rds of Federal Rifled Slugs. All are 2-3/4-inch.

It takes 2-3/4"" or 3-inch shells. The magazine holds (7)  2-3/4-in shells. Pistol grip and forend is the new Hogue ""TAMER"" model which reduces most of the recoil. Also includes a synthetic shoulder stock for hunting.

I've had it a couple of years and it's only had about 14-rounds through it. I don't forsee needing it so I'm selling it to buy some new toys. It's in beautiful condition with only a few minor nicks on the reciever.

This model has a Steel shell follower in the magazine instead of a plastic one.

Selling it for $335-CASH ONLY.  (Keep in mind, you're getting over $60 worth of ammo too!) (I really want cash, but might consider a trade if it was a modern gun or guns worth at least $500 or more)

Be advised, to buy this gun from me you must be a Florida Resident, at least 21-years old, have a current Florida Driver's License or Florida CWP, and sign a handwritten ""Bill Of Sale"" with your Florida DL, or Florida CWP number on it. I have a Florida CWP and will provide the same for your personal records.

This gun was bought new by me and it has been shot. I am a user of my guns and this one only shows cosmetic wear as the gun has had the springs replaced a few years ago when I got my gen4 guns and put in the safe. Only reason I am selling is because I actually have come to like the gen4 guns better which surprised me in the end. This gun was ceraplated a few years prior to me stopping carrying it and it shows scuff marks on the slide but these are not gouges or grooves, they are just scuff marks from the fobus holster I used to carry it in. This gun has all of the original ""pre"" mim parts in it just like it came from Glock, nothing has been replaced to fool you. It is one of the few 2 pin framed gen3 guns before all of them went to 3 pin frames. This gun has been flawless from day one and I really hate to see it go but I have come to like the gen4 better so I do not need it. I am going to include the following items with the gun;

installed Factory Glock steel sights 
Glock ext slide release & standard slide release
Glock ext mag release
grip plug
2 new mags
extra new recoil spring
extra new trigger mech housing with 336 extractor
2 extra black spring loaded bearings for this era gun

This gun was never under the E series recall as I had checked that back when I bought it. I have the original box with matching serial number, cleaning kit and original owners manuel with it as well. Asking $425.00 shipped to your fll. I know this may sound a bit high, but if you factor in the extra parts (which is over $40.00 new), ceraplate slide ($70.00 back then) and minus that off of the gun, the price is comparable to a used gun that has been shot. Anyone interested please email me first with any questions or ""i will take its"" as I do not check this forums every hour. NO TRADES, I need the cash and the gun will ship from my ffl to yours. A postal money order will work for payment.. If you need anymore pics, just let me know. Thanks for looking"

This is a Stevens 620 12ga shotgun designed by John Browning himself. These Stevens with the 20"" barrels saw action in WWII and were popular stateside as well. This is an EARLY serial number (under 350) so it's a classic. This one has the much more sought after early buttstock and ribbed forend as well. 

These shotguns easily breakdown into 2 pieces in about 2 seconds with no tools, making them perfect for backpackers, preppers or people transporting them in small car trunks or under truck seats. The finish on the wood on this gun has to be seen. It has that dark, rich, lived-in look. 

You need this gun. I'm only trading it because I have too many guns that I don't shoot. This one is such a classic that I just don't take it out much, but when I do, it's amazing. The action is like butter, or a Swiss watch. Hard to explain but when you rack it you feel the kind of workmanship that is hard to find on today's guns. Also, decades of use have the inner workings nice and worked in for you. The trigger is also crisp and true. 

Anyway, I hate to sell it so I'd rather trade it for something my kid or I will use so take a look at the list below but PLEASE feel free to offer any trades you think of. I'm open to whatever. If you don't have a trade and you absolutely NEED this gun, then shoot me an offer and I might take it, but I'm more in to trading guns than selling them."

Description:    Up for auction is an AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout.  A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary .223/5.56mm  magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and a 16inch barrels.


Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard"

I haven't weighted the pull yet but I would put it at 2.5-3lbs. And the reset is perfect. It comes in the original case, with 2 original mags, but I have plenty more 1911 mags laying around that I could throw in to sweeten the deal if needed and I mean quality mags. Chip McCormicks, Springfields, Kimbers, Colts, etc. And last but not least...... It's also equipped with a brand new Crimson Trace Rail Master Pro (the green laser/light and strobe combo). One of if not the best handgun combo lights out on the market. I paid $300.00 for mine and still have the original box with all of the paperwork. I will list the specs below.

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. Our exclusive ArmorLokt™ process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in."
