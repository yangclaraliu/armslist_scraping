Kel Tec KSG 12 Gauge Pump Action Shotgun, 12+1 Rounds, Dual Magazines, Picatinny Rail
***PLEASE NOTE: The folding sights pictured ARE NOT INCLUDED with this shotgun.****
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.
The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Winchester 534REDACTED Carbine Lever-Action .44 Mag Rifle, 20″ Barrel, Blued Finish, Walnut Stock

The Winchester® Model 1892 has been featured in many Western movies and was the favorite of John Wayne and Chuck Connors. It is considered by many as the smoothest, most compact, handiest and most handsome lever-action ever offered. The Model 1892 is the compact model of the venerable Model 1886. For 2011, this exquisite rifle features a 20″ round, deeply-blued and polished barrel, receiver and lever. The full-length tubular magazine balances the rifle perfectly. The stock is solid walnut, cut in a straight grip style for fast handling.

Not many firearm models today can boast of having had over one million produced. The Winchester Model 1892, very similar in construction to the Winchester Model 1886, is one of these famous lever-action rifles. It is much like a compact or carbine model of the famous 1886 and has the same dual, vertical locking system for impressive strength. Many of its components have been scaled down and simplified to handle the smaller calibers, and here is where this nostalgic rifle shines. It is famous for its light weight, low recoil and responsive, easy handling. It displays a genius of design that makes it a modern-day treasure. The Winchester Model 1892 features a beautifully finished walnut stock, blued barrel and receiver, finely fit with precision and pride.

I'm going to be moving (and my wife has suggested that I don't build guns in our bedroom), so I'd rather aquire another bench on the other side of the move.

Bought it at Harbor Freight. So it's not engineered for the 100 years war. But it does the job for the price.
I'll include all of the pegboard gismos to hang your tools. I've got a baggie full of them. 
I already assembled it for you. I can take the top half off and you can take it away in a car or truck and safe the 1.5 hrs of reading the translated from Chinese directions. I'm pretty handy and I wanted to stab the clown in the eyes after readying the ""assembling instruction"" in the box.

It goes on sale randomly. The claim was $179 full price, $129 or $99 depending on the coupons or whatever bull they claim each monthly blowout sale. I'm pretty sure I paid $100, tax, bought two packs peg tool hangers from Home Depot, and the high density foam matting and have $140-$150 into it."

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of brand new, factory fresh, and hard to find Ruger Blackhawk Flattop .45 acp/ .45 Colt revolvers.  These beautiful revolvers feature a 5.5″ barrel, polished stainless steel construction, faux-ivory grips, and of course come with both a .45 acp cylinder as well as a .45 colt cylinder.

Ruger Blackhawk Flattop Revolver, 45 ACP / 45 Long Colt, 5.5″ Barrel, Ivory Grip, Stainless Finish, 6 Round, Convertible Cylinders- Ruger 5241
The mid-size Ruger 5241 Blackhawk Flattop sixguns are some of the finest packing guns ever produced. The original 357’s and the wildly popular 44 Specials have been highly prized for their smaller dimensions and great balance. Now, you can have this classic revolver in the most classic sixgun cartridge of them all, the 45 Colt.

This is the first Ruger Flattop made in stainless steel with a 5-1/2″ barrel and is the first stainless steel Flattop chambered in 45 Colt. As of right now, this is the only Ruger 45 Colt stainless steel single action revolver with adjustable sights being produced. The regular stainless steel Blackhawk in 45 Colt was discontinued by Ruger several years ago.
As a bonus, we spec’d out these guns to include an auxillary 45 ACP cylinder. This production run will also feature “gunfighter” style simulated ivory grips that Ruger has used on some of their special edition guns, such as the Joe Bowman commemorative. For those of you who don’t like the “cheesegrater” (as some people call them) black plastic grips that have been included on the Flattops, this will be a nicer feel. The front sights on these 45 Colt revolvers are taller than the sights on the 44 Specials revolvers so that there is plenty of elevation available for various bullet weights. On this stainless version, the front sight is pinned into the base so you can switch the front sight out for other heights or configurations that work best for you. All parts, including the gripframe and ejector rod housing are made out of a brushed finish stainless steel.

Pocket pistols and handguns geared towards concealed carry typically lack the features of their larger, easier to shoot service pistol counterparts. That's all changed with the introduction of the Smith and Wesson Bodyguard .380 Automatic. With an actual set of full sized adjustable sights, a practical thumb safety, and a functional slide stop, you aren't giving up anything by switching to a smaller sidearm - except the hassles of carrying a large gun. Unlike most pocket pistols, the slide on the Bodyguard .380 stays open on the last shot. Takedown and maintenance are easy, thanks to the simple to use disassembly lever. The Bodyguard is uniquely engineered to be the most state of the art, concealable and accurate personal protection handgun possible. Lightweight, simple to use, and reliable - nothing protects like a Bodyguard. Specifications and Features: .380 ACP 2.75"" Barrel 6 Round capacity Manual thumb safety Double action High strength polymer frame Stainless steel barrel and slide, Melonite-coated Black finish Ergonomic grip Extended finger tab Stainless steel drift adjustable sights Integrated Insight laser sight"

5 boxes available


SUPERFORMANCE ammunition is loaded with proprietary propellants that increase the velocity ratings up to 200 feet per second compared to other popular brands. Because there is no increase in pressure, regardless of the caliber, there is no increase in felt recoil but there IS an increase in efficiency and high speed performance. From sub-zero arctic temperatures to almost unbearable desert heat, SUPERFORMANCE ammunition can withstand any hunting habitat. 

Loaded with Hornady's InterLock Super Shock Tip (SST) bullet, this round combines proven Hornady performance with a higher ballistic coefficient than available with most hunting bullets. The sharp, pointed polymer tip creates a faster, flatter shooting bullet. With its one-piece core and jacket strengthened in critical areas, the SST delivers much more controlled expansion and superior weight retention than other tipped bullets. Featuring Hornady's trade mark InterLock ring system, this bullet's core and jacket remain locked solid during expansion, creating massive wound channels.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"". This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward. YHM sights shown in picture are not included.

The GLOCK 23 Gen4, in .40, introduces revolutionary design changes to the pistol that combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight-despite its large magazine capacity. The Modular Back Strap design lets you instantly customize its grip to adapt to an individual shooter's hand size. The surface of the frame employs the new scientifically designed, real-world-tested, Gen4 rough textured technology. Internally, the new GLOCK dual recoil spring assembly substantially increases the life of the system. A reversible magazine catch, changeable in seconds, accommodates left or right-handed operators. The G23 Gen4 in .40 caliber retains the GLOCK accessory rail for your attachments.

I think that's a fair price considering it goes for $20 a box if and when you can get it.

Federal law requires that you be 21 years or age or older to purchase a stripped receiver or frame. If a frame or receiver can only be made into a long gun (rifle or shotgun), it is still a frame or receiver not a handgun or long gun. However, they still are ""firearms"" by definition, and subject to the same GCA limitations as any other firearms. See Section 921(a)(3)(b). 18 U.S.C. Section 922(b)(1) makes it unlawful for a licensee to sell any firearm other than a shotgun or rifle to any person under the age of 21.

The concealed carry scene is dominated by small guns that are capable performers, but there are often some basic sacrifices that come with small guns. For the most part, 380s are,  small.  Yet that is their only asset.  The .380 round doesn’t compare favorably with larger calibers.  Yet the relative size has made the .32 and .25 all but obsolete.  Could it be that the new spate of 9mms will crush the .380?  The new Smith & Wesson M&P Shield will help in the effort.  This gun is a rock star.

The only damage on the gun is the slide catch broke, Which I neglected to fix because it doesn't interfere with the gun's firing, and the 13 round magazines keep the firing chamber shut after emptying the firing load regardless.

Serial number equates to a 2007 production.  Black synthetic stocks and receiver are in great shape, as well as the barrel.  Crown in great condition as picture will show.  I can bring a barrel light to verify barrel condition if requested.  Action works smooth, cycles best with pointed soft point ammo, such as Remington Corelokt 130 or Federal 130 gr.  When recently shooting, no FTF’s when using ammo this rifle should be shooting.  It isn’t made to shoot 180 gr blunt tips, etc.  Rifle is great for shooting in woodsy areas when getting off a few quick shots is sometimes needed.

Also included in the sale of this rifle are two new boxes of Federal 130 gr pointed soft point ammo.  No scratches, dents or dings.  Rifle is being sold without iron sights, but with Leupold base installed.  Also included is a brand new set of Weaver bases that fit the 7400.

Will not ship.  Buyer must be willing to meet in Dane County area, present a valid WI Driver’s License OR CCW permit and sign bill of sale.  This bill of sale is not going anywhere except my desk drawer.

Product Description
Patternmaster's LONG RANGE tubes will extend out the end of your barrel 1 inch and has an effective range out to 60 yards. You will see a patterns similar to a Full constriction choke on paper with a 2 ¾"" or 3"" shell and a Modified with a 3 ½"" shell, but because of the patented ""stud ring"" inside the tube, there is a much shorter shot string. This shorter shot string will allow more shot on target all at once so your down range energy is sure to kill instead of cripple. Our LONG RANGE tube can be used with steel or other non-toxic ammunition as well as lead, 2 ¾"" or 3"" or 3 ½"" shells. Pick your favorite shot size to use which can range from 8 to T-Shot Non-Toxic/Steel and Lead 8 to 000 Buck. LONG RANGE tubes are available in Black Ported or Unported, and Silver Ported. Patternmaster tubes are made of Carpenter Custom 630 (aircraft quality) 17-4ph stainless steel and are heat treated to the optimum level for best performance.
Note: Testing done by Ballistics Performance has determined that ammunition with velocity of 1550fps and below will achieve the best results with the Patternmaster Classic and the Code Black Tubes.
Not for use with ammunition containing flight control wad or slug ammunition.
Patternmaster’s 12ga Benelli Crio/Beretta Optima Plus will interchange with Benelli Super Black Eagle II, M2, Ultra Light, and Current Benelli Production Sport II, Super Sport, Cordoba, and Montefeltro; Beretta A391 Extrema II, Vinci, and Super Vinci; and Tri Star 3 ½ (current production); just to name a few. For more information about your shotgun interchange please see the firearm owner’s manual or contact the firearm manufacturer.

This choke is used and shows some wear from screwing in and out, but has no rust and is in great shape.  It is not bent or nicked.

Primarily, I would like to trade for another firearm. Not really interested in anything bolt action.

Don’t need another shotgun, and not necessarily in need of the cash but I’ll sell if the post has been up a sufficient amount of time and I haven’t received any offers that I get excited for. Bear in mind that I will be choosy, and as I work a lot I will reply to your responses when I have an opportunity.  I work at a gun store and know the values of new firearms, so I will not even respond to someone who has inflated the price of a used gun.

I am ONLY looking to do business with mature individuals of integrity and character,. If we make concrete plans for a transaction (I say I'll be there with the gun and/or money at a certain time), keep them. I'll make sure others don't have their time wasted in the future with you if I don't have a good experience; but I'll also sing your praises if you are a man/woman of your word.

A spent cartridge got stuck and when I attempted to hammer the bolt open it ripped off the base of the cartridge leaving a brass tube severely fused to the chamber with nothing to grip on and no way to use a rod to punch it out. I ended up using a little screwdriver and a hammer to bend a part of the shell up enough to get a rod on.  I got the shell out but in the processes I burred up the chamber.  The rifle still fires as is but it jams more than it did, especially with steel cased rounds.  I need to find somebody to smooth out the burrs if possible. I understand there will still be gouges but I think the gun will work better without sharp metal scratching against the rounds as they go in and out. 

The pictures are a little hard to see but what they show are the burrs in the chamber and how the shells look coming out.  If you think you can fix this please email me with a little about your experience and approximate cost, turnover time, and area of city.  Would prefer to stick with Sac area. Keep in mind this is an AK style rifle and it would not be easy to get any kind of tool into the chamber in a straight shot.

This shotgun is almost new and lightly used with only about twenty shells through it. If you are not familiar with this shotgun it is made in Turkey by the same factories that make the Canik CZ75 clones and TP9, Winchester SXP, and many other quality firearms. This is a 5+1 pump action that will chamber 3 inch shells. Has a built in recoil pad and pistol grip, as well as a nice set of fiber optic ghost ring sights, a receiver mounted picatinny rail, a removable breacher choke, and is VERY lightweight. This is a Benelli pattern shotgun and will accept extended benelli magazine tubes. Very similar to a Benelli M3 (sans the semi auto functionality) for a fraction of the cost.

Im interested in several things in trade. Ive had a few shotguns with pistol grips and ring sights and Ive found that I prefer a straight stock with a bead sight. This shotgun retails for $299, Id like to trade it for a similalrly priced 12 gauge shotgun with a straight stock, bead sight, and 18-20 inch cylinder bore barrel, such as a Remington 870, Mossberg 500/maverick 88, winchester sxp, or similar. Only looking for combat/hd style shotguns, absolutely not interested in field guns, sorry.
Might also be interested in a Taurus M85 or similar snub .38 special revolver, or a Polish P-64, or similar PPK style pistol in .32 acp, .380, or 9x18mm. Maybe a Ruger LCP or LC9, Taurus 709 or 740.
Would also be interested in a case of 5.56 ammo or a Vortex Strikefire red dot and magnifier.
Im also looking for a progressive reloading press, my turret is just too slow for the volume I reload.
Might consider other firearms but no .22's or household junk. Looking for a trade value of $300-350, will consider partial trades plus cash.

If not interested in trading I will sell for $200 firm. I also have a decent amount of ammo, 50 shells of buckshot and 50 shells of various birdshot I can include for $50 extra. 

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). 


The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

If you aren't familiar with the Cougar design it is the precursor to the Beretta PX4 and uses a rotating barrel action to improve accuracy and lower recoil.  Identical to the Beretta Cougar aside from the name on the slide; Beretta transferred the tooling and manufacturing equipment to Stoeger, Stoeger being a subdivision of Benelli, which is in turn owned by Beretta.  Has the same manual of arms as a Beretta 92/M9, so its a great choice if you're looking for a more compact version for carry.

Has some light holster wear from being carried but overall is in good shape, bought new about two months ago and only has about 200 rounds through it.  Will come with two 13 round magazines. Depending on what you have I can also include an extra 15 round magazine (modified Beretta 92 mag) and I have a fair amount of 9mm ammo.

Primarily looking for a subcompact 9mm striker fired pistol in trade, really looking for a Ruger SR9c or LC9s (must be the striker fired LC9s, not interested in the standard LC9).  Might also consider a J frame sized .38 special snub, but must have an exposed hammer (S&W 637, Ruger LCRx, etc).  No Tauruses or Kel Tec's please.
