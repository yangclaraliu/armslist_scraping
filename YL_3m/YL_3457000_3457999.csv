Its lightly used and in pretty good shape. Very accurate with minimal recoil, +P rated.

Will include the gun and box it came with, around 50 rounds of assorted .38 special, two Bianchi speed strips, and an ankle holster.

I'm primarily interested in trading it for a Ruger SR40c as the title says, don't really care if its stainless or black. Might also consider a S&W M&P Shield in .40. Primarily interested in compact .40's, but may consider the same guns in 9mm, a Taurus PT92, or a S&W Model 10

Ok. I shot it thursday at the 200 yard gong and it smacked perfect.


ok, I just bought this to do my youtube demonstration with and shoot a box through it if I can handle it that is. I tested one out before and it is about over my limit since I am on blood thinner and bruising is so easy.

I cleaned her up and it still looks like a Mosin. The date says 1938 across the frame. The parts are all same serial with except of the bolt which as we all know parts and parts mades mosins and mosins. The bayonet fits tight.
 The tool bag has some tools in it. There are two leather straps through the rifle frame that are the original ones.

I used Froglube to scrub it from top to bottom then wiped it down several times. I cleaned the bolt, the wood, the furniture, the metal parts, screws, edges, corners, cracks. Everything is as clean as i can get it and not remove any age or coolness. 

This has not been cut or recrowned. This came from a private individual who had it for decades.  It comes in a plastic carry case that fits it nice.

Ok, next. Images tonight when I get them. 
email me with cell number and offer price. You know how much cabelas and other places sell these for and of course condition is everything along with the stamps and markings. Am loading a 200 place holder price 

I have not interpreted the markings. There are many on it. The stock has a star impressed on one side. Other markings on the frame and barrel I need to do some research in. 

I plan on doing my youtube video and photography work. But if you really want this today you can get it. I have shot a few of these and I really can not handle the pounding so I may not shoot it, just image it and do some reading to pass my time.

The vintage tooled leather sling and sling swivels will go with the rifle. We also have some vintage 300 Weatherby ammo that will be for sale to the buyer of the rifle.

The rifle will ship in a hard plastic case for safe transport. Shipping will be a flat $45 to anywhere in the US. Credit and debit card payments add 4%. Ohio residents ad 6.5% sales tax. Please let us know if you have any questions. We are more than happy to chat over the phone or on email. Thank you very much for taking the time to look.

The receiver was manufactured by Inter-Ordnance for their SR-41 project, but sold as an extra when the project was cancelled.  The receiver is well made, but the weld around the front sight isn't pretty. The rear spring latch on these was welded shut, so the action must be opened by removing out the hinge pin.  

Functioning:  This rifle works fine with stick mags, but doesn't feed reliably from the drum I  have.  Looks like an issue with the feed lips on this particular drum, but I'm not sure since I never tested it with any others.  If you like to tinker then this is the rifle for you. As such, it is being sold with the understanding that it is essentially a parts kit but for the price of parts, you get a rare complete receiver and a functioning gun that you can go out and shoot.  Must be transferred through an FFL."

This high velocity 45 acp+P load offers numerous tactical advantages for anyone using their 45 acp pistol for anti-personnel purposes. First, this load is operating at velocities of normal +P 9MM 115gr. ammo, yet it is a 45 caliber, 160gr. bullet. Second, this load will penetrate roughly 15 to 18 inches of penetration in flesh and bone, depending on which bones are hit. Third, this load generates relatively low recoil because of the light weight bullet, which assists in fast follow-up shots. Fourth, we are as per usual, using a low flash powder, so the shooter is not blinded by his own gunfire should he be required to drop the hammer in low light, when the criminal element is most active.

This 45 ACP +P load is safe for use in ALL 45 ACP pistols that are in normal operating condition.

Buffalo Bore always uses factory/real world firearms to establish our published velocities. The industry wide practice of using extra-long laboratory barrels that generate unrealistically high velocities and energy is dishonest to the customer who will rely on the ammunition under “real world” conditions and circumstances, where it matters. See our test velocities below

Users will need to supply a source of compressed air or CO2 (minimum 75 psi, 7 gallon portable air tank recommended) to trigger their systems. If working in remote areas a ""T"" handle bicycle pump and our 1/2 gal aluminum air tank will allow for a very portable triggering system. Note that you will need to outfit your air source with a quick coupler (1/4"" Industrial Interchange) to connect to the hose on the MB IIx3 Manifold/Valve to your air source.

Rifle come with a 5 round detachable magazine that fits nicely in front of the trigger guard, leaving the center of the rifle open for easy handling when firing off-hand, or if you need to push the rifle further up on your shooting bag.   The trigger is the standard single-set that is used on almost all of their centerfire rifles.  There is no need for bases, as all the CZ rifles come with integrated dovetail grooves so they are ready for mounting your scope with the appropriate rings.
The specs on the new .17 Hornady Hornet (.17HH) are impressive.  They list their 20 grain V-Max bullet at velocities in the 3650 feet per second range, with 592 foot pounds of energy.  A box of 25 cartridges will run you about $23.00.  Hornady’s factory ammunition is very accurate, but reloaders can get the cost down to pennies because the cartridge uses very little powder compared to some of the other larger varmint calibers available.

I bought it a few months ago blown up from someone that I knew with intentions of rebuilding it. I had no idea what was actually wrong with it when I bought it, I just knew that it shut off on him after running it hard. After I dug into it, I saw that it jumped time, bent 3 valves, destroyed the piston, and grooved the cylinder.

I just went through the bottom end. I split the cases, got the metal shavings out of the bottom end, checked the oil pump, transmission...etc. I put new main bearings in and a new timing chain in it. The bottom end is ready to go, just needs a PISTON and a CYLINDER HEAD. I bought another cylinder for it since the old one was grooved. It will come with the old cylinder as well. I don't have a head at all. I sold the head for parts, and was going to buy a good used head off of eBay. I have the gaskets for the top end as well as I bought a cometic complete gasket kit for when I had the cases split.

It is white, has the little circle lights and a different hood to cover where the old headlight used to go...It is white carbon fiber.

Has aluminum nerf bars and heel guards, nice aluminum grab bar and front bumper. Has a yoshi slip on exhaust and metal malicia 1 1/8 bars. Quad is in pretty good shape, stock shocks, swinger, axle and a arms...Has holeshots all the way around with about 50-60 percent tread...stock wheels in the back, Douglas aluminum wheels up front with some minor damage.

I am selling it for $1,200. That is a very fair price for what it is...Another 650 bucks and you will have a nice running quad with new internals. $1,200 is what I have into it...I would consider a trade on an AR-10, AR-15, Mini 14, AK-47, or other rifles, maybe a SAIGA 12, 20, or .410...Please no other shotguns . I really could use the extra cash to buy some things for my second vehicle, but again, trades on multiple guns, or a high value gun would intrigue me."

 This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. 
 Features: 
 ** Long-fiber, glass-filled polymer fire control housing helps reduce recoil. 
 ** Aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame with a black synergistic hard coat provides sturdy, rigid support for the cylinder and barrel. 
 ** Extensively fluted 400 series stainless steel cylinder is lightweight and compact. It is treated with an advanced form of Ruger’s Target Grey® finish. 
 ** Cylinder front latching system uses titanium components, optimized spring tension, and enhanced lockup geometry to ensure that the LCR's cylinder stays locked in place during firing. 
 ** Friction-reducing cam fire control system results in non-stacking, smooth trigger pull for this double-action-only revolver. 
 ** Replaceable ramp front and fixed U-notch rear sights. 
 ** Internal lock is hidden unobtrusively under the grip and does not interfere with the fire control mechanism in any way when disengaged. 
 ** Hogue® Tamer grip helps reduce perceived recoil.
