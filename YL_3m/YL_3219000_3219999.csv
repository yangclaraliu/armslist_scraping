FULL BLOWN AS ISSUED SOCOM 300 WIN MAG SNIPER WITH STEINER MILITARY ISSUE 5-25 ALL OPTIONS! SOCOM snipers have been using the 300 win mag for years as one of their go to platforms and now this year 2014 the U.S. Army has officially adopted the .300 WM as their next generation sniper caliber. The US Army has adopted it for their new versions of the M24 SWS and as such a new emphasis was placed on making it an effective cartridge for 1500 meter engagements. The 300 WM is an outstanding cartridge for military sniping but as you might imagine it offers a lot of power and penetration which limits its role in Law Enforcement. The Secret Service does use the .300 WM, but they're situation is rare and unique and they do not typically have to be concerned with hostage situations. They just need to insure that the possible assassin is stopped and the .300 WM is a good caliber to do that.

Civilians don't pay what we do so please stop comparing this special privilege pricing to people who have to pay the new or used retail market pricing.  

We've earned this privilege, but ONLY where we can get it WHEN they have it in stock.  My best friend just told me he feels ""we're"" taking advantage of this and shared his emails... Whoever this jblm guy is (not going to go there), offering him $350 for a lnib MP9 with 4 mags... Then bashing him when he passed... Shameful.  So please STOP trying to buy mil spec or LE spec guns off of NON military or NON LE for what you ""would"" pay if it was in stock.  If it's not, you pay what it is where it's at.  Or wait till it's in stock.

There are many great handguns on the market today however; Glock is the benchmark in which all others strive to achieve. Glock pistols are renowned for their simplicity, accuracy, and rugged reliability; rightfully so given the fact that over 30 years Glock has been providing their Safe Action pistols to military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters all over the world.

The Glock 30S was created to take a full capacity .45 ACP round count and place it in a smaller package. The Glock 30S is designed for optimal concealment without the bulk and weight of a full size pistol. Pick up a Glock today and you will see that there is no substitute for perfection.

LaRue rifles are known for their precision accuracy and high quality build. They are guaranteed sub-MOA accurate.

I recently received two LaRue rifles I ordered from LaRue in December 2012. I have decided to sell the OBR 5.56 with the 18-inch barrel. This rifle is brand new, in-the-box and has never been fired, except for the factory test target. 

The OBR comes with a LaRue Tactical RISR, 2 mags, 3 rails, lock, targets, and all the extra stuff LaRue sends you with a rifle purchase (owner's hat, extra buffer spring, target ruler, beverage tool, Dillo Dust, pocket Constitutions, etc). Troy iron sights in photos are NOT included.

Price: $2300 firm. This is less than what I have in it ($2250 base + shipping fees + FFL fee) and you don't have to wait a year-and-a-half!

Perfect/New. This is a great AR from a reputable company. This version is perfectly set up for hunting: 20 inch free-float barrel and an A2 stock. The stock has a storage compartment and a sling mount. The grip, a Stark SE-1, is so much better than the standard AR grip. It's larger, flared at the bottom, and has storage for batteries or small parts. The trigger guard is integrated into the grip for a solid, one-piece unit, and the guard is curved for easy use with gloves. The foregrip has two sling mounts and cut-outs for adding a rail. The upper receiver has a Picatinny rail and is ready for optics. Chambered in 5.56 NATO so you can use either 5.56 or .223 rounds. 1:9 twist. Comes with one standard 30-round AR mag. 

I'm selling this for a friend; he bought it and never used it. Looks like the only rounds through it were the factory test rounds. The bolt shows no wear and is MPI and HP tested. I gave it a good cleaning and it's ready to go. Perfect AR for hunting or long-range type shooting as the A2 stock is rock solid with no wobble.

Get it now before the hunting season rush.

Please ask any questions. I'm an NRA certified instructor and all of my Armslist sales have had no issue.

Regarding this 5 year manufacturing warranty:  This is SOLELY FOR LE PURPOSES and is an INSURANCE POLICY. Armor DOES NOT GO BAD. Saying armor goes bad after it's warranty is comparable to saying a car is no good after its 2 year manufacturing  warranty is up. It all depends on how well the armor was taken care of and the quality of the panels themselves.

http://www.thebangswitch.com/tac-con-3mr-trigger/

I am dowtown Orlando during days and Oviedo, nights and eves.
I bought on locally while mine was on backorder, now I have one too many.
I am not a dealer. These list for $495, I am selling for $400,used for one outing and cleaned.
This is for the Trigger, Selector switch, ATF letter, box, the whole package ready to go.

See below:

3MR   trigger functions in a standard semi-auto mode with a 4.5lb trigger when the safety switch is in the standard Fire position. When you switch the selector switch back to where full auto would be on an M4/M16 you get the same 4.5lb semi-auto trigger, and the action of the bolt resets the trigger for you. All you have to worry about is pulling the trigger for the next shot.

The build quality is superb. USA manufactured utilizing CNC and EDM processes to produce the parts. The quality control process is top notch.

TAC-CON says the trigger is capable of a 600 rounds per minute (RPM) rate of fire. Most shooters will   be in the 400-500 RPM range,   Short travel distance and assisted reset means you have to do very little movement with your trigger hand.

1980 Glenfield 30A .30-30 Lever Action, this is the sought after Pre-Safety and JM Stamped rifle! Action cycles SMOOTH, trigger is NICE!! Comes with Weaver See-Thru Rings and a Tasco 3-9x40mm Scope, it was on the rifle when I purchased it. Did I say the action is smooth? This is one of the smoothest cycling Marlin's I've handled in quite awhile.

Has some freckles on the ejection side of the receiver, doesn't really detract from the appearance, this would make a perfect rifle for a Hunter not worried about banging it up or for someone just wanting a Lever Action rifle!

Bought it a few months ago, don't really need it, don't plan on hunting anything, would rather have a Pistol.

Sell it with 40 rounds of Ammo for $375.

As with ALL military crates, it does have dents, dings, chips and signs of use.

I always get 5-10 emails ""hey can I get a shipping quote"". Well theres why.. Its to bloody expensive for a wooden crate. Its like people email me expecting ""Oh just $20"". I always reply with what UPS tells me.. $150+ and they always reply with ""Oh I wasnt expecting that much"".. God gave you a brain ;)

Keeping a few extra magazines around is never a bad idea; extra magazines save loading time at the range and also serve as a backup for those days when you simply cannot remember where you put your primary magazine. 

The GLOCK G26 Factory Magazine is a standard replacement magazine for your handgun. Glock magazines have a hardened steel insert encased in high tech polymer. This polymer coating protects the magazine and prevents deformation, even when dropped from a great height. 

•Glock magazines have very stiff springs when new and may be extremely difficult to load to full capacity. It may be necessary to use a Glock magazine loader (generally included in the Glock case with the handgun) to load the magazine to capacity or near capacity.

All current production Glock magazines are also compatible with all previous generations of Glock pistols. 


Don't be fooled by competitors with low prices and outrageous shipping and handling fees!! ""Low Price Guarantees"" often do not include shipping.

Gun has been fired, but so little that it shows practically 0 signs of wear. If you are looking for the perfect AR15 at a discounted  price, this is it. 
Smith and Wesson's M&P15 consists of their M4 stamped upper receiver atop their legal-to-own (for civilians) AR15 lower. This particular rifle has the MOE package on it for a comfortable grip, but I will also throw in a spare set of carbine length hand guards, just in case you'd rather have the customizability that comes with a set of aluminum quad-rails. The package also has a magpul flip-up rear sight--allowing for optics to be mounted without the removal of the rear sight. This thing will fire practically any kind of ammunition. 
The M&P 15 is renowned for its unsurpassable reliability and accuracy for a reasonable price, so that anyone can afford a top-shelf rifle, for a mid-shelf price. 
It has been cleaned and lubed with frog lube literally every time it has been out of the case. Even though it has mainly been fired at indoor ranges and never gotten dirty (kept out of the elements/sand/dirt/water/rain/etc), since I am selling I found it necessary for the firearm to be completely stripped and cleaned inside and out for the next owner. 
I will also include riser mount and .223/5.56 calibrated BDC compensation for distance shooting on the rifle (please note the scope has not been sighted in yet ). The scope also has a light up reticle (blue/green/red) with brightness settings to optimize target acquisition, thus decreasing the time in-between followup shots.
Another plus is that not only does it come with the original 30 rd ""M&P 15"" stamped Pmag, but also includes 3 other 20rd pre-ban mags--which I liked because they do  not hang down as far as the 30rd ones. 
Have a cmmg .22 conversion kit that I can add for an additional $75 ($219 new)--it definitely cuts the cost of shooting and makes it possible to shoot the rifle on a pistol range (some places do not allow high powered rifles). If interested, feel free to inquire about .22lr bullets, as do happen to have some on hand.
Also comes with 2 boxes of 5.56 ammunition.

The rifle has pretty much sat in the safe since I purchased it, as I live in a subdivision and cannot shoot in the back yard--making shooting a hassle (we have land, but it is out of the state), so I cannot justify keeping it.
