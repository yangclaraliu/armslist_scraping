It comes with the original box and a matching custom Bond Arms leather holster that is an OWB with a belt clip (value $85). I have about 40-50 rounds through the gun. It is excellent condition except for a scuff on right side wood handle that could probably be buffed out. 

It is a lot of fun to shoot. I have shot primarily 45 Colt, 410 slugs, and a few Winchester PDX-1 410 self defense rounds through it. If you don't know the PDX-1 410 round, it shoots three plated Defense Discâ¢ projectiles and 12 pellets of plated BB shot. It makes a mess of whatever you happen to be aiming at! Almost like being about to get off 15 rounds with 1 pull of the trigger! The Snake Slayer is very concealable and works as an excellent personal defense weapon. Cash sale or possible trade for the right firearm. Trade value is around $525."

The scope is mounted on Barrett's ultra-high rings. The rifle was once fired by our ballistic specialist with 20 rounds of Black Hills 250 grain ammunition. The barrel and bore were cleaned after each shot and was given time to cool down as to break in the barrel. The MRAD rifle's user-changeable barrel system is just one example of this hardworking gun's modularity. The precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 30 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions."

Ruger LCP .380 Auto (380 ACP). Very hard to find Limited Edition with Factory engraving.

Very beautiful. I know that this model without any extras was originally selling for $450 and up brand new.  Used, with Crimson Trace Laser upgrade, I'm selling for far less than that. 

Includes:
Crimson Trace Laser (NOT LaserMax).  Crimson trace is the better one that works straight from the pistol grip without need of a finger to toggle switch.
2 Magazines, including one with extended finger (pinky) grip.  Those of you with larger hands will appreciate that. All original paperwork and boxes, etc. Included. 

Made in the USA. 

I will ship to FFL. I will accept Pay Pal if you need to use a credit card or would prefer online payment. You will pay $30 shipping and insurance for air delivery as required and FFL on your end. No FFL fee on my end.

I realize the .338 Lapua is NOT for everyone. Chances are, you've never seen one or handled one, let alone shot one !!!

Now you can tap someone from 1 1/2 miles away !!!

I will NOT reply to ridiculous offers. Please know that up front. I've had replies/offers for other guns/items for sale and will not waste any more time to reply to an offer that's worth 50% what my rig is worth.

Sorry to have to say that to you legit buyers/traders.....

Here's what I have, an Armalite AR30 in .338 Lapua, the creator of the AR30 and it is legit !!! It comes fully loaded and in mint condition, literally mint condition !!! For those of you that don't know it, the .338 Lapua holds the record for longest CONFIRMED sniper kill at 2,707 yards!!! Yes, that's OVER 1 1/2 miles down range!!! Then again, if you're reading this you probably already knew that, and much more about this weapon system.

Really want to trade it for an AR10 or a SCAR in .308, I want a .308 AR. But I'm not hurting for $$$ and I don't need to sell this AR30. If you have a legit offer, that means a weapon worth $3,250.00, send the offer, or I will take $3,250.00 in cash. When I say not a penny less, that's gospel.
Here's what you'll get, and I have included a link so you can read about each part it has.......

 The Hellfire trigger system is a small metal piece that attaches behind the trigger of your semi auto pistol or rifle
 It has a finger that presses against the back of your trigger and is adjustable.
 The effect is to increase the force of the return to the forward position.
 This allows the Hellfire system to shoot your gun at faster rates even thou you are still pulling the trigger each time.

Q. Is this a trap gun or a sporting gun...?
A. This is a trap gun, the barrel is clearly marked ""TRAP"". While the low rib and 30"" barrel length would give it a sporting appearance, I assure you the gun is purpose built for trap.  The gun, for me, shoots 3.5"" high at 13 yards

Q. Are there choke tubes...?
A. No, there are no choke tubes. The barrels are fixed Full on top and fixed Improved Modified on the bottom. An ideal choice of chokes for the game of trap. The gun breaks targets nicely from the 16 all the way to the 27 with this setup. You of course have to do your part.

Q. Is there a recoil reducer on the stock...?
A. No, there is no type of recoil reducer on this stock. The stock has an adjustable pad, with a new Kickeeze modified trap pad installed. The pad is unaltered and can be ground to fit your own pitch, or left as is.

Q. Would you be willing trade the gun for a rusty but trusty '87 AMC Eagle...? 
A. Unfortunately I am not interested in trading this gun for anything other than $1150 cash. Thank you."

 It has a finger that presses against the back of your trigger and is adjustable.
 The effect is to increase the force of the return to the forward position.
 This allows the Hellfire system to shoot your gun at faster rates even though you are still pulling the trigger each time.

They are at the same location where Rocky Mountain Guns used to be. It's too bad because I really liked those guys at RMG. Brandon ran the place and he's a great guy who always treated me fair! That being said the new place is called Pony Express. I went in the other day to do a transfer (1 gun) and they charged me $40.00! Wow that's the most expensive I've seen in town! Because of that I won't be doing any business there in future. Don't get me wrong, they had a decent selection of handguns and the two guys were nice enough but $40.00 is way too much. The way I read the law the most anyone should be able to charge is a total of $20.00 I guess others don't read it that way!"

I don't have a price since it is for trade only.  If you want to make an offer then go ahead but I am mainly looking to trade with or without cash on either end. I am considering mostly a trade for a S&W or Ruger stainless revolver ( like a SP101 ) or 1911 or anything in 10mm or maybe an AR.  But I don't want something someone pieced together themselves. but I would consider an offer if it is reasonable.

This is a Sig Sauer P938 Extreme. It has the original paperwork, lock, etc.  It has the 6rd mag & the 7 rd ext pinky mag.
I have shot this gun maybe 300rds.  I bought it and used it for concealed carry but it's a little on the small side for me and I am just ready for something different.  I do not work and only leave the house approximately once a week so it was not carried all day everyday. Also I had 2 foot surgeries this past year so I was laid up for at least 4 months. My point is it was carried lightly.
You can see the typical line on the top of the barrel which could be touched up with Duracoat but other than that it looks excellent.
Cleaned after every shot and stored in humidity controlled safe. Fingerprints always wiped off and lubed regularly.
The gun seemed a little plain in appearance to me so I had Omega Gunsmithing in Newport bead blast and Duracoat the barrel, hammer, take down pin, grip screws & amidex safety. My receipt shows this was done on July 26th, 2013.
Also I had a custom OWB holster made by Adams Leather Works in Texas (currently 10-12 week wait). WWW.ADAMSLEATHERWORKS.COM  The holster was stiff as all new leather is and its just finally starting to soften up probably from the lack of use.  You can watch a video of this guy make a holster from start to finish almost identical to this one on Youtube.  Here is a link:      http://youtu.be/mjr72-ANHq0   
I was so impressed with this mans skill I ordered my holster immediately and if I trade this P938 I will be ordering another from him.  He has a customer for life in me!
I just looked at the pics I posted for this ad and the holster didn't really come out as nice as it is in person.  He stains the leather then airbrushed black around all the edges. Sharp holster!

I paid $720 with the FFL fee for the Sig P938
$97.50 for Duracoating
& $80 for the holster
I realize it is used so not expecting a $900 trade value but I also am very aware of gun values so please don't waste your time with ridiculous offers or the junk in your safe that no one wants anyway. Mostly looking for a S&W revolver or maybe a Ruger like a SP101.  I also love 1911's and anything 10mm. No rifles, shotguns.
I also have a trade listing here on Armslist for a Springfield XDM 3.8 Compact 9mm Bi-Tone with everything it came with if anyone is interested in a larger trade.

I will delete this ad the minute it is gone, so no need to ask if I still have it.  If your reading this the answer is yes!
If interested send me a email or text.

This railed handguard is a drop-in replacement for the standard AK handguard and fits all AK models with a standard length handguard.  It is extremely easy to install and provides rock-solid rails and co-witness capabilities. The entire system is light weight, keeps the shooter tucked tightly into the rifle, and provides the options of either using iron sights or the optic. 

The Burris Fast Fire III is an excellent, lightweight micro dot optic with a 3 MOA dot. The Generation III is much easier to adjust windage/ elevation and replace the battery than previous models.  It can be used on handguns or rifles of any caliber with a standard weaver/picatinny rail mount.  

Both the sight and the rails are brand new, with no issues. I have never fired a round with either on the rifle.  They have been mounted only.  I loved the setup on the AK, and the co-witness. I just decided I wanted to go with Bulgarian military parts only.  If you are looking for the ultimate tactical AK optics setup, this is it.

I have all of the original armalite trigger group,trigger gaurd parts that I removed in individually serial numbered armalite parts containers

Total= 815.00 for each lower half and that's before taxes
So I will say 800.00 for each or 1500.00 for the pair

I can also remove the Geissele triggers and kns pins and install the stock armalite parts
If you would prefer that then the price would be 525.00 each or 1000.00 for the pair
Again I would mostly prefer to sell/trade as a pair since they are consecutively numbered but I may split for the right offer/trade

It has been well cared for.  Woodwork and blueing over 95%.  Mechanical is 100%.   The guns shows very little signs of use.   Book values is $575.00.  Retail on ammo is $375.00 minimum.  $950 for $815 and no tax leaves another $75 at least in your pocket.     
The Mohawks are great rifles - perfect size, accurate shooters, mechanically simple, asthetically beautiful.   The .308 version is the large caliber and has the range and accuracy to reach out a few hundred yards with accuracy.  Rifle is factory drilled for a scope but has not had a scope mounted.  These rifles are classic in their design, operation and versatility and require appreciation and appeal. 
With 500 rounds +/-, this combo is priced to sell.   
I am downsizing right now so I'm not sure what kind of trade I might be interested in.  Don't need a large caliber rifle, shotgun, or striker fire pistol.   Might consider a 45 ACP / 45 revolver, carbine that is not a heavy assault style rifle, or Big Henry in 357.                 
Shipping to FFL available.   Price is probably pretty firm.  It is priced right.  Will consider a test shoot."
