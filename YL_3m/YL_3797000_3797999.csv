The only sign of wear on it is a couple minor scratches on the barrel shroud.. Which I might be able to work out with my bluing kit.

Comes with 3 30 round mags, and one 13 round mag.  If you have a Glock 21, it's perfect because the mags are Glock 21 mags. Also comes with the original hard case.

Period.  I have a early Colt Official Police .38 SPCL. Caliber revolver.  These are the ancestor to the Python.  They definitely have the ""Snake Gun,"" look as they both share the same frame.  The pre-war models have the rounded ""half moon"" front sight, checkered trigger, hammer, and cylinder release, and the old style cylinder retention system.   It has a  4” barrel.  Very unique number and uber rare ""1"" shield number stamped on the butt end.  It was manufactured during WW2(1944) making it very desirable in collectors value.  It has the original Walnut grips embossed with bright Colt medallions.  The checkering is still sharp and defined.  The Post WW2 (1947-54)guns were fitted with plastic grips and are therefore  less sought after.  The bluing is all original and in excellent condition, with only minor localized cosmetic fading towards the barrels end.  Internal barrel and bore are bright, rifling is sharp without any visual deterioration or flaws.  Cylinder timing is perfect with zero play in cylinder lock up.  As well as the cylinder rotates smooth as the day it was manufactured.  As with most early Colts the metal to wood fit is exceptional, as well as the metal to metal machining tolerances. Impeccable quality and functionality.  Current market value on the Guns International site range from $600- $1500+ for this gun model.  I would respectively place the value of this revolver somewhere definitely on the high side of that price spectrum.  As close to ""minty,"" for a 71 year old vintage.  Again this is an all original  war era Colt. A time capsule of American history.  This is a jewel in the current  era of ""throw away, disposable,"" guns.   NO SHIPPING, FACE TO FACE with Florida ID.

I purchased it through IMA (International Military Antiques), carefully disassembled it, and thoroughly cleaned it as the ""cleaned"" rifles are only cleaned on the outside for display.  It does show signs of use, wear, and storage but it is marked 1886 so go figure.  

I special ordered a brass bullet mold from Australia as I had intended to reload and shoot this gun but I just have too many projects.  I did cast some bullets with the mold but I later melted most of them back down.  The molds and handles go with the rifle.  

As I was planning on reloading, I purchased a set of Lee Reloading dies, which will also go with the rifle.  I have some brass cases that I bought from Ten-X Ammo that will go with the rifle as well.  

I have fired this rifle and it is a pleasure to shoot something so old and interesting, but I just don't have the time or space in my cabinet anymore.  

$750 firm for the lot (rifle, reloading dies, bullet mold/handles, brass).

Otherwise the P30L is essentially identical to the P30.

Like the P30, the P30L was designed as a modern police and security pistol and combines optimal function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstraps inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user.

Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases, magazine release levers, and a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame (for applicable variants). A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor serves as a loaded chamber indicator providing a reminder of a loaded chamber that can be subtly seen and felt. The standard P30L is a 9 mm “Variant 3 (V3)” with a conventional double-action/single action trigger mode with a serrated decocking button on the rear of the slide.

P30LS models have the features of the “L” model with the addition of an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. LS models are available in conventional double-action/single action trigger mode with decocking button (“V3S” 9 mm and .40 S&W) and with HK’s enhanced double action only “V2” Law Enforcement Modification trigger. A special “V1” lightweight trigger pull model of the Law Enforcement Modification is also available.

Extensively tested, P30L and P30LS models have been adopted by several international police and security agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30L naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions

I'm throwing in 4 surplus steel mags, one polymer, and a couple of super rare Chinese flat backs. The only things in the pics that don't go are the Lo-Pro offset mount and Surefire.

It's pretty rare to come across them. Well, I came across some, and was so surprised I bought two (but really only needed one to match my 10.5 upper). 

To confirm:  No - this lower has never had a rifle buffer attached to it. YES - I purchased them directly from the owning FFL, and they were transferred to me as ""other,"" stripped lowers in SC. 

This is a brand new, never mounted, LMT pistol lower, with PSA enhanced lpk, enhanced trigger springs and polished fcg (about a 4.5# extremely crisp pull), brand new LMT grip, pistol buffer, ambi sling endplate, buffer and spring. 

I thought about it quite a while, and I don't believe that $400 is unreasonable.  Standard LMT lowers go for this price + shipping, and I can almost guarantee you won't find a legal pistol LMT lower anywhere else...  

I prefer this to be a SC FTF only transaction (must have CWP and do a bill of sale), but might make an exception for the right deal out of state.  No shipping to banned states. Your FFL must accept from an individual..I'll take cash, money order, or DISCREET paypal (+3%, or friends and family) - absolutely nothing in the comments section on PP."

Prior to the Fuji's, I was using the Nikon Monarchs, which were decent, and in my opinion, outperformed everything except the top tier's, like Leica, Swarovski, Zeiss, and Vortex Razors (however, I'll concede that I never had the chance to compare them to the german bino's, i.e., Steiner, Minox, or Docter-Nobilem). But the Fuji's topped them all and have been the best optic I have ever used, at least in the category of optical quality. They aren't the lightest, but they're durable, and the color, clarity, and light transmission cannot be beaten, and these qualities are more important to me than weight anyway. They are, of course, waterproof, fogproof, nitrogen filled, etc. Come with a lifetime warranty, see picture.

I honestly cannot say enough good things about this optic. For example, usually, I was always the first one to spot elk, especially in low light conditions, and on one occasion, the elk I was looking at couldn't even be seen with my partner's Swarovski EL 10x50's. He had to borrow my binoculars to see the elk and I couldn't the elk with his. From that day on, if we were together (and if he didn't have to pack them up the mountain) he was always asking to spot with my Fuji's. On my aforementioned sheep hunt, I was able to spot Mountain Goats at least three miles away AT MIDNIGHT. Also, I am able to see craters and spots on the moon I have never seen before. And, one reviewer on binoculars.com talks about how he was glassing Jupitor's Moons with these binoculars.

I have taken immaculate care of these binoculars, as I do with all my hunting equipment I'm a fanatic about keeping lens covers on my optics, so you can be assured that lenses are in great shape. You can see my seller feedback if you search for these binoculars on ebay.

What turned me onto Fuji optics was their outstanding reviews on allbinos.com. I relied on this site to buy my Nikon's and I was really happy with them. I was even happier with my Fuji's. If you take nothing else away from this ad, trust and use allbinos.com.

Here are the allbino rankings for the 10x50 category, you'll notice what ranks second, by a very narrow margin: http://www.allbinos.com/allbinos_ranking-binoculars_ranking-10x50.html The only difference from the model they used in their rankings and the model I'm selling, besides the difference in the size of the lenses, is that they used a model that had a rubber armored coating, which is what the R stands for in FMTR-SX. But Fuji doesn't make the fully rubberized version for the 16x70's, so the model there is FMT-SX. They do still have some rubber, but it must not be as thick or something.

The binoculars were made in Japan, which has a reputation for making great glass (all of the Vortex Razor stuff comes from there), and they boast a 95% light transmission rating which trumps both the top of the line Leica (90.6% -- albino.com) and Swarovski (90%) and matches that of the Zeiss (95%).

I should caution you by stating that these binoculars are big and won't fit into all of the commercial chest harnesses out there.

From Glock:
The GLOCK 30SF in the legendary .45 AUTO offers excellent out-of-the-box precision paired with the ballistic quality of this genuine big-bore caliber. Its compact design and simple operation allow smooth drawing of the pistol. With all of these advantages-especially because of its compact dimensions, the G30SF .45 caliber is the first choice of plainclothes officers and security personnel in the U.S. The SF model reduces the circumference of the receiver at the rear, or ""back strap,"" offering increased comfort and control, especially for shooters with smaller hands.

Here is a random Youtube review of the pistol if you are unfamiliar with it. http://youtu.be/U_27WsYgsiI
and a review:
http://www.personaldefenseworld.com/2013/09/do-it-all-45/#glock30sf_14-copy


Specifics: I received this handgun in trade for a rifle and have never shot it.  It appears to be in almost new condition (good to excellent).  There is very slight holster wear on the left side of the frame ""nose"". Comes in original box with two magazines (10+1) and a gun lock, however the stock plastic bore brush is missing. This firearm was originally owned by a LEO (possibly as a personal carry or back up) and it has a custom stippled grip (with no reduction) for extra stability, which is also applied on the two mags. The stippled grip is excellent shop work (~$120 mod), not some garage hack job.  The pistol come with standard Glock sights. 

If you are interested in a 45 ACP Carry Pistol, you can't go wrong with this model -- it is considered by many to be the most accurate Glock pistol.

I am selling this 45 ACP because I do not shoot 45 cal, and I want the cash towards a CZ GVO 3 S1. So unless you have a Scorpion, NO TRADES."

WW 2, SPRINGFIELD ARMORY, M1 GARAND, 30-06 (LETTERKENNY REBUILD 1965)

The title says it all, this M1 is simply beautifu as an investment and as a shooter. It is a higly regarded Letterkenny Army Depot (LEAD) arsenal rebuild. It is the most collectable of all rebuilds with the beautiful “Silver” finish only produced at this depot. Matched with the correct LEAD stock and given a WW2 Serial you have an incredibly collectable and highly valued rifle. However, with this particular firearm it gets better. Let me explain.

We have known production numbers from the Springfield armory for month to month during the war. With those facts and some “Safe and Fact based” mathematical assumptions, this rifle could have been produced on the eve or morning of the Normandy Invasion of June 6, 1944. This serial is a 2915XXX which puts it in the later part of the first week of June 1944.

This rifle comes with Certificate of Providence, Hard Case and USGI Sling and has a Muzzle/Throat of 0+/1. Although the rifle does have some minor parts (Hammer, Safety and Trigger Guard from Winchester) these parts can easily be exchanged for the Springfield Armory Type. The Barrel is 1965 and the Stock has the LEAD stampings.
This rifle would bring over $1500 on GB every day.  This rifle has it all, Date, Finish, Providence, History, Great stock, etc. I have it priced at $1250 for a quick sale.

I am not really interested in Trades but would consider as partial trade:

Glock Handguns 
Older Gen 3 Smith Autos 
""Possibly"" Sig Sauer Handguns (Sig 226/229/, etc)
A High end Semi Auto or Smith Revolver with engravings/gold fill, etc ( Yes a pretty Gun, :)

 Must be a VA resident ( Military or Civilian)

There hasn't been any issues with this particular rifle but I'd suggest bypassing the whole deal by installing a timney trigger. Which is what I'm doing with my other 700. If this would be your plan I could sell or trade it to you ASAP. If you'd rather it go back to the factory that is fine too. It'll just take a bit longer.

Hey everyone,
I have a used but decent condition HTC One M7 for use on the AT&T network for sale. I got this in trade and really don't have a use for it since I'm with sprint. It seems to work fine although the charger doesn't like to stay in very well. It still charges fine, just is really loose on letting the cord come out. It will come with a replacement part to fix the charger so all that has to be done is install it. Or just use it like it is. It will also come with a UAG case for it, and a wall charger/USB cable. It is is used condition and as such is as is. But I will have it charged up so you can see it running. It does have scuffs and dings but nothing that the case doesn't cover up! Haha. Only trades I would consider would be for certain firearms or something along those lines. Shoot me a message on here or a text at REDACTED if you have any questions or offers. Thanks for looking and have a good one!

403,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3797403,For Sale/Trade:  Bushmaster about to be sued ?!?!,"Common Sense-ville, Louisville, Kentucky",$ 0,"Listed On: Wednesday, December 10, 2014",Rifles,Bushmaster,no type,no type,no type,"It appears that the parents of the ""Newtown"" tragedy (or the lawyers involved, I am sure) have decided that they will sue Bushmaster firearms for manufacturing the gun that was used in the shooting. When will this kind of foolishness stop, if ever? Newtown was a terrible tragedy, period.  But, Bushmaster was not at fault...that is pretty apparent. Guns are legal, safe and have never hurt anyone, on their own...and neither has Bushmaster.
If I go fishing.... and catch a shark and the shark bites my arm off, can I sue Zebco if I was using their fishing rod when I caught my fish. Can I sue Fruit of the Loom if I was wearing their socks when it happened?
It is a chance for someone (zealous lawyers for certain) to make a profit off of this event. There was / is a guilt party here...it is not Bushmaster.
The parents of Newtown have also decided to sue the entire town of Newtown for that one young man's actions. In other words, bankrupt a town/city, because you can. Our legal system is so tilted, some of this will probably actually hold water.
Integrity, honesty, taking responsibility and putting it where it belongs, what are those concepts?"

-------------------
OK, let's get this straight: this is NOT a WTT ad.  I'm not selling it because I'm trying to gather funds for a different project, and I won't take half the listed amount as I'm not hurting for money.  I recently suffered a pretty good hand injury.  My grip is now different because of this.  I just can not shoot the bobtail 1911 like I used to.  I'm not comfortable enough with my abilities with this particular style of frame anymore, so it's time for it to find a new home.

If you're gonna offer me a trade anyway, it better be something fantastic that I can't drive up the road and pick up from any number of LGS's around.  IE: Dillon 1050, cases of WIN 231, Hypertherm PMX45 or bigger, 6-71 with SBC manifold, etc.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

I also installed a lower handguard retaining backet and US upper gas tube to which was added US made Arsenal furniture with heat shield.  I removed the muzzle nut and added a Tapco AK-74 flash hider.  I also put a dab of luminescent paint that dries clear on the sights, so they can be seen in the dark.  I ran a mag thru the gun (of silver bear, non-corrosive) to test function, it works great, and then I put the gun up in storage.

About MSAR
The STG-556 rifle was developed by US-based company Microtec Small Arms Research, a sister company to famous hi-tech knife-maker Microtec Knives Co. Based on the famous Austrian Steyr AUG assault rifle. Manufacture of this clone became possible because original patents for  SteyrAUG have expired, and the demand for civilian version of this weapon in USA was not covered by import of original Austrian-made rifles. MSAR designers took some time to reverse-engineer the Steyr AUG,and then added several additional features that they feel might appeal to US shooters. Most notable of these new features are bolt stop release button and Ar-15 style bolt -closure forward assist button on the left side of receiver. Otherwise, the STG-556 follows the  Steyr AUG A2 rifle pattern. Microtec MSARSTG-556 rifle is available in different colors and with barrels of various lengths. Optional caliber conversion kit allows to upgrade the rifle from 5.56mm / .223 to more potent 6.8mm Rem SPC caliber. SAR also offers STG-556 in either semi-automatic only (civilian / police) or selective-fire (military) versions.

Microtec MSARSTG-556 rifle is gas-operated semi-automatic or selective-fired weapon of bullpup configuration. The receiver is made from aluminum alloy, the stock / housing is made from impact-resistant polymer. Barrels are quick-detachable, with barrel lock incorporated into the gas block /forward grip base. Gas system features short-stroke gas piston, located to the right of the barrel. Bolt group rides on dual guide rods, and different user-replaceable multi-lug rotary bolts are available for right- or left-hand ejection. STG-556 is equipped with bolt hold-open device; bolt catch release button is located on the left side of the gun, behind the magazine housing. The M16 / Ar-15 type bolt closure assist button is located on the left side of the gun, in front of the magazine. Non-reciprocating charging handle is located also on the leftside, in front of the receiver. STG-556 accepts proprietary Steyr AUG-type magazines, made of plastic; magazine release button is located below the stock, behind the magazine housing.

Aimpoint CompM4 sights are the finest sights that Aimpoint has ever produced. The improved energy efficiency provides up to 8 years of continuous use from a single AA battery! Aimpoint CompM4 sights incorporate an integral mount that eliminates the need for a separate ring and can be customized with vertical and forward spacers to fit a variety of firearms. They can also be used by hunters and sport shooters that need night vision compatibility. CompM4 sights are available in two versions. The two versions are identical except that the CompM4 offers a high battery compartment, while the CompM4S offers a low battery compartment. The Aimpoint CompM4 is now the latest version of the US Army's M68 CCO (Close-Combat Optic), continuing a legacy that Aimpoint has maintained since 1997. The performance of the CompM4 sights is optimized for use with all generations of Night Vision Devices (NVDs), but is especially suited for 3rd generation night vision technology. Aimpoint's unique band-pass coating on the front lens reflects select frequencies of red light at near 100% efficiency in order to give the highest possible dot brightness with the smallest amount of energy while transmitting nearly 100% of light in the Infrared and near-infrared part of the spectrum to provide the clearest, brightest image possible when used with a 3rd generation NVD. With 7 NVD-compatible brightness settings and 9 Daylight settings including one extra-bright setting, the CompM4 and CompM4S are ready for use around the clock.
