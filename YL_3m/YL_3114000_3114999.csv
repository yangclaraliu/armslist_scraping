For five decades, the Remington 700 bolt action rifle has been used by the U.S. military, law enforcement, hunters and civilians. Along with the Winchester 94 and Marlin 336, it's considered to be one of the top-selling rifles in U.S. history. Continually praised for its accuracy, in the late-1960s the Remington 700 rifle was adopted by the U.S. Marine Corps and made its primary sniper weapon. The 700 over the years has also remained popular because of its versatility as it comes with different stocks, barrel configurations, finishes and calibers. Are you sold yet?

This is a first time posting here. I am a real person, with a real gun to sell.. haha.. I have posted pictures that I found off of the internet, but will be more than happy to send anyone actual pictures of the gun should you request them.

 I have a like new Sig P250 compact that I have put all of 50 rounds through. I have kept it in great condition. No cosmetic damage, no internal damage, nothing... and it shoots great. Very easy to take down and clean. 

I'm asking $400 for it because it comes with 2 magazines (instead of the traditional one). I have a Sig Sauer 14 round extended mag that I bought aftermarket ($44) and a Sig Sauer paddle holster ($55) that is made specifically for this firearm. The product description from the manufacturer is as follows:

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer.

Now you can tap someone from 1 1/2 miles away !!!

I will NOT reply to ridiculous offers. Please know that up front. I've had replies/offers for other guns/items for sale and will not waste any more time to reply to an offer that's worth 50% what my rig is worth.

Sorry to have to say that to you legit buyers/traders.....

Here's what I have, an Armalite AR30 in .338 Lapua, the creator of the AR30 and it is legit !!! It comes fully loaded and in mint condition, literally mint condition !!! For those of you that don't know it, the .338 Lapua holds the record for longest CONFIRMED sniper kill at 2,707 yards!!! Yes, that's OVER 1 1/2 miles down range!!! Then again, if you're reading this you probably already knew that, and much more about this weapon system.

Really want to trade it for an AR10 or a SCAR in .308, I want a .308 AR. But I'm not hurting for $$$ and I don't need to sell this AR30. If you have a legit offer, that means a weapon worth $3,250.00, send the offer, or I will take $3,250.00 in cash. When I say not a penny less, that's gospel.

The Henry Big Boy .45 Colt Cowboy edition captures the wild west adventures of cowboy life on the trail.  The Henry Big Boy .44 Magnum Wildlife Edition emulates the pulse quickening thrill of a trophy buck leaping into view. Each genuine American walnut buttstock and forearm are engraved using techniques which combine todays engraving technologies with hand craftsmanship passed from  generations past. After engraving, artisans individually hand paint the buttstock and forearm using multiple acrylic colors. The original artwork is visually used as a guide, but subtle detailing makes each unit truly one of a kind."

The Rossi revolution started with the founding of the company in 1889 by Amadeo Rossi and over the last 115 years that tradition has grown. The Rossi name represents a piece of firearm history and a tradition of excellence. Over the years Rossi has led the way in design and engineering, while at the same time, stressing the importance of producing an affordable product without sacrificing quality or accuracy. In December of 1997 BrazTech International was created as the exclusive importer of Rossi firearms in North America. Rossi manufactures its classic rifles in a plant in Sa Leopoldo, Brazil selling many firearms outside the United States and North America. Rossi manufactures three models of Taurus handguns including the .38 Special as well as four models of .357 Magnum revolvers under contract. Today's Rossi is still family run and they put the same dedication and innovation into every firearm. At Rossi, it is more than just building guns...it is a family's history and tradition. As a perfect example, this 45 Long Colt R92 Carbine is the ideal rifle for hunting in heavy bush and is a tried and true “Piece of the Old West” with all the beauty and functionality of the original at a fraction of the cost.

Ruger® patented chrome-plated, two-stage piston with multi-stage regulator provides a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm with superior operating endurance. The two-stage piston provides a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier.
The four-position chrome-plated gas regulator can be adjusted for optimum reliability and superior operating endurance. The gas system may be closed completely for manual operation during training or when using a suppressor*.
Folding backup iron sights include a windage adjustable rear sight and an elevation adjustable front sight. These sights provide a solid, reliable aiming system that can be folded out of the way to make room for optics, but can be instantly redeployed if needed.
Six-position telescoping M4-style buttstock* is mounted on a Mil-Spec diameter tube.
Precision-rifled, chrome-lined, cold hammer-forged Mil-Spec 41V45 chrome-moly-vanadium steel barrel ensures accuracy and longevity.
Fluted barrel (for reduced weight and improved barrel cooling) features an SR-556®/Mini-14®-style flash suppressor* mounted with a 5/8""-24 thread.

Drilled and tapped for additional rails at the 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions (two additional rail sections included), providing ample space for mounting sights, lights, lasers or other accessories.

Finally, a .22 LR tactical training rifle that looks, feels and handles like its full-size counterpart. The ARX160 is a rimfire version of the ARX100, Beretta’s celebrated .223 Rem tactical rifle.

A training rifle that will never let you down, the ARX160 is an extra-durable piece of gear that will satisfy even the most demanding tactical shooter.

Comparable in size to a smartphone, the Beretta 3032 Tomcat is tiny while offering the power of the .32 ACP cartridge. As such, this double/single-action autopistol it is perfect for deep concealment or used as a backup second handgun. Its tip-up barrel design makes it easy to load, operate and maintain, while its traditional looks give it the allure of a true classic.


Easy to Operate

The controls of the 3032 Tomcat are designed to be simple and to provide safety and peace of mind while carrying. The two-position safety engages crisply and positively, and locks the slide while also preventing the pistol from firing. The magazine release is located to the left of the grip, making it easy to locate and operate even with one hand.


Convenient Tip-Up Barrel Design

The 3032 features a tip-up barrel design typical of the classic Beretta small-frame pistols. Thanks to this design, you never need to rack the slide and you can load that first round directly into the chamber. This is especially convenient in cold weather, or for people with weaker hands. Another advantage is that the barrel may be easily cleaned without taking the pistol apart, making it convenient to give the pistol a quick wipe after a session at the range.


Easy to Conceal and Shoot  

Right from their inception, Beretta small frame pistols such as the 3032 Tomcat were designed to be carried concealed. Therefore, the lines of the Tomcat are snag-free, with the sights being engineered to easily slide in and out of a holster or belly-band without catching on anything.

Item History:  

The pistol was produced in 6.35 mm, 7.65 mm, and 9 mm variants. Although not expensive, at the time it was of advanced design and 

high quality construction with relatively few parts, well sealed against dirt. Metal components were forged or machined, and assembly 

in general made no use of screws, even securing the wooden grips with metal clips, although some examples do incorporate a single 

screw for that purpose. The hammerless action depended on a spring-loaded striker to fire the cartridge. As in early Colt and 

Browning pocket pistols, the Ortgies striker also operated as an ejector as the slide traveled backwards after discharge.
Unusual design features included the safety and the magazine. The safety was a lever inset into the back of the grip and, with the gun 

cocked, forced backward out of the grip into the ""safe"" position by spring tension from the firing pin upon depression of a button 

under the slide. Thus, engaging the safety simultaneously reduced tension on the firing pin spring. To disengage the safety, a shooter 

simply would squeeze the grip, pressing the lever forward and locking it flush with the back of the pistol."

Sight MUST flip up and lock down. I prefer metal parts rather than the plastic Magpul ones. Used condition is preferred and it doesn't matter if you've painted, scratched, or used it on deployment. As long as it folds down and locks in both positions and is in working order (not bent and it can be adjusted for elevation), I'll take it. 

I currently have a GG&G Rear BUIS flip-up sight so the GG&G brand is preferred but willing to see what you have. 

Will pay the appropriate shipping if you are not in the El Paso, TX. 

(Note: It will not cost over $6 to ship something this small via USPS Flat Rate 2-Day Priority w/ Tracking so please do not tell me you want $10 or more to ship it). 

If you are looking for military/tactical gear or other weapon accessories, we could do a trade. Email me and I can send ya a list. Be sure to check your spam folder for my response.

This is a 2010 model with the black Duty Treatment (not the old Duty Coat) and night sights. The grips are VZ Gator Backs. I've included 2 Tripp Cobra 8-round mags in addition to the 2 original DW/Checkmate mags and 100 rounds of Speer Lawman .45 ACP 230 TMJ ammo.

DW makes the best production 1911s on the market and the Valor is their top-of-the-line 1911. I've put around 2500 rounds through the gun without any problems.The gun is extremely accurate and in excellent condition (98%). The trigger is amazing. 

The serial number shows that it is a blem, but I've never been able to find the blem. DW routinely sells blems that have minor cosmetic imperfections that do not affect the gun's performance. After 2500 rounds, I can assure you that there is nothing wrong with this gun. Similar Valors sell new for over $1700. 

The Valor has been meticulously cared for, kept well lubed, and cleaned after every trip to the range. I'm selling to fund another firearm purchase. Not interested in trades.

Price: $1200.

The barrel is machined from ordnance grade, chrome moly, high vanadium steel hardened to Rc 28-32. The barrel is 36” long, has 8 grooves, 1-15” right hand twist and features a SAAMI spec chamber which will allow the use of any SAAMI spec ammo. The barrel and all external steel parts, are manganese phosphate finished for long lasting good looks and corrosion protection. The V50SS utilizes the time proven standard, '98 Mauser trigger system for absolute safety. This rifle also features a high efficiency ""shark fin"" muzzle break, machined from solid bar stock and threaded on to the muzzle of the barrel with 1-12 TPI threads. This muzzle break is designed to reduce felt recoil to that of a 12 ga. Shotgun. The muzzle break can be “Tuned” to the barrel by altering the length via the long thread shank. This feature allows the operator to find the “sweet spot” for the break that gives the best accuracy. An M1913 Picatinny scope rail is attached via oversized grade 8 allen screws for easy mounting of optics. The oversized recoil shoulder distributes the recoil over a large surface area affording rock solid mounting to the stock. The bolt has three huge locking surfaces and a 60 degree throw. It features a “primary extraction” cam for positive extraction of the case. The receiver is machined from bar stock SAE 4150 steel and features pressure release vents for BOTH case separation and primer pierce, making this one of the strongest, safest actions available. We have tested these actions and bolts to pressures exceeding 100,000 psi with no evidence of failure. The stock is machined from aircraft aluminum bar stock. This stock is made to machine tool tolerances and is completely impervious to climate and temperature. It is attached to an aluminum buttstock with a shock absorbing recoil to further reduce felt recoil and allow the shooter to comfortably shoot all day.

No New York City Magazine Sales. This listing is for THREE magazines, hit Buy It and you’re buying 3, not 1. Winning buyer can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. Here are genuine factory Glock magazines to fit the Model 22 Pistol in .40 S&W Caliber, or its .357 Sig caliber peer, the Model 31. They will also fit the compact and subcompact models 23, 27, 32, and 33, only they will protrude past the magazine well on those smaller guns. Since the .40 S&W and .357 Sig caliber cartridge case heads are the same, Glock magazines for both calibers will interchange. Manufacturer is Glock gmbh of Deutsche-Wagram, Austria. Importer is Glock, Inc., of Smyrna, GA. Factory skus are MF10022 and MF10031, both are exactly the same except for caliber designation, .40 S&W or .357 Sig. Construction is classic polymer body with steel inner lining, and visible loading ports so the operator can check round count. We take these any way we can get them, whether they are individually packaged or not. Since 2012, most of the time they are shipped in bulk like the ones in the photos. Each magazine holds 10 rounds of .357 Sig or .40 S&W Caliber Ammunition, five fewer rounds than the standard issue 22015 magazines. Note the 4th Generation style release slot on the face of these magazines’ bodies. They work just fine in any Glock 22 or 31, or even those models’ compact 23 and 27 size pistols, just fine, no matter which generation the pistols are. They will protrude from the grip frame of the smaller pistols. If we are in stock on the 22015 fifteen rounders, buyers who reside in jurisdictions where those are not restricted may sub, but only if we are in stock on those. If that is what you want to do, please message us and let us check stock before you hit buy it. Replacement pricing on these in our area has recently been upwards of $50 apiece, and many times they’re hard to come by even at those prices. Our Single Magazine price is $35.00, but we usually have a separate ad on Single Magazines. We’re offering these excellent magazines, however, in lots of 3 at only $29 each. Own 3 for only $ 87.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

If you’re looking for a versatile carry pistol that is packed with features, has amazing capacity, and performs flawlessly, look no farther than the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact. The XD(M)® 3.8” Compact is the smallest of the XD(M)® line, but it’s by no means the least. It boasts the same superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make larger XD(M)®’s easy and intuitive to use in a slightly abbreviated package. And you’ll be amazed at how fun it is to shoot.

The XD(M)® 3.8” Compact has a 3.8 inch barrel mated with a shortened compact frame. When combined with the versatility of XD(M) Gear® X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazines, the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact is ready for daily carry or a day on the range. Put in an X-Tension™ (USPAT7191556) magazine, and you have a 19 round full-sized 9mm pistol (16 rounds in .40SW, 13 rounds in .45ACP). Use the flush-fitting 13 round magazine, and you have a Compact (11 rounds in .40SW, 9 rounds in .45ACP). Like all XD(M)®’s, the XD(M)® 3.8″ Compact comes with three interchangeable backstraps, dovetail sights, mega-lock frame texturing, an ambidextrous magazine release, a multi-position frame rail, and a match grade barrel.You’ll also find all the safety features that make the XD(M)® a safe pistol in responsible hands.

If you want a gun for daily carry as well as a trip to the range, but you only want to buy one gun, try the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact. You’ll be amazed at how controllable it is to shoot and how easy it is to conceal. It’s two guns in one."

It is recommended that the shooter only uses high velocity ammo. I bought this kit new for my Glock 17, I used it with some Federal auto-match rnds and it worked flawlessly, its had exactly 45 rds through it, cleaned and well maintained. has no wear or anything on the exterior, it does have some slight wear on the top corner of the chamber where it has been fired, the barrel and slide make a tight fit so the friction caused a little bit of wear there.
