It looks as though it wasn't used much before the serviceman got wounded as the condition is very lightly used. I've seen and handled many of these and this one is one of the Rare first 600 specimens that has not been messed with. Collector quality! The firearm absolutely has to be transferred to you and the paper work done as I Prefer to sell FTF at an FFL only. Don't really want to ship but if you absolutely need to it would be shipped from my FFL to your FFL ONLY! The Gun Broker in Oregon on 82nd is where the fire arm will be sent from. Sorry but want to make sure everyone is comfortable with the transaction and that is the only way that I know of to keep everything on the up and up and legal. Thanks!

I added the DPMS Sportical Upper as a Quality Low-Cost option when I just wanted to have a complete AR rather than a Lower Paperweight hanging around. 
I bought the Upper brand new a year ago and it probably has 200 rounds thru it.  The finish on each match perfectly.  This lower is stock, but it has a sweet crisp trigger that I don't find on the factory guns now days.  That along with the fixed stock makes this a Solid Shooting Platform.  This is a perfect gun for the recreational shooter and/or hunter.  I recently had it out on a 15deg Coyote hunt, and it functioned perfectly in the cold.  $650 OBReasonableO takes it.  Ill go $550 if you don't want the Scope/Mount and Iron sights.

This rifle has had about 300 flawless rounds through it and some upgrades done as well. The traditional stock has been replaced with a 5 position stock that has a locking lug to prevent any movement while aiming and also has a compartment for storing items. The firing pin has been replaced as well as the extractor, these were not broken I just felt the need to freshen them up when the rifle was modified as they are really the only parts that ever break on an AK. The piston is stainless steel and the forearm of the gun has been modified with a tri rail addition with heat shield. A magpul fore grip has been added for ease of aiming, and a Houge grip has been placed on the gun for a tight hand hold and comfortable grip even after hundreds of rounds. The stock also has a shock absorbing rubber pad that absorbs recoil without effecting aiming. In addition to all of this, the standard G2 trigger has been slicked up and modified to remove the majority of the take up and shave the pull down to around 3lbs. The rifle will also come with 4 magazines and 60 rounds. The cleaning rod is intact as well as the bayonet lugs. This rifle also has a side mount rail for adding an optic as well. The last modification that was made was to replace the slanted muzzle brake with an A2 Flash Hider. I can be best reached by email or by text at REDACTED. Thanks for looking."

They came from the balkans region, as the major manufacturer markings are scrubbed off, but from what I can tell it is still identifiable as a Tula, tang stamped 1906.

I've shot it on two different occasions, definitely not a tack driver, but you can hit a man sized target to 70 yards without being too generous and I have done so. The flip up konovalov sight is measured in Arshin, and is much better than the notch and post on the regular 91/30.

This is not an M91/30, and this is not a $100 rifle. Handguards themselves can go for $50 (if you find someone willing to sell theirs).

Make me an offer, I will also take cash outright. I will also trade this for value toward a K31, value negotiable. Local sales only please.

This was in a box by itself and wasn't on a gun and finish as you can see is almost perfect accept a few marks on the mount. Switch works and looks like everything is there but it takes some kind of battery on top where the switch is but no reference to what kind. I'm not going to try any because I don't know exactly what it takes and don't want to try something and mess it up in case it's actually something more than a paper weight so you are buying it as is because it is unknown what will make it work. There are NO markings other than the Colt name and Trade Mark on top and some NON english warnings on the side shown in pic's. This was looked up to find out more about it but only found out that they are VERY RARE and it's going to take someone that is familiar from that era to know what makes it work.--------The FOLLOWING is for Firearms ONLY!! (The firearm absolutely has to be transferred to you and the paper work done as I Prefer to sell FTF at an FFL only. Don't really want to ship but if you absolutely need to it would be shipped from my FFL to your FFL ONLY! The Gun Broker in Oregon on 82nd is where the fire arm will be sent from or transferred if you want to buy it. Sorry but want to make sure everyone is comfortable with the transaction and that is the only way that I know of to keep everything on the up and up and legal.) Thanks!

Just sight-in as usual, then lift the spring-loaded adjustment knob, rotate to your “zero”, and reengage. Field adjustments are now as simple as dialing-in your subsequent ranges."

Always Kept inside the case. Only shot about 150 rounds. 
Original owner. 
I had the choice of the Benelli or Fabarm that where sitting next to each other at the gun store and after picking up this Fabarm shotgun, I never once even thought about the Benelli after that. 
This shotgun is so smooth it feels like it's on ball bearing rails when loading shells into the chamber. Hard to find and is one of the best shotguns in the world. 
No longer Imported and one of the hardest to find shotguns out there. Want a Shotgun of pure quality and something that a million other people don't have? This is what you want and no disappointments of any kind except for not being able to find accessories for it since nothing is being imported into the United States. But what else do you need? I already added the 2 shot extension and everything else is there for mounting Red dot sights or add another picatinny rail and add a flashlight or laser. 

When it comes to reliability and tactical flexibility, nothing matches the FABARM FP6 Series shotguns. Security professionals agree that a pump-action shotgun is still the best choice for a defensive shotgun. FABARM FP Series shotguns are built to take the toughest abuse confronting today’s law enforcement and security users.

FABARM pump-action shotguns use the same advanced design and manufacturing techniques found on their premium arms. Twin action bars, deep drilled TriBore™ barrels, durable sandblasted anodized finish, as well as interchangeable chokes, make the FP6 one of the strongest and most tactically adaptable pump-action security and utility shotguns available. The ability to mount accessory Picatinny rails on the extended forearm, combined with the rail mount built onto the receiver of many of the FP6 models further enhances the tactical utility of this shotgun.

Features:
• Tribore™ chrome lined barrel with heat shield 
• free carrier for quick, smooth reloading 
• extended forearm has hard points for mounting accessories 
• threaded outer barrel for chokes 
• Ergal 55 alloy receiver 
• can use a variety of accessories, including folding stocks, pistol grip stocks, compact hand grip, and magazine extension 
• twin forged action bars for smooth reliable operation 
• 3"" chamber 
• large safety button 
• choice of blade sight or Picatinny rail 
• lifetime warranty (not sure of warranty is transferable to a different owner)  REDACTED j"

This shotgun is in like new condition with only four shells through it. If you are not familiar with this shotgun it is made in Turkey by the same factories that make the Canik CZ75 clones and TP9, Winchester SXP, and many other quality firearms. This is a 5+1 pump action that will chamber 3 inch shells. Has a built in recoil pad and pistol grip, as well as a nice set of fiber optic ghost ring sights, a receiver mounted picatinny rail, a removable breacher choke, and is VERY lightweight. This is a Benelli pattern shotgun and will accept extended benelli magazine tubes. Very similar to a Benelli M3 (sans the semi auto functionality) for a fraction of the cost.

In great shape but Ive had a few shotguns with pistol grips and ring sights and Ive found that I prefer a straight stock with a bead sight. This shotgun retails for $299, Id like to trade it for a similalrly priced 12 gauge shotgun with a straight stock, bead sight, and 18-20 inch cylinder bore barrel, such as a Remington 870, Mossberg 500/maverick 88, winchester sxp, or similar. Only looking for combat/hd style shotguns, absolutely not interested in field guns, sorry.
