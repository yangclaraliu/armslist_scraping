132,335 Miles
FOR SALE- IF INTERESTED, MAKE OFFER.
Picked this up several years ago in Florida. Drove it home to Branson and parked it. Had intentions of restoring, but due to being on the road for work, never had the time. I put almost 2000 miles on the car driving back from FL. Via NC.. The car ran great. Transmission is solid. Has a lot of pep for a V6. Didn’t burn any oil, and has no fluid leaks. My only issue is it has a rough ride due to suspension modifications for 20” rims.
Here is a list of Issues that need to be addressed;
•	The suspension
•	The driver’s seat has some holes/tears and wear in leather.
•	Some of the trim pieces on dash and console need refinishing or replacement.
•	There are minor dings and scratches here and there. The driver’s door has small dent and scratch from Harley falling over on it.
•	Both front tires (Falkens) need to be replaced. Passenger side holds air. Driver’s side does not. Rear tires are like new, 2000 miles on them.
•	The ignition coils and plugs probably need to be replaced at some point. The fuel filter as well. These were on my to do list.
A little money, time and effort would make this a great car once again. The car is being sold as is with no warranty. I am motivated to move it, so if you are interested, make me an offer. Give me a call or E me with your questions. 417- five nine eight-9637"

I hadn't planned to sell this, but I'm adjusting my collection a bit and would like to get some cash toward a future purchase.

If you’ve not shot a P89, I can tell you it’s a pleasure to shoot. The extra weight from an all metal gun really tames even the already mild recoil of 9mm. For someone who is recoil sensitive, this would be a great option, making it a great gun to shoot for hours at the range. It’s perfect for a home defense gun or even a vehicle gun, though probably a bit heavy for most to carry.

You get:

· Ruger P89 9mm Pistol
· (2) 15-round magazines (1 Ruger OEM, 1 3rd party)

The 308 barrel has a Leupold FX II 4 x 28 fixed scope with a 3 ring dovetail mount.  I can't remember the manufacturer of the mount & rings but it holds zero very well, I went for tough considering the caliber.  It has 80 rounds through it.  Also included is a 45/410 barrel that's had a box of 410's through it, or perhaps less, and that's it.  Never had a 45 down the pipe.  Both barrels are 15"".  

The whole package is in great condition w/one exception.  The sides of the lower have slight flecking.  They don't appear in the photo's but they are there.  They're not rust and I'm a little confused as to what they are.  Perhaps there's a finish that TC puts on the SS and this is the result but it's been this way since the first year I owned it.  Otherwise, it's great.  Slight wear based on the fact that it isn't brand new.  But it's SS so you can buff it up if you like.

Includes;

- Original box for both Encore and Leupold
- All factory tools, locks, paperwork (minus BOS), manual, 410 chock & tool, etc.
- Original rear sight for the 308 barrel
- Hammer extension
- TC soft case
- I've got an old shoulder holster that I'll throw in.  It works well enough (not in pics)

Surgery on my right hand tells me that I'm not likely to be able to play with this anymore.

- Ruger Scout
- A solid 30-06 (cash would likely be req'd)
- M1A (if you're in the mood)
- S&W 41 mag

Will require photo copy of NC CC permit, valid drivers license and BOS or shipped to an FFL.  Let's keep it clean.  Shipping extra but should be approx 25 bucks I'd think."

SIG SAUER® Introduces the New 1911 Max, Built to Winning Specifications

Competition pistol designed by world speed shooting champion, Max Michel, Jr.

SIG SAUER Team Captain Max Michel, Jr., has brought his winning ways and experience to work with SIG engineers in the development of the 1911 Max, a race-inspired pistol built to his unique specifications.
Built by the SIG SAUER Custom Shop, the 1911 Max is a single-stack, 5″ all-steel pistol with all the
custom features that a world-class shooter requires.

“We’re proud to be associated with a competitor of Max’s skill and character,” Bud Fini, Vice President of
Marketing. “He also brings years of elite-level match experience, which is incorporated in this pistol.”

A Nitron-finished stainless slide features forward cocking serrations, on top of a natural stainless frame
with 26LPI checkering on the front strap. Max’s “MM” logo is custom engraved on the slide and machined
into the Hogue® custom G-10 “Chainlink” grips, which offer a very aggressive, non-slip surface to the
shooter.

“I’m pretty particular about what goes into my guns,” Michel said. “In my world, a broken part or a
malfunction could end my shot at a world title. I wouldn’t put my name on a gun unless I was certain it
would measure up to my standards.”

Built to Michel’s specifications, the 1911 Max has a host of custom features, including SIG SAUER flat
trigger, external extractor, a Dawson® Ice Magwell®, a Koenig® Speed Hammer® and EGW® sear and
firing pin. Fiber optic front and adjustable rear sights also provide high-speed visibility. The 1911 Max will
be available in .45ACP and .40S&W.

It consists of an AR style lower (http://www.lonewolfdist.com/Detail.aspx?PROD=915278&CAT=8034) with Sig brace and a 10.5"" upper (http://www.lonewolfdist.com/Detail.aspx?PROD=915258&CAT=2895).  As you can see, it's decked out and ready for more accessories.  I've put about 200 rounds through it, and it's operated flawlessly and is amazingly accurate.  Best part: it takes standard Glock mags, either the 17 round ones or the 33 round ones....AND the aftermarket 33 round mags work perfectly in this pistol.

As you can see from the links above, this kit would be about $1400 before shipping and transfer costs, AND the upper is currently backordered.  So if you want this now without all of the waiting, fees, and paperwork, contact me.

In terms of trades, I love Glocks, and I'm also looking for a Walther P99 (9mm only).  I might consider a swap on a high-end 300BLK AR.  I am NOT interested in bolt rifles, shotguns, or cheap crappy handguns.

I am willing to separate them and sell the upper and lower separately, but I can sell the lower only to a resident of Alabama over the age of 21, and I'm not willing to drive very far outside of Birmingham.  A bill of sale will be required, and having an Alabama county carry permit will make things go a lot more smoothly."

Hey all,
I have up for trade or sale a sweet 1911. This is a Taurus PT1911 in used but great condition. It has a few marks on the muzzle end of the slide, but nothing too bad. I would keep this by I really am looking more for a compact 1911 than a full size. This will come with 2 magazines, factory box, and factory barrel brush. Need to meet up in Norman on this one due to my schedule. 

In terms of trades, I am somewhat open. I would consider compact 1911s in 45, 357 mag or 38spl revolver in full size, and even certain rifles. I would even trade up to an entry level AR. Some trades will need boot on your end, some will need on mine. I also have a substantial amount of JHP 45 ammo that I could sell with or add to to even out the values. For any questions or to make an offer shoot me a text at 4058212160 or a message on here. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!
