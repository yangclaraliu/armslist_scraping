It has a black Hogue grip cover. I am asking $650 for the pistol, grip cover and everything that came with the gun originally (3 mags, Glock box, manuals, etc)

I will also consider selling it with a Raven Concealment Systems Holster Kydex holster (RH), an MD cut mag carrier (Left side), 2 boxes of Hornady Critical Defense, a Surefire X300 Ultra and everything that came with the gun originally (3 mags, Glock box, manuals, etc). Everything is brand new. 

Retail was $650 for the G21, $300 for the light, $60 for the ammo, $140 for the holster and mag carrier and $10 for the grip cover. Total: Around $1200. I'm taking a bit of a loss but would love to sell it all in one place. Your gain is a ready-to-perform fully outfitted weapon system. Asking $1100 for everything. 

So I'm basically asking $650 for the pistol with box, mags and grip and $450 for everything else(light, ammo, holster). Open to trades. Really hoping to find a G30 that I can use as a daily carry but shoot me your offers. Worst I can say is, ""no"". Email me with your offer, phone number and pics if you're proposing a trade. I do not ship or travel more than 250miles from Bend, Oregon."

P30 A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable backstrap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers. The P30S has a conventional double-action/single action trigger have a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame. P30S models have an ambidextrous safety lever mounted on both sides of the frame. A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber. Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions. During a recent (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.

This is a solid rifle and it is a fair price, especially considering you will not be paying taxes on it like you would if you got it at a retail store.  Please don’t send low ball offers.  I am not desperate to get rid of this gun but I do want to thin my collection a bit.  I have only put 120 rounds through it (4 full mags).  That being said it is a good rifle and it is well into its “Break-In”.

If you are interested contact me and we can make some arrangements. I am not really interested in trades at this time as I want to use the cash for another build but if you have something interesting I will listen. I will strongly consider trading for a Kriss V Special Duty pistol or SBR (not the CRB) or even a Chiappa Rhino 50DS in .357."

Visit us at our website at http://www.parkerssafesandvaults.com

Parker's Safes and Vaults is a family-run, veteran-owned, home-based business operating under Godly principles. We carry CHAMPION, SUPERIOR, and AMERICAN SECURITY brand safes. I could carry a bunch of other brands, and have been approached by some other companies, but I choose these because of their quality, customer service, U.S.A. manufacturing and warranty. I wouldn't sell you a brand that I don't have faith in or wouldn't own myself. (I own a Superior.)
I also keep my prices very fair. I don't run a lot of sale price specials. You won't have to wonder if you could have saved a few dollars by waiting for a big sale. The prices are already low. I'm not trying to retire after one big sale- I just want to sell a lot of safes! When you buy a safe from me and then, because you were happy, tell your friend and he buys a safe, you've stumbled onto my business model.
PARKER'S SAFES AND VAULTS carries around 40 gun safes in sizes from 17 cubic feet up to 95 cubic feet and WE DELIVER, INSTALL AND SERVICE! That means we'll bring the safe to you, put it where you want it, get it level, bolt it down,(if you want), explain how to operate and maintain your new safe and lock, explain the warranty paperwork AND help you if you have an issue in the future. (I've only seen 2 problems in 4 years and they were both minor).


TESTIMONIALS...

""I had to thank you again for one of the most pleasant buying experiences I've ever had. I am 100% satisfied with the Master 25 safe by Superior. Buying a safe for our home was a big deal for my wife and me. I wasn't looking for someone to sell us a safe. I was looking for someone to understand our needs and guide us to make the best decision for our home and budget. Your knowledge, courteousness and professionalism accomplished those things and much more. I was also impressed with the flawless delivery and installation. Job well done Aaron and much success to Parker's Safes and Vaults.""- Mark M.

""Aaron Parker is an honest and personable individual who beat prices around the state. After you have done your homework and shopped around, go see Aaron. He beat Cabela's prices for a comparable safe by $1500."" - Brandt M.

""Mr. Parker gave me a fair deal and outstanding on-time delivery and installation. Also, his two young sons, who assisted him, are just about the most polite, well-behaved boys I have ever met."" -Ramona H.

""We bought our safe from Aaron last year and were very impressed by his knowledge and service. He told us about each style of safe and how each would or wouldn't be suited to our needs. Delivery was flawless. His product quality is excellent."" -Mike and Kathy C.

""I have had my safe for over a year and love it. When I bought it from Parker's, I was very happy with the price and the looks of the safe. It looks great. The safe was delivered and set up when he said it would be. I was shown how to work it and told if there was any problems to call. I have never called because I have never had a problem. Prior to getting it from Parker's, I looked all over. The quality of my safe is so much better than the ones I had looked at. One of the other stores I looked at had a floor model that would not open. Most of them were so light I could move them by myself. I wanted something safe and that's what I got from Parker's."" -Earl P.

""Doing business with Aaron was the best service and sales all my life. Excellent all around. He never pushed sales on us. We wanted to buy his safe. Delivery was perfect. (and it was your hardest install!)"" -Leslie and Jinx

We're committed to helping you PROTECT the things you value from THEFT and FIRE. Choosing the right safe for your particular needs can be a tough endeavor. We'll help you decide on a safe that will not only fit into your home or business, but will also fit your budget.

-------THANKS for considering my company, Parker's Safes and Vaults is dedicated to providing our customers with quality safes and professional service. Most of our safes are made here in the UNITED STATES of America. I'll be with you before, during and after the sale. I know the value of a satisfied customer and therefore; I do all I can to achieve just that. 
If you're in the market for a quality safe, please give me a call!

The free-floating military-grade barrel is chrome-lined and phosphated, and the rifle features an adjustable four-position gas regulator. The SIG516 Patrol also features a free-floating M1913 quad rail and flip-up adjustable iron sights.

SAPI (Small Arms Protection Inserts) Plates or Ceramic plates (also known as trauma plates) are commonly used as inserts for soft body armour. Most SAPI plates used in the body armor industry can protect against a NIJ level III and IV with a IIIA vest supporting. SAPI plates are a form of composite armour. Insert plates may also be manufactured from steel.

The standard SAPI plate is made of 98% aluminum oxide (alumina), which is then bonded into aramid fiber. These plates are often worn by army personnel needing protection from heavy rifle fire. In Iraq, the type IIIA vest with the SAPI plate helps protect troops from small-arms fire to 7.62mm rifle bullets, like those commonly used with the Kalashnikov (AK-47).

Surefire M620V-A KIT: Scout Light Vampire with White/Infrared LEDS, M93 Swing Lever Mount, 150 Lumens / 120mW, 7"" tape Switch & click on/off tail cap

The compact M620V Scout Light® produces 150 lumens of brilliant white light or 120 milliwatts of invisible infrared output for use with night vision devices--with no need for IR filters or spare lamps; attaches to Picatinny rail with a Swing-Lever™ rail clamp. Simply twist the self-locking selector ring on the dual-spectrum V-series head to switch between output modes. In either mode, the M620V's TIR lens produces a tight beam suited for short- to medium-range applications. The high-efficiency LEDs are virtually immune to failure since there's no filament to burn out or break. Comes with a momentary/constant-on pushbutton tailcap switch and a momentary-on pressure-activated tape switch with a 7"" cable that can be positioned where you choose. Also available are optional dual SR pushbutton/pressure pad switches.

The M620V clamps solidly to any long gun equipped with a Picatinny rail via its integral M93 Swing-Lever™ rail clamp, which self-adjusts to off-spec rails and features a lever lock to prevent loosening from vibration or recoil. Constructed of high-strength aerospace aluminum with Mil-Spec hard anodizing for superior toughness and corrosion resistance, and optically coated tempered glass for durability and maximum light transmission, the M620V is O-ring sealed to keep out dust, dirt, and moisture. Battle-proven and built to withstand the rigors of combat.

Available in Desert Tan.

Fits: Rifles, carbines, or submachine guns with a Picatinny rail on the forend. (See our Picatinny Rail Forends to equip your weapon with multiple integral forend rails.)

Hey everyone, I have up for sale or trade a used but in great condition EAA ""Windicator"" 357/38 special revolver. It is in great cosmetic condition and shoots flawlessly. I put roughly 50 rounds of 38 spl and 20 rounds of 357 mag down the pipe of this. It is a very stout gun and shoots great. I is a 6 shot and has is the 4 inch barrel model. It also comes with the factor plastic container and I can include ammo or other extras for the right trade. Mainly interested in trades for a Glock 40 or 380 (obviously with extras on my side) or possibly a 44 mag revolver, or even a 38 revolver plus extras. Would consider cheap 1911’s or other pistols in 45, 9mm, and 40 as well. Would even trade for a huge lot of 45 auto brass ammo. Would also trade for a good SR22 with some extras. Honestly, just shoot me a text and we can go from there. worst I can say is no! Just shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can try and get something lined out. I would also consider partial trades for cobra derringers, mainly in 38 spl or other large bores.  Even shooting this in double action it is very easy to keep on target and the trigger pull isn’t bad for being a factory job. The grips also make it very comfortable to shoot even with the 357 mag rounds. For any more questions or pictures just drop me a line and wel go from there! Simple BoS required on this one."

These are high quality 7075-T6 forged lowers. I'm located in Two Rivers. These make for cool paperweights, conversation pieces, or each can be legally finished into a functioning lower with a little drilling / milling. In their current state, these are not considered firearms.
I travel from Two Rivers to Wautoma frequently, and can meet someone anywhere in between for no charge.

I also have the jig for finishing them, I won't sell the jig until the last lower sells.The price for the jig is $135. Yes, I am aware there are cheaper jigs out there. This is a high quality jig with steel inserts for repeated use. The jig and lowers are sold by Ares Armor.

Will sell both lowers, plus a disc with CNC g-codes for $120

626,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3070626,For Sale:  * RARE * Wilkinson Terry 9mm Tactical Entry Carbine * uzi * 9 mm,"Pierce County, Washington, United States","$ 1,200","Listed On: Saturday, May 17, 2014",Rifles,no type,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Listed here is a rare piece of firearm history that dates from the 1970’s and 1980’s. This is the Wilkinson Arms Terry 9mm Carbine. Based on an original design from J&R Engineering called the M68, this was a limited production run from a Mom & Pop style firearm manufacturer that placed too much emphasis on perfection and quality that subsequently put them out of business.

The Terry carbine is chambered in 9mm and is a pistol caliber carbine. Although it has the legal barrel length of 16in, several inches of the barrel reside in the receiver to give an extremely compact tactical package. The end of the barrel features a muzzle brake enclosed by a flash suppressor cone. As you can see from the pictures, the barrel removed from the receiver by simply unscrewing a washer which then breaks the gun down into an extremely small and concealable package.

This carbine was designed as a tactical entry carbine for use by law enforcement and SWAT teams. This gun takes 32 round magazines and feeds in the same manor of an Uzi. This gun will out-shoot an UZI all day long with accuracy and reliability. The quality of manufacturing and materials put the cheaply stamped UZI to shame. This thing functions as solidly as a bank vault! Essentially, this is the American Uzi that never made it mainstream. The upper part of the receiver is formed so that a simple claw scope mount can be mounted and optics utilized. I can personally attest that of the 3 times I have shot this rifle, I had no problem hitting a man size metal target from 100-150yrds. This carbine is an absolute joy to shoot and the 9mm ammo is not only affordable, it can be shot at any gun range to boot!

Wilkinson Arms also manufactured a much more common variant of this gun in pistol form known as the Linda. This particular example is in excellent condition and comes with 3 32 round magazines.

The stock is in BEAUTIFUL shape and the entire rifle looks great and functions fantastically.
I had plans to keep this locked in the safe but other projects force me to sell. Buyer is responsible to make sure they are legally able to purchase and own this weapon. A Washingtong State drivers license or CCL will be needed for my records only for the bill of sale. Please feel free to call or text with any questions. REDACTED

I didn't find many local prices on the gun, so it's somewhat rare and I'm unsure of how to price it. Slightly used now; it was taken to the range 3x (including the trial run before I bought it; I am the only shooter of the firearm). It comes with two 17-round clips as well. VERY accurate. I went to buy much smaller gun, but the owner told me about it and let me try it. It impressed me so much I brought back the gun I had originally bought and shelled out the additional couple hundred bucks for this beauty. It's not as rare as I may have hyped it just now, but it's not easy to get around here.

I really wasn't even going to sell it, but I am getting another, smaller gun for practical reasons, and there is no real reason to have this beauty just gathering dust, it needs love. I'm gonna put a price tag of 400 **OR BEST OFFER** on it, but know that I am always up to negotiation, so don't be afraid to email me; it's just an email, and I will respond regardless.

This feature is especially helpful in areas with high levels of ambient light that may wash out the image.

Powered by one AA battery, the PVS-14 will run for approximately 50 hours at room temperature.
