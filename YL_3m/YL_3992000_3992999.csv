214,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3992214,"Want To Buy:  Cold Hard Cash for all AK's & AR's! (WASR's, AK's, M70's, Bear Creek's) The Uglier the Better!","NE Portland, Portland, Oregon","$ 300,000","Listed On: Wednesday, February 18, 2015",Rifles,no type,7.62x39,no type,no type,"Hello Armslist,



  This ad is pretty darn simple; I'm looking for any and all AK(7.62x39mm) or AR(.223/5.56 NATO) style rifles, which includes all the variants such as RPK's, PKM's, etc(and I won't go into the thousands of AR variants). Particular attention is paid to collector's who have more than one, and AK's that are not super-desirable. I'm not looking to pay $800 for a single AK, so no Arsenal's, Red Army's, Saiga's, etc. I personally think that is a waste of money for any rifle, no matter how pretty it may be, thus, I'm more in the Iraqi surplus/WASR/Romanian AK range. The cheaper the better and the more of them you have the more I will offer you.

  As to the AR's, again, quantity over quality. I don't need a $5,000 night-visioned, auto-feed magazine, with a 78 position butt-stock that is also a GPS and makes you coffee in the morning, after giving you a nice back rub. I'm looking for simple, military-style AR's; iron sights(or basic scopes), carry handle, 30-round mags. Accessories or no accessories.

I have plenty of firearms to trade, black powder firearms, Mosins, even a small black powder field cannon.


I would love to buy some 'beater' AK's/AR's. So long as the interiors function(I pull the trigger, it goes BANG, and my face is still intact) and there is not much rust, I'll buy it. I go this route because I'd much rather spend $200-400 on an AK/AR with rust, a broken trigger assembly, and some minor missing pieces to fix myself, rather than grabbing a Saiga or Colt for 8x the cost. So if you have any AK's that have been languishing in your safe, if you've got your project gun that ""you'll finish someday, dammit!"", or if your girl is getting on your case about ""having an assault rifle in every damn room of the house"", this is the ad for you!


Please email me anytime; I will respond with 24 hours normally. Kindly send pictures if it is not a hassle; and remember I am looking(hoping more like) for larger collections. If we could get a bulk deal going where I purchase 10 AK's/AR's at once, that would be so much better than singly. That being said I will look at everything. Also interested in:



-Maxim MG's
-MG42/34's
-Mosin Nagants
-1911's(especially Rock Island)
-Ammunition
-Unique guns



For trade I have a random assortment of goodies:

-Snowboards
-200+ MRE's
-Mosins
-Black powder weapons, all very unique
-Warhammer(most factions)
-Modern Body Armor(this one is truly special; the only one on the West Coast)
-Gun cases
-Cash moneys
-Medieval Weapons(longswords, training bows, training weapons)
-Full-size Pool Table, Saloon style(NIB)

Bring me something interesting and hell, I'll even trade you my kick-arse gaming computer, which I'm typing this ad on. Nothing is off the table for AK's/AR's and variants.



Thanks Armlist, as always I look forward to a full inbox.


Cheers,

This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1942 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped in May of 1942. It is stamped with WB inside a Box for Colonel Waldemar S. Broberg, Hartford/Springfield Ordnance District, Army Inspector of Ordnance: July 1, 1941 - June 16, 1942. The WB inspected pistols are a little more rare for that time frame.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. But not all pistols back then were stamped with ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted national match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by the military, as the barrel has been re-stamped. This gun is in its original time frame finish (parkerized). All Proof markings to fit era. Bore is excellent and looks shinning.

This pistol is a shooter. It is amazingly tight and special fitted for accuracy. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection.

All were assembled by one master gunsmith and craftsman, who currently is the director of technical services at Steyr.

A Match or free pistol that has the barrel positioned exactly at the level of the index finger, the gun has no rotation when fired.  This makes it capable of essentially perfect precision in aiming.

Machine rest accuracy of the guns is close to 0.2 MOA at 50 Meters.  This is equal to the best USA produced match .22lr rifles.

The barrel position also makes it perhaps the only handgun that can be fired with full accuracy from a canted or tilted position.  The sighting system is designed for this use, as well.

Due to the extremely low barrel position, the sights themselves are very high, however.  Also, the hand must be positioned precisely in the handgrip.

Shown with a small to medium Morini factory grip, but L and XL RH and L LH grips also are available.  Grips etc sold ONLY with the gun however.  Please note, several pistols are available.  The STATED PRICE with the listing is the lowest priced option with a standard (large) Nill grip.  The Morini grip (illustrated) and the XL grip are $100 higher in price.  All available images are included in this listing, but more can be made.  If you want more, please indicate what additional views are desired.  The guns are essentially identical except for the grip.

Includes the case (useful, Italian origin), and an English language instruction manual (essential).  No factory tools, which are very low quality anyway.

Precise price depends on the grip chosen.

Note that sometimes these guns are sold without the weights and rail.  Use of the gun without them is NOT recommended, if high accuracy is desired.

All ammunition loads and velocities can be used with this gun, from the very low subsonic to the very high velocity rounds.  The muzzle brake is very helpful with the latter.

FFL required for transfer.  In a few regions, this gun MAY BE an assault weapon.  It is on the CA-Legal exempt list.

""Close"" offers considered.

For those wanting a more ""conventional"" hand gun, or one that is not banned from silhouette competition (due to the unbeatable accuracy), Hammerli 150 and Pfuff free pistols, and a 10"" barrel GSP also are available."

The original 1911 platform has been scaled down as a single action straight blow back operated firearm that is 85 percent of the original. The results have been astounding! This redesign accommodates the much smaller .22 Long Rifle cartridge with flawless performance under a Commander hammer. The controls operate the same as the original design in an extremely accurate firearm that is perfect for plinking or teaching new shooters. Its smaller size is idea for small hands and yet the black laminate stippled grip panels retain a size comfortable enough for larger hands as well. In traditional Browning craftsmanship the 1911-22 A1 features a machined aluminum slide with a matte black finish and an extremely accurate stainless steel barrel with a target muzzle crown. It has a solidly constructed black composite polymer frame with an accessory rail under the dust cover and checkered front grip panel. The familiar safeties include an extended ambidextrous thumb safety and a beaver tail grip safety. It comes with a reliable 10 round steel magazine and the magazine release is still positioned in the same comfortable location adjacent to the squared off trigger guard. The Browning 1911-22 A1 is a must have firearm for any shooters collection and an even better choice as a first time firearm purchase.

The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome linedusing techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.

These rifles are currently banned from import and becoming very scarce. Prices are likely to go nowhere but up. I am only asking what I have in it. The gun is unfired and like new in the box.

Yes it is very well built and when you read the parts that have gone into it you will agree too. No not cocky or anything but this gun is very well built. 

Spikes Tactical slick side upper and lower. Also the lower parts kit with a Timeny trigger with 3 lb pull. The stock is built by Troy. It's their new collapsible stock that has a custom made BCG that goes with it. The barrel is Daniel DefenseM4 profile 16"" with a 1/7 twist. The gas block and the tube are also from spikes, the low profile .750 block. The rail is an UTG 13"" keymod rail free float rail. Now the scope is worth more than the gun. The scope is for law enforcement or military. The scope is a Nightforce NXS 2.5-10x24. Very very good scope. Can't say enough about it. 

If you made it this far and you know about guns you know this is not just a simple AR-15. It will not be a cheap AR-15. You are more than welcome to make an offer. Just know that the gun is worth $1600 and the scope is worth more than that. Yes it's not your typical gun but if someone wants a high quality gun this is it."

The grips on the gun were 110.00 dollars because of the custom embedded colt medallion.

It has a custom fitted egw barrel bushing fit to .00015 to slide and .002 to barrel which was 40.00

This package also comes with 3 extra magazines that the gun did not come with from the factory.

2 Metalform 8 round magazines. 55.00

1 shooting star 7 round mag 20.00

also included is a egw flared magwell-20lpi mainspring housing 70.00

So i think it is fair to value gun at 1100 dollars. At the indy 1500 there were 4 railguns i saw there for over 1200 dollars before tax. 

So doing the math the price of gun with the things included in package comes to 1395.00 so 1200 asking price is fair."

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and
need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.
