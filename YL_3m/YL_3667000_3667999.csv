Highly accurate and distinctly refined, the 84FS offers a host of features found on Beretta’s larger combat pistols. An ambidextrous, framemounted
safety is easily manipulated by right- and left-handed shooters. The combat trigger guard can be pressed against any hard surface
for support during emergency, single-handed firing. The open slide design ensures positive extraction and ejection of spent cases in the most
unforgiving conditions. The magazine release can be easily swapped for right or left-handed shooters. The grip tang is small enough not to hinder concealment, but designed to eliminate the possibility of the web of the hand being struck by the slide.

It's a Lithgow Enfield chambered in .303 British that in absolutely beautiful condition. This rifle was imported by J. Jovino of NYC whom I'm told bought all of the remaining inventory of these rifles from the Slazenger arsenal of Australia in the late 80's or early 90's. Some of these rifles came over intact and some were assembled here by Jovino from all original parts that came from Slazenger.

In any case this rifle is as close to a perfect as new specimen as you are ever likely to find. Everything is 98%+ with only the slightest handling marks. I have shot it and it functions perfectly. It's quite accurate as well. 

Rifle comes with all the accessories pictured including bayonet, canvas carry case, sling, original cleaning kit, bolt disassembly tool, ammo, bandoleer and stripper clips. 

This is a beautiful rifle and one that will continue to grow in value. I'm asking $750 for the entire outfit with pickup in the Brandon area by a Florida resident who is at least 18 years old. Unfortunately shipping firearms has become to complicated and costly for a private collector so I will not ship this rifle.

The barrel is in great condition otherwise, but the front bottom part has notable scratching. I'd estimate I put a thousand or two rounds through it? Works nicely; just too heavy for the applications I want my rifle configured for.

I'm asking $75.
Or, if you're upgrading from a standard barrel, I want that. I'd do a partial trade for it and $25, if it's great condition with the iron sights left on it. I'd take lesser (but still usable) quality, and/or no sights, if you threw in more cash.


I am mostly only interested in face to face sale/trade at my house, 4 miles south of Wamego, straight down K99. Throw in $5 if you want to meet in town in Wamego.

I can't say enough about this beautiful revolver.  I bought this last fall from an accomplished shooter near Madison to see if handgun hunting would be my next venture, but at this point I feel more comfortable just saying I'm not a handgun hunter.  The previous owner sent it to Wilson Combat, and according to him it was accurate in harvesting deer from 125 yards.  As for me, I can certainly say it's been a pleasure to shoot.  My teenage daughter enjoyed it, too!  (In case you're wondering if you can handle .44...you can!  The Magna-Porting really seems to reduce recoil.)  I sent about 100 rounds down the pipe and cleaned it religiously the 3 times I've taken it out.  I've kept it lightly oiled and always stored away from corrosive elements in a safe.  (Not in the foam lined case which, from what I've heard, can have a negative impact on a gun's finish over time.)

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

KeyMods were added at the 3 & 9 O'clock positions for modularity and additional weight savings. It's unique mounting system captures a standard AR15 barrel nut for easy installation. Check out all the features and see for yourself why the Fortis REV™ beats the competition.

 THE LEGEND CONTINUES, the legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic SWAT is a semi automatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate.

Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic SWAT features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as a aluminum quadrail forend that is ideally suited for mounting accessories. The Classic SWAT’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ barrel. SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor.

The SIG 556 Classic SWAT is available for law enforcement and responsible citizens. Obtaining a sight picture with the SIG556 SWAT model now takes place using a new rear rotary diopter sight, utilizing aperture calibrations from close quarter ranges out to 100m, 200m, and 300m.

The one Lionel 3620 Search Light Car that comes with the train is all metal from an old set in working order these are expensive and hard to find in working order. The ply wood base is included if you want it is wired up for the houses. Everything is in 100% working order. The train should be cleaned it's a little dusty. I do run the set once a month to keep the engine lubed due to it being a smoking unit. I have prolly 1400 bucks into this and have lost interest so my loss is your gain.

The rail is a YHM Diamond Series 6930 that is 7.29"" long.  It does not come with a CH/BCG.  The upper in my picture has a YHM 762 QD suppressor FH, but it does not come with it unless you want to pay for it.  Otherwise, it will come with the standard A2 FH it originally came with.  I am also including with this a NIB set of Lee 300 BLK dies, this is included in the $425.  I have only about 50 rounds through it and it was very accurate.  The upper is keyhole marked with a few dings on the shell deflector.  I got bit by the bug, just decided not to continue with a new caliber.  I shot some store bought subs and supers in it.  It functioned perfectly with the 147 gr supers, the 208 AMAX subs did not throw the bolt back far enough.  I did not try lighter carriers, buffer, or anything.  I decided I really want a BCM 11.5 or 12.5 5.56 upper, so I am selling this.  

This is for a pistol or if you have an NFA registered SBR, do not use otherwise.

If you are local, I have 2 jars of unopened IMR 4227 and one of H110 that I will sell with it for additional.  I probably have some brass and few rounds still left.

They say it is the first repeating handgun ever invented. Also known as 'Remington's New Repeating Pistol', or 'Elliot Pocket Repeater'.

Derringer: Four barrel .32 rimfire, ring trigger. Left side: ""MANUFACTURED BY E. REMINGTON & SONS ILION, N.Y."" ... Right side: ""ELLIOT'S PATENTS MAY 29 1850 OCT 1 1861"" ... Four shot double-action derringer ... trigger cycles properly, and firing pin rotates to each of four positions properly. Barrels are 3 3/8"" - barrels unlock, tip forward, tip back into position, and lock, securely. The bores are in good shape - uncleaned, but the lands and grooves are visible and relatively unworn. The grips are said to be made of rosewood. The right grip appears to have been replaced, or, perhaps sanded a little too much.

They say only a few thousand of these were ever manufactured, between 1863 and 1888. But I've only seen one other for sale - and it was inoperable.

Matching serial numbers on frame and barrel assemblies.

One reference estimates the value of this piece as less than $800. I disagree. That valuation was made half a decade ago. The only sale I've seen matching that valuation was for a piece with an inoperable firing pin. And I don't think the evaluator gave sufficient weight to just how uncommon four-barrel derringers are.

I estimate its value as more in the neighborhood of twice that - $1600.

I would happily trade this for two stock Ruger 10/22 rifles (through an FFL), and some cash."

I have a Ruger SR22 that is threaded and ready for a suppressor. This is a secondary SR22 that has less than 200 rounds through it. I purchased it originally but found a Bi-Tone threaded that is my plinker. If you haven't had the SR-22 and know nothing about it know one thing, it eats all ammo you put through it with no hiccups. No need for the CCI Minimags and higher velocity ammo to cycle. My SR-22 is in great shape with no issues and will come with everything that it came with new. 2-10rd mags / pinky ext / thread protector / thread wrench / manuals / box / case. I am looking to trade my SR-22 for one of the following items that I will list below. I am willing to add any of the following for the right trade, Ammo / Cash / Lee Hand Press ready with everything you need to start reloading 9mm tomorrow. That being said I am willing to work a fair trade out with value of my SR-22 but expect the same in return. I’m not looking for a Glock 42 valued at $540 due to that being the price paid and wanting $300 trade value in mine because mine is used. I am looking for one of the following,

This Martini was originally built by London Small Arms Company in 1881 as a Mark III Martini Henry in Caliber 577-450. After serving the armed forces of the British Emprire and the Crown for several years, this old veteran became obsolete in the early 1890's with the advent of the new .303 Caliber Bolt Action Lee Metford and Lee Enfield rifles. Queen Victoria must have not been able to bear the thought of throwing away thousands upon thousands of perfectly good Martini Henry's so an ingenious plan was devised to rebuild and convert these Martinis over to .303 caliber. These new .303's were sent off to the Colonies for a few more good years of loyal service to the Crown until they were retired at the turn of the 20th century.

 MARKINGS: If you know what to look for, the markings on these old Martinis tell quite a story...Ian Skennerton is probably the best source for deciphering the labyrinth of markings the British military used on their weaponry...I'm not the best interpreter but I will do my best to translate. This rifle has loads of good markings, all with a story to tell. This rifle tells me it went to Enfield in 1899 for its rebuild and conversion. The LEFT side of the receiver is marked with the Crown Cypher over V.R. (that means Queen Victoria Regina), over ENFIELD (the manufacturer), over 1899 (Its Conversion Date), over M.E. .303 (Martini Enfield Caliber .303) over A.C. II. The RIGHT side of the receiver bears the Crown Cypher, over V.R., over ENFIELD, over 1881, over a smaller Crown symbol, over I.C. 1. As typical of London Small Arms markings, the original set of right-side receiver markings are extremely light and due to the Enfield rebuild in 1899, the crown is somewhat difficult to see. 

I am no gun expert, and found someone else selling the same rifle on here with much more knowledge than myself. I copied the majority of his description of this rifle has he does a much better job identifying it than I could have.

Price is $700 OBO, I would like this gun gone, so if you are interested, make an offer. Text 727 366 234zero"

This shoots the high powered 3 1/2"" magnum shells as well as 3"" and 2 3/4"" shells.  It is the armor plated 887 Nitro Mag with a 32"" turkey barrel and a fiber optic front sight. I purchased it as a new never fired gun. Can't guarantee it but it looks in perfect condition and the bolt doesn't show signs of firing.  I paid $400 but will take $350 or maybe a trade if it is attractive enough. Save at least $100 and get a gun you can't tell isn't new.

Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – the Model 870™ – the new Model 887™ Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth. The most durable and reliable shotgun ever built, it has no external surfaces to rust. Our exclusive  ArmorLokt™ construction process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor, so you can wipe it down with your wet dog or a decoy bag at the end of the day.

Its overmolded surface is built to withstand abrasion in the trenches, whether that’s barbed wire, gnarly thorns or the bottom of a Jon boat. And when it’s time for action, our revolutionary  SuperCell™ recoil pad so effectively reduces rearward force that it makes a 3"" mag 12 gauge feel like a light field load. This is our softest-shooting pump gun ever. Similar to the Model 870, its receiver is manufactured from solid steel, and the barrel is hammer-forged.

Key Features: Action design based on the venerable Model 870™ – ultra-smooth and reliable Rugged  ArmorLokt™ coating totally prevents rust on all exterior surfaces SuperCell™ recoil pad  reduces the felt recoil up to 54% Our softest-shooting pump gun ever Awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics Handles 12-gauge 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" loads interchangeably Rugged synthetic stock and fore-end with specially contoured grip panels 28"" barrel with solid rib and Hi-Viz front sight with interchangeable light tubes Sling swivel studs built-in Includes Modified Rem Choke"

Spring Powered Airsoft Gun BAXS: Accuracy System
Velocity: 315fps Energy: 0.5 joule
Mag Capacity: 12 rds
Maximum Range: 131ft

The Softair Colt 1911A1 Spring Powered Airsoft Pistol employs the BAXS Accuracy System for straighter, more accurate trajectories. The pistol offers 0.5 joule of energy to shoot with a maximum velocity of 315 feet per second and a maximum range of 131 feet. The pistol is equipped with a 12-round magazine.
 The BAXS Accuracy System:
Tradition hop up systems use two points of contact on the B* (top and bottom), that allow the airsoft guns to shoot to the left or to the right. With the BAXS Accuracy system, Airsoft has incorporated three points of contact with the B* in the design (two at the top and one at the bottom). These three points of contact spread the weight of the B* more evenly, center it, and give it backspin, causing the airsoft gun to shoot straighter and with greater accuracy.

Crest is a very nice touch, but later imports lacked this feature with only plain washed wood stocks (Makes it even more Rare: You wont find one with a crest, I looked). This gun is a lot tougher than your normal AKM. No longer imported and out of stock except for Atlantic Firearms for $730 which is what I based my price on.

As I understand it....these were model 56s rifles that were caught in transit during the 1989 Bush assault weapons ban, and we're modified accordingly for legal importation (had their evil bayonet lugs neutered, among others). The '56s' was ground off (you can see where it was), and replaced with a 'NHM-90' stamp. These were precursors to the MAK-90, and were also imported prior to Clinton's 1994 Chinese assault weapons ban.

Shoots pretty good, accurate enough for plinking, but I wanted a hunting rifle so I'm gonna sell this one and try my luck with another one. This would also be a great collector item, since the numbers match and it cleaned up so good. The stock is okay, would look great if it was refinished. Comes with original accessories: pouch, grease can, tools, barrel cap, cleaning rod,  and bayonet. Email any questions you have. 

Price is $150, which is the same as J&G, only you don't pay tax (saving $15) and I've done all the cleaning and polishing for you."

I bought it a while back with the intentions to use it for coyote hunting, long range shooting, and making a cool looking weapon like nothing in my current gun cabinet. So everything on this rifle serves an important purpose. I have been able to shoot at 600 yards a few times and this gun performs outstanding and is very accurate. The rifling is in great shape and when I bought it never looked like it was actually used. The wood stock was a little beat up but not bad at all. Shoots MOA groups. Now lets get to the good stuff.
Included are the following:
-ProMag Archangel stock
-(1) 10 round mag, and (1) 5 round mag
-Jmeck scope mount (no drilling or tapping of receiver) with picatinny rail
-NcStar Mark III 6-24x50 Mil-dot illuminated reticle.
-Leupold scope rings
-Boltman bent bold mod (30* sweep)
-ProMag forend rail
-UTG tactical OP-2 bipod (collapsible 6""-9"")
-Shark muzzle brake (threaded)
-Also included is everything to turn the mosin back into it's original configuration (IE. wood stock, box magazine, bullet pouches, original straight bolt, sling, bayonet, oil can, barrel bands, and repair kit. 
The reason why I chose the Jmeck scope mount was because I didn't want to drill and tap the receiver so I found Jmeck scope mounts that actually form around the receiver so there's no machining that is done to the gun and it is 100% reversible. Look up this mount it's legit! This gun has been my baby and I hate to see it go but my loss is your gain. This is going for a fraction of what other people are asking. I will ship this item to your local FFL but you must pay for shipping. I will work with you on shipping charges if you go that route. 
For an extra $50 i will also include a MidwayUSA sniper drag bag that will fit the mosin perfectly and has enough storage to carry an entire 440 round spam can and fit an AR-15 along the side of it. $75 Value 
The price is negotiable so let me know your offers. Every reasonable offer will be considered. Willing to trade for a Savage 10t or Savage 10tr. Needs to be the 24in barrel. Will be willing to drive if close or meet half way depending on how far."

Internal 4 round magazine with hinged floorplate for rapid, safe unloading.  Right now I have a 3-9x40 Vortex Diamondback with standard fine duplex reticle mounted on factory Ruger rings.

I have 10 left

You get one 1/2 lb Tannerite target. Tannerite® Brand Binary Exploding Targets are a binary explosive used primarily as a shot indicator for firearms practice. Tannerite® is unique in that it is exceptionally stable when subjected to less severe forces such as a hammer blow or being dropped. It is more than 1,000 times safer than ordinary black powder since it is not flammable and can not be initiated by any kind of flame or electricity. It is supplied as two powders which are combined to produce the explosive. Tannerite® is a trademarked name, and binary exploding targets are a patented invention by Daniel J. Tanner/Oregon. Tannerite® detonations occur at a very high velocity, producing a large explosion and cloud of water vapor. It may be useful for persons who are firing at long ranges; in this scenario, a long-range rifle shooter places targets downrange, retreats to his firing position, and fires. The shooter does not have to walk down range to see if he has a hit, the Tannerite® brand target will detonate and serve as an indicator. Since the two components are not explosive until mixed, they can legally be purchased in the USA without a license. They can be legally used for sporting purposes in conjunction with small arms, just like black powder and other exempt sporting powder. The federal government, not the state, governs the manufacture of explosives. They specifically exempt the need for an explosives manufacturing license in five separate statutes. In the CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Publication 5400. Q&A section, question #48 expressly addresses that a license is not needed for personal, non-commercial manufacture and use of binary explosives.
