i also have conversion barrel (9mm) and mags if interested

it cost me over $1200 to build with the conversion but i can cut a deal if you take 9mm match barrel and mags as well your getting a like new M&P with all kinds of work for an extra $100 if you figure what you would walk outta the door paying… my loss your gain, baby gotta eat ;)

Will trade for CZ P01, P02, p07 in 9mm or P06, maybe an AR10 upper lower set or shorter barreled bolt guns.. No cz 75b's right now though

The Beretta M9A1 evolved from the base design of the battle-tested and proven M9 pistol, with input from military and law enforcement agencies around the world. It was developed to meet the demands of the U.S. Marine Corps, and it incorporates the established reliability and performance of the M9. The M9A1 features a white 3-dot sight system, a sure, firm grip, a Picatinny MIL-STD 1913 rail, and a magazine well bevel to facilitate fast tactical reloads in combat situations. The chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion resistance and ease of cleaning, and it also features a deeply-recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. The special PVD coating reduces friction, and the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of sand accumulation within the round column, which greatly increases the reliability and functioning of the M9A1 in the desert or other extreme conditions."

The Beretta M9A1 evolved from the base design of the battle-tested and proven M9 pistol, with input from military and law enforcement agencies around the world. It was developed to meet the demands of the U.S. Marine Corps, and it incorporates the established reliability and performance of the M9. The M9A1 features a white 3-dot sight system, a sure, firm grip, a Picatinny MIL-STD 1913 rail, and a magazine well bevel to facilitate fast tactical reloads in combat situations. The chrome-lined barrel provides extreme corrosion resistance and ease of cleaning, and it also features a deeply-recessed combat muzzle crown to protect the rifling. The special PVD coating reduces friction, and the magazine tube design reduces the possibility of sand accumulation within the round column, which greatly increases the reliability and functioning of the M9A1 in the desert or other extreme conditions."

There is a little chip in the wood around the grip shown in picture that worst of the wood damage, checkering on stock is good. Scuffs in the finish and couple indents nothing that couldn't be fixed by the steam trick. Worst of the stocks finish is where you hold it with your left hand but hasnt been rubbed through.  Bluing inside and around the action is pretty clean normal wear and tear. I would guess somewhere around 300 rounds have gone through this gun total in its life, Bolt actions still pretty stiff.

Smaller size allows for mounting on a wider variety of railed hand guards and better compatibility with rail covers and accessory mounts.

Compatible with most any 1913 Picatinny-railed hand guard, the Magpul AFG2 (Angled Fore-Grip) takes into account natural body mechanics and provides a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore-grips, the AFG2 helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

The Gen4 recoil management is a dream.  Glock uses their new design to the dual recoil spring assemblies on its Gen4 pistols.  Couple that easy recoil with multiple back strap options for a perfect fit to your hand and the Gen4 SF (short frame) grip for easy concealability, and you can understand why FBI and CIA agents carry these under their suit jackets. Large enough for a service/duty weapon, small enough for conceal carry.    Buyer pays all transfer fees.

If you watch Hickok45 on YouTube, you know he said that if he could only have ONE Glock, it would be the Glock 23 (see video at:  http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dd848bus9aE )

And for accuracy demonstration, you can watch Hickok45 on YouTube hit on target at 230 yards with the G23 Gen4.  (see video at:   http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zFd3kF6LHz4 )

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.
Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.
To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.
Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.
Features & System Characteristics:
•	Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
•	Grooved target triggers

The sd series is Smith and Wesson 's version of the ""glock"". It's a great mid size polymer framed pistol.  I've had this sd40ve fir over a year. Have polished the slide, barrel, and most of the trigger parts. Gun comes standard with a 5.5lbs trigger pull. I have replaced the trigger spring system with Galloway precisions trigger reduction spring kit lowering the pull to the 3.75 4 pound range. Also I've replaced the original 17 lb guide rod and spring with Galloway 's 20 lb spring which has helped stability of muzzle flip greatly. Also it's stainless steel not plastic.  Also coming with the pistol is going to be two fourteen round magazines and one with Apex Tacticals 3 round base plate making it a 17 round magazine.  Also there will be 300 rounds of winchester white box fmj 1 50 rd box of federal fmj and one 50rd box of blazer fmj. Also have a couple hollow points and some mag safe ammo. Maybe two mags worth. Not needing to get rid of pistol just looking for something different.  So this is not for sale."

Clamp screws connect the barrel and the receiver and the trigger assembly is built into the receiver as a separate module. The main stock and the forend are connected to this ""self-supporting"" unit without having any supporting function themselves. The results are better accuracy because any natural warping of wood stocks cannot influence it. The bolt locks up directly into the barrel leaving the receiver as an unstressed part.

This rifle is pretty much the nicest I've held. It's beautiful. My buddy's dad brought it down from CO and asked me to find a new home for it. So here it is. Will come with the mount and rings. The Swarovski comes off unless it is something you can't live without and we make an agreeable trade/sale.

This rifle will also come with about 150-200 rounds (i'll count a little later) of premium ammo. Every weight and projectile configuration one can find - all Hornady - and you can figure out what groups best for you. About 100 rounds through the rifle and meticulously cleaned and maintained.

The Apex Duty/Carry Action Enhancement Kit I purchased and had installed by an M&P armorer at Sharp Shooting gun shop in Spokane.

The Apex DCAEK kit comes with a high quality machined sear that replaces the factory MIM sear. The geometry of the Apex sear creates a more crisp trigger break and shorter reset with no over-travel. It also includes a radiused and polished striker block that makes for a very smooth trigger pull with no gritty-ness. Finally it comes with springs to reduce the trigger pull to around 5lbs. 

Gun is in excellent condition with the exception of some light holster wear on the right side by the ejection port. It was hard to see in pictures so I spent the time to get the lighting at the right angle to accentuate it. I try to be honest when selling and not hide anything. The picture was not accurate on Arms List so please Copy & Paste this link in your browser to see: s13.postimg.org/qhbr948if/IMAG1054.jpg

I'm willing to drive for a sale/trade if outside of the Yakima area. I can meet halfway or if you are in Seattle I would consider driving to your area. 

Buyer must be able to lawfully purchase a firearm. Will need to see a valid Washington state ID or DL to show proof of residency and age.

------------------------------
The Troy Industries MRF Drop-In Battle Rail Handguard is a 2-piece, non-free floating upgrade that installs in seconds to replace an AR-15's standard polymer handguards. The MRF drop-in quad rail utilizes Troy Industries' patented clamping design for a rock solid installation, making use of the rifle's existing barrel nut, delta ring assembly, front sight base and round handguard end cap. Machined from 6061 hardened aluminum and given a mil-spec anodized finish for durability, the MRF provides true M1913 Picatinny rails at the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-o'clock positions for the mounting of tactical accessories. For greater versatility, quick detach sling swivel sockets are incorporated into the 3-o'clock and 9-o'clock rails for easy sling attachment. Made in the USA.

I have for sale or trade hard to find Caracal F in 9mm. Made in UAE. 2 18Rd. magazines included. Comes with original case and papers just like from factory. Condition is like new. Only 250-300 rounds was shot. Very reliable and highly accurate gun. Not a single problem with a gun. Trigger is the way better then Glock. I would say it is like Walther PPQ trigger or even better. If interested just watch some clips on Youtube about Caracal F.

The .22 rimfire handgun will never look the same. The P22 changed everything. Walther adapted the tactical styling and Performance Design concepts from our centerfire handguns and applied them to the .22 L.R. This created a new movement in the design of contemporary rimfire handguns… and an explosion of imitators. As a stylish, fun gun to own, the P22 is at home on the shooting range, around the camp or in a museum of modern art.

I have put maybe 2-300 rounds through it so far. I believe there was only one failure to eject, pretty sure due to under powered ammo. Otherwise its 100 percent reliable. Gun is in perfect condition. Kept really good care of it and cleaned as soon as I came back from shooting. Currently has a Houge grip on it, which I really like. Do have the original grips, made of real wood. I made a little modification to the sight which is, painted a white dot on the front sight post and a white line around the back sight (as seen in 3rd picture). Also the trigger has been polished and trigger over travel has been modified. Weight is still around factory standard weight, just more smooth than a factory trigger. Last of all, the load chamber indicator has been deactivated. All of these modifications, other than polished trigger, can be reverted to stock at your request. I personally believe these modification only make it easier to shoot more precisely. 

I am the original owner and have the box with everything that came with it. Need money for a new gun. Looking to get myself a Glock 35 (40s&w) because I need a carry gun when in the woods. 

Will trade only for a Glock 35. Nothing else please. Dont have much money to put up for the trade.
