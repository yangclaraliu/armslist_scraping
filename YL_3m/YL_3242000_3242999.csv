CZ 02101 455 Lux Bolt-Action .22lr Rifle, 20.6 Inch Barrel, Walnut Stock, Detachable Magazine, Adjustable Sights

The CZ 455 is the latest generation of the CZ bolt action rimfire. The 455 model will eventually consolidate all of the receivers currently used in the 452 line into one common platform. This combined with the new interchangeable barrel system of the CZ 455 will allow the user to easily change the stock configuration as well as the caliber of the rifle. The 455 retains the accuracy and quality of the adjustable trigger, hammer forged barrel and billet machined receiver from the CZ 452. Improvements that the 455 brings include new manufacturing technology and tighter tolerances for improved accuracy and smoother operation. The 455 models feature an integral 11mm dovetail for scope mounting and a 5-round magazine.

The Lux model features adjustable iron sights and the “Lux” pattern stock that is designed to excel when used with open sights. A 5-round magazine is included.

In all seriousness though this pistol with the Sig brace affixed to it and shouldered, which is legal according to the BATF as of May 26, 2014, makes an excellent firearm. I have fired one hundred rounds through it flawlessly and it has been oiled and cleaned since. The only reason I am selling the firearm is because I have other firearms, all though you can never have too many, and would rather have the money to go towards paying off bills. The firearm includes everything pictured which is the Sig Sauer Arm Brace, 11 slot rail mounted to the bottom, as this is a key mod rail, with a Magpul XTM hand stop which I have o say I far prefer over and vertical grip or any for grip but to each there own. A set of Magpul MBUS sights is also included which are flawless and a enhanced trigger guard to make which makes the gun much easier to use with bulky winter gloves. A Magpul grip is also on the gun with a hollow cavity to store batteries or whatever you may want to keep with the gun. A two position sling mount is also included attached to the buffer tube. All of this comes with the gun including two brand new Magpul 30 round p-mags, 100 rounds of 147 grain brass FMJ factory ammo and a great Draco case. I promise, which I very rarely promise anything, that you will not be disappointed with this set up.

2. I'm currently in Oregon for the 4th of the July weekend.

About EXO Technology
EXO Technology is a patented, nickel-boron coating from UCT Coatings, Inc. EXO Technology provides a hard, durable surface (40% harder than Chrome) and permanent lubricity to metal substrates, allowing firearms to operate without oil or grease. EXO coated components last longer, clean up easier, and require minimal maintenance, while increasing reliability in harsh environments (sand/dust, hot/cold, suppressed fire, frangible ammunition).

I have bird dogs that have told me about brand new S&W ARs for $500. Don't give these morons $800 for their used rifle or mix and match home builds just because it has a extra mag and clone red dot. Buy from a legit dealer for far less even after adding the extras and the extras will be brand new with warranty. You wont get a warranty here. I've preached it for a while now that AR prices are about to bottom out and we still haven't seen the bottom yet. Turns out I know what I'm talking about. Listen when I tell you to hold out on major ammo purchases. The prices are about to drop there too and even 22 will be plentiful again very soon. Sorry if you made a panic buy but this is the risk you took and the new very low price tags are strictly your fault for causing a flooded market. You wanted to preach about supply and demand when everyone was diving through their asses trying to buy black rifles, and I sat back laughing at you, and now the flip side of the coin. Too many guns and less buyers in a shit economy. It's time to get a grip, cowboy up and cut your losses. You got suckered by another democrat."

I hate buying a gun off of armslist that has problems the seller didn't tell me about. So here's all the dirt on this gun. The frame and slide is scratched and not in pristine condition. I've probably put about 600 rds through it without proper cleanup. So no, it's not like new. Pre-decocker isn't like a pre-lock Smith and Wesson (which usually means better quality) on the Taurus PT-92, it just means that you don't have a decocking option.I only have one mag for it, which I've abused, so the slide doesn't lock back on the last round anymore. Recently, the gun's been stove-piping. This is usually means a dirty or bad ejector. It's not a chronic issue, but if you don't clean it and shoot a hundred rounds through it, it'll not eject casings properly. That is everything that is wrong with this piece.

So what's good about it? At 15 yds (I'm no expert shooter by any means but...) the sights are reliable and your bullets will shoot where the sights are. It'll eat everything, whether it's match grade Horniday, steel case Tul-Ammo, or hollow points. The gun is SMOOTH with a pristine DA/SA trigger that'll give any revolver a run for its money. No issue pulling the slide back, the gun's well broke-in and cycles buttery smooth. The mag still feeds reliably. 9mm is cheap, readily available, and parts for this gun are easy to find. Did I mention the nice pachmayr grips? That wasn't stock and they look good on the gun. $275 OBO, all trades welcomed. Satisfaction guaranteed or your gun/money back. 

Back in the late 90's Beretta stopped making guns for the Brazilian military and police. Taurus came in, bought out the Beretta factory in Brazil, kept the original machinery, re-hired the previous workers, and told them to do exactly what they were doing. A Beretta without the Beratta price. The only real changes they made to the design was the safety lever, which they put in a place that made more common sense."

This is by no means a cheap set-up.  The trigger alone was $230. Do not low ball me because I do not need to sell.  I got my SBR stamp on another lower so I don't need this one anymore.  I just figured I would throw it up for sale to maybe save someone the trouble of building their own lower.  Obviously not everyone is looking for a pistol lower.
This can be used as either.  Price is $500 for the complete set-up if you're looking for a rifle lower I will keep the buffer tube and sell it for $450

I'm sick and tired of the over priced run of the mill guns, the traders who think they are the barter king of the century, and the wanna be pawn stars. I'm tired of logging in to see the same shit over posted day after day, tired of the greeding ground this site has become. If you want to buy at pawn store offers buy a pawn shop, no one is here to sell at those prices. And like wise no one is here to pay store price when we all have a gun shop around the corner to buy from at those prices. To steal a quote from Mr. Jim Jones, the one on here not the cult leader, "" If wasrs are worth 800 mine has to be worth 1000"" is exactly the mind set that has run this site aground. There is not one dracco worth $1000 Jim. Sorry to use you as an example but you did it to yourself. Just because the next guy gouged doesn't mean you should too or that either of your guns are worth the price you want for them. I would love for someone to offer me more money than my guns are worth but thats just not how it works, or how it should be. Yes there are some rare collectible guns listed a couple times a year that can have a open price tag but if it's not your great grand dads war bring back with the according paperwork, you need to hit the bricks and see what they actually sell for at the gun shop, or look up their web site and then knock off a few more dollars since you know damn good and well your not going to warranty it if something goes wrong. I have every intention to wage web warfare on this site until I see the market we had before the second obama scare. It's just going to get worse before it gets better so it would be in the best interest of the honest guys to start flagging the bull shit before all you see are my rambling posts and the occasional gun for sale. If your flagging me your part of the problem and your exactly the guy I want to piss off. Don't send me emails telling me you agree with me because I've already gotten your emails supporting me in the past and then you low balled me or couldn't be bothered to have the courtesy of sending a no thanks when I made fair offers on your stuff.

LEE #90707
There is no loading system that will load more accurate ammunition than Lee Collet Dies. Lee guarantees it in writing with every set. No one
but LEE has ever dared make a guarantee like this - SMALLEST Group Size or Your Money Back. A collet squeezes the case neck against
a precision mandrel for a perfect bullet fit with minimum run-out.  No case lube is needed. Cases last ten times longer, so the savings on 35
cases will pay for the dies. Maximum accuracy is usually achieved by seating the bullet out far enough to touch or almost touch the rifling.
This provides the shot start pressure normally supplied by the crimp. That's why dead length bullet seater is included to complete the most
accurate reloading system ever made. These dies size only the neck to preserve the perfect fit of fire forming. Only reload cases that have
been fired in your firearm. Not recommended for autoloaders, slide or lever action guns.

Collet Neck Sizing Die
Dead Length Bullet Seating Die

No other SKS besides the Yugo/Serbian has this.  You use a blank in conjunction with a dummy grenade because obviously it's illegal to have a real grenade.  Comes with a bayonet and sling mounts and would make a good hog hunting rifle or collectors rifle. It comes with 1-20 rd and 1-30 rd detachable magazine.  There are signs of use on the magazines as they were used. The stock has the most beautiful wood grain of any rifle I've ever seen. The pictures can't come close to how nice this rifle looks. My camera can't seem to get a good picture. If you're serious about buying it you won't be disappointed,   I GUARANTEE !!   Since removing the cosmoline, I have kept in immaculate condition and only shot it once with under 100 rounds through it.  My friend was mad because I was out shooting his AR15 with this. He couldn't believe that I was shooting through the same hole at 50 yards consistently.  I'm not desperate for cash and am firm on the price.  Face to face sale only.   If you are interested in buying, email me your location and I'll try to meet you half way.  I'm selling this rifle privately with no paperwork required. Only need to show a Texas I.D. so I'll be in compliance with the law.  Will consider pistol trades on a case by case basis. Mostly 1911's, beretta 92, M&P, XDM, glock 23 or compensated models."

3MR   trigger functions in a standard semi-auto mode with a 4.5lb trigger when the safety switch is in the standard Fire position. When you switch the selector switch back to where full auto would be on an M4/M16 you get the same 4.5lb semi-auto trigger, and the action of the bolt resets the trigger for you.

The build quality is superb. USA manufactured utilizing CNC and EDM processes to produce the parts. The quality control process is top notch.

TAC-CON says the trigger is capable of a 600 rounds per minute (RPM) rate of fire. Most shooters will   be in the 400-500 RPM range,   Short travel distance and assisted reset means you have to do very little movement with your trigger hand.
