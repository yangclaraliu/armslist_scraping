Precision on the Range, at the Ranch, on Patrol or in the Woods. Specifically designed for mounting today's scopes or other optical sighting systems, these rifles include a side ejection to clear the top mounted scope, and a patented recoil buffer which protects the scope from damage or shifting the point of impact as the semi-automatic action cycles. Simple rugged Garand-style action with breech bolt locking system, a fixed-pistol gas system and self cleaning moving gas cylinder gives unparalleled reliability under harsh operating conditions. Heavy , hammer-forged barrel for extra rigidity and accuracy. Accurate sighting system with “ghost ring” adjustable rear aperture sight and a protected, non-glare post front sight. Patented integral scope mounts, machined directly on the solid-steel receiver provide a stable mounting surface for scope rings. Eliminating a potential source of looseness and inaccuracy in the field. Flat, rifle-style butt pad for recoil reduction.

The V9 plate causes the gun to function as follows: DA/SA with safety, but no de-cocker.

These switch out in less than a minute when you field strip the gun to clean it. Just allows the owner to have the choice of having a V1 variant USP or a V9 variant. All about personal preference. V9 functions basically like a 1911.

 For sale (or trade) is 900 rounds of FACTORY .25 auto ammunition. I think $150 an extremely good price considering it goes for $20 a box if and when you can get it. At $20 a box, that $360 worth of ammo!!!

 I would also consider a NOE 311247 mold with handles and top punch, heavy .308 caliber projectiles or pistol gunpowder powder (which of course nobody has either).

 Be advised, at this price I'm not driving far...

 I think its important to mention this... I am NOT A AMMO SCALPER. Someone accused me of this last week. If I was an ammo scalper, the ammo would be more expensive, not less expensive. This is part of my ""ammo collection"" that I no longer have a use for."

I bought this a couple months ago with plans to send it to Wilson Combat to get some upgrades done.  In the meantime, Beretta released the 92G Brigadier Wilson Combat collaboration and I had to have that one, voiding the need for the M9.  

I've shot exactly 2 mags through this gun, although you wouldn't be able to tell.  The gun shot great, and the Italians know what they're doing when it comes to style.  I have everything the gun comes with new including the box and 3 magazines.  

The M9 offers a variety of tactical features that make it equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster of military personnel as well as for home or personal defense. Its reversible magazine release enables the use of either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes the pistol flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. Its Bruniton finish with military-style markings is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion, and after shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it simple and quick to take the pistol apart for cleaning. These and countless other useful features make the M9 the choice of the US military, as well as individuals wanting the absolute best for sport or self-protection.

Asking $590.  Located in Elkins/Fayetteville.

Prefer cash, but will consider trades.  Interested in a Sig 227 or FN FNX-45 Tactical.  Will add cash as needed."

With its 18"" barrel, ghost rings sites, 5+1 capacity, and 3 Pic rails, this 12 gauge is a GREAT home defense firearm. Add to that the inertia-assisted slide-action Super X Pump, and you get very fast follow up shots. I used this Winchester twice to shoot skeet and was impressed.
There is one scratch on the right side of the cheek rest pad, otherwise it looks great.
Note: the butt is made by ATI but is not adjustable (though it looks that way).

The Winchester retails for at least $375 before the taxes, shipping, and FFL fees are tagged on to your price.

It is setup with the 223 conversion but will not come with any dies since I use them in another press. This press is three years old but has only loaded a couple thousand rounds max. It comes with Dillon's famous ""NO BS"" warranty. The press comes with everything that it would come with from the factory including the box and all the instructions. It also comes with an extra No Bull tool head from Tactical & Machine, shell plate bearing kit from Hit Factor shooting supply and a offset Ergo roller handle from Inline Fabrication. 

Here is a break down of what I paid for the press and related items.
Dillon RL550B $457 shipped for Brian Enos
No bull Tool Head $30
Inline Fab Roller Handle $55
Hit Factor Shell plate and bearing kit $32
That total's $574

The extra's that were added to this press are ones that really make a difference and are not useless parts. If you want the press without the extra parts shoot me a offer and I will go from there. 
If I get the job promotion that I have been hoping for before this press sells I will be keeping it and putting it back on my bench where it belongs. If my money wasn't tight I would not even consider selling this press.
