Will come with 1 box of .250 Savage rounds and also has an old school M7-4X Leupold scope.  It is a very nice scope.  Really clear to look through.  Also has a nice leather sling.  Wood is in good shape.  No huge scratches or damage.
I have seen these rifles priced anywhere between $250 and $600.  So make me a nice offer and it is yours.  

I will also entertain trades for handguns in .45 ACP.

2. LAST ROUND LOCK OPEN
The slide will lock open after the last round in the magazine has been fired. Our unique patented magazine design and heat-treated steel lock open insert allows us to offer this special and desirable feature which you can only find on 'Advantage Arms' .22LR GLOCK conversion kits.

3. INTERNAL FIRING PIN SAFETY
Glock incorporated an internal firing pin safety into their guns. We thought it was important enough to include it on our conversion kits as well. Our internal firing pin safety is designed to eliminate accidental discharges from dropping the firearm. 

4. FINISH
All Aluminum parts are Anodized Per Mil-A-8625 with a matte black finish. All steel parts are heat treated with a Black Oxide Finish. The barrel is made from heat treated 416 Stainless Steel.

5. THE 10 SECOND INSTALLATION
Installation is simple and does not require any modifications to your GLOCK pistol. Simply remove the GLOCK magazine and slide as outlined in your GLOCK owner's manual. Now slide the ""Advantage Arms"" slide onto the frame, until it engages with the slide lock. Check to make sure that the slide lock is in its most upward position. Insert the conversion magazine. You are now ready to shoot.

This procedure can be accomplished in less than 10 seconds with some practice.


Great for practicing accuracy or introducing a new shooter to the sport. Feel free to contact me with any questions."

Also comes with 3-4 mags (I would like to keep one mag for my G23 but if the trade is good enough I will include all 4 and maybe one of the 30 rd Korean mags). Again, if the deal is good enough, I will have one mag already loaded with Federal Hydra Shok JHP ready for your ride home.

Very well maintained and cleaned; I am one of those every use (now think Arnold Schwarzenegger's voice - for comedic effect) ""clean it now"" guys.

I do not require a bill of sale/trade but do require a GA drivers license PREFERABLY a conceal carry permit."

What is presented to the German government is a slightly modified and scaled-down version of the Astra Modelo 400 chambered in the 9mm Luger [9mm Parabellum]. The new handgun is manufactured by the Unceta Y Compa√±ia S.A. in Guernica, Spain. The company gives the handgun the designation Astra Model 600 while the Heereswaffenamt designate it the ‚ÄûPistole Astra 600/43‚Äú.

This Pistol was brought back by a us Serviceman. It has no import marks. All matching serial numbers including magazines. Markings are clear and sharp and is near 100% Condition. Strong and accurate it is a safe and beautifully finished Pistol. I have been useing it as a Luftwaffe reinactor for 30 years. It comes with two matching Mags and Holster! 

Perfect for collector or reinactor but also shoots like a dream! It is the perfect representative piece, given that it  is German in thought and execution, was a design made by another country outside of Germany but made to German exacting standards of fit, finish and accuracy.  If you need to have only ONE non-German Made Pistol in your collection that was used by Germany, than this is the best of the best! 

I always liked it because as a reinactor, everyone that sees a Luger or a Walther assumes it is a model gun, but when they saw this, it got imeadiate attention, given that it is sinister looking, much less common and obviosly not a model gun. I  loved showing it off!

Note: Front strap has finish and grip protector on it. I will remove it if requested. It was put on by me so as to protect finish when I used it for reinacting.

Sear polished.
New Factory trigger and trigger spring set.
New Hogue grip cover installed.

My wife tells me I have too many guns, so of them must go, I hate to see this one go.

This pistol comes with its original hard case, papers and a life time warranty. 
It also comes with the ghost Ring peep Sight. It now has a 3-Dot sight on it. Fully adjustable rear sight, up/down/right/left.

I have shot this Hi Point 9mm at the range and have found it to be very reliable. It has never failed to fire for me, not even when I empty the magazine as fast as I can, it has not given me one problem. 

It is kinda bulky for a small gun but I can hit the bulls eye at the short range every time, it will do the same for you at home.

Hi Point wanted to make a pistol that was affordable to all Americans, this is the pistol for the average person, some one who needs to protect their home and family with an easy to use pistol at a very fair price that comes with a life time warranty.  

I'm asking $170 for this pistol. The two 10 round magazines and the two 8 round magazines, almost a full box of ammo left, I think it has 11 rounds used. I lost one good roind in a crack in the dirt. 

9mm Luger ammo is affordable and always in stock.

The receiver has been drilled and tapped and is currently wearing a ati scope mount with millet windage adjustable rings and a bushnelle banner dawn to dusk 4-12x40 adjustable objective duplex rifle scope. The gun is very accurate and I have busted clay pigeons sitting on rests out to 150 yards off hand. Included with the rifle is a already fitted boyds thumbhole laminate stock. I also have the original stock as shown in the picture with an original sling and cleaning rod. I refinished the original stock and made a cut for the new bolt handle. The gun shoots great in either stock. Its currently zeroed for 150 grain hornady vintage match sst ammo which you can usually find at cabelas and that round drops a deer dead. I shot an 8 point buck with a different nagant 2 years ago using that round and he went straight down like a sack of potatoes. I have also polished the bore on this nagant so it wont foul quite as a bad as your dark pitted bore. Im only trying to get out of this gun what I have in it and after adding up what I've done I'll take 450 bucks for that you get everything including the extra boyds stock, just not the scope which I think ill hang onto for another rifle. If you want the scope I will throw it in for an extra 75 bucks and it is already zeroed on the rifle so it will save you some time. If interested please email me."

For less than I paid for just the rifle you are getting the rifle, Magpul pistol grip, Magpul BAD lever, Magpul stock, magpul foregrip, Magpul vertical grip, Magpul BUIS and a Sightmark red dot sight w/quick detach. Since I'm switching to an all new platform I'll throw in any original furniture and AR specific gear I have as well. I spent around $1200 on all this and it's in perfect condition. The rifle is barely broken in.

This rifle really is a great firearm and I'm sad to part with it- but the Tavor and Aimpoimt put a pretty big dent in my wallet. I'll include all of the specifics about the rifle below. It's full mil spec and feels nice and solid when you hold it. The list below is from the manufacturer. It doesn't include all the magpul extras I'm throwing in along with all the original furniture I still have. I'll also throw in some cheapie red dot sites to use on other guns (good for .22).

Wanting to sell/trade my AR. I bought it brand new from cabelas a little over a year ago and have done a few Mods to improve the rifle to my liking. The M&P series are extremely reliable and tend to be of higher build quality than some of the other AR platforms out there. This one is the magpul edition so it came with all the magpul furniture from the factory. The only thing I added was the TROY INDUSTRIES free float quad rail system and the Eotech optic. Everything else is completely stock and unmolested. I have put maybe 300 rounds through the rifle and have always fired high quality non corrosive ammo. I have never had one malfunction. Comes with four 30 round Pmags and a two point sling. I have some other goodies for AR's not listed that i may throw in depending on the offers. $1700 obo.

It's 100% steel construction and was the standard issue flare pistol for West Germany during the 60's and early 70's. I've owned this one for quite a few years and used it quite a bit on the 4th of July and New Years. It was an issued pistol so it's not perfect and it has some holster wear around the muzzle plus a few minor scratches. However it's overall condition is very good and it's mechanically excellent.

Pistol comes with a German flap style holster designed to keep the pistol dry. It's made from a woven OD green color vinyl material and it's in excellent condition with no rips, tears or stains. It carries the pistol, cleaning brush and flare cartridges. Plus it has room for some miscellaneous items. It also has a nylon shoulder carry strap. 

Also included is a green nylon lanyard, bronze cleaning brush, and a felt tip cleaning rod. Finally there is an adapter by Kennesaw Cannon Company that allows you to fire any .410 shotgun shell or the .45LC cartridge. The adapter turns this flare pistol into a powerful weapon that would be excellent for emergency survival or self defense application. You'll really appreciate the strength and heft of the GECO pistol when firing .410 full power 3"" buckshot or slug rounds. Caution is a must when the adapter is installed because it turns a flare gun into a real gun. So know your local laws before installing this adapter.

For another $100 i'll toss in a blackhawk holster, 100 rounds of critical def and 50 200gr rounds of FMJ and a second set of night sights in the box. 


Rules? The $300 price is based off a $199 credit on a LG G3 and $100 cash. The LG G3 must be NEW UNUSED AND UNOPEND. If its removed from the box i dont want it. If they touch it at the store when you buy it i do not want it. Must be new never used, never powered on and never has had a sim in it. I know people have issues with taking them out playing with them then attempting to say they are new. At that point it is used.  I do not want any other phone. LG G3. I will tell you what color, If you want we can meet at a verizon store and do this. If you have credit at Verizon and want to toss in a case, high end screen protector or anything like that. Then i will toss in extra mags, ammo ect to make it a fail deal.

Up for sale today is a Crimson Trace Lightguard made for the S&W M&P series. Bought this in February for my M&P, which has since gone on to greener pastures.
Light is a nice bright 100 lumens in a pretty compact, streamlined package. I mounted the light and tested it out, but since then its sat in the safe (was on the M&P in a case for a couple months, then went back in the original Crimson Trace box after that). No blemishes or scuffs, includes original packaging, allen screw, receipt, etc. For all intensive purposes it's like new.

Asking: $110 shipped, or $100 in-person.

The gun is an earlier model P229 with an Exeter, NH slide built on a German Frame. It is in very good functional and cosmetic condition. There are a few scuffs and scratches from handling, but it is in otherwise excellent shape. I have personally shot a little over 500 rounds through it without a single failure. It is fitted with Siglite tritium night sights, although they are on the dim side. It is outfitted with Hogue rubber grip panels, and includes 3 Sig factory mags labeled ""Made in Italy."" Presumably of Mec Gar manufacture.

In addition to the gun I also have three holsters. A Remora Concealment No Clip IWB holster which is quite comfortable for concealed carry, a Safariland ALS 6375 OWB level 2 retention holster which is my personal favorite retention holster line, and finally a Bianchi X16 X Agent leather shoulder rig with 2 mag carrier. 

I also have an EKF firedragon 9mm conversion barrel. I bought the barrel to make practicing and plinking a little cheaper, but I've only ran about 100 rounds through it so it's like new.

The gun is in near perfect condition minus some general wear here and there on the gun (see pics). Firearm has NEVER jammed or had any mechanical issues whatsoever. This particular firearm was purchased in 2008 used from a firearm store that did a police department swap deal. Since purchase I've run 500(isn) rounds through it.

I bought it at the gun show recently and it doesn't fit me quite as well as I would like it to. I had planned to return it to the guy at the next gun show, but after $8 for parking and $10 just to get in...seems like bad math to me. Prefer not to wait until my budget permits me to make more purchases. I can't go to those things anymore, tendency to buy cool stuff. 
It is brand new, and works great, but my chest/back to waist ratio makes it too loose around waist. So its either stop lifting weights and eating clean or find another MPC.

I paid $85, have only worn it in my house for a total of less than 10 minutes. I have not even attached anything to the molle webbing. Asking same price I paid."
