First person that puts $775 cash in my hand takes it.

This is a Glock 34 I purchased new from an FFL dealer a few months ago. It was assembled by a Glock master armorer who was the gun smith for the store and was never fired. He put a ton of money into it, but ended up selling it to the store for a huge loss to fund a new build. Their sticker price was $999, but I know the owner and got it for their cost. I don't do shooting competitions and I have many other guns made for home defense work, so it's just a super-accurate range toy for me. I can put all 17 rounds through 1 1.5"" ragged hole at 15 yards.

Total round count is 250. All federal and UMC brass case. Zero failures.

Here's all thats's included with costs:
Gen 3 Glock 34 with three 17 round mags and unfired factory barrel - 620
Slide professionally cerakoted black, tough as nails finish - 50
Vickers enhanced mag floorplates - 45
33 round stick mag - 45
Talon Grips - 18
Glock OEM extended mag release - 5
KKM Stainless match barrel - 190
Seattle slug for balance and a mag funnel effect- works well- 45
New tritium night sights - 100
Upgraded extractor and other internals - 100
Full length stainless guide rod and spring - 40
Tuned match trigger breaks at 3.5-4#, crisp with great reset- 110
New bladetech OWB right hand holster - 70
Plus 5 hours of gunsmith time polishing internals and assembly. - you determine value
His stated cost before tax was around $1400 I bought the stick mag separately because why not?

Also box, paperwork, mag loader, brush, cleaning rod, all the factory fresh stuff etc. It's basically a new gun.

Whole package, $775 FIRM. Was listed at $850 earlier, but reduced for fast sale. Will not last long. It's a steal at this price. Not even the cost of the gun and stainless barrel let alone the sights, trigger, etc.

Cash only unless you have some really awesome gun you don't see every day. FAL, G3, Lugers, HK p30, auto ordinance Thompson, or other cool guns with character. No AR's- I have too many already. Trades must be transferred through an FFL. I have CPL.

As per I-594 this gun must be transferred into your name at your choice of FFL in Snohomish or Skagit county. You pay transfer costs. I hate it just as much as you do- no exceptions. Will ship to any FFL dealer (where legal) for $50, overnight air.

Contact me with questions through email only so everything is understood and in writing. I don't respond to phone numbers, gibberish, or lowball offers. Can meet at Cabelas in Tulalip for viewing, or request additional pictures through email.

This is a Glock 34 I purchased new from an FFL dealer a few months ago. It was assembled by a Glock master armorer who was the gun smith for the store and was never fired. He put a ton of money into it, but ended up selling it to the store for a huge loss to fund a new build. Their sticker price was $999, but I know the owner and got it for their cost. I don't do shooting competitions and I have many other guns made for home defense work, so it's just a super-accurate range toy for me. I can put all 17 rounds through 1 1.5"" ragged hole at 15 yards.

Total round count is 250. All federal and UMC brass case. Zero failures.

Here's all thats's included with costs:
Gen 3 Glock 34 with three 17 round mags and unfired factory barrel - 620
Slide professionally cerakoted black, tough as nails finish - 50
Vickers enhanced mag floorplates - 45
33 round stick mag - 45
Talon Grips - 18
Glock OEM extended mag release - 5
KKM Stainless match barrel - 190
Seattle slug for balance and a mag funnel effect- works well- 45
New tritium night sights - 100
Upgraded extractor and other internals - 100
Full length stainless guide rod and spring - 40
Tuned match trigger breaks at 3.5-4#, crisp with great reset- 110
New bladetech OWB right hand holster - 70
Plus 5 hours of gunsmith time polishing internals and assembly. - you determine value
His stated cost before tax was around $1400 I bought the stick mag separately because why not?

Also box, paperwork, mag loader, brush, cleaning rod, all the factory fresh stuff etc. It's basically a new gun.

Whole package, $775 FIRM. Was listed at $850 earlier, but reduced for fast sale. Will not last long. It's a steal at this price. Not even the cost of the gun and stainless barrel let alone the sights, trigger, etc.

Cash only unless you have some really awesome gun you don't see every day. FAL, G3, Lugers, HK p30, auto ordinance Thompson, or other cool guns with character. No AR's- I have too many already. Trades must be transferred through an FFL. I have CPL.

As per I-594 this gun must be transferred into your name at your choice of FFL in Snohomish or Skagit county. You pay transfer costs. I hate it just as much as you do- no exceptions. Will ship to any FFL dealer (where legal) for $50, overnight air.

Contact me with questions through email only so everything is understood and in writing. I don't respond to phone numbers, gibberish, or lowball offers. Can meet at Cabelas in Tulalip for viewing, or request additional pictures through email.

Everything operates just as it should, and the action functions just as you would expect.  This is the early and most preferred “round trigger guard” model. 

The gun comes complete in the original factory box and includes the instruction manual and all of the literature that was originally packed in the box from the factory.  Also included is the original and unopened cleaning and tool kit and two original Smith & Wesson-brand stainless steel eight-round magazines.  The box even has the original non-corrosive paper wrapping to protect the gun during shipment from the factory and long-term storage.

This Smith & Wesson Model 639 has a 4-inch barrel, adjustable rear sights, exposed hammer (which allows you to fire the first round in single-action mode) and de-cocker lever.  This gun is slightly smaller than a 1911, although its design evokes the traditional 1911 look.  It is still a hefty gun, however, at just over 1.7 pounds.

There are two very minor flaws that should be mentioned for fair representation: 

-The small Smith & Wesson medallion on the left grip appears to have come loose at some point.  The medallion has been securely reaffixed to the grip, but when this repair was made, the logo on the medallion was not as squarely oriented as it probably should have been.  It doesn’t stand out as an obvious flaw, but it is something you’ll notice… especially since I’ve pointed it out :-) 

-The lanyard loop at the base of the butt of the gun has some wear.  It’s still intact, strong and functional, but there is some wear evident in this area.

I recently bought this gun from a very reputable local gun store’s used gun case, and I have put about 50 rounds through it since I’ve owned it.  I was assured that the gun has been thoroughly inspected by a qualified gunsmith, and I have no reason to doubt their appraisal.  I experienced no issues with this gun at the range.  Everything worked exactly as it should, without a misfire, feed or eject issue.  The sights seem to be set a bit low, but I have not attempted to adjust them. I love the look and feel of this gun, and I know you will too!  The reason I’m selling it is that it’s about a half pound too heavy for me to carry.  I saw it for sale, loved it, and in my excitement I bought it immediately… without actually thinking through the mechanics of carrying it.  I’m not really a gun collector, so I thought I’d offer this for sale. 

I am not a gun dealer.  I’m an Ohio resident with a valid Ohio CCW permit.  I will sell this gun in a legal manner to an Ohio resident, with a proper bill-of-sale signed by me and the buyer (the buyer will be given a copy, and I will keep a copy).  Ohio CCW holders go to the front of the line, but without a CCW permit, a valid Ohio driver’s license will be required to establish Ohio residency.  Out-of-state buyers would be responsible for shipping fees to a FFL dealer in their area, as well as any fees the FFL dealer may charge.  I’m a good guy, and I will only deal with other good guys and gals.  If I ever see this gun again, I want to make damn sure I won’t be looking down its barrel."

The only flaw is one side of a sticker on it is starting to peel (who needs a sticker?) The Orion 80/I made by Zeiss/Eltro is a high-quality starlight night vision scope currently in use by the German Bundeswehr. This scope features high-tech XX1211 and XX 1340 image intensifier tubes, flash protection capabilities, reticle adjusters, focus knob, on/off button and shade control knob, reticle brightness knob and a rubber protection cover. Each scope comes with the original storage case and the following mounts: HK-made G3 claw mount with adapter plate MG3 Lafette tripod mount with adapter plate PzF 3/PzF 44 grenade launcher mount Quick-change adapter attached to the scope. This adapter can be mounted on a Picatinny rail (not included) and if it is removed it can be attached directly to a Stanag mount or to the G3 claw mount minus the adapter plate for a low-profile sighting picture. With a Stanag Scopes To Picatinny adapter like the A.R.M.S.#7 III Adaptor, this scope can be mounted on any rifle/shotgun, optionally you can spend $10 on Amazon to buy a UTG 2nd Gen STANAG To Picatinny Adaptor Mount to mount this on any firearm. This would make a DEADLY hog or yote night vision scope. I took it out to my property and had no problem identifying a human size target at 400 yards. I do not know what the maximum range would be but it is FAR better than gen 2 NVDs plus it is German made, so I am sure that it could take some serious abuse before it failed, unlike some of the new digital NV scopes. It is built for the recoil of a 7.62x51 Nato. It amplifies available light (starlight) it does not need any IR light but an IR light could be mounted on it, it is tapped for an accessory platform on top of the unit. It can also not be detected by night vision devices due to the lack of it using IR so if you are stealth hunting you can not be spotted by someone using a NVD. I hate to let it go but i need the money. When I can afford it again this is the exact model that I will be buying. Includes the original screwdriver and mounting screw pack, microfiber lens cleaning cloth.Listing as New old stock because I was told when i bought it that it was never issued, and I have never mounted it on a rifle, just tested it for function and have ran it for maybe 20-30 min checking it out. Has never been exposed to bright lights or daylight, works perfectly.

This shotgun was test fired for function at the gunsmith after the conversion.

This is the laser sight with 9 green dots in a circle that gets larger the further away the target is. It also has a Hogue pistol grip and US made hammer, sear, disconnector. It features a railed dust cover so it will accept any optic that you would want to install.  I am listing this as new but be aware that it has been test fired at the factory and has fired exactly one magazine at the gunsmith when 922r converted. Since then it has sat in the safe.

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.

I have a new Armalite Super SASS I am looking to sell. I purchased this gun with the intention of getting into long range shooting, but other hobbies have taken my time and I never got out to shoot this thing. It is all set up to tack drive. With this set up, you can shoot 1000+ yards. This is an armalite factory rifle, not a parts kit franken-gun put together in a garage...

I have spared no expense on the optics and mount, so this is a true long range precision rifle, ready to shoot sub MOA. Please note, the Atlas Bipod is not included in the sale price. Since purchasing this rifle several months ago, it has spent all of its life in a climate controlled safe. Never shot and never dry fired. Its ready for your break-in ritual...

Below is what I paid for the items
Armalite Super Sass	$2,767.94
ADM AD-RECON Mount	$179.00
Hogue Pistol Grip	$20.00
DMR Bushnell Tactical Elite 3.5-21x G2 Ret. FFP Scope	$1,299.00
Total	$4,265.94

I'm asking $4000, as I know I will not get 100% of what I have in it even though these rifles are VERY hard to find. I have personally never seen one locally...CCW Holders are preferred, but I will expect to see proof of Ohio residency if not a CCW Holder. As this is a higher end rifle, I prefer to do a transfer at a gun shop so this is a safe and hassle free transaction for both parties. I am a straight shooter, and I appreciate the same respect from you."

For sale is a used, good condition, Savage Arms Stevens Model 311C double barreled (side by side) Shotgun, chambered in rarely seen 16GA. The original “painted on” wood stock has been completely sanded and refinished with a nice cherry/walnut stain and buffed oiled finish. The receiver still has the case hardening colors to it and only minor visible surface pitting in some spots on the barrels.  The barrels are uncut and measure 28” long and feature a Modified and a Full Choke (per research I’ve done on this model this was the choke configuration for all 28” barrels chambered in 12, 20, or 16 gauge).  Length of Pull(s) measure 14” and 13” respectively.

Exact age of this gun is uncertain as it doesn’t seem to have a numerical serial number, however it does have what appears to be identifying serial letters, and according to gundigest.com, “From 1940 to 1948 no serial numbers were used on doubles, only capital letters, usually in groups of three or four…”

Overall this gun is setup to be an excellent shooter, and is just waiting to be taken out with you on your next bird or upland hunt.

I have a like new SAIGA-12 shotgun for sale. This particular one, is from the first batch that came in to the US, the ones that collectors want. It is made on the thicker 1.5 mm receiver.
I was one of the first ones to buy one when they were out. This is the one that came with a factory muzzle choke break, factory front sight rail, and side rail for optics mount.
I only shot the gun twice, just to make sure it works, and its perfect, it is lots of fun, probably the best semi-auto shotgun out there for the money. It's hi-capacity and reliable as an AK-47. It has been cleaned and stored in a dehumidified gun safe at all times, not a scratch or dents or anything, it could pass as brand new in the box.
 It comes with 5 like new Saiga factory Five round mags, 2 brand new AGP arms Ten round mags, and 1 brand new Promag 20 round drum, extra AK buttstock, tactical light installed on the side, blackjack recoil buffer, safety slide bolt stop, Tapco m4 buttstock ,Tapco pistol grip, a H&K style vertical grip and front rail.
 Cash only, No trades, buyer must have a valid Georgia ID and must be over 18.
Thanks for looking."

The truth is, many people are just plain JERKS.  

If you put a post-up, and someone makes you a decent offer – respond.  If you don’t, you have a problem in your thinking.  I don’t know your exact problem because it will vary from person to person, but if you don’t respond, ultimately, you are a JERK:  

You may feel you are too busy.  If you are unable to manage your time and can’t respond, then don’t post up, or man-up.  

If you think your time is too valuable to respond to offers or counteroffers, then you are selfish.  Selfish people are JERKS.  My time is valuable too, but I choose to be courteous.  Its part of being an honorable man.

I could go on and on with this, but the bottom line is, if you are a JERK on Armslist, you are a JERK.  Armslist is real life, and if you are a JERK here, then you are a JERK in other areas of your life.  

BTW – feel free to replace JERK with A** if you want.  WE talk about losing our rights, we talk about losing our country, we talk about losing our morals, we talk about turning from God, and we talk about losing our freedoms, but wake up dumb dumb, if you are a JERK, then it’s likely that the people you lead in life will not listen to what you have to say about these issues because you are a JERK.  Also, if you lie thru the course of a trade – YOU ARE A LIAR.  Stop it, confess, ask GOD to forgive you. Be an honorable man."

Story goes like this, my idiot friend was cleaning the rifle barrel and managed to get two brass cleaning rods stuck in the barrel. 

I tried getting them out but I gave up since I dont really have the tools to deal with it. I dont have a workshop or a vise to hold it or really any way to deal with it so im just selling it. 

This rifle would be a good candidate for an Obrez. Since you could cut the barrel down and could easily get out the rods. 

There is also no cosmoline as I made sure to get rid of that when I first got the rifle. 

The rifle is currently inoperable because of the rods in the barrel. The action cycles fine but as with most mosins you have to be rough with it. 

It shot great last weekend.

I am firm at $60, I bought this from classic arms online and with shipping and tax it was $170 so I really cant take less than 60. 

I can include 20 mosin rounds to sweetin the deal. They are Soviet milsurp. 

For $60 extra I can include a NEW ATI black Synthetic stock complete with box and instructions. 

A few things:

You gotta be at least 18 and no felonies. 

 You need to meet me in Franklin NC if you want this. This isnt worth it for me to drive to anywhere outside of my local area.

Rifle is a Springfield Armory Mfg. M1 Garand that was mfg. in 1/43. It has been through a factory rebuild and has a Springfield barrel dated 1965 which is towards the very last of the run of Springfield barrels produced. This is probably why the ME measures 0 and the TE measures 1 because it probably wasn't issued after the barrel installation since this was towards the end of the ""Garand Era"" The wood is factory new walnut with a CMP cartouche on it.

This AAC Blackout Flash Hider is an extremely efficient design that effectively eliminates muzzle flash, even on short barrels. The open-end, 3-prong design of the Blackout is inherently stronger than 4-prong units, and is not subject to the wear and erosion commonly encountered with closed-end designs. All Blackout flash suppressors are machined from high strength aerospace steel alloy and coated in a hard, durable, corrosion resistant SCARmor finish. 

This 51T Blackout flash hider works in conjunction with AAC's improved ratchet mount sound suppressors. The 51-T mount is an intuitive, lightning fast silencer attachment/detachment system that allows for secure installation of a suppressor in less than 3 seconds with no tools or moving parts. Not compatible with the older spring mount (18-Tooth) or newer ratchet taper mount (90-Tooth) sound suppressors.

He shot his second deer with it Dec 26, 2014. Unfortunately, we will be hunting next year in a county that does not allow centerfire rifles to be used for deer so I’m selling this fine upper.  
This upper is a great hunting compliment to a 5.56mm AR as it uses the same magazines.  Pull two pins, replace your 5.56 upper with this one, reuse your BCG, charging handle, magazines, and you are ready to go and legal for deer hunting!
The 6x45mm caliber is simply a 5.56mm necked-up to accommodate the 6mm bullet.  Simply run your 5.56 brass through a 6x45 die and you have all the brass you need!  
This is the most accurate AR upper I have built.  I have only loaded 80 gr. Barnes TTSX bullets and 70 gr. Nosler solid-base bullets with BLC-2 powder.  I have not loaded anything lighter or heavier.  For me, the 70 gr. bullets do best.  My best group with this barrel was .302” at 50 yards with a 3-9x scope.  
This upper has approximately 70 rounds through it and it has never been run hard.  It was built and carried as a hunting rifle, not a plinker.
