Well, I may have finally purchased too much. That might not be possible in your opinion, so if you're looking to pick up a few extra bites of Mosin food, here's your chance. 440 rounds of Russian surplus in the can. Could use the cash, so letting one or two go. No opener (I've found a Dremel works much better anyway). Looking to get what I paid for it with shipping ... no less, no more. These are currently $150 at the local sporting goods store I shop at, so save some change there and skip the wait on those internet retailers. FTF preferred. I'll drive a little ways to meet you (work takes me to Greenville and Wilson), but the ocean and mountains are probably out of the question. Thanks for looking. Any questions ... just email me."

Smith & Wesson 640 Engraved .357 Mag Revolver, 2 1/8 Inch Barrel, Double Action Only, Stainless- Smith & Wesson 150784

When the first all-steel small frame (J) revolver was introduced in 1950, it became an instant success. Originally named the Chiefs Special by the International Association of Chiefs of Police, it has become the first choice for those who insist on an all steel, small frame revolver with greater recoil control and proven performance. The Smith & Wesson J-Frame has become the most popular small frame personal defense revolver on the market. With decades of reliable performance to its credit, the J-frame line offers models capable of firing .22 LR, .22 Magnum®, .38 S&W Special and the more powerful .357 Magnum® loads. Smith & Wesson offers these revolvers from our production, M&P, Pro Series, and Classics lines in three diverse hammer designs; internal, exposed and shrouded.

Model 640 machine engraved. When you need a lightweight carry revolver, you turn to Smith & Wessons small frame series. These guns are machine engraved for the professional that wants that special touch, it can be used as a duty weapon, personal protection or in pristine condition it still can catch the collector’s interest.

Purchased this gun NEW in the Spring of 2014, Serial # begins with 14xxx, and never got around to doing the complete conversion that I wanted, other gun projects came first and now I am no longer interested in the conversion, or shotguns really.

***UPDATE 9/25/14***  

Replaced Factory Trigger w/ Tapco G2 Trigger - hand polished hammer, trigger, trigger pins
           - Very light trigger with 3.5-4lb pull 

Replaced DPH gas plug with ...
**TAC47AutoPlug**  - Automatic gas plug with no presets to shell required
Tune once and 100% reliability with any shell, low or highbrass. 
Shot 25rounds of mixed 00buck and low brass 7.5 Remington shells WITHOUT 1 FTE/FTF

- Had multipule emails asking about the Gas port and # of Holes/diameter of holes

This Saiga was produced in 2014: 
 Gas port has 4 ports, in a diamond pattern. I tried my best to measure them as accurate as possible, with electronic calipers and a piece of wire that was .075.  I fit the wire into each port perfectly, with a little play in the two side ports. I can send anyone pictures of the gas port if you would like. 
_____________________________________________________________________

Everything is stock on the gun except the addition of

  - CAROLINA SHOOTER SUPPLY SAIGA 12 RELIABILITY KIT (MSRP: $50)
    The Kit includes
         1-DPH 6 Position adjustable Gas Knob. 
              *** REPLACED w/ TAC47AutoPlug*** (MSRP $50)

          CSS Peformance Recoil Spring (Factory Spring included)
          CSS Performance G2 Puc 

         - Hand polishing: Bolt, Bolt Carrier, Trigger, Trigger Pins, & Receiver Rails


_____________________________________________________________________

I say **Like NEW** because after installing the CSS kit I completed the 200round breaking in period so low brass loads would be reliable 100% of the time with no FTE/FTF. I have shot everything from Buck to Slugs to Low Brass target loads and never had a single hiccup/failure as long as the gas system was set to the load.  


As many of you know this gun has been banned from future import and in turn has seen insane markups, this Unconverted Saiga 12 is priced to sell so that I can invest in other projects. 

__________________________________________________________________________

So for sale is a Unconverted Saiga 12 with updated spring, puc, Automatic gas regulating plug, & polish job that you can convert in any way you would like BUT that is 100% right out of the box for any load you wish to shoot. With the availability and amount of aftermarket products for this gun, you can tailor it to whatever way you like without paying *anything* extra for ban markups, or products on the gun you do not want. 

This is the Saiga 12 as it should have come from the Factory.

Haven't made any solid deals yet but I think some people are confused about what I'm trying to do here.

What I am trying to do is straight even trade for my Kimber (paid $1200 for it) which doesn't mean beans. What I am trying to get is a quality .45 & .9mm for my gun.
I would also like to do the deal with the same person if possible.

I live in South Bradenton right on the county line. I would like to stay local but I am willing to drive a reasonable distance for the right deal if you are also.

I would like to complete this deal over the weekend because on Monday I will be leaving town for a few days.

If you answer this ad I will assume that you are a Florida resident, at least 21 years old and can own a firearm.

OKC, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 215,"Listed On: Sunday, November 16, 2014",Rifles,Chiappa                                                                                ,22 Magnum                                                                                ,Break Open                                                                                ,Rifle,"This is a customized Chiappa L'il Badger in .22 magnum (.22 WMR), with 16"" barrel.  This whole rig is just over 4 lbs even with scope, rings, and AFG - it's nice, very light & handy, accurate rig (I was getting around 3.5 MOA with certain CCI ammo).

This has multiple additons and customizations:
--Magpul AFG I
--Weaver rings
--Weaver ""Classic Rimfire"" scope, 4x28mm, excellent condition
--Plastic thread protector removed and replaced with steel thread protector
--Side P-rails removed to accomodate scope and Magpul AFG (not included - they are worthless - you cannot put anything on top or bottom without taking them off, so they serve no use)
--Plastic sights removed (not included - they are worthless; you couldn't see them anyway; way too low to see - factory defect)
--Olive & Desert earth camo paracord wrapped around steel buttstock frame
--Length of pull shortened by 1 and 1/8th"" (It was too long; now it's ideal for teens, women, and smaller men, but anyone can use it.  It's perfect for use with thick winter clothing)
--Cheap plastic buttstock piece replaced with custom fabricated wood buttstock piece (The rifle WILL come with the original plastic buttstock endpiece as well, and the original plastic shell holder which slips on the frame just in front of the buttstock piece)
--Flat black paint job
--Super rock-solid custom pistol grip added and ""checkered"".   I fabricated it from wood - it's attached with two machine screws into the two factory pre-tapped receiver holes, plus epoxy.

Comes with original soft case, box, and papers.

NOTE:  This rifle has an extremely light (excellent) trigger - under 1.5 lbs - so it is NOT a good choice for kids or someone inexperienced with firearms.

PRICES (face to face):  Entire rig EXCEPT for scope is $215.  Entire rig WITH scope & rings is $335.  If you don't want the Magpul AFG, then subtract $30 from the above prices ($185 without scope; $305 with scope & rings)

SHIPPING:  Add $18 if I ship to your F.F.L. via FedEx Ground, insured, signature confirmation.  Extra to HI or AK.  [Also, for that same price, I can and will legally ship it directly to your door (FedEx), per BATFE regs, provided that you are an Oklahoma resident, and can email me proof of same, such as driver's license with address].

I believe these are good prices considering the AFG and customizations.  

Ultimate subsistence survival gun.  Note that this is the best legal chambering to hunt feral pigs with, on Okla. public WMAs, since it's legal for squirrels and rabbits.

Thanks for looking. Call or text REDACTED

P.S.  Here's a question I got by PM and my answer:
""So, with the factory sights removed (you implied you threw them out) and if I don't buy your scope and rings set up, the rifle will have NO sights then?""

Correct - no sights.  As mentioned, there WERE no sight on it anyway from the factory, AS A PRACTICAL MATTER.  They were useless as teats on a boar hog because they were un-usable.    They could not be used - factory defect - way too low.  So without the scope, the rifle has as many usable sights as it would have had from the factory - which is none.

I still have the sights and two rails I took off and can send them with the rifle - if you want them, I will certainly ship them.  I just don't want anyone thinking you can use the sights...So that no one is dissatisfied in any way with the lack of sights, even if I send these."

I have some cash but quite a few quality firearms I would be willing to trade for the right rifle. I will list a few that I may trade. Winchester super X2 3  1/2"" mag solid black that has been fired 5 times. Colt gold cup trophy .22 LNIB. Really interesting 45-70 martini action octagon barrel from England with Navy arms competition barrel and elevation globe sights. Walther target model P-22 LNIB. S&W Ar-15-22 (the top version) and several more. I also have a Daewoo DR-200 (Kimber) with the first 3 of 6 serial numbers being 000 that I may consider trading. I also have a weatherby .223 bull Barrel that is super accurate. I assess my firearms at honest value, not new prices and would respect the same. Just thought maybe someone has one as a safe queen or just no longer use it. Please do not offer me a Ruger bull barrel target model or anything like that. I have shot many of them. Yes, they are extremely accurate but they will NOT hit the size of a needle every shot at 50ft. Thanks so much. Headed to work so I will not be around email for a good while but I can receive text at 615-476  two thousand. If you are one of the people I have already spoken to about one of these rifles, I am looking to get a deal done fairly quickly as I am going to take the best deal when it comes being fair to both parties.

 Melonite treated barrels have proven to last 30% longer than chromelined barrels and are more accurate.
 These barrels are as accurate as any 6.8 barrels made, many report 1/2"" groups at 100yds with Hornady 110gr HPBT factory ammo.
The 4150 11595E steel Melonite(QPQ) treated barrels we sell will last twice as long as stainless barrels-60 rockwell VS 28-30 of the stainless. The  final finish meets or exceeds stainless steel corrosion resistance.  416 stainless barrels .980"" in diameter do not meet the 2:1 burst/hoop strength safety ratio required by the firearms industry standards in anything larger than the 5.56. We only use the stronger 4150 11595 E barrel steel in all of our barrels.

This rifle is in very good to excellent condition EXCEPT for a gouge and some large scratches on the left side of the buttstock toward the rear (ask for close-up pic, please, and I will text to you).  So overall condition I'd give it a Good+, with the scratches in mind.  Bluing is nice and wood is a dark color; very rich.

This is the sought-after carbine length configuration with 16"" bbl.  It is also easy and quick to take down into two pieces to put in a backpack or small case.

It has the flip-safety on top of the receiver.

It has a very solid and securely-mounted scope mount in place of the rear sight.  Perfect for a dot sight or scout type scope.  It also comes with the original rear sight assembly pieces, which can be drifted back in easily in 2 minutes flat with just punch and hammer.  This scope mount will fit any Rossi or Taurus pump in .22lr, .22 mag, or .17 HMR.

To Okla. residents:  Note that this is the best legal chambering to hunt feral pigs with, on Okla. public WMAs, since it's legal for squirrels and rabbits.

Price is $405 OBO, due to the scope mount.  Add $18 for me to ship it to your FFL.

Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine."

The rifle has seen almost no use, and the same can be said of the magazines (which vary from very little use to no use at all, and never filled with more than 20 rnds despite their holding 25). The three tritium night sights are still glowing just fine and in fact have reached an ideal level of brightness, IMHO (they were all too bright when the rifle was new). The rifle (and mags) were never stored loaded, even with 1 rnd. The gas tube shows no trace of pitting or any other evidence of heating (or of even having been fired aside from the gas piston's centering bosses having gone back and forth over the interior of the tube (I have a picture to prove it). The factory recoil pad (which isn't needed, again in my view) still looks as new. Apparently IMI uses some very high quality rubber or other material as there isn't any of the dryness or cracking usually associated with old recoil pads. As you may know about Galils, the chamber, bore, gas block and operating rod are all factory hard-chromed, the latter being something you won't find on even Valmet Kalashnikovs. Please keep in mind this is probably the world's most reliable and durable semi-automatic battle rifle. I've always felt if I had to shoot steel-cased ammo this weapon would eat the stuff for breakfast, lunch & dinner (and more) without breaking a sweat (or a part) as it's built like an Israeli MBT. Also, besides the forged steel receiver and all steel folding stock (not the aluminum version from which it was copied), the rate of barrel rifling twist never goes out of style, which can not be said of the 5.56mm versions. Also, the .30 cal version of this rifle is far rarer than the 5.56mm model, and interestingly enough, because Galils use the same outside diameter of barrel regardless of caliber, this higher-powered version has a far better balance and is faster to bring into action than the smaller caliber rifle. I know this as fact as I own both types.

I'll pay for shipping to your friendly neighborhood FFL dealer from my friendly neighborhood FFL dealer (I actually haven't any choice as I'm a subject...uh, I mean ""citizen"" of the Peoples Republik of Oppressifornia), so it has to go to an FFL holder.

Often referred to as a mini 1911, it is one of the nicest handguns I've ever shot.  Great trigger and balance helps you to hit your target every time.  Very light and great for conceal carry.  Shoot a Ruger LCP or Kel-Tec P-3AT to see why this gun is worth every penny.

BECAUSE BEAUTY AND FUNCTIONALITY AREN’T MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
SIG SAUER® pistols have long provided their owners with peace of mind. Now the SIG Sauer Custom
Shop Equinox series adds pride of ownership to that feeling. The distinctive polished slide flats and
nickel controls contrast with the dark-coated surfaces for a visually arresting two-tone appearance. When
combined with its practical features, the Equinox series is pretty to look at and beautiful to shoot.

The P238 Equinox®, it’s just a fraction of the size of our ful-size pistols. A smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just 15.2 ounces, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with wood grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular trademarked SIG SAUER slide serrations, corrosion resistant Nitron finish and SIGLITE® rear Night Sight and Tru-Glo Tritium Fiber Optic Front Sight. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case and one 6 round magazine.  Great for right handed and left handed shooters with ambidextrous safety."

Better for quick reloads and not trying to shoot with the slide still back. I can also add two steel 17 round ProMag magazines also with a lifetime warranty.  I have another M&P in .22 I could add for right gun, such as a 391.  Just have too many handguns I don't shoot and want a shotgun or North American Arms.

Thank you to all who responded to my post, but no, I will not ""take 400 cash.""  I am not hard up for cash.  At this point and considering the condition and extra mags, it seems like as good a deal as the shotguns I've seen advertised here. I will let it ride for a while.

If the sale falls through I'll update the post.  

This is a Springfield Armory M1 Garand in 30-06 with 6” bayonet, sling, two en bloc clips, 340-rounds of brass factory ammo (PMC 150 grain full metal jacket  / target), and 20-rounds of tracer, in two ammo cans.  

The serial number 1,737,XXX places it as being made in July 1943; certainly in time for military service in WW II.  The stock does not appear to have been restored in any way – that gives you the option of making it a regular range rifle or doing some work to make it a conversation piece that hangs on a wall.  I’ve had it at the range and it went “Bang” the appropriate number of times followed by “Ching” when the rounds were gone and the clip extracted…  That’s very high on the cool factor if you’re a fan of WW II firearms or just history.  

Trades I’m interested in include:  

AR-15 / M-4 with 16” barrel in 5.56mm
AR-10 in .308 with at least an 18” barrel
1911 in .45ACP 
High Standard – Double Nine (.22 LR)

If you are sending me a trade offer let me know the value you place on your trade.  If it’s a high estimate or I’m not familiar with aspects of the firearm (accessories, private manufacturers, etc.) I may ask for a price breakdown, that’s not to insult you it’s to better inform me.  If your trade is worth more we’ll work that out too.

Additional photos available if required.  

I check email at least daily for messages and can reply by text if you include a cell phone number.  

I will need to see a valid state or military ID and fill out two sets of private party transfer paperwork – one for each of us.  

Serial number validation site:  http://usriflecal30m1.com/ProductionGraph.aspx

Update:  A gentleman walked me through some of the markings (cartouches) and it appears this is a Garand that was built for (and likely used in) WW II service and then sent back to the Springfield Arsenal in 1951 to be reworked and used for the Korean Conflict.  Can you imagine the history / service behind this rifle?

Barrel : A proprietary blend of cold hammer forged chrome-moly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system.   The pencil profile style barrel is high pressure tested, magnetic particle inspected and then phosphate coated to mil-specs.
