This is my third and final time posting this.  I've raised the money needed to repair my car so no longer desperate to sell.  I've had a lot of interest from serious buyers in other states, but I have neither the time nor inclination to deal with the hassle and expense of shipping a firearm to an out of state FFL.  I have zero interest in trading for anything: guns, laptops, tattoos, dental work, your roommate's iguana, or whatever.  $300 CASH takes it.  And by CASH I mean no checks or PayPal.  If it does not sell by Monday I'm keeping it.  Great ladies gun with the traditional low profile pearl grips which fit small hands perfectly (original rubber boot grips also included).  

This is a fairly obscure piece, a Taurus ""Instant Backup"" IB-17 chambered in .17 Mach2, which is a bottlenecked .22LR that fires a jacketed .17 caliber V-MAX projectile at high velocity, with a 9-round cylinder. Factory bobbed hammer, double-action-only.  1.75"" barrel, 22 ounces.     

This revolver is a great choice for anyone who is unduly sensitive to recoil, or for situations where overpenetration is a factor. It has solid lockup and perfect timing.  Zero recoil, low noise, very reliable, light trigger pull for a rimfire revolver.  Very unique revolver utilizing a small, bottlenecked cartridge firing tiny jacketed ballistic tipped projectiles at approximately 1,100 fps out of the snub barrel.  9 shots as fast as you can pull the trigger.  Zero problems extracting spent casings.  I took down the forcing cone about a hundreth of an inch with emory cloth so it can go longer between cleanings (tolerances were so tight it needed to be cleaned every third cylinder, now it will go through a box of 50 rounds no problem).  Very accurate revolver within 30 feet (have not tried past that distance).  Should be cleaned after each range session.  If the trigger pull starts to get heavier, it needs a quick cleaning.  This is normal with all DA rimfire revolvers.       

Revolver is in Excellent condition. VERY nice shape, almost like new. Comes with MANY EXTRAS: 200 rounds of V-MAX ammo, Snap-Caps for dry fire practice, a set of vintage Ajax pearl grips (in addition to the stock rubber grips), a .17 caliber bore brush, and the original plastic carry case (with manual, paperwork, etc). Does not come with a holster, but any S&W J-frame holster will fit it perfectly.  I recommend the DeSantis Nemesis pocket holster, which can be found on eBay or Amazon for about 25 bucks.

This is a great little revolver, but need to replace the timing belt (and several other parts) on my car and that takes priority.  This is a GREAT deal for only 300 bucks . . . I paid 400 for the gun and 50 for the grips.

I reserve the right to withdraw this item from sale at any time, or to refuse to deal with anyone I don't like. Will not travel too far from Denver.  Price is FIRM.  Will not ship.  CASH ONLY. Thanks."

I originally listed this as a 1971 Bearcat.  The Serial number is 90-21xxx.  My research says it was NOT made in 1971 but 1969 or 1970 which means it is a Bearcat and not a Super Bearcat. 

This Bearcat has the original box and manual AND it does NOT have the modified and added safety transfer bar.  In other words it appears it was never sent back to Ruger to have the safety feature added! It has a few minor dings as its almost 50 years old!  I am willing to consider trades/ trades and cash (both ways).  I like old military bolt actions and wheel guns?  I also like all kinds o guns, so give me a try!  I would love a single action .45!  I am willing to dicker but I don't need money and I am in no rush to sell.....actually I don't care if I sell it or not, so plan accordingly!  :)  But I am also not stupid so I won't expect anything more than fair value!

Very low rounds through it and is in like new condition. Comes with numerous accessories, including Talon grips, 4 magazines, 1 kydex triple-magazine holster, 1 Glock Perfection magazine holster, and a disassembly tool.

Additionally, it includes a new Raven Concealment kydex holster. This holster comes with the standard OWB loops and I ordered the extra IWB flexible loops so that it can be worn IWB concealed as well as externally on your belt. It is a very comfortable and secure holster.
The 2nd holster is a smaller kydex IWB holster made for appendix style carry, and can also be worn in other positions. The third holster is a Galco custom-formed black leather holster mostly for a concealed carry behind the back. Lastly, it includes a new Foxx kydex/leather IWB holster, which is surprisingly comfortable and easily conceals the Glock.

The only mod to the pistol was the (professional) installation of the Wolff Glock Competition Trigger Spring Kit. It improves the trigger pull tremendously by getting rid of the “gritty” feeling the stock trigger had. It makes the trigger nice and smooth, and is much more
pleasurable for me to shoot. I still have the stock springs if you prefer those instead.

As a bonus, I’m throwing in a new pair of custom Oakleys. They come with 5 different interchangeable lenses to improve your shooting visibility by changing the lenses based on the light and environmental
factors you’re shooting in.

The Russian-made Baikal IJ-70 pistol is often referred to simply as the Makarov. Imported by B-West Imports.  The pistol was designed by Nikolay Fyodorovich Makarov in 1948 as a means to firing the more powerful 9 x 18mm round. This gun became the standard Soviet Union military & police sidearm from 1951 - 1991. Presently, the Russian-made IJ-70 is not being imported into the U.S., having been discontinued in 1996, which is what makes this particular firearm so unique.

....Max Energy Tuning extracts every bit of energy possible out of every molecule of fuel giving you more miles at part-throttle and more power at wide-open throttle. In order to increase engine efficiency, horsepower and torque, our engineers first optimize the spark and fuel curves point by point over the entire rpm band. With the additional power and optimized transmission functions, drivers use less fuel to accelerate and maintain cruising speeds without the torque converter un-locking and transmission down-shifting to a lower gear. The results are maximum power and fuel mileage. *Internet updatable*

Would consider most mid or subcompact size 9mm's though, so let me know what you have.  ONLY interested in 9mm semi auto handguns however, no rifles, shotguns, or other calibers.
If not interested in trading I'd sell everything for $325

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with offers, texts preferred.

As the most aesthetically refined representative of our prestigious pump-action family, the Model 870 Wingmaster is a true American icon.

Available in 12 gauge 2 3/4"" and 3"", 20 and 28 gauge, and .410 bore, it has a custom-quality finish and handsome American walnut woodwork. The receiver and barrel are richly blued and highly polished for classic appeal. We also offer a broad selection of barrel and choke options to fit your application.

I have had this 25-06 for a few years now and absolutely love the gun. It shoots great but I would like to buy another lightweight stainless carry rifle.  I have hunted with it a little so it does have a few very minor marks but it is a very nice rifle otherwise. The stock is bedded and the lop is 13"". It has a 26"" Medium contour target grade/crown barrel, NOT the bull barrel. This thing really shoots with virtually no recoil.

The trades I would consider would be:
257 Roberts
257 Weatherby with ammo and reloading dies
260
280
6.5x55
6.5 Creedmoor 
35 Whelen
Possibly a HK VP9
10mm in SF 
Partial trades 
Would also consider NICE optics

I'm open to most with the exception of Remington. I would also prefer to have ammo/brass/dies with most of the odd ball calibers for obvious reasons.

Preference would be for a Stainless Sako, Tikka, Browning or Steyr ProHunter or Scout. I also like CZ's as well but still prefer another SS rifle. Might also consider a SS 260 or Savage lightweight hunter in 6.5 Creedmoor or 260. I can add cash if needed to make it fair. 

3 - Different Options to purchase:
1. $550 Cash gets the gun only 
2. $625 Cash gets the combo (6-18x50AO Bushnell scope/Ruger factory rings/gun). 
3. Trade for options listed above (I can Add cash if needed to make it fair).

Price is firm and certainly fair. These are NOT cheap (Mine is the Target Grade model) so please be respectful and skip the lowball stuff . Sorry but I don't have a lot of time with work and family so the deal needs to be close by unless you are willing to do more driving on your end. Bill of sale will be completed as well. Thanks for the interest!"

The lower is a San Tan Tactical ambidex. billet registered as a pistol with spikes LPK. These lowers are $300 stripped so if you don't about them google San Tan Tactical. Also included is a phase 5 pistol buffer tube kit with heavy buffer and spring, Sig sb15 arm brace, Magpul grip, and magpul AFG. I have over $1800 in this build and looking to get $1300. This thing is awesome but I just ordered a new Aimpoint micro and some other things for my other AR so something has to go but also not desperate to sell. Would rather sell but would trade for a FDE FNX tactical with RMR or without RMR and some cash or extras like ammo with it. Might also consider a QUALITY 14.5 ar 15 with keymod rail but please no DPMS,S&W etc etc. Will include the cheap knock off troy sights as seen in the pics to get you started. Will need permit or ccw and sign bill of sale.

Has od green fore grip. Magpul buttstock. Duracoated in Vietnam era tiger stripe pattern.  The sage conversion was an extensive modification to the buffer tube, recoil spring, and reciever. They modified the gun so that the buffer tube and recoil spring fit under the fore grip. This allows for for other than 11-87 stocks to be used. Ie: collapsible, folding, magpul, etc. With the current magpul stock it is by far the tightest most comfortable defense shotgun I have ever fired. This was a very expensive conversion when they were doing them. Look them up. They were only offered to police departments and the military. They are cool. I am open to partial trades or cash.

I have a Beretta nano I purchased in July that I would like to sell. I have only taken it to the range once and ran around 40 rounds through it. I love the extended mag setup, but the 6+ standard mag seem too small for a big handed guy. Shoots extremely accurate, great balance, and it's extremely good looking (I believe hickok45, on YouTube, described it as a baby glock). I am keeping the Holster since AlienGear does free lifetime swaps. 320 is what I am looking to get. I already purchased a Taurus PT111 G2 so I only want to sell now. You get the Gun, the magazines, the lock, the case, and the crush box.
I am in Obetz / South Bloomfield area.

As of July 16th, 2014 the Obama Administration has effectively banned all firearm imports from Izhmash, Saiga & IZHEVSKIY under the Actions Implement Executive Order 13662. 
This is it, there is only a finite number of these firearms within the US and they will never be imported again. Russian Saiga Semi-Auto 410 shotgun, these are imported based on the AK47 design and feature a Black Polymer hunting buttstock and fore end. The Saiga shotguns are intended for hunting big and medium-sized game under different climatic conditions. The shotguns are developed on the base of the venerable Kalashnikov assault rifle. These shotguns are brand new & come with a 22 inch chrome lined barrel, side rail for the mounting optics, 1 four round mag & all other accessories shown. Firearms are all new construction in the famous Russian IZHMASH Arsenal. Unfortunately this is the last we will ever see of these firearms as the Obama Administration has banned any further Import from the manufacturer.

The Magpul PRS2 (Precision Rifle/Sniper) – G3 Model is a drop-in, precision-adjustable butt stock especially designed for the HK G3/91 rifle and its variants. Designed to offer the fine-tuned, customized feel of a precision target stock, the PRS2 is adjustable for both cheek riser height and length-of-pull without sacrificing the durability necessary to withstand the operational environment. Compared to common plastic fixed stocks, the PRS2 has a similar minimum LOP but can extend up to 1.25"" longer. Machined aluminum adjustment knobs feature positive-locking click detents to maintain position under recoil and allows easy, tool-less adjustments by simply rotating the knobs. Machined aluminum butt-plate and alloy steel adjustment shafts provide stability and strength to withstand severe impact conditions. Rubber butt-pad offers positive shoulder purchase to prevent slippage for optimal accuracy even with body armor or modular gear. Stronger and heavier than most OEM stocks, the PRS2 also adds beneficial weight to the rear of normally nose-heavy G3/91 rifles.
