The SIG SAUER P232 is a small and lightweight pistol. Chambered in .380ACP and featuring a fixed barrel blowback action, the P232 Stainless is one of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 23oz in the stainless version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today."

I bought/built this direct from PSA back in 2012 and have put roughly 1000 rds through the barrel give or take 100 rounds. Not one single malfunction or any other issue. The only reason I'm selling this is because I want to build an SBR, and the wife says that this upper has to go to fund the next project. This is a somewhat rare Dissipator setup that's been hard to come across at PSA lately.

Putting this package together new costs roughly $675.

I'm looking to get $475 for everything as is. I'm willing to take off the rear Magpul BUIS and BCM handle and drop the price to $375 if that helps.  

Everything else stays on the upper as my new upper won't need these for my SBR build. I am NOT willing to part out or strip the upper any more past what I've already mentioned so don't ask!

Just remove the current stock and pistol grip, insert the receiver adapter into the receive, tighten the screw to the back trunion/tang and put on the stock (sliding part) with your pistol grip.  NOTE: neither the AKM nor the Hogue grip in the photos is NOT included in this sale (just the bumpski hardware from fostech).

I've used this one a few dozen times over the years but didn't find a buyer last year and was out of the country for some time.  I've given it allot more use this year, since I still had it, it's loads of fun to use with 7.62x39, much more than an AR, but it's again reminded me of how addictive and costly going through 1000 rds in a day..  

Overall, the bumpski is definitely TUFF and HEFTY! While your tapco and slide fire stocks work, they wouldn't take a beating. This one nobody would want to be hit in the face with, it would survive, they might not.

This is the right handed model, and is in fair to good condition; it now has more wear this year on the bottom edge of the stock.  I've marked two spots in photos that have some edge wear on the finish, I'll touch both spots up with some birchwood casey either way). Original box and documentation is NOT included.

Retails for $449.00 @ http://fostechoutdoors.com/shop/index.php?l=produc t_detail&p=1

I've reduced the price from $300 to now asking for only $270 CASH FACE TO FACE (this is the preferred exchange, what you see is what you get).

Or if you will take it, I can send CONUS via USPS priority insured for $299 but only as paypal gift (they wont just take 3-5% but will suspend my account if I invoice a firearm part)."

This Revolver is not a ""Safe Queen"" and will make an excellent Home Protection Gun, or just take it to the range and have fun punching holes in paper.

Included will be everything as pictured with Upgraded Wood Grips from Altamont. The original Grips can be included but they were just too bad to put on the gun in my opinion.

The price reflects it's condition as a ""Shooter Grade"" Smith & Wesson Revolver and not a Collector Grade Gun.

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitrating process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable back-straps, magazine pouch and loader, 2 magazines and a holster.

Born from experience with the Israeli Special Forces and baptized through firefights and hard use in the field. The Mepro M21 day/night illuminated reflex sight from MEPROLIGHT, is an optics system that is always ready for the fight.
The MEPRO 21 is an always illuminated system due to its fiber optic collector system during the day, and tritium light source at night. This reduces the need for any buttons or adjustment switches allowing the M21 to be extremely ergonomic. There is no on/off switch to fumble with or need for batteries.
Furthermore on ergonomics, the streamline-system comes with quick detach adaptors/mounts that fit on a Picatinny rail. This allows the M21 to be quickly removed and reinstalled while holding a tight zero, all without the needing tools.
Moreover the MEPRO M21 system’s large 30mm lens makes it extremely easy for fast and accurate target acquisition, with both eyes open, for both close to mid-distance shooting during competitions; making this platform ideal for SWAT/HRT operators, military, hunting, and competition shooting. As with a few other sights on the market the adjustments of the sights, windage and elevation, can be done with a coin.
The MEPRO 21 is shockproof and waterproof further allowing it to be used in all weather conditions and temperatures, as we have done through our year-long + review. We used the system in the wettest/muddiest of rainy days in the desert and even out in the snow. The M21 did not fail us. The M21 also has an all metal frame so you know it doesn’t need any babying. The M21 is also backed with a ten year warranty as well, which shows the people at MEPROLIGHT stand behind their work."

The Ruger New Bearcat Shopkeeper is a limited edition mechanical jewel-a true work of art! It is different from other single-action revolvers-smaller, lighter, and like the old Remington Civil War single-actions of the 1800's, it has a one-piece cylinder frame that also forms its compact birdshead grip. If features an unfluted cylinder with a bear and cougar Ruger rollmark, transfer bar safety, fixed blade/notch sights, rosewood birdshead grips. Compact and perfectly proportioned for 22LR rimfire ammunition, it is easy to carry and fits nicely in a cash drawer, under the counter, or as a concealed carry weapon. It is perfect for collectors, shop keepers, hikers, campers, boaters, small game hunters, or just about anyone who needs a dependable .22LR revolver and appreciates the beauty of old-world styling.

 K2 Semi Auto Pistols have been around for a long time. The K2 takes many of the modern designs and puts them in one pistol to come up with one of the best high capacity semi auto pistols in the world.

The Urban Go Plate Carrier is the most cost effective complete and ready to go plate carrier package on the market that offers rifle threat protection. Our Urban Go package includes (2) AR500 Armor® Level III patent pending Advanced Shooters Cut 10” x 12” body armor plates. We put our survivalist mentality to work and came up with the essentials required for scenarios that require quick rifle threat protection, creating an armor system that is ready to go at a moment's notice.
The Urban Go Carrier Package is ideal for home protection and emergency situations where rifle threat protection may be necessary. The open side design with a quick release buckles unfastened allows the Urban Go Plate Carrier to be quickly tossed over a single shoulder and worn over any existing gear or body armor. Front access shoulder mounted quick release buckles allow rapid removal compared to plate carriers that utilize a cummerbund. Fast into action, fast out of action. Due to a cummerbund-less design the Urban Go Carrier is not intended to be used with side body armor plates.
We think everyone should be able to afford body armor and took that into consideration when building this package. In addition to being functional and effective, we aimed for high value and our Urban Go Plate Carrier package delivers.

I have $450. I want a xds 9mm with some ammo or an xd9 or xd40 subcompact with night sights. Either should have essentials kit. PSA has the subcompact for 350 and the xds can be ordered online for 420. I think my budget and expectations are reasonable. Also interested in any carry piece as long as its 9mm or above. If its not worth the xd prices, I expect more in trade. Example would be pf9 or lc9. A text before phone call is preferred. Willing to travel as far as Columbia. I'm not trying to be a cheap skate but wont pay more than necessary either."

Ideal for Home Defense, Emergency Situations, Training/Carbine Courses, and Active Shooter/Rifle Threat situations. The AR500 Armor® Sentry Plate Carrier package is an all-inclusive rifle threat protection Body Armor solution. As it ships, the Sentry plate carrier package includes our Level III rifle rated Body Armor, MOLLE Chest Mounted Pistol Holster (Universal), Double M4/AR15 magazine pouch, and a Double Pistol mag pouch.
600D nylon construction nets a lightweight & slim, yet rugged backbone to your body armor system. Mesh internal lining improves airflow and adds comfort with minimal bulk. The Sentry Plate Carrier Package bypasses frills and includes all of the necessary basics such as adjustable padded shoulders, drag handle, hydration tube/radio guides, and quick release side buckles. All with minimal excess material resulting in less wasted space, bulk, and ultimately reducing unnecessary weight, heat signature, and improving comfort.
The Sentry Plate Carrier features ergonomic wide adjustable side straps with quick release buckles. The cummerbund-less design reduces bulk on the side of your carrier and helps improve airflow, at the cost of being incompatible with side plate body armor. Easier to don and doff, the quick release buckles are maneuvered with easy allowing you to gear up quickly in an emergency.
The AR500 Armor® Sentry Plate Carrier Package features everything you need with no frills offered at an affordable price point.

This is my best price. I don't care if you can get it for 250. Go ahead and pay shipping, taxes, and or fll fees. Then tell me how that 250.00 gun worked out.

Shot very little,  carried mainly. 2 new mags, just receive from company because one was not functioning properly. So I know for sure that the warranty works, no questions, just asked for serial number and sent mags! 2 when I only needed one.

The upper came in a package deal of ARs that I acquired a couple years ago. I bought the lower brand new and assembled the 22 kit. I like traditional 22 rifles, and want to buy a couple bolt actions ones for my kids. Otherwise I would not sell this as it is very accurate. It has been my starling gun and hits on these small targets are easily done at 50 to 75 yards. The scope is a Simmons 8pt 3x9. Nothing fancy but it is very reliable and can take abuse. The rifle comes with 2 Black Dog Machine 30rd magazines (that I bought new a couple years ago, and an AR padded carry bag that fits this rifle nicely. The buttstock is a six position adjustable stock. This light rifle is 6 lbs 11oz without the mag and ammo. This upper is a traditional recoil operated and not gas cycled. This is 22LR only and you do need a certain velocity ammo to cycle the action. The action is tight, and I would guess less than 1000 rounds through the rifle but have no way to verify. This has the European style charging handle. The front gas block is held by a set screw, so it is removeable and possibly reversible for upside down mounting. I had a M6 Tactical mounted on the top and it did not interfere with the optics. The 16"" barrel is free floating and the handguard mounts to the receiver.
I travel all over northwest Iowa for work and might be able to meet you if you want to purchase this. The lower is registered in my name and a transfer will be done at a dealer. If anyone is needing 22LR ammo, I am selling some surplus in another listing."

936,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3944936,For Sale:  Minimalist IWB Kydex Holsters (Glock),"Seattle to Pullman, Washington, United States",$ 25,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 4, 2015",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Minimalist, genuine Kydex holster designed for IWB carry. Instead of using loops attached via screws (as is typical), the design uses a single integral loop. This means there are no screws to lose (for retention adjustment or otherwise) when it matters most. Fits Glock 34, 35, 31, 22, 17, 19, 23, 32, 33, 27, and 26. 

.080 thick OD Kydex used throughout. All edges have been rounded with 220 grit sandpaper for comfort. Minor design alterations are possible, send ideas along and I'll see if I can implement them. Future holsters will likely use .060 kydex for increased comfort.

If you're wondering how I can sell these for such a low price, here's why:
- The fold-over structure is much faster to manufacture than typical pancake styles. This greatly reduces my time-cost.
- No attached belt loop means I don't have to make the loop in the first place, and I don't have to buy attachment screws.
- I don't polish the edges. Polishing the edges of the holster (like on most expensive kydex holsters) takes a lot of time. I have found finishing the edges with 220 grit offers the same level of comfort and alignment, albeit without the ""shiny"" cool-factor. 
- Use of a single rivet instead of multiple rivets or a retention-adjustment screw lowers material cost and manufacturing complexity. Besides, screws can come loose which could cause the firearm to exit the holster.

These are made by myself in Washington State - help support a starving college student! 

Because I live/go to school in Pullman (Go Cougs), I understand that many Armslisters would have to drive a considerable distance to pick up their holster. Therefore, **I will ship for free to the lower 48**. If you live in AK or HI I'll give you a $5 credit towards shipping costs."

Notes: Pictures are of a previous model I had in stock, the current one up for auction has not been out of the box. The front sight may be red or green pending what Dan Wesson is installing at the time. Also the serial number will be different than what is pictured.
Features: The PM9 is the only Government size Dan Wesson model chambered in 9mm Luger. We have offered this model in limited quantities in the past and always have demand greater than production capacity allows.

This gun features our Clark style rib on top of the forged slide with an adjustable target sight in the rear and a popular fiber-optic sight in the front. 

The slide also features front and rear cocking serrations. The frame is forged stainless with an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI front strap checkering. 

We have polished the flats to a soft-brushed finish and sandblasted the rounds for a nice contrast. 

We have installed Double Diamond cocobolo grips to finish it off. With the low cost of 9mm ammunition and lack of recoil, this is the perfect model for getting acquainted with the 1911. This model shines both at the range and in competition. (9+1 capacity).
