If you know the P99, this is a 3/5ths build of the P99 pistol chambered in .22. It has a European style mag release on the trigger guard and comes with a threaded barrel if you're looking to shoot suppressed. I'm discounting it because it came with a little pit in the exterior frame, visible along the slide in the photograph. I can travel a bit to deliver, but I'd prefer to stay in Seattle proper. No trades -- cash only. First person who can meet and pay gets the weapon.

I am throwing in a box of .22 ammunition -- it's a mix of Federal and Remington ammo, perfect for this plinker."

This CIA M-1 is well kept. First serie that CIA built with All Springfiled parts (non-matching USGI parts), mostly in 1945. Stock and Parkerizing look very good and I was able to hit metal targets out to 600 yards (at Angeles) with iron sights. I do not know the throat and muzzle measurements because I do not have any gauges. Perhaps an M-1 Garand gunsmith will be best suited for purchasing this rifle and get it up to it’s original specifications as intended by John Garand."

I can't believe I am letting this sweet heart go. However the safe is too small lately. And I picked up a PC 3"" version. So I am half heartedly letting it go. I know I will never find another exactly like it.

This was a 4"" barrel that has been re-barreled to 2 1/5"". The grip frame has been nicely round butted for better concealed carry and then shod with gorgeous combat stocks. It has been dual Mag-na-ported to bring it quickly back on target. I have put less than 2 boxes through it. The recoil is definitely manageable.

ARAK-21 Upper by Faxon ARMS Adjustable Gas In  Other features include:
These sell for 1200 This has never bee fired except factory.
•The upper receiver is fully machined from an aircraft grade 6061-T6 aluminum billet in a one piece design that incorporates a full length picatinny rail (Mil-STD-1913) on the top and three additional rails on the muzzle end of the receiver, making it a full M4 style quad rail upper. The top picatinny rail is laser engraved for optic placement. There are also half-length picatinny rails available.
•12 ½” length BAU is available in 5.56, heavy profile. 16” and 20” length BAU’s are available in both the 5.56 and 300 BLK. There are two profiles to choose from, medium and heavy. BAU’s can be interchanged in less than 3 minutes by removing the (6) captive allen screws on the bottom rail using the enclosed allen wrench.
•Long stroke variable setting gas piston system. There are three options for gas flow, and one for no gas flow. This allows for single shot operation. There is also a clean out port for the gas block between the gas cylinder, and the barrel.
•Charging handle is ambidextrous, non-reciprocating, foldable, spring returned and is easily relocated from left to right side without tools by the operator.

•Model “39” Eight (8) lug bolt design with involute profile for both right and left hand versions. The extractor is positioned at 3 o’clock. This allows for a left hand version to use the same bolt by simply removing the cam pin and rotating 180 degrees and reinstalling the cam pin.

•Self-contained firing pin retention system enclosed in a rectangular bolt carrier that no longer requires a cotter pin.

•Bolted in hardened steel rail system for the bolt carrier to ride on. This allows a metal on metal wear surface for better wear characteristics and a much smoother operation.
•The ARAK-21® system allows for a folding stock to be added, as our recoil system does not extend beyond the upper receiver to fully operate. This eliminates the noise and feel of the buffer tube cycling back and forth.

 It will fit on any AR-15 Lower shown on Rock River.
 Scope, Forward Grip, Sling not included. I have seen these operate in real time and they are awesome read reviews and check out their links.
 New Cost is 1199 plus tax and shipping. This one is new with box and paperwork. 1075.00 or trade for Colt Defender or Colt New Agent.

I changed out the stock to a Bell and Carlson Medalist Varmint/Tactical. The stock features two swivel moats for a sling and bipod. The trigger has been upgraded to a Timney adjustable trigger. It is very crisp, no creep and a solid 2-3lb break. It has a Leupold Solid Steel Matte finish base with 30mm Leupold high rings. The scope is a Millett 4x16x56 mil dot gold Series. It is an awesome optic and gives a huge picture for varmint hunting. I have proven this rifle at 500yds (max available to me) using Federal Match 69gr boat tails. I have only put 200rds through the barrel and did follow all break in procedures as recommended. Will come with the bipod shown on the rifle, not the sling (that was grand dads). Please feel free to contact me for more pics and questions.

I have over $1700 into this rifle.

Our introduction of a ""heavy bullet for cartridge"" 9X18 Makarov +P loading is the sole result of numerous customer requests.  With millions of these pistols now on American soil and no +P heavy loadings available, this cartridge and the many pistol owners are suffering from the lack of serious fight stopping ammunition.  This load is 20grs. heavier and 100 fps faster than standard 9X18 ammo.

This loading features a flash suppressed powder, so if you need to shoot in low light, you won't be blinded by your own gun fire and this is a useful tactical advantage since around 95% of all civilian shootings in the US happen in low light while the criminal element is out and about.  Our use of a hard cast bullet, with a flat nose, can best be understood if you'll read our technical article on ""The Use of Expanding Bullets in Small Defensive Cartridges,"" posted under the ""Technical Articles"" category on our home page.

Further, please note that the use of hard cast bullets (not lead but, Hard Cast) does NOT cause lead fouling in the polygonal rifling's used in all 9X18 Makarov pistols.  For more information, please see our technical articles entitled ""Hard Cast Bullets in Polygonal Barrels"" and ""Dangers of Pure Lead Cowboy Bullets"". We found no appreciable leading in any of our Makarov test guns. It should also be noted that all of our test guns functioned and fed flawlessly with this load. We also experienced very good to excellent accuracy in all test guns.

Please note the real world velocities listed below from real world 9X18 Makarov pistols. At Buffalo Bore we always use real, ‘over-the-counter’ firearms for our published velocities, as we feel the use of laboratory test barrels that give false, high velocities does the customer a disservice as each customer needs to know what their carry ammo will really do on-the-street in a real world situation.

The upper comes with a black dog 25 rd mag. The SBX barrel is 12.5"" with a pinned 4"" shroud that a suppressor can fit into an thread onto. This gives you the ability to suppress the rifle without adding much length to the riffle. And with the barrel being 16.5"" no tax stamp is required. I am FIRM at $600. Not really locking to trade. Unless you have a tactical solutions x ring reciever or rifle. There is nothing wrong with this upper. I just want to build a nice 10/22.
