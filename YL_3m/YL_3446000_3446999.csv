(yes America has turned a corner the wrong way) 

After serving 21 years in the Marines defending this beautiful country reality is hitting home for me!  Anyway, this is a no issue fine example of this revolver that would make anyone very pleased.  Like with any of my firearms they are extremely well taken care of and just looking for a new home!

I have listed all of my firearms at very fair prices and have very pleased folks who have purchased from me.  I am not going to list high just so we can play the back and forth game.  I really do not want to trade as it sort of takes the point away from being able to leave as planned.  Silver bullion or coins is always OK as I buy this stuff for my grand kids!!!  A partial trade may be considered but cash is king as they say.  The first person with $500 cash gets her.

Chambered in the classic .308 Winchester cartridge, the LE901-16S is the perfect choice for medium to large sized game animals. Exceptional accuracy is assured by its full floated, 16.1” chrome lined barrel and one-piece monolithic upper receiver, suitable for mounting your optic of choice. Keeping the varmint hunter in mind, the .308 Winchester upper receiver group can be easily swapped out for any Mil-Spec Colt upper receiver chambered in 5.56x45 NATO. The fact that all operating controls are ambidextrous, including the magazine release, bolt catch and safety selector, makes for versatility and ease of use. You can depend on the new Colt LE901-16S to take the shot of your lifetime!

We make every effort to remove any cases that are obviously defective or otherwise unsuitable, however, due to the volume of brass processed, it is not possible to remove every unsuitable case. Therefore, we add some extra cases to account for any that we might miss and that do not pass your safety inspection. 

There is absolutely no substitute for a final safety inspection of cases prior to reloading! Brass being once fired is not a guarantee of the safety or suitability of any brass for reloading. Case preparation, care and attention to detail while reloading, use of appropriate powder and primer, powder charge weight, primer seating, case mouth flaring, bullet seating, case crimping, and the number of times a case has been reloaded will determine proper function of loaded rounds and case failure rate.

Only looking for trades at this point, might open up to selling if no bites in the near future. I might need you to add cash depending on the scenario (i.e. your gun only has one mag, etc).

Here are the Glock models I am specifically interested in. I am not interested in anything chambered in .40/.357/.45 GAP. I like the old Gen 2 models the best. For Gen 3 models, the pre-2010 ones with the shiny black finish will be of more interest, however, if your gun comes with the newer matte-greyish finish, I'm not necessarily going to say no. Anything with any stippling whatsoever is going to be an automatic no as well:

back in 1954 their own assault rifle similiar to the AK47.  And that they did.  They
designed a tighter, more accurate, better fit to finish assault rifle than the AK.
Has an american MILLED RECEIVER and all Czech  parts.  Czechs (CZ Factory)
are famous for their quality, their mauser was considered one of the BEST.
This VZ2008 (VZ-58) scares people because it does'nt accept AK mags.  However,
it comes w/5 30rd ALUMINUM mags, bayonet, cleaning kit/sight adj. tool.  They
are lighter, more accurate and the finish is beautiful (unlike M70's out of Zastava).
They compare the workmanship of this fine weapon comparable to Beretta, Sig Sauer,
and Glock.  Extremely tight assault rifle.  Comes w/5 30rd mags, 500rds of ammo,
cleaning kit/sight adj. tool, leather mag pouch and sling.  The tolerances of this weapon
allows it to easiy outshoot the AK, will do sub 2"" grps at 100m.  New and unfired,

Do a quick check on amazon to find out what it looks like or how it works. It is a beginner/intermediate reloading kit for personal use, not recommended for someone looking to make a living reloading. It comes with everything from the original kit, minus the instructions that can be downloaded off of the net, 9mm carbide dies, 45ACP dies, 600 or so brass in 45ACP,  40S&W,  9mm, and .380. No powder, primers, or projectiles included. 

You can find this press listed on ebay for less but they increase in price through auction. You could also get this for less brand new from amazon. Mine comes with two die sets that haven't been used and a bunch of brass. My price is negotiable and I have no problem working out deals. I have zero time to reload and my box full of reloading stuff is collecting dust. If I get the cash from this it will go towards an advanced gun course. 

I would take cash, a gun/s, ammo, tools, knives, military/law enforcement gear, watches, electronics, gold, silver, gun parts, and anything worthwhile not mentioned here (that is LEGAL). I also would take a combination of anything mentioned previously.

This new pistol has all the features you expect to find on what is, in our opinion, the most advanced semi-auto pistol in the world. It is derived from the successful ""Taurus OSS"" pistol we designed for the U.S. Armed Forces, but adds an external hammer that has been requested by so many of our valued customers. ""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going."

Extra magazines, other barrel weights available with gun purchase (not available separately).  No box, papers.

This grip is strikingly beautiful.  However, the gun to which it is mounted is not available any longer.  The gun, if purchased, will be the  Gold lettered Hammerli 208 S in my other ad.  The GRIP also can be used on most of the 208 (non-S) models.  If desired, I have a few that can be offered with this grip.  Price with this grip is around $1100-1200 for a standard 208, depending on which 208 is used.  

FFL transfer only.  Please note, only means ONLY and that includes FOID card holders, police officers, police departments, CIA, DIA agents etc..  Requests for exceptions will not receive answers.

Also for note by ATF and Customs agents, this gun is NOT one of those stolen while in Customs custody or shortly thereafter a few months ago.  It was one of the few that was not stolen in that shipment.

If this is close but not quite what is wanted, I also have ambidex 208, 212, and 208S available with the ""combat"" type grips from Nill and Hammerli.  Grips are NOT for sale without the gun.  The 208 are in the 900-1100 range, the 212 from about 1000-1400 depending on details.  

FOR THE CURIOUS:

A SPECIFIC GUIDE to the 208 and 208 S with list of most of the versions available from me also has been prepared and IS AVAILABLE for download.  An email address is required for that, due to file size and format.  The RH 208 S are lower in price than this gun, and the 208 are much less.

The S model is significantly more expensive than the standard 208 due to rarity and popularity in the USA.  The basic design is very similar, but the S model has a 2-stage trigger (adjustable play and pull weight between stages), an adjustable trigger position (front to rear), an enlarged trigger guard to accomodate that freeplay in trigger position, a different trigger adjustment system than the older 208 guns, and as a result, easier access to the recoil spring for changing that if ever needed.

The 208 uses a single stage trigger that is not adjustable for position (but is adjustable for pull and resistance).  There are a number of versions of the 208 which differ in the magazine release (bottom vs side frame mount), presence or absence of a safety, presence of an external coarse adjustment for trigger pull weight, and detailed trigger design (some use the 215 trigger).

The S model has been very popular in competition, but has never ""bettered"" the scores attained by the 208.  

This gun is one of several target and ""other use"" pistols available, which are NOT listed on Armslist.  For a complete list and EXPERT'S SELECTION GUIDE to these guns, please email.  The guide and list are free.  Several such guides (catalogue raisonne, in the old terminology) are available.  One covers a number of target pistols, one focuses on Hi Standard Victors, and one is specific to the 208 and 208S."

Fortis REV™ is an extremely lightweight yet robust free floating rail system. When designing the REV™, we didn't want just another rail system, we wanted a better, lighter, feature rich handguard that was robust and within budget. We've managed to reduce as much weight as possible while maintaining strength by utilizing a 1 piece body design. KeyMods were added at the 6 & 9 O'clock positions for modularity and additional weight savings. It's unique mounting system captures a standard AR15 barrel nut for easy installation. Check out all the features and see for yourself why the Fortis REV™ beats the competition.
