This is a very nice kz 45 compact that had a recent complete tune up in Arkansas at Wilson Combat. While there I had non bullet proof parts upgraded to Wilson bullet proof, new tritium Bill Wilson contrast Battle Sights installed and purchased a couple new mags for it. Since getting it back from Wilson it's had 120 rounds through it, zero malfunctions. Test target that came back with it from Wilson Combat after the tune up /upgrades is one ragged hole!! Comes with all paperwork, two test targets (original and tune up), Wilson pistol bag (your choice gray or blue),& 3 mags (2 virtually new). This model is the 4"" barrel and is very accurate. It's everything you expect a Wilson to be; accurate, reliable, well fit and the trigger...it's a Wilson Combat , that pretty much says it all lol. I bought it used and decided I wanted it made like brand new, so I had Wilson Combat upgrade pretty much everything that showed ware to bullet proof and had them fit everything. The sights were dim, so they were replaced too. I don't think there will be any disappointment on this one even for discriminating 1911 aficionados. I would prefer a Ftf cash sale in or around Asheville area, but will consider shipping at buyers expense. Will consider trades, but should include some cash, not looking for a straight trade. More pictures available upon request. Looking for $1750 or reasonable offer. I also have an extra Wilson Combat tritium front sight (taller) available but not included."

This is a full-size gun with a 4-inch barrel. The action type of the TP9 is a bit unusual. It is a striker-fired gun, but it works a bit like a DA/SA pistol with an exposed hammer. When you first load the pistol and drop the slide, you have the option of leaving it as is. The trigger will stay all the way forward if you don’t touch it, but a light tug on it will reveal no pull weight for the first two-thirds of its travel length, then it will click into place. Pull the trigger then and the result will be a crisp 5-pound trigger pull. Or, you can hit the decocker at the top rear of the slide. When decocked, the trigger stays forward and you will get a long, traditional DA pull of about 10 pounds.

The rear of the striker is painted red, and if you can see it through the hole in the back of the slide, you’ll know it is cocked. The pistol has no external safety.

The polymer frame of the TP9 accommodates interchangeable backstraps, and two sizes–small and large–were provided with the pistol. I have medium-small hands, and the large backstrap put too much bulk on the pistol for my taste, but those of you with larger hands will probably like it a lot."

I would like to trade my Beretta 90-Two for firearms below. It looks LNIB. It was fired approx. 100-150 Rds tops. These Berettas selling right now up to $800-850 area in this condition. Very collectible. Many people mistaking these with polymer frame guns. Frame of the pistol is metal with wrap around polymer grip. Also you can always buy 9mm barrel from regular Beretta 92 FS and shoot 9mm ammo without even buying 9mm magazines. Under plastic cover there is a picatinny rail for your acces. They were all made in Italy. Most beautyful Beretta ever made ( in my opinion) I never seen one on Armslist.
Comes with a box ,Manuals and papers just like from factory.

I am the original owner of this firearm. I have put about 1000 rds through the handgun. The gun shoots great, I am just looking to sell it so I can purchase something different. Simple takedown (like a Glock) makes this an easy firearm to clean. It has been cleaned after every time it gets shot. No modifications have been made to the firearm. I have the original packaging, with lock, as well as a second 16 round magazine that did not originally come with the gun. Originally purchased the firearm for $500, spare magazine for $45. Asking $280. Please email me if interested or if you would like to see more photos. This must go to an FFL if you can not pick up in person. Buyer pays FFL fees. Buyer assumes all responsibilities for laws and ordinances in their particular area. Sorry but no sales to Cook Co. IL.

Would be interested in cash plus SD9 for a new or nearly new Glock 17 Gen 4 (black, OD, FDE whatever)."

Most varmint guns are easily recognized by their heavy barrels, bipod mounting studs and long range scopes, but they are far from being equal. The new Winchester Coyote Light is the rifle to take along for varmint and target shooting fun. It has been carefully trimmed of any unnecessary bulk but is no lightweight when it comes to performance. The matte-blued receiver and medium-heavy fluted barrel mount into a skeletonized aluminum bedding block that is set in a lightweight carbon fiber/fiberglass composite Bell and Carlson stock for superb accuracy. Flow-through vents on the fore-end reduce weight and help cool the barrel during long strings of fire. A Pachmayr Decelerator pad helps soak up recoil."

What’s in a name? In this case, everything. Our all-new ATACR™—Advanced Tactical Riflescope—builds upon the long and successful history of our NXS™ series. The result is a riflescope of unprecedented long-range capability and image quality.

The 34mm tube allows 120 MOA/34.9 Mils of elevation adjustment—20% more than our most capable NXS™. Fully multi-coated ED glass results in light transmission values of over 90%, brilliant images and exceptional color contrast. A magnification range of 5x to 25x, and a wider field of view as a result of its unique optical prescription (17.96 feet at 5x) will cover virtually any situation a shooter could encounter.

All this power comes in a compact package, too, measuring just 14.3″ in length. Our patented ZeroStop® is standard, and the ATACR™ is offered with two of our most sophisticated reticles, leaving nothing to chance.

The ATACR™ redefines the “long” in long range for serious shooters and hunters, pushing the envelope of precision…and possiblity."

This gun is equipped with factory adjustable Eliason sights and is very tight. It has spent most of it's time sitting in the safe over the several years that i have had it. It does have minor bluing wear on the left side of the side only and that looks to be from just being laid up and not being carried. It's an excellent shooter and would still be a piece of value from a collectors standpoint. If you have any questions, feel free to call or ask. Thanks and have a great day!

It features a blinding 3,000-lumen beam with enough reach to illuminate targets hundreds of yards away and enough surround beam to make it perfect for patrol or search-and-rescue operations. 


Built to withstand intense recoil and combat conditions, the HellFighter's water-resistant body is constructed from high-strength aerospace aluminum with a Mil-Spec Type III hard anodizing finish. A 5mm multi-coated Pyrex® window protects its lamp assembly, and the window itself is protected from dust, mud, and heavy particle impact by either a swing-open amber filter for cutting through smoke or dust, a swing-open infrared for use with night vision devices (NVDs), or a swing-open opaque cover. 

The HellFighter's rugged high-intensity discharge (HID) lamp is powered by one or two military BA-5590 batteries or from a 12-volt auto battery, and is virtually immune to failure from recoil, vibration, or impact since it has no filament to break or burn out. 

The light has a handle so you can use it as a spotlight! This light works fantastic!!! Will light up a 100yrd field like the sun is out!!!

Will be great as a coyote light or a hog light!

The 551 is the same as the 552 except that its shorter, which worked great on the AR with the magnifier behind it.   Uses the N batteries which I picked up at lowes today.  Below is some product information.

The EOTech holographic sight features a heads up design that allows both eyes to be open in order to maintain peripheral vision and depth perception while shooting. It features an sleek and unobtrusive low profile design that points naturally. The reticle is a 65 MOA open circle with a 1 MOA aiming dot in the center, providing fast target acquisition and precise aiming options. The model 551 N is 4"" in overall length and runs for 200 hours on a set of N batteries. The 551 N also includes a toggle switch that immediately lowers the light intensity for use with night vision without any halo effect.

**  The .300 BLK round is a favorite among Military SF Units and Law Enforcement. It is a little more pricey than the .223/5.56 counterpart, but when bieng shot with a suppressor, the acoustics of the rounds fired are almost identical to that of an MP5SD.... it is also one helluva hog hunting round bieng a .30 caliber projectile. It uses the same size brass (in diameter) as the .223/5.56 and thereby uses the same BCG as the .223/5.56 round. The recoil felt is minimal at best when compared to the .223/5.56 round. It is a VERY accurate round with impressive ballistics and knockdown power.  **"

The left arm needs a color Taz devil (or similar) with my son's name under it in a ribbon or something to make it look good. This one is about an 1.5"" x 4"", it is also a basic outline. this one was appraised at $150. 
Both are on the upper arms. Mistakes of younger days when I didn't think first.

Prefer a bone-stock rifle, will pay extra for ammo assuming you're not asking too much for it (steel cased 7.62x39 isn't that expensive nowadays, guys). Price to be determined by the quality/type of rifle (i.e. I'll be paying more for an N-PAP because of the heavy receiver), but keep in mind I'm looking for the low end stuff.

there is the original holster Dated 1916 with the Makers name Joseph Moll of hoch.
Two clips
Take down tool.
The Luger was brought back from WW1 where my grand father served in the US Army in France (have service medal for proof if needed). He died in the late 50's and it has not been fired since then until last weekend. Its been gone through and safe to fire. clean crisp, strong spring! Works like only a Luger can and just has an awesome motion to it with low recoil. I am not a gun collector and i got this from my father because i have coyotes where i live and wanted a safety device. Its a rare piece and i am sure a collector would enjoy it more as i just want simple safe hand gun for what i need, just seems wrong to ride around with this on my quad. 
I have more pics e-mail for them.
Might sell holster, clips and cleaning kit separate for the right price. The gun works great and is metal, i just have a hard time taking the almost 100 year old holster out on the farm."
