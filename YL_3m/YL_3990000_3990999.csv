I’ve got a bit of money into this piece of wonderment so this will be a great deal for you!  I just need the money to fund more ammo.  

Get the best of both worlds: (1) a longer barrel and slide for better accuracy and more powerful ballistics than the G27 and (2) a shortened grip for superior concealment than the standard G22 grip!  This pistol is a blast to shoot and actually balances out nicely with the loaded G27 magazines.

Why I’m selling:
Saw this at a gun show and thought it would be pretty cool to own, but after having it a few months I feel like I’m more of a less flashy gun type of guy. I really like this gun. Zero malfunctions ever. I have never had a problem with it. Very reliable gun and makes a good car gun or house gun, just not my style.

The GLOCK 23 combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight, despite its large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, the G23 pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. That's why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol.

This Gen 3, Glock 23 was used by an out-of-state LE Department, and was recently traded in when the Department decided to upgrade.  Despite the fact that it was LE owned/operated, shows very little wear and tear, and is in Good/Very Good Condition.  Includes:
•	Gen 3 Glock 23 pistol with factory installed Glock Night Sights
•	(2) 13 rd factory Glock magazines
•	Factory Glock hard plastic case
•	Cable Lock and Keys
•	All Manufacturer’s Nomenclature (owners manual, fired shell casing, etc…)

New receiver, and hammer forged barrel. Unlike the new production WASR 10s the rest is made up of parts from demilled military rifles, as are all 10/63s. This one is parts matching minus the recoil spring and selector lever. Trunnion dated 1980. Cugir arsenal stamp nice and clear. Includes a Romanian sling and one mag.

This is a very accurate target pistol for plinking, teaching kids to shoot and even starting competition. 

 If you want to upgrade it, you can upgrade to competition grips and a Hammerli competition externally adjustable trigger (stock trigger is adjustable, but not externally) for under $200.  If you've been thinking about a Browning Buckmark, Ruger Mark III, S&W 22A or other target/plinking pistol, consider a Sig Hammerli Trailside and you will have a much better base to expand into competition shooting if you want.  If you keep it clean, the Trailside pistols are far more tolerant of a wide range of ammo than many Eurpopean target pistols are (like Walther OSP/GSP, other Hammerli models, Benelli, Pardini.)

The rifle is in excellent condition. I am the first owner & the importer I bought it from selected which mosins he imported, and then I selected which one I wanted out of his stock. He guaranteed it unissued, and said it was possibly unfired. I've put 100-140 rounds through it since I've had it. It's a round receiver. All bolt parts are the original matching Tula parts as far as I can tell. The scope mount is the ATI mosin scope mount. Had it installed by a gunsmith so it's no bubba job. He also attached the bolt handle to a separate bolt body with steel apoxy so it won't coming loose. However you still get the original & matching & untampered bolt body with the rifle as well. Finish is great. No rust or pitting anywhere on it. Very thoroughly cleaned it every time i shot it. To include disassembling the bolt & wiping the receiver till it's clean. Was going to keep it for my collection but I already have another m91/30. It's not you average run of the mill mosin by any means. Stock it in great shape, not totally beat up and grease-soaked like most of them. Still has a few dings, but fantastic condition none the less. Never fired corrosive rounds through it. Comes with the usual accessories you'd get with a mosin, with the exception of a bayonet. Action is smooth as can be and I'm in no rush to sell it so I won't be lowering the price. I do drive for the right offer though. As south as Olympia and as north as Arlington. Plus these aren't being imported anymore and because of Putin's misbehaving the UN is trying to make Russia destroy what rifles they have left. May include some brass cased ammo or shotgun shells if interested, for the right deal. May also include some cash for the right offer. Offer what you got! You'd be surprised what I'd be interested in. Worst that can happen is I say no! Text or call REDACTED. Or email, which I do check frequently

(Yes they still make 16 gauge at any normal gun store). It was manufactured in 1956, and all of the labeling on the gun is very clear to validate that. The orange sight is still in perfect condition too. There is even engravings from the factory on this one, on both sides, everything is in spectacular shape functionally, as everything works like silk. There is slight surface rust, from the previous owner keeping it in a bag I figure, but nothing that is off the bat noticeable. The actual wear of the gun is remarkably little. You can tell it was kept in the open position, but the slide pump arm has very little wear on it. I've kept it very clean, and only shot a box through it, and of course cleaned it after. It'd be a great gun to show off, hunt with, fun shoot with, anything really. The kick is surprisingly little, making it a great gun for men, or women or kids even. it is veey hard to find this great of a gun, this old, especially in 16 gauge.

22 TCM case details
The 22TCM (Tuason Craig Micromagnum)[2] is a proprietary cartridge developed by Fred Craig and Rock Island Armory. Before the cartridge was commercialized, it was called the 22 Micro-Mag. The 22TCM is a bottle necked cartridge referenced as a short 5.56 with performance that exceeds the 5.7x28 FN while being smaller in length and re-loadable. Standard factory loads are 40-grain jacketed soft hollow point. Armscor has announced a new round the 22TCM9R which will be the same case as the 22TCM but have an overall length of the 9mmx19 round. The company plans to release this round in summer of 2015 with a Glock 22TCM9R conversion slide to allow the 22TCM to fit in a 9mm length magazine, hence the ""9R"" designation. The 22TCM9R will in fact still be a 40GR bullet but will be a fully jacketed hollow point instead.

The 22TCM is based on the 5.56 nato case, shortened so that the shoulder is at approximately the same length as a 38 super cartridge. The cartridge is designed to feed from a Para-Ordnance style double column .38 Super magazine. Currently only Rock Island Armory catalogs firearms chambered in 22TCM: a 1911 style semi-auto pistol (also available with optional additional 9mm barrel and recoil spring), and a bolt action rifle (which reportedly can use the same magazines as the pistols); and only Armscor (the parent company of Rock Island Armory) manufactures ammunition."

ISSC's M22 is a great training pistol 

that mirrors modern defensive 

handguns. Top quality handling, 

performance, and safety features 

make the M22 a standout among 

rimfire autoloaders. Designed for 

inexpensive, high velocity 22LR 

ammunition, the accurate rapid-fire 

performance of the M22 offers the 

shooter an economical shortcut for 

modern defensive pistol practice at 

the range. The M22 gives shooters 

the opportunity to shoot with 

extreme accuracy due to the 

combination of a 4.375"" threaded, 

match barrel, an extremely crisp, 4-

lb. single-action trigger and a 

windage-adjustable rear sight. The 

M22 pistol from ISSC has five safety 

features: safety decocker, loaded 

chamber indicator, trigger safety 

tab, magazine disconnect, and an 

external key-lock. It uses easy to 

load 10-round magazines in a 

lightweight polymer frame with an 

integral rail for training with lights 

and lasers. This SD model has a 

black slide and Desert Tan frame.

694,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3990694,For Sale:  HECKLER & KOCH VP9 STRIKER FIRE LEM 15RD SAO 2 15rd Magazines,"Lincoln, Lincoln, Nebraska",$ 599,"Listed On: Friday, June 19, 2015",Handguns,Heckler & Koch                                                                                ,no type,Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"HECKLER & KOCH VP9 Link to deguns.net  Heckler & Koch has introduced their first striker-fired pistol design in over thirty years. HK pioneered striker-fired pistols with the introduction of the VP70 and VP70z. These were also the first polymer-framed pistols, preceding the Glock by a decade. The latest striker-fired pistol from HK is the VP9, which is the subject of this review. At first glance, the VP9 looks like just another polymer-framed double-stack 9x19mm pistol. That it is, but the details in the execution of the design puts the HK VP9 a cut above many of the similar pistols on the market. The workmanship and finish of the VP9 are first rate. There are no visible tool marks, inside nor out. One notable feature of the VP9 is the excellent trigger pull, for a pistol of this type. The trigger on the test pistol released crisply with four and one-quarter pounds of resistance, after a short, smooth take-up. Like most pistols of this type, the VP9 also has the thin blade ""safety"" inset into the trigger blade. The trigger must be preset by cycling the slide, either manually for the first shot, or by the firing cycle of subsequent shots, until the slide locks back on an empty magazine. The steel magazine holds fifteen cartridges, for a ready-to-go capacity of sixteen. Ten-round magazines are available, for those who live where the populace keeps electing idiots for legislators. The grip of the VP9 can be conformed to fit almost any hand, by switching the backstraps and side panels. The pistol ships with three backstraps of various sizes, and three pairs of side panels, to allow for a custom fit to the shooter's hand. The VP9 sits relatively low in the shooter's hand, for a straight-back recoil impulse, allowing for faster follow-up shots. The front of the trigger guard is grooved and slightly concave, for shooters who like to place the trigger finger of the support hand in that position, as I do. Don't judge me. I was taught that way. Every time I shoot at Gunsite, the instructors threaten to remove my finger, permanently. The trigger guard is also large enough to accommodate a gloved finger. Another feature that I really like on the VP9 is a very simple one, but highly useful for those who have limited hand strength: the protruding ears at the rear of the slide to help the operator to manipulate the slide rearward to chamber a cartridge. HK calls them ""charging supports"". They protrude about one-tenth of an inch outward from the sides of the slide. Whether you grasp the slide with thumb and forefinger, or push the slide rearward with the hand atop the slide, the supports make the operation easier, and will make the difference between not being able to operate the weapon and doing so successfully, for those with limited hand strength. Great idea. Also, if not desired for some reason, the charging supports are easily removed. The slide to barrel and slide to frame fit of this weapon are very tight; not overly so, but enough to eliminate play between the upper and lower halves of this pistol, aiding overall quality and accuracy. The sights are the familiar three-white-dot pattern, and both front and rear sights are adjustable by drifting in the slide dovetails. The sights are also, thankfully, made of steel. Tritium night sights are an option, if desired. The large extractor also serves as a visual and tactile loaded-chamber indicator, and the rear of the firing pin (striker) is painted red, to serve as a visual cocking indicator. The controls on the VP9 are ambidextrous. On the right side of the pistol is a slide lock release lever to accommodate left-handed shooters. The magazine release is also ambidextrous, and is located at the rear of the trigger guard. The levers push downward to release the magazine, and are easily reached with the trigger finger or the thumb of the shooting hand. The carbon steel slide is coated with a corrosion-resistant carbon-nitride finish. The black hammer-forged barrel has polygonal rifling, which should reduce fouling buildup and make cleaning easier. The front of the frame wears a section of 1913 Picatinny spec rail for the installation of a laser or white light. Critical specifications for the HK VP9 are listed in the chart below.

The ""P"" proof mark is located near the magazine release and on top of the slide, in front of the rear sight. Cross cannons ordnance mark on the right rear of the frame, to the right of the hammer pin. ""UNITED STATES PROPERTY"" over the serial number with ""M1911A1 U.S. ARMY"" to the right of the slide stop pin.

This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1942 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped in May of 1942. It is stamped with WB inside a Box for Colonel Waldemar S. Broberg, Hartford/Springfield Ordnance District, Army Inspector of Ordnance: July 1, 1941 - June 16, 1942. The WB inspected pistols are a little more rare for that time frame.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. But not all pistols back then were stamped with ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted national match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by the military, as the barrel has been re-stamped. This gun is in its original time frame finish (parkerized). All Proof markings to fit era. Bore is excellent and looks shinning.

This pistol is a shooter. It is amazingly tight and special fitted for accuracy. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection.

 I am looking to pick up a few different ""beater"" guns to practice re-bluing/refinishing/restoring on as a bit of a hobby. I would prefer for them to be ""mechanically sound"" but that is not a deal breaker, just price it accordingly. Im not looking for your pristine condition/collectible guns, but rather that old beater gun that has been sitting there cracked, fading, rusting, jammed, gummed, or unused. They need to be more or less complete (or missing minor parts or parts i can order without spending more than the gun is worth). Im also open to the idea of getting some of the ""saturday night special"" style guns (bryco, jennings, charter, sedco, jimenez, hi point, phoenix, those type) to practice on as well if you have some you dont use or regret buying haha. Also, i will not buy your stolen guns. Period. So please stop offering them. (I hate to have to say that, but i see it a lot nowadays.)
I have cash or trade in hand depending what kind of deal you have.
