One gun that adapts to perfectly fit any individual’s hand size, shooting style, and purpose. 

This  SIG SAUER p250  is a radically new kind of pistol that carries the renowned SIG SAUER quality – the performance, the accuracy and the reliability – into an exciting new range of unlimited possibilities, all built around a single, serial-numbered metal frame and fire control assembly. Choose the caliber:, .357 sig or.40 s&w. When you have a P250, you not only have a high-quality SIG SAUER pistol that perfectly meets your needs. You have the foundation for building a new SIG SAUER pistol that will meet changing needs without the slightest sacrifice in performance. 
 The P250 is a hammer-fired double-action only pistol (not DA/SA). Every pull of the trigger completely draws back and releases the hammer, giving a consistent but heavy trigger pull. The trigger is rather smooth, but the weight of it makes it difficult to fire accidentally (not that this matters if you're observing the basic rules of gun safety)

You can purchase the conversion kit for different calibers and frame size the only thing needed is the trigger assembly (the only seralized peice on the gun) for around 300.00$

If you're looking, you know, this shotgun isn't made for looks, it's made to function flawlessly in all conditions. 

Shotgun will hold 8+1 and the speed feed stock will hold another 4 rounds, giving you access to 13 rounds of 12-gauge should you need it. I typically kept 2 slugs / 2 bird shot in the speed feed and 00Buck in the tube when traveling so all bases were covered. Ghost ring sights make target acquisition a breeze. A new one in this configuration with the speed feed and ghost ring sights installed will run about $650-700 plus tax. Here's your opportunity to save some money buying used. No trades will be considered.

Only selling because I got another new truck shotty and no longer need this one, however, I also don't need to sell so save the lowball offers for someone else. I'm offering a great gun at a fair price."

From the Aero website: The AR15 weapon system is an ever-evolving and modular system. That weapon system has now been enhanced by Aero Precision into the new M4E1 platform. The M4E1 upper receiver is precision-machined to our specifications and features M4 feed ramps and handguard mounting platform. The rail mounting surface and barrel nut area provide a much stiffer system than a standard receiver, giving you more accuracy out of your rifle. Lightweight by design, stronger through superior engineering, the M4E1 delivers monolithic accuracy in a lightweight package.

I see no rust at all and no peeling of any of the plating. Looks in excellent condition to me. But remember condition is subjective so please look at the pictures. It was loaded when they found it and I shoot the 5-rounds in it and it functioned like knew. When I was finished I cleaned it. I will be include a brand new box of 50 rounds of ammo.  FTF sale or trade.

YOU MUST PICK UP IN ABERDEEN, MD 21001


Note:
Sorry but because of all the scammers, game players& no shows
Starting from now on I will not meet anyone unless I have a phone number to call to see if your running late, lost or whatever. I am tired of sitting and waiting for hours for someone that is to inconsiderate to call me and say that something (whatever) come up and they will not make it. I have always just asked the person to call me and give them my Cell number but most just let me sit and wait. Later ask to meet some other time or they just changed their mind. So because of these inconsiderate and non caring people I must insist on a phone number. Sorry but as with other things the assholes cause the rest of us to have to do things that we normally wouldn’t. So blame them not me."

This Super Charged 30-06 load was designed to be the premier deer load for 30-06, providing devastating, one shot terminal destruction of deer “clockwork”. The 150gr. Spitzer is traveling at around 3,000 fps from typical 30-06 rifles and the bullet will mushroom violently at these impact velocities. It may even fragment, depending on bullet placement and impact speed. For big game up to 350 lbs, tremendous penetration is not needed, so this bullet mushrooms radically and might even break up. (Much like our Deer Grenade 44 Mag. Item # 4F) When high speed bullets act this way terminally, the effect is devastating and they absolutely “dump” deer sized game animals in their tracks. This bullet does not give ample penetration for super big game like Yukon moose and we have designed other 30-06 loads for that type of task, but this load will collapse deer sized game unlike any other 30-06 load. This load is designed for any game weighing less than 350 lbs, such as medium sized black bear, hogs, antelope, deer, etc.

Note our below real world velocities, shot from real world rifles. We do not use extra long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings.

3050 fps - Kimber 8400 Montana, 24 inch barrel
2970 fps - Winchester All Terrain (circa 1995), 22 inch barrel
2957 fps - Winchester Feather weight (circa 1950) 22 inch barrel
This ammunition is designed for use in ALL 30-06 chambered rifles that are in normal operating condition."

THE CLASSIC ZT ""BEAST""

If any ZT is our flagship knife, it's the 0300. It has all the features Zero Tolerance is known for: extremely solid construction, premium materials, and sophisticated ergonomics. This top-quality knife is equipped with the patented SpeedSafe assisted opening system.

SpeedSafe makes it easy for users to deploy the blade one-handed—using the ambidextrous flipper. The flipper is easy to access and with a blade this massive, SpeedSafe supplies an assist you'll appreciate. In addition to SpeedSafe, the 0300 features a tough S30V stainless steel blade with matte black Tungsten DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) coating. The S30V blade steel is designed to provide the perfect combination of durability, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. The Tungsten DLC not only provides a non-reflective camouflaged surface, but also enhances blade hardness and reduces friction drag.

The 0300's handle is 3-D machined G-10 in the front with a matching 3D machined titanium back. The titanium frame lock provides a secure blade lock up during use. With or without gloves, this enables a very firm grip. The solid grip enables a quick transition from forward to reverse grip time and again. Heavy jimping on the thumb ramp further enhances the grip. A 3/8-inch hex head pivot shaft nut makes field adjustments possible with minimal tools. ZT's Quad-mount pocketclip enables for tip-up, tip-down, left- or right-handed carry. The 0300 is also available with a versatile, partially serrated edge as the 0300ST.

Blackwash is the New Black

Zero Tolerance introduces blackwash. A blackwashed knife is like a battled-tested tool or a favorite pair of well-worn jeans. Blackwashing gives a ZT that already-broken-in look that's just plain cool. Although a few custom knifemakers have been using this process, Zero Tolerance is one of the first major manufacturers to use it on production knives. Knife components are Tungsten DLC (Diamond-like Carbon) coated, then tumbled to produce the distinctive ZT blackwash finish. Like any coating, it will wear eventually, but with blackwashing, who cares? Additional wear just adds to the blackwashed look.

60° Bolt
Browning X-Bolt and A-Bolt rifles have a short 60° bolt lift. Many competitors' rifles incorporate a 90° bolt lift that is not only slower and cumbersome but places the bolt near or on the rifle's scope, making the bolt more difficult to operate.

Target Crown
The muzzle of the barrel is specially machined to protect the rifling, therefore preserving and protecting accuracy. This is a critical feature on any barrel. If riflings are damaged in any way, especially at the muzzle, accuracy suffers and it is often difficult to determine the cause.

Feather Trigger
For precise shooting in the field or off the bench, there’s absolutely no substitute for a good, predictable trigger. The X-Bolt’s new three-lever Feather Trigger provides a clean, crisp pull with no take-up or creep and minimal overtravel. The trigger is screw adjustable from 3 to 5 lbs. and factory pre-set at approximately 3 1/2 lbs. An alloy trigger housing contains the hard chromed steel components that are highly polished on all critical contact surfaces. Precise engagement angles mean the X-Bolt Feather Trigger feels light and right and stays that way through many thousands of rounds. Unlike competitors’ triggers with secondary fingerpiece levers, the Feather Trigger is designed right, from the very start.

Detachable Rotary Magazine
An all new detachable rotary magazine is incorporated into the X-Bolt. Constructed from a durable lightweight polymer, the magazine is designed to feed cartridges directly in-line with the bolt, instead of offset as with traditional leaf-spring magazines, for a straight shot right into the chamber. An ergonomic magazine-mounted release lets the magazine rotate directly downward and into your hand. The magazine sits flush with the bottom of the rifle for a sleeker appearance. Additional magazines can be kept loaded and carried in your pocket or pack for easy access.

Bolt Unlock Button
The bolt unlock button works in conjunction with the top-tang safety to provide an added measure of safety during checking and unloading of the chamber. Conveniently located on top of the bolt lever, the bolt unlock button allows the bolt to be unlocked and opened with the safety in the on safe position. The safety blocks the trigger sear and features a firing pin block for added safety.

Have not needed it much recently, rather than just let this beast sit, would like to get it to somebody that will put it to work.

4 speed manual. 1st gear is REALLY low. normally start in 2nd and go from there. have never driven it over 60mph, runs best between 45-55 mph
runs great. cylinder heads got worked before i got it a few years ago. got 11mpg last time i was driving it around enough to check. have since rebuilt the carb and re wired the engine bay. is no longer a fog bank when its started up and the 12v system has been reliable. rear differential was rebuild by vancouver transmission in 2011. the engine has a small idle issue when its cold. after a few min of running its just fine. runs strong, sounds great. 4x4 system engages.

Shoots all 22lr very accurately. This is from their website: Our muzzleweighted barrels are designed for the shooter who requires match-grade accuracy while using the factory sporter stock. Muzzleweighted barrels offer superb balance whether used for competition or serious plinking. This barrel is built off our Stainless Match Barrel and machined to the muzzleweighted configuration. This eliminates the main compromise made in other factory-contoured barrels – the decrease in accuracy due to the narrow muzzle profile. These barrels utilize the factory contour through the stock but contour back to a full bull barrel at the muzzle to allow bull barrel accuracy.

948,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3605948,For Sale:  NEW Liberty Mystic X Silencer Suppressor,"Amissville, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 735,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 11, 2016",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Check us out online!  www.54-17arms.com Brand new Liberty Mystic X Silencer Suppressor. A mounting adapter is not included but is needed depending on your application. FREE SHIPPING AND NO CREDIT CARD FEES!  Price does not include NFA tax stamp or sales tax. We can assist you with the creation of a basic living trust! A living trust will ease the transfer process. Let us know if you have questions. Check out this video! The Mystic X was born from a need: the need for a “Swiss army knife” of silencers, so to speak, for first time suppressor buyers. The first time buyer is literally overwhelmed with the amount of intel that is currently available. Due to this problem, we feel that the first time buyer needs a choice that will allow them to “dip” their toe into NFA and be able to have the most versatile suppressor available at the same time. Armed with this idea, we took one of our most popular suppressors, one that has already been adopted by many first time buyers, and improved on it. The Mystic X is the ultimate first time owner’s silencer! Made entirely from Titanium and Stainless Steel and coated with type “C” high temp Cerakote™ this suppressor weighs in at a paltry 10.5 ounces and only 13.9 ounces with a recoil booster installed in it. This suppressor can be “dipped”, ultrasonically cleaned, sand blasted, or soaked in harsh solvents without fear of damage to the unit. Did I mention that it is also full auto rated? Well it is!!! It is rated for seven different calibers in full auto and 53 calibers in semi auto giving the T/C guys as well as hunters and target shooters a large host of options. We have developed a series of mounting solutions for the Mystic X to include several booster options as well as many variations in fixed barrel mounting solutions as well. All of the mounts are available in black now as well. Designed with Dual Arc Baffle technology, the Mystic X is incredibly quiet for a centerfire monolithic core suppressor. Although the real treat is the Mystic X performs really well on so many centerfire rifle and handgun calibers. The 7.62 x 39 and the 300 BLK are prime examples of this. Not only in subsonic, but many rifle calibers are also rated for supersonic speeds as well. 38 Special, 357 Magnum, 357 Maximum or 9×25 Dillon? No problem! The Mystic X loves all these rounds and many more! Being takedown in design, this suppressor is a favorite of people using cast lead bullets. It is well known that lead buildup in the 9mm and 22LR suppressors is a reality and the Mystic X is perfectly suited for this application. Specifications: •Length : 8” •Diameter : 1.375” •Weight : 10.5 oz. •Core – Stainless steel •Tube – Titanium •Tube Retaining Ring – Alloy steel •Finish: Type C High Temp Cerakote™ In Graphite Black •Mounting via: Thread mount specific to each platform. •Aprox. Sound Reduction: 33 to 38dB across several platforms. •Provided with a Battlecloth pouch and a core removal tool •Adaptable to a large variety of firearms with our mounting solutions. Please call with special applications and we can discuss a solution that would work for you."
