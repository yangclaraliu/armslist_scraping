Here is a Romanian contract 1934 Beretta military pistol assembled in 1941, as indicated by the markings on the left side of the slide, and with two original Beretta magazines. The back of the right side of the frame displays Romanian armory mark, ""CM"". No import markings. 
CONDITION: Excellent, with 97-98% of original blue still on the metal. All matching serial numbers (frame, slide, barrel). Fine bore with strong and shiny rifling. Very smooth action. Difficult to find pistol without the import marks! Caliber: 9 mm Short (.380 ACP, marked on barrel). Two WWII Beretta magazines with thin metal floorplates and no other markings, both in like new condition (as is the pistol!).

This Beretta model 1934 pistol offered here was manufactured for the Romanian military in 1941. In August of 1940, the Romanian military placed a contract with Beretta for 61,000 model 1934 pistols. This contract specified that the pistols were to be delivered within seven months. The first of these pistols was not delivered until February of 1941 due to the shortage of steel and Romania's failure to send Beretta the entire fund amount for the pistols. Beginning in February of 1941, Beretta delivered 10,000 pistols with the promise of 5,000 more per month until the total contract was filled. By August of 1941, Beretta had sent a total of 40,000 pistols, but the remaining 21,000 were never delivered. This means that there are less then 40,000 of these pistols in existence today. The first of these Romanian contract pistols can be identified with a 0(zero) at the beginning of the 5 digit serial number. The Romanian contract pistols are identical to the Italian model 1934 versions except that the slide is marked 9 SCURT instead of 9mm Corto as seen in the pictures below. These Romanian model 1934 pistols were normally issued to the Romanian officers 
during WW2.

Trigger has two settings, and it only takes slight pressure to switch between them. One setting is 3#, the other, 1#.

Still in incredibly similar condition to when I bought it, since I never had the chance to take it out hunting.

No pictures yet, and let me know if you have any questions. But I urge that you take a look at the specs on CZ's website.

I am looking to do this tomorrow (Monday, 5/19) between the hours of 5-8pm (preferably 6 to avoid rush hour traffic). 

First off is the .22. It is a marlin bolt action. It has seen relatively little action and is in very good condition. It is magazine feed with which you will get one magazine, the ammo I have bought for it (about 400 rounds, most of it being subsonic), and a few cleaning supplies. It is the first picture of the bunch.

The second part of this deal is 3 air rifles. One is a hatsan .22 breakbarrel, which has scratches on the stock (indicated by the picture of me holding it separately), another is a .177 ruger blackhawk breakbarrel, and then a daisy .177 single pump. With this purchase you will also get the pellet listed in the picture too. All of these air rifles are in decent condition, though the blackhawk's rear sight is pretty much worthless, while the hatsan has the scratched stock.

I'd like to sell these as a package to one person to avoid having to make separate meets to separate people. First come first serve. Have had a couple of potential buys fall through so please only serious responders. For all that you are getting, price is non-negotiable."

Buy this new one and this nice used one with a bunch of extras for a package deal price, with ammo.  All matching serial numbers on both One new, still in cosmolene, one lightly used, maybe 200 to 300 rounds. You won't find another new, unissued, unfired early one like my new one with box, manual, and original sling and spike bayonet any more. There is no indication on any part of the new rifle to suggest it was ever fired, and the perfect exterior proves that it was never issued. I have put a couple of dings on the stock from the bayonet getting against it in the box over the last almost thirty years. 
The used one comes with a synthetic side folder pistol grip stock and the original stock, and a 30 round metal mag, and a 40 round plastic mag, and the original 10 round mag. It also comes with an extra gas tube, and a metal hand guard, and a plastic hand guard. All in very nice condition.  Neither of these is a refurbished military, I bought both new in the 80's. Both are early production Chinese SKS, according to what I have researched. The new one was produced at factory 0141 for the Chinese military, which is one of the more desirable ones. It has only been out of the box maybe 10 times in almost 30 years. All parts on both have the matching serial numbers, including the original stocks. Both have the importer stamping added on the left side of the receiver, behind the Chinese military symbols, factory number stamp, and S.N.. The used one was produced at factory 636.
I will try to accommodate you to meet locally for inspection at a convenient time with no obligation.

If this ad is still up they are still available.  Neither of these are the junk models built specifically to export, both were built for the Chinese military. $500.00 for the new one, or $900.00 for everything, , and I will include my last 100 rounds of ammo. I will not sell just the used one or just the folder or mags, or just the ammo. 

 I will answer any more specific questions you have.

204,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3076204,"For Sale/Trade:  W German Sig P226 w 5 mags, real SEAL holster, case, $750","Lakewood Ranch (Sarasota/Bradenton), Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 750,"Listed On: Sunday, May 18, 2014",Handguns,Sig Sauer                                                                                ,9mm Luger (9x19)                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"I have a much sought after West German marked Sig P226 9mm. This is one of the ones that has the slide, frame and barrel all marked with the same serial number. This is one of the Sigs that were made back when Sigs were actually Sigs. This one was made with the rare original (and also sought after) grips. 

If you know anything about Sigs then you likely know that the above three-serial number West German marked ones is the tip of the spear. This is also the EXACT configuration that the US Navy SEALs originally adopted (before the MK25) and from what I hear back from the Sand Box, many are still using this version as they prefer it over the MK25 (the one with the rail and the cute little anchor on it). 

I also have FIVE original Sig 15rd magazines. 4 of them are the authentic Sig-made, German ""zipper-back"" mags and one of them is a Metgar that was made for Sig and is marked with Sigs logo. They all run flawlessly. 

Here's the coolest part. I'm also including an AUTHENTIC US Navy SEAL Safariland ""drop leg"" holster that has been ""operator-modified"" by the SEAL who owned it. The modifications are the ones that almost ALL SEALs and DELTA guys do on these Safariland holsters: They shorten the belt strap so that the gun rides higher (on the hip) rather than way down flopping around on their leg. They also cut off the top strap so they can sinch the bottom strap high up into the groin to keep everything nice and streamlined. Next they drill a hole through the holster and attach a bungie that can be slipped around the gun's handle when parachuting so as to keep the gun more secure and add a second retention device as they free fall. Lastly they paint the previously black holster (it's like a hard, rough plastic) FDE (which is like a tan color). 

This holster is the real deal and I personally know the operator who wore this in combat operations in ""the Sand Box"". You'll have to just trust me because no, I'm not giving you his name but he's a tier-1 operator and this holster has seen some serious operations. The holster still has the USN ID painted on it (in red). 

Lastly, I'm including the original Law Enforcement Only box that this weapon came in. These boxes themselves are actually quite rare and people on the Sig forums buy these. 

This was a duty holster so there are wear marks on the front of the slide from coming into and out of the holster and there are the minor dings and scratches that you'd expect to see from an actual duty holster. If you're looking for beauty queen; keep looking. If you're looking for a bad ass man gun then this is it. 

Between the weapon itself (a Florida SWAT deputy's duty weapon) and the AUTHENTIC Navy SEAL holster, there is a lot of history on this package. 

All five of the magazines are currently loaded with Speer Gold Dot duty rounds. I'll let you keep all the rounds too."

The Extreme is essentially an Elite Dark model with fixed night sights and gray Hogue G10 grips. The gun is brand new, unfired and I am the one and only original owner. As you would expect from a brand new firearm, it is in perfect shape with no marks, scratches or wear of any kind. The decocker lever has never been used so there are no marks on the frame. There are some very light scrapes on the barrel hood from the slide being racked several times, but that kind of wear is obviously unavoidable. Other than that, there are no blemishes whatsoever anywhere on this pistol. You are truly buying a brand new Sig.

Everything the gun came with when I brought it home from my LGS is included in the sale. The Sig P220 Extreme itself, two 8-round Sig mags, plastic carrying case, owner's manual, gun lock, small tube of unopened factory Sig lube, and even the plastic bag and paper tags that were on the gun from the factory. Like I said before, this is a factory new handgun. There really isn't much else to say about the Sig, but if you have any other questions feel free to ask.

Price is $1,000 cash and I am not interested in any trades. Buyer must be 21 years old, have a valid Ohio driver's license and be able to legally own a handgun in the state of Ohio. CHL holders are preferred but not required. I am in Canal Fulton 44614. I have additional pictures of the gun uploaded to Photobucket, just ask for the link in your email. Thanks for looking."

Asking for $675 cash. Will listen to any reasonable offer/trade. Also included 300 rds or ammo. You can email me or text me @ REDACTED.

Must have valid Purchase Permit or CCW. Below is the retailers statement about the gun:

Introduced in January 2010, the Centurion 39 is a new semi-automatic version of the AK-47 design, and it retains all the signature AK features, such as the curved 30-round magazine, 7.62x39 mm chambering, and an oversize, right-side safety lever. Unlike other AKs sold in this country, which are usually assembled using foreign-made parts kits, the Centurion is made completely in the United States.
The Centurion 39 conveys an impression of extreme sturdiness, with robust and simple internal components, and a receiver machined from an 11-pound block of 4140 steel. Century Arms states that the rifle is also made to tighter tolerances than the original.
The Centurion, however, incorporates a number of changes to the original design. For example, its 16 1/2-inch barrel terminates in Century’s proprietary three-port Chevron Compensator. Created expressly for the Centurion, this removable unit more effectively directs propellant gas upward to reduce muzzle jump.
Also departing from the original pattern are the Centurion’s sights. On standard AK variants, windage adjustments are performed by moving the front sight. On the Centurion, the square-notch rear sight has been redesigned to allow windage changes by loosening a set screw and moving the rear sight blade laterally. Elevation is adjusted by a slider on the rear tangent sight or by rotating the red-colored front sight post.
The Centurion’s most visually distinguishing features are its polymer buttstock and two-piece polymer handguard. The buttstock has a 1-inch longer length of pull than the original wood stock—better fitting American shooters—and terminates in a ribbed, plastic buttpad. The handguard features four Picatinny rail segments spaced 90 degrees apart for the mounting of optics, lights and other accessories. Molded-in checkered panels on the lower handguard aid grip, while numerous ventilation slots in the upper handguard help cool the enclosed gas tube assembly.
Two TAPCO 30-round polymer magazines come with each rifle. Century Int’l states that the Centurion accepts standard AK accessories, including the company’s own MTL-225 Tactical Fore-end Weapon Light, which combines a 225-lumen light with a vertical fore-grip and mounts on the rifle’s bottom Picatinny rail. Disassembly follows standard AK-47 procedures, as is thoroughly explained in the rifle’s owner’s manual."

Included at no extra cost are the 20 rounds I bought to test the rifle with.

  As it is I will describe the gun in detail as best I can. I have only had it a month or two, and have not yet taken it to the range. The only damage I have noticed after a field strip was a few bits of laminate along the stock have been worn down. The entire firearm could easily be summed up in a single phrase; ""Grimy, but undamaged"". There's no physical damage on the rifle, but there are plenty of signs of long storage. Dusty barrel, worn laminate, bits of dried mud inside the checker-pattern on the buttstock, etc

Since the picture, the rifle has been touched up considerably; everything but the barrel has been rubbed down and cleaned, all metal parts have been oiled.

I am reluctant to sell this rifle; I have yet to fire it and it was my uncle's prized possession. Alas, I have no more room in my gun safes, and my house is far too humid to allow firearms of any sort to sit in the open for long.

I'm not looking to gouge anyone with the price here; I'm a collector as well and I know how infuriating it is when dealers jack up the price just because. I searched Armslist to find similar condition Winchesters and based the price off of that, taking off $100 for the 'damage' the rifle has. This is a golden opportunity for anyone who wants a .30-30, and is willing to spend a few hours cleaning it up instead of buying new for hundreds more.


Please, feel free to email me at anytime. From there I can give you my cell phone number, and we can schedule a time to come take a peek at the rifle. This is a first-come, first-served basis. Cash only, and the price is firm.

It would be easiest to meet me at my house, where all the guns are anyways, but I am willing to meet anywhere in the Portland area. Please bear in mind I have a very odd weekend from work 'Wed-Thur'.

Happy Hunting,

The Extreme is essentially an Elite Dark model with fixed night sights and gray Hogue G10 grips. The gun is brand new, unfired and I am the one and only original owner. As you would expect from a brand new firearm, it is in perfect shape with no marks, scratches or wear of any kind. The decocker lever has never been used so there are no marks on the frame. There are some very light scrapes on the barrel hood from the slide being racked several times, but that kind of wear is obviously unavoidable. Other than that, there are no blemishes whatsoever anywhere on this pistol. You are truly buying a brand new Sig.

Everything the gun came with when I brought it home from my LGS is included in the sale. The Sig P220 Extreme itself, two 8-round Sig mags, plastic carrying case, owner's manual, gun lock, small tube of unopened factory Sig lube, and even the plastic bag and paper tags that were on the gun from the factory. Like I said before, this is a factory new handgun. There really isn't much else to say about the Sig, but if you have any other questions feel free to ask.

Price is $1,000 cash and I am not interested in any trades. Buyer must be 21 years old, have a valid Ohio driver's license and be able to legally own a handgun in the state of Ohio. CHL holders are preferred but not required. I am in Canal Fulton 44614. I have additional pictures of the gun uploaded to Photobucket, just ask for the link in your email. Thanks for looking."

* Custom-built reloading bench - my woodworking skills are AWFUL but it is sturdy and functional, including a 100-capacity charge block drilled into the wood
* Lee Precision single-stage press
* 5 tungsten carbide Lee dies for 9mm (1 sizing, 2 flaring and 2 seating)
* 2 shellholders for 9mm
* 2 powder scales - the balance model that came with the kit and a cheap Chinese-made electronic one
* Powder dispenser (attached to bench)
* Cabela Model 400 vibratory case cleaner
* Cabela rotary media separator
* Case-cleaning media and cleaning solution
* Roughly 3000 pieces of 9mm brass, already sized and de-primed
* A small number of 9mm copper-plated bullets (maybe 100)
* An even smaller number of primers (maybe 20)
* A third of a can or so of Red Dot powder
* Calipers for measuring rounds

I have not used this equipment in 2 years, and some of the dies are a bit rusted, but it all functioned then and I am 90% certain it all functions now - you will of course need to obtain more bullets, primers and powder but the brass should last quite some time. The kit will of course work for other calibers but you will need to buy a new die set.

Now, a couple of stipulations:
* You must pick it up, and take the complete set as-is. 
* I don't have any instruction manuals and I'm not going to teach you, so you'll have to learn on your own.
* I will only sell to a holder of a Florida CWP - after you contact me, I will ask you to send me a copy of your driver's license and permit before the sale."

Today I'm trying to get rid of a few old soft handgun cases as seen on www.kickinapacksnstuff.com. I have three black cases that measure 12"" x 6.5"". I'd like $7 each or $15 for all three.

I also have a size medium (7.75"" x 6"") Original Tommy's Gun Pack as seen on www.kickinapacksnstuff.com.

It has only been out of the spam can for about 3 months, I opened it up to do testing and found for me to shoot tighter groups than the Russian varieties. This is great fresh ammo, and with the water and air tight 30 cal ammo  can I am including this ammo will last many many years.

This is a project for an off-hand charger I've been working on, and I've lost interest.  The receiver is complete and functional, the barrel is a stub, and the grip is solid.

If you're not familiar with the Charger, it's a 10/22 pistol.  Made by Ruger, all parts interchange, only difference is ""Charger"" on the receiver, and it's registered as a pistol.

Again, this is not a 10/22, its not a rifle, its not a cut down 10/22. Its a real ruger charger, made and registered as a handgun by Sturm ruger and is totally legal to own and transfer. They don't make these anymore.

The 37mm STZ-Havoc Flare Launcher features the latest in design and manufacturing technology. Parts are CAD designed and CNC machined from solid billet material rather than the typical stamped and welded construction of other launchers. The 6061 T-6 aircraft grade aluminum components are anodized in a non-glare matte black finishing for maximum durability and ease of maintenance. 

Additional components are built from 1018 cold rolled steel and plated with a mil-spec black oxide finish. The proprietary STZ push button cylindrical breech lock design is 3 times stronger than existing lever lock systems. The Havoc is designed to mount on any mil spec rail system. Installation simply requires sliding the launcher onto the bottom rail of the handguard and tightening two set screws which are included."

The guy I bought it from cleans and repacks bulk military surplus ammo into commercial 20 round boxes. I've since sold my rifle and no longer need this ammo.

Ammo is for the 1891 Argentine Mausers & carbines. It bears the head stamp SF 81 indicating it was produced in Argentina in 1981. So it's fairly current in the world of military surplus ammunition.

It's brass case and pretty darn clean. There are some scattered darker spots on some of the cartridges but nothing that would interfere with using it. I've tried to capture what I'm talking about in my pictures.

I do not know if it is corrosive primed or not. With the 1981 production date it could go either way. So clean your rifle after firing and you'll never have a problem no matter what.

Price is $70 with pickup in the Brandon area. You must be 18 or older to purchase this ammo. I will ship UPS ground at the buyers expense and cost will be determined by your location."

I've got a few left from a lot that I made a month or two ago, so I'd like to sell them as a package.

*Made from 7.62x54R steel core Military Surplus ammunition.  Primer and powder are removed, leaving just the bullet and the casing.  The key ring is connected to the casing by a wire strung through the primer holes.  Casings and bullets are polished.  All key chains come with a ""dog tag"" style ball-and-chain necklace.

*I have had pretty good luck selling these key chains at $7.00 each ($5.00 when left unpolished), but don't intend to make up another batch for a while.  You could have pretty good luck with them at gun shows, too.

*Method of payment is PayPal, and shipping is included in the price.

Thanks!"
