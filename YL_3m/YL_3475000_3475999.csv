I'd like to trade one or a combination of these for something, however I plan on keeping one of the handguns for my carry gun.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

Thanks!"

Most of you know what this is. I'm selling it for AIRSOFT ONLY, however, you could theoretically get yourself a tax stamp and license this as a SBR with your Glock 17, 18, or 19.

I bought this on an impulse buy with full intention of finding a Glock Series Airsoft Pistol and trying airsoft, then I realized those pistols were nearly $200 and I just don't have time to go find an airsoft range or learn the ins and outs of airsoft gaming.

If you intend or even give me a hint that you'll use this illegally, I will NOT sell it to you!

I've compared this with the $300-$400 models and the ONLY difference is the airsoft label on the side. This isn't a cheap plastic toy.

Glass is crystal clear, no scratches or blemishes. Includes batteries and 2 ADDED BONUSES - a GG&G Tactical Flip Lens Cover & a GG&G Quick Detach Mount!

Unlike active IR laser pointer systems, the Model 552 is a passive system and emits no muzzle-side signature. While in the NV mode, the 552 is not detectable by night vision surveillance systems, providing operators with a stealth means for effective nighttime aiming.

Are you a sportsman interested in hunting with night vision? The 552 is EOTech's most affordable night vision-compatible sight and it partners with most night vision-devices. The 552 is designed to increase your speed to target even after the sun goes down.

GG&G Lens Cover
The GG&G EOTech Lens Covers fit between the EOTech hood and the body of the EOTech housing. They are spring operated so that once pressure is applied to release them from the closed position, they spring open. The rear cover lays across the top, so as not to interfere with the field of view. The front cover opens and serves as a sun shield. However, if heavy brush etc. is encountered, the front lens will fold back so that it is not damaged. These unique lens covers for scopes can be easily operated with either hand to provide flexibility of operation.

GG&G Accucam QD Mount For EOtech
The EOTech Accucam QD Mounting System is the only QD Lever System available today that does not add height to the EOTech. This quick detach system retrofits directly to the body of the EOTech. The GG&G EOTech Accucam QD Locking Lever System replaces the EOTech socket head screw or thumbnut attachment method. No other modifications are required. The only tools required are a 7/64"" allen wrench and a torx head wrench. It is fully adjustable to fit Weaver and MIL-STD-1913 dovetails, even those that are worn or out of spec. Once installed on the EOTech the sight can be quickly installed on a dovetail rail in seconds by rotating the Accucam Cam Lever to the locked position. Manufactured from solid billet 4140 steel and manganese phosphated matte black to mil-spec.

Both rifles have been well taken care of - cleaned and oiled regularly, and stored properly. There is NO rust or pitting anywhere on either of these rifles, and the only blemishes on the original stocks were suffered in the hands of Japanese soldiers, during actual battles in Japan.

The gun and barrels were stored in the case and developed some rust on the right side of all pieces.  We sent them to a professional gunsmith for refinishing and re-bluing.  This package also includes the original case for the set, the barrel wrench, and another set of wood grips.

 Throughout the years, the Dan Wesson series of revolvers has retained a loyal, and dedicated following.   Through all the years, these have retained their popularity, because they remain the most versatile, accurate revolvers made. Innovation, and versatility have become the hallmark of the Dan Wesson company.  The most striking feature of the gun is the capability of changing barrel length, by the use of an ingenious system of interchangeable barrels and shrouds. While there are other unique qualities to the Dan Wesson series, the fame of the system rests on the barrels. Even so, many if not most, Dan Wesson owners stick to a single barrel length, and often can not even recall the location of the tool used to change the barrel. In many cases it is the great accuracy, and light trigger pull which attracts buyers. These are some of the most accurate handguns in the world, and may very well be the most accurate repeating handguns ever made. They have also been constructed with very light, very simple actions, and the interchangeable barrel feature, for which they are best known. It doesn't hurt that the guns are very handsome, since the redesign. There is an almost pythonesqe look to the ribbed, and underlugged barrel. The deep blue is almost black, and has a mirror finish.

928,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3475928,For Sale:  Geissele AR15 Super Semi-Automatic Trigger,"Wylie, Dallas, Texas",$ 190,"Listed On: Monday, September 8, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Geissele Super Semi-Automatic (SSA) Trigger is the semi-auto only version of a select fire trigger that Geissele makes for U.S. SOCOM. The SSA is a non-adjustable combat trigger, it is not a match trigger. The second stage break is like a carrot rather than an icicle. Suitable for Close Quarters Battle (CQB) and mid-range carbine work, the Geissele SSA is also the perfect trigger for Squad Designated Marksman (SDM) rifles. A short summary of the Geissele SSA features and advantages follows.



1. Performance Advantages for the Shooter

The Geissele SSA has a pull weight of about 4.5lb. 2.5 lbs on the first stage and 2lb on the second stage. The pull weights and sear engagement are non adjustable.

Trigger and hammer are made from quality tool steel 

Sear surfaces are cut by a wire edm machine. Sears cut this way are very accurate and the non-directional surface finish of the wire edm gives a smooth trigger pull without the associated grittiness of directional machining marks left by a milling cutter.

The initial force needed to start the disengagement of the sear surfaces is low and the force linearly increases at a low rate. This helps the shot to fall at the initial point of aim and aids in building shooter confidence in his weapons ability to put the rounds where his sight is pointing.

The Geissele SSA trigger allows the shooter to slap through the trigger pull on close in shots but also set up a long range shot with a crisp trigger break.

A full force hammer spring is used for quick locktime and positive ignition of all types of ammo. No lightened hammer spring is used.

The hammer is lighter than a standard AR15 hammer. The lightened hammer favorably decreases locktime and increases accuracy of the weapon, especially for snap shots.



2. Advantages for the Armorer

The Geissele SSA is a simple design that is very similar to the original M16 trigger. The number of parts is identical.

There are no adjustment screws to come loose. 

All springs are captive; they will not get lost during disassembly in the field 

The entire trigger can be dissembled for cleaning (no rivets or staked parts) 

The trigger can be installed without removing the safety 

Sear engagement is pre-set from the factory. 

Hammer and trigger pins are a close slip fit into nominal receiver holes so the trigger can be installed and removed with rudimentary tools.

Triggers come with a slave pin for the trigger/disconnector assembly for easy installation.



3. Safety Advantages

The Geissele SSA is a 2 stage trigger where there is generous overlap of the sear surfaces which contributes to safety and a low tendency of any inadvertent movement of the trigger to discharge the weapon.

The Geissele SSA has a patented pseudo sear that is almost identical to the standard AR15 single stage sear. However, this secondary sear has surfaces that never touch during normal operation. This sear prevents the hammer from falling unless the trigger is pulled.

The secondary safety sear contributes to shooter confidence in dynamic/vehicle situations where a fellow shooter’s muzzle may cover him. There is firm knowledge that even with the safety in the fire position the weapon can never discharge unless the trigger is pulled.

Trigger timing is robust and parts have been sized to operate with a certain amount of wear to the working surfaces. The trigger is designed to operate in dusty, abrasive environments that cause wear."

From Remington’s Webpage:

“Sure as autumn arrives, the Model 870™ Wingmaster® rises to meet another day in the upland fields and woods of America. The Model 870 is so smooth and reliable that today – nearly 60 years after its introduction – it’s still the standard by which all pump shotguns are measured. With a receiver machined from a solid billet of steel, it is the model of enduring strength. True to its original design, the pump glides with silky surety on two twin action bars for the utmost in positive chambering and ejection. These characteristics, along with its flawless balance and natural pointing qualities have made the Model 870 the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time – of any action type, from any manufacturer. As the most aesthetically refined representative of our prestigious pump-action family, the Model 870 Wingmaster is a true American icon.”

Per the barrel code on this beautiful shotgun, this appears to be a Model Year 1968 – Remington 870 Wingmaster Field Gun, 12 gauge pump action shotgun, with a 2 ¾” chambered receiver, and a 30” vent ribbed , full choke, barrel (30” bbl’s no longer offered on the WM’s).  Beautifully checkered American Walnut Stock is in Very Good condition for age. Gun shows some visual wear on the mag tube (as expected for a 45+ year old gun), but as can be seen by the attached pictures, this gun appears to have been very well maintained.

The Huntertown Arms Guardian 22 and Guardian 22 SS (Stainless Steel) versions typically run between $200 and $250 each, respectively. Now due to stock overruns, we are selling them as low as $150 (22) and $200 (22 SS)—and we’ll help you with your ATF Form 4 paperwork! 

Huntertown Arms suppressors provide a host of attractive qualities for beginner and advanced marksmen, such as:

-	Sound suppression of 117 dB
-	Can be used with .17 Mach 2, .17 HMR, .22LR, and .22WMR
-	K-style baffles made of aluminum (Guardian 22) or stainless steel (Guardian SS) to provide superior sound reduction
-	Aircraft grade aluminum casings to provide both strength at a low weight (4 oz Guardian, 6.5 oz SS)
-	Can be disassembled with standard 1” tools—no special tools required!
-	Suppressor endcaps are intentionally made of soft aluminum parts that will protect the suppressor baffles in the event of a baffle strike. These caps can be easily replaced in order to keep your suppressor in service—no additional ATF stamps required!

The Huntertown Arms .22 suppressors are an outstanding way to enter the fun and safe world of suppressor ownership, and are now even more affordable. These suppressors are excellent for silent pest control, quiet varmint hunting, or just noise-free target practice with friends. Call us at REDACTED or email us at REDACTED for more information.
