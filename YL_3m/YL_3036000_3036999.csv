Springfield Armory® XD-S™ Centerfire Pistols



• Perfect for compact, concealed carry
• Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System
• Loaded-chamber indicator
• Single-position Picatinny rail
• Available in 3.3"" and 4""

To create the XD-S Centerfire Pistols, Springfield Armory took the best innovations of the award-winning XD Series and trimmed down the frame to a perfect size for compact, concealed carry. Metal parts on each gun are forged and machined from billet with utmost precision. Fully hammer-forged barrels enhance accuracy. Corrosion-resistant finishes are either super-hard black Melonite® or classic bead-blasted stainless steel. The Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System™ guards against accidental discharge by locking the trigger in place until direct rearward pressure is applied. Loaded-chamber indicator allows the shooter to verify without a doubt, visually or by touch, that there is a round in the chamber. Grip safety allows firing only when the shooter has a firm grip on the pistol. A more pronounced texture on the XD-S ensures your grip is always secure.

 A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size with this feature. The XD-S trigger has a short travel along with a short reset, which keeps you on target with greater ease for quicker, more accurate follow-up shots. The low-profile rear sight is holster friendly. Fiber-optic front sight promotes easier and faster target acquisition. Customize your grip with two interchangeable backstraps. Includes rugged carry case, paddle holster, double magazine pouch, two interchangeable backstraps, two magazines, cable lock, bore brush and safety manual.

I bought this gun in November of 2013 from sports world (a local firearms dealer). When I purchased the gun it was NEW, and still has never been fired. Upon buying the gun it was taken from the box and put straight into my gun safe and has only been taken out to admire or show off to friends. I had planned to use it for multiple purposes but have been too busy to take it out. This gun is in perfect condition and has no scratches, dings, or blemishes of any kind. The only reason I am selling this gun is because I have a baby on the way and could use the money to go towards that. With that being said I am not strapped for cash, I don't need to sell this gun, but would like to to help out with baby fund, I know what this gun is worth and how hard they are to get (being that their sold out in stores, or on a waiting list online). I am only looking to get my money back nothing more. About the gun- it is a black semi automatic Arsenal SAIGA 410 shotgun, it comes with a standard 4 round clip, as well as a pro-mag 30 round drum. It shoots 3 inch 410 shells only. I have 25 Winchester super X brass game loads that go with the gun as well as 5-5 round boxes of Winchester super X slugs, and 1-5 round box of Winchester super X buckshot. All ammo comes with gun being that I don't have any use for it. This gun would be great for a boy or girl to squirrel, rabbit, or dove hunt with, Or for an adult. The gun is not heavy in weight although when you have the 30 round drum attached it adds a bit of weight to the gun. If interested or you have any questions feel free to email me. Thanks"

Sig Sauer gave the discreet, all-metal P238 platform some 9mm muscle, and the result is the P938: the first 1911-inspired 9mm microcompact by SIG SAUER®. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever all in familiar places.

A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 can pack six or seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame, depending on the magazine (this version includes both).
NBS13 Package Overview

Sig Sauer has included both a 6-round (flush fit) and 7-round (extended) magazine with a finger-grip extension. In addition, this P938 also comes equipped with a SIG laser.
X38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser
Sig-Sauer-P938-938-X38-TGL-Laser

“The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.”

product description:


Benjamin Trail NP XL 1500 Air Rifle

The XL1500 features a handsome, checkered, hardwood stock. With its daunting 24 ft-lbs of muzzle energy, and shot velocities of up to 1500 fps*, small game – it’s game over. Independent research by Intertek found that Nitro Piston technology reduces noise by 70% during the shot cycle comparted with traditional steel spring break-barrels!

With Nitro Piston Technology
70% Less Noise then the competitor’s “quiet” break barrel
Gas Piston Technology uses Nitrogen as the power source, instead of a steel Spring

It is noted for its similarity to the Remington 870 shotgun in design, and for being chambered in the ubiquitous .22 Long Rifle cartridge as well as the less popular (and less well known) .22 Short and .22 Long cartridges.  

The rifle features a cross-bolt safety and the receiver is factory grooved for scope mounts.  The tube-fed magazine under the barrel holds 15 rounds of .22LR or 22 rounds of .22S.  This model of rifle has remained popular over the years for both its reliability and accuracy.  I've had this one since I was a kid and it has help thin rabbit and squirrel populations here in the Midwest.  

Based on what I found online (Remington Society of America) this rifle appears to be manufactured in March of 1978.  This rifle has a couple spots of surface rust (which I've oiled and cleaned) and the normal bumps as bruises normally found on a field rifle.   Based on the condition, I have priced it accordingly.

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers."

The unique LWRCI™ Rapid Engagement Precision Rifle (R.E.P.R.) is a full spectrum weapon system designed to put devastating 7.62mm NATO rounds on target in a variety of roles. The R.E.P.R. rifle allows a marksman to perform assaulter duty with the 16” barreled upper installed, and quickly switch to a sniper role simply by changing to the 20” barreled upper. The extra upper receiver assembly can be carried in a backpack and takes up less room and weighs less than carrying a separate rifle.

The R.E.P.R. rifle utilizes our patented self-regulating, short-stroke gas-piston operating system, ensuring unparalleled reliability in the harshest theaters of operation. A side-mounted charging handle allows the shooter to perform reloads without removing their eyes from the target, and prevents any gas blowback to the face when using a suppressor. The ARM-R™ rails are easily removable and reinstalled with a hex key and provide a 100% return to zero for optics and lasers."

I chose the .40 because of the insane amount of speed it picks up going through a 17.5"" barrel (has roughly the same bullet energy as a .357 magnum through a 6"" revolver and MORE bullet energy than the .45 and 9mm versions of this carbine) 
I love the gun, but need to make some room in my collection.  Might be willing to throw in some cash or ammo to trade for a beretta 92/96, but really just looking for cash. Will meet in the Greenville area."

It is perfect for shooters who are already familiar with Beretta tactical pistols, or more in general for those who may not have extensive experience with a rifle or carbine. However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies aross the US, while its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.------ Accepts Beretta Full-Size Pistol Magazines--- The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4, 90-series and 8000 series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following.----- Extremely Versatile, Easy to Use----- This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The length of pull is adjustable (one spacer included), making the CX4 easily and intuitively come up to the shoulder of most shooters. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use.---- Easy Accessorization---- The CX4 jsut begs to be accessorized. Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights. It also sports a retractable Picatinny rail that extends from the fore-end, which allows users to mount tactical lighting devices and other accessories. Additional rails can be mounted on the left, right and bottom, thereby providing ample opportunity for customization. Please visit our accessories page for a full list of CX4 accessories.

Taurus Security System (TSS)rs
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols all feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
 	7 Rd Cylinder Feature
Some Taurus models offer our 7-shot cylinder. A shot above the rest.
 	Transfer Bar
The transfer bar mechanism prevents the hammer from striking the firing pin unless the trigger is pulled fully to the rear."

It is perfect for shooters who are already familiar with Beretta tactical pistols, or more in general for those who may not have extensive experience with a rifle or carbine. However, the cold-hammer forged barrel delivers the sort of accuracy that even the most experienced shooters will appreciate. Easy to use, ultra-reliable and low-recoil, it has been adopted by several police agencies aross the US, while its versatility and accessorization options have made it a favorite of recreational shooters. Whether you use it for home-defense, varminting, competition or training, the CX4 will deliver what it promises.------ Accepts Beretta Full-Size Pistol Magazines--- The CX4 is adaptable to accept any full-size Beretta PX4, 90-series and 8000 series magazines (using optional adapters), thereby saving existing Beretta users the expense of additional magazines. Along with its uncompromising Beretta quality, this is an additional reason why the versatility of this carbine is highly prized by tactical shooters. Along with a Beretta pistol, it helps create the best and most versatile tactical system available today, as evidenced by the CX4’s dedicated following.----- Extremely Versatile, Easy to Use----- This light and compact carbine was designed to be completely and easily adaptable to the needs of most shooters. The operating handle, safety and magazine release are reversible and give you the opportunity to train or shoot right- or left-handed, while case ejection can also be switched from right to left. The length of pull is adjustable (one spacer included), making the CX4 easily and intuitively come up to the shoulder of most shooters. The aperture and post sights are user-adjustable, meaning that you can train with (or switch) your favorite brand of ammo without taking the carbine to a gunsmith. And after a day at the range, this carbine is a snap to take apart and reassemble, while its ultra-tough construction and surface treatment make it stand up to the hardest use.---- Easy Accessorization---- The CX4 jsut begs to be accessorized. Between the front and rear sights, it features a full-length aluminum top rail for mounting optical and red dot sights. It also sports a retractable Picatinny rail that extends from the fore-end, which allows users to mount tactical lighting devices and other accessories. Additional rails can be mounted on the left, right and bottom, thereby providing ample opportunity for customization.  Kansas residents must pay sales tax, all other states only pay shipping."

The Mark 6 1-8 elevation dials to prevent unintentional adjustment in the field and caliber-specific front focal plane reticles.

 Just got this pistol and am very happy with it. It is in my book, as good if not better then some of the bigger gun companies out there. It is easy to carry open or CCW. It is also very accurate. Bought this for my son but he is not interested in shooting after all and I want to let this go while it is still almost new. $450 or best offer.

 Awesome gun and value. Great price and a great gun! Love it! I shot the dots on my target right out of the box. It has a great feel and shoots well from various distance. Recommend highly don't let the price fool you it is a great investment.

 Nice smooth recoil ,light. Worth twice what I paid. Well made, a solid value for an open carry weapon.

 Starting with the CZ-75 famous design is always a smart move. The B6P does a good job following that tradition. Tight, very dependable, and actually shoots where I aim right out of the box. I can recommend this firearm with no reservations for the right use. Awesome quality pistol!

 I bought this gun because of the price. After taking it to the range I was blown away (no pun) by the performance. At 25 yards I was getting some really tight groups. I fired a bunch of mags and not a single malfunction. I like the mag capacity. Also found some 19 round mags on line to increase fire power. I have a lot of confidence in this pistol. For the money you will find no finer firearm.
 I have put 150 rounds through it with not one problem. Cleaning and lubricating it is easy. For the price of this gun you get all the quality you would expect from something costing twice as much. By far the best gun for the money. Flawless performance, and a great feel, and tight groups."
