Not marked for choke but supposedly made in modified(R) and full (L). Very tight action has apparently seen little use. Case-hardened finish on the receiver, etc. is just fading the slightest and looks near new. Barrel finish is completely blue going to plum in just a few areas but worn only slightly at the muzzles and breech. Barrels and rib are solid. Wood has nice hand cut checkering with the slightest of handling marks. A vintage Pachmayr ‘White Line” recoil pad is fitted, most likely when the gun was purchased new. A really nice clean example of the Working Man’s L.C. Smith; among the nicest of the type I've seen. Asking $450. I don't do text. E-mail only please."

Small-bore world domination starts right here.

Seamless throttle response is provided at all RPM by way of its 28mm Keihin flat-slide carb. And race-bred chassis design - featuring a rigid, lightweight twin-spar frame and swingarm, and adjustable, YZ250/125-spec suspension - that lets you soak up the whoops. Hydraulic disc brakes fitted with large-diameter stainless steel rotors (220mm front, 190mm in back) and high-friction pads provide class-beating stopping power with progressive, one-finger lever feel that lets you slow quicker and dive deeper with unbeatable precision."

Details:
Fortis MFG's quick detach rail system SWITCH features a brand new locking mechanism that allows a tool-less removal of the rail itself for easy access to the proprietary barrel nut and gas block, and what we believe is most important, is to be able to quickly change rails for a variety of mission or competition specific setups.

These .308 versions weighs in at a mere 8.7oz for the 12"" model and 10oz for the 14"". Each model will feature Keymod Slots and QD Attachment Points at the 3, 6 and 9 O'clock position as well as a full length Picatinny Rail on top.

Fortis MFG has done it again with the SWITCH, a revolutionary design that not only looks great and feels phenomenal in hand, but is incredibly functional and adds minimal weight to the rifle - this is truly an exciting new piece of kit.

I will say the scope is very well built and can handle any rifle up to and including .50 Cal. This scope has locking turrets and a illuminated (Green) mil-dot reticle. I'm also including UTG Quick Release rings because I don't own another 30mm tube scope. There are small scratches on the tube and I'll reduce the price accordingly.  Over all this is a great scope at a great price. I would recommend to anybody looking for a high end tactical scope.

If you order a firearm without checking to see if it is legal, and we ship the gun to your dealer only to find it is not legal, the gun will have to be returned to us at the customer's expense. All shipping costs will be forfeited. Please ask your FFL dealer before ordering any firearm if you are located in one of these states. 
Shipments... All firearms, with the exception of black powder, must be sent to a Federal Firearms Licensed dealer (FFL).

The ARX100 features a constant contact/short-stroke gas piston system that makes it feed and fire under the most unforgiving conditions. The lightweight technopolymer receiver allows for reliable operation with virtually no lubricants. To make maintenance easy and trouble-free, this rifle has no pins and can be completely disassembled in a matter of seconds with no tools at all.

Ultimate VersatilityUltimate-Versatility
This rifle was designed to be completely ambidextrous, and all the critical controls on it may be operated right- or left-handed. These include the 2-position safety, the magazine release, the bolt release and charging handle and the case-ejection selector, which determines whether spent brass is ejected to the right or left. The flip-up backup sights that come standard on the ARX100 are also versatile, offering an easily-adjustable diopter system ranged from 100 to 800 yards. The barrel is also easily replaceable in seconds, making is possible to use different lengths and calibers without any tools required. Lastly, the folding stock is adjustable for length of pull at the touch of a button, using a simple and rugged telescopic construction.

Ultimate Accessorization
The possibilities for accessorization on the ARX100 are limited only by the user’s imagination. It comes out of the box with a full-length Picatinny rail on top, which is perfect for attaching a variety of optics and other sighting systems. It also has Picatinny rails on both sides of and under the fore-end, which offer countless possibilities for easily adding lighting systems and other tactical devices.
