This is a great handgun for concealed carry and has surprising power! This weapon is absolutely perfect for someone who wants to carry a weapon at all times comfortably and have the element of surprise in their corner! 

LOOK AT MY DEAL...If you bought this weapon new it retails WITHOUT the Crimson Trace laser for $340 to $389.00 plus tax. The Crimson Trace Laser would be an additional $179.00 accessory plus tax. I'm INCLUDING IT in my entire selling price of $400.00!!!! But that's not all as you'll see down below!

UNLIKE OTHER LASERS the Crimson Trace laser is activated when the gun is gripped...and wherever the red dot is...that's where the bullet is going! No more worrying about hitting your target! There are cheaper manual on-off switch lasers like LaserMax and LaserLyte out there for around $100-$150, but they are not even close to the product quality of Crimson Trace. 

I'm also including an Elite ""inside the pocket"" holster which makes the weapon completely unnoticeable while carrying it in your pocket and so comfortable you can actually forget that you have a weapon in your pocket. If you went out and purchased an Elite pocket holster it retails for $27 plus tax. Again...I'M INCLUDING IT!

And finally...the Golden Saber +P ammo is a personal favorite ammo choice of mine for the shear ballistic power. It's an additional $25 if you went out and purchased it...but I'M INCLUDING IT free of charge in the deal! 

Weapon comes in the original box with a Ruger logo nylon zipper pouch.

That makes MY entire package valued at nearly $600 retail when adding everything up. 

BUT I'M SELLING IT ALL TO THE FIRST $400 FIRM! THAT'S RIGHT...$400 FIRM!!! 
NO TRADES.
CASH ONLY.

This barrel is for the Sig P226 in either .40 cal or .357 sig cal. Does not interchange with the 9mm P226. The magazine interchanges with the 40/357 sig  model because the .357 sig is a necked down .40 or 10mm (depending how you want to look at it) cartridge to a .357 bullet .

As the title also says, this gun is rare.  Why is it rare?  The reason is because Sig never intended to make the P229 Equinox in 9mm.  From what I understand around #120 P229 9mm slides made there way to Sig's Custom Shop where the Equinox and other custom guns are finished.  Instead of scraping the slides that the Custom Shop had already performed work on, Sig decided to finish the guns.  With the limited quantity produced due to this mistake, these are few and far between in this configuration.

I'm not sure of exact round count but it's definitely very low (being a Sig and in as new condition, round count is irrelevant).  I have not fired this weapon as I have a couple other well-used Sigs.  Needless to say, the gun is in pristine condition with no signs of wear.  Comes with factory case, two 15 round magazine (one still sealed in wrapper), a Sig laser (not installed but shown in picture of the case) and Sig Nite sights on rear and TFO on front (this is standard on Equinox models).  I've also installed a nice stainless guide rod (the factory one is polymer and is included) and have purchased a Blackhawk CQC Serpa holster in carbon fiber finish (to my knowledge gun has never been holstered).

Price is $1,000 OBO (Will consider trade for a quality AR).  I'm in no way desperate to sell this weapon.  I'm located in the Lawrence/Maury County area and will not travel far.  TEXT 9three1-two1five-6eight5zero (serious inquiries only and no email please).  Buyer must provide proof of TN residency (TN HCP holders preferred).

To save you time and mine, the answer to the following questions is ""No"":
1) Will you consider any trades?
2) Will you deliver to me or meet me far from your area?
3) Will you ship to my FFL?"

These adapters cost $100.00 and I am including it in the sale of the scope. I have tested this unit and it is at such a high level of condition that even after the batteries have been removed from the scope you still can see clearly for over nine minutes. The length of time that a scope of this type will remain viable after having the power removed is the way that their readiness is gaged. When a unit of this type is nearing the end of it's life span you will have only a minute or less of cloudy vision once the power has been cut off.

They were produced from mid-1944 to 1947 and with only approximately 250,000 being made it is one of the rarest, and most collectible, of the Lee-Enfield models available.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

This is a 1968 model with a rounded hammer for snagless drawing. The frame, barrel, slide, and all other applicable parts have been professionally media blasted and refinished in graphite black cerakote, which very closely matches the original finish and is very hard wearing. I have also added custom walnut grips that give a more ergonomic fit than the originals. Comes with two magazines, one that has a matching serial number and one that does not. I have ground down the finger rest on the non matching mag to better facilitate pocket carry. Will also include a box of Hornady xtp defense rounds and the original grips.
With the gun, refinishing service, and grips, I have just over $500 into this pistol and that is the basis I will use for any trades.
Looking to trade for a Sig P938 plus cash on my end. Offering an additional $100 for a basic model, more for a higher end model (SAS, Blackwood, Equinox) and/or additional mags.
Though not my first choice, would also consider a straight trade for a Sig p238.

Feel free to check my eBay feedback to verify I am trust worthy. Send a message through eBay if you want to confirm my ID. My username is hogwild! (with the !)

For full details check out Marlin's website, or wikapedia.

This gun is an older model which had the 22"" barrel, and a total capicity of 18+1 rounds as opposed to the newer 14+1 capacity, but new enough to have the last shot hold open feature. 

The gun is well used but well loved. There are few minor dents and scratches in the stock, and some of the paint is worn off of the top of the receiver from mounting and unmounting scopes. I also added sling swivel stud. 

I have owned it about 10 yrs and probably put 4000 rounds through it. It is quite accurate but a bit prone to jamming. Makes for quite a fun gun for plinking or chasing small critters. Great first gun and a blast to shoot."

The R.P.D. platform has been issued by many countries including the Soviet Union, China, Egypt and former Eastern Bloc countries.  The R.P.D. was also used by the U.S. SOF in Vietnam.  DSA has modernized this battlefield benchmark with features such as a newly designed 7075T6 alloy lower and proprietary rail handguard.  With these new features you can outfit your R.P.D. system with any M16 style adjustable stock, giving the end user greater versatility.  The rail handguard allows the mounting of a variety of accessories, including optics, lasers, flashlights and foregrips.  Compared to the old wooden handguards, a foregrip added to the new DSA rail handguard is extremely helpful in heat dispersion and improving overall effective operation.  In addition, the DSA barrel is fluted and shortened.  This reduces weight and helps keep the barrel cool.  A very effective, proven design flashhider has also been added.  These features have reduced the R.P.D. weight by almost 2 pounds.  This one comes with an LMT adjustable stock."

All you need to get this up and running is an upper, bolt and charging handle. It is extremely comfortable to run right or left handed and was intended to be my ultimate AR pistol but my loss is your gain. The parts alone are worth over 500 but I'm asking 400. Because this is a virgin lower (never had an upper installed) it can be changed to a rifle by simply removing the pistol buffer and installing a rifle buffer tube.

I had this scope for a little over a month (still have box). Reason Im selling is that I was planning on doing more long range shooting than I actually have time for (or the money). This scope was going to be used as duel use for long range shooting and (long range) hunting. The fact that it is illuminated helps with the first and last minutes of hunting when it is still dark outside. Each level of illumination has an off between each level of brightness (which is much better than Nightforce scopes that have a preset level of brightness which cant be changed quickly). The glass on this scope is as clear as you will ever see. This is almost the best scope that I have owned, but when you get into such high-end quality scopes, the difference in quality is hard to tell. I need the money right now for another project and because I am not using this scope to its fullest potential. 

The scope is in like brand new condition. It is currently held by Burris extreme tactical rings (low), that have been lapped. Lapping reduces any pressure points the rings can put on the scope from any manufacture imperfections on the rings. This translates into a better secured scope and equal pressure all around the body of the scope. 

The anti-cant is a Holland Signature Series. I believe this is the best anti cant as it is very clear and strong yet not bulky. 

The rail is an EGW 20 MOA rail for a Remington 700 Long Action.

I paid:
Scope $1400
Rings $63
Anti cant $65
Rail $45
----------------------------
Total $1573

Asking $1425 obo for all or trade (look below) 
This is a package deal My loss is your gain!

You are more than welcome to check out the scope but only serious inquiries. 
Scope will remain on rifle until I have cash in hand. I have no other scopes for my rifle so for the time being I need this one on it. 

Will only trade for Glock 20 with or without red dot (RMR or Deltapoint only) depending on what you have I'll decide how much cash on your end. NO TRADES FOR RIFLES, SCOPES, ACCESSORIES, ETC!

It has Williams Gun Sight adjustable fiber optic sights. Even though the pistol has had only light range use I had everthing refit to max out the pistols performance. All springs have been replaced in pistol and magazines. Reduced hammer spring to lighten the DA trigger pull, increased recoil spring to tame the felt recoil and limit wear and tear on the frame. and a 5% increase for all the new magazine springs to insure proper feeding. Friction points and feed ramp have been lightly polished. It also has a Houge/Ruger wrap around grip. Only very light scuffing can be found on the fiberglass filled urethane frame, everything else is 100%.

This pistol is very accurate and reliable... While it's a bit bulky it beats out most 1911s. Feeds anything very well, from 180 to 230 FMJ and HP, it seems to have no issues with even the widest mouth hollow points.  It has a very smooth DA trigger pull with no creep that runs about 8lbs, the SA trigger breaks at roughly 3.5lbs with very little pre travel. The adjustable Williams Gunsight (of Davidson Mi) fiber optic sights catch just the right amount of light indoors or outdoor. 

Package also included rare and sometimes difficult to find spare parts.

Package includes
Sturm, Ruger P97 DC Stainless .45 ACP with 4.2"" barrel
Six 8 round magazines with new +5% springs and S&R floor plates

AWC Turbodyne: The AWC Turbodyne X is absolutely the most compact, effective, and quiet .50 caliber suppressor available on the market today. Constructed of 100% stainless steel and 360 degree circumferentially welded the Turbodyne produces less noise than a .22LR. The bullet impact can be heard and is the primary source of sound while the lack of concussion allows for hours of comfortable shooting.

The Turbodyne X can be fitted to most semi-auto and bolt action .50 BMG rifles, mounting directly to the current muzzle break threads without modification to the gun.

Here are a few things about this rifle from the manufacturer:

""Unlike other semi-automatic .50 BMG rifles, the Model 82A1 is completely reliable. Its chamber is chrome-plated and dimensioned for both civilian and military ammunition. The extractor and ejector are proven to work under any condition, and close tolerances on every part allow it to function in all environments.

Its re-engineered muzzle brake, dual barrel springs and long mainspring design make the 82A1 comfortable and, dare we say, exciting to shoot.

The Model 82A1 fits into a regular sized carrying case. Although it is transported as a disassembled upper and lower receiver, it can be ready to fire in under a minute by simply inserting two assembly pins through both receivers. The scope remains mounted on the upper receiver, maintaining scope zero. The rifles M1913 optics rail is tapered 27 MOA to take full advantage of the scopes elevation travel.""

This rifle actually will fit in the case fully assembled, which is a nice advantage. No need to mess with assembly while out in the field. Also, the chrome-lined barrel will make it easier to clean."

Manufactuer: 	American Tactical Imports
Model: 	FX45 Fatboy Lightweight
Caliber: 	.45 ACP
Barrel Length:	3.2
Capacity:	12 + 1
Finish:	Blue
Hand Gun Web Model:	FX45

Overall length under seven inches, 5.5 inches high and only 1.33 inches at its widest point, the FX45 is easy to conceal even under light clothing. But it’s a true 1911 and has all of the excellent features John Moses Browning designed into his original pistol: single-action trigger, excellent ergonomics and well-placed controls that are easy to operate.
The machined steel slide has dual sets of grasping grooves, and the ejection port has been lowered and flared to ensure that spent cases get out of the way surely and quickly.
But the most modern feature is that it uses a bushing-less barrel with a flared muzzle section. Another departure from the original is a telescoping, dual-spring recoil system on a full-length guide rod. Both of these features ensure tight and consistent barrel/slide lockup for improved accuracy and functioning. It also greatly simplifies disassemble.
The low-profile rear sight has a large, easy-to-acquire square notch and is angled to prevent it from hanging up on clothing on the draw, and its rear face is serrated to reduce glare. The front is a square blade with a white dot insert.
The alloy frame pares the Fatboy LW’s unloaded weight to a mere 22 ounces, and the frame is undercut at the trigger guard to permit a high grip on the gun.
The ambidextrous thumb safety levers are smaller than normally seen on a 1911 but can still be operated positively. An extended beavertail grip safety with a palm swell provides superior handling while ameliorating recoil—a nice feature on a .45 pistol weighing so little. Aggressively checkered, polymer grip panels allow a secure grip."

This was my primary carry gun for over a year. It has been an absolute joy. This is a super concealable .45 caliber power house with a match grade barrel. It is very accurate and has manageable recoil even though it is so small due to its all stainless steel construction. 

Why buy a used gun? Because you get great stuff with it!

This has been my primary carry gun. As such, you get a gun that is already broken in. It is already proven to run great. It comes with many extras that would otherwise cost you quite a bit of cash! The extras include:

-Tritium night sights. ($120 value)
-Minotaur MTAC Holster for IWB concealed carry ($90 value)
-Serpa holster with retention clip for open/range carry ($40 value)
-6 Snap caps for practice. 

This combination of holsters work great. The MTAC is one of the best CCW holsters that money can buy. It is very comfortable. The Serpa is a fantastic holster for open carry or the range. It is easy to use and has a retention clip to keep the gun in the holster. 

The stainless steel finish on this gun is ideal for those who actually want to carry the gun frequently. There is no coating that can wear off in time. It resists damage from sweat, oil, etc... This is an absolutely fantastic carry gun. 

Q: What is LDA?
A: For double action converts who prefer not to carry a “cocked and locked” 1911, PARA’s LDA (Light Double Action) system delivers 1911 performance from a double action fire control. Fire it and you’ll never pickup a standard double action pistol again.

What LDA means to me:
It is a super smooth and easy to operate double action only trigger. You do not need to carry ""cocked and locked"". The trigger feels like a well tuned revolver. Feel free to read up on this. Para Ordinance has created something very cool. 

In addition to the LDA, this gun has a grip safety and a manual safety. This gives you some added peace of mind when carrying the gun with you every day. 

Condition:
The gun is in excellent mechanical condition. It is in good cosmetic condition, but does have a few minor marks on it from being an every day carry gun.

Notes about sale:
Cash only. Local sale only. You must be a Virginia resident who is legally allowed to own a fire arm. I will ask to see ID."

Here is my immaculate HK SL8-1 rifle. This is the civilian version of the g36 rifle, and can be converted if you happen to have the cash and time. I like it just the way it is, and it has the factory heavy barrel. Because of this barrel, it is ACCURATE beyond belief. Low round count, outstanding trigger, no damage what so ever. It's a head turner, for sure! I am looking for only a few specific trades, but will consider REASONABLE FAIR offers.
