Original Old West Single-Action Look, Size and Feel. Since its introduction in 1993, the Ruger Vaquero® has dominated the cowboy action shooting world and earned its reputation for rugged reliability due to its strength and mechanical superiority. It is often referred to as ""the gun that won the New West"" because of its widespread popularity among single-action shooters and cowboy action competitors.

 The Ruger Vaquero combines the original Old West single-action look and feel with new features. The mid-size steel frame and cylinder are scaled-down to the same size as the original 1955 Ruger Blackhawk®, closely resembling the classic single-action revolvers of the late 1800's.

 PATENTED RUGER REVERSE INDEXING PAWL allows for easier loading and unloading, while the traditional
 beveled cylinder simplifies holstering.

I recently purchased a Serbu .50 cal and went overboard on reloading supplies and a Lee .50 Press Kit.  I have way too much and need to sell off some ammo in lots of 24 or 100. The photos show my actual bullets for sale (you will have to click my other sales to see all of my photos as I cannot post them all here).  I have over 100 rounds cleaned, sized, primer crimp removed with Lee chamfer tool, primed and ready to ship.  All my shells are once fired Lake City brass which have been resized down to OAL 3.945” as needed.  All my projectiles are mil surplus/pulls 650 grain API which have been resized in my Lee .510 resizer for consistency.  Projectiles have all been cleaned and the ones cleaned to a shine no longer have silver paint on the tip- they are VERY clean and show no pull marks once loaded-- these are the cleanest ""pulls"" you will ever see as I clean them by hand after resizing.  My projectiles have been compared to new parts as they are that nice looking once loaded. These are ARMOR PIERCING so be aware where you live and/or shoot.  I have a case of mil surplus wc872 powder and all three bottles are from the same lot.  I use a Frankford Arsenal digital scale for even more accuracy and precision.  It is not possible to get either when using a “thrower” so every shell I load is 200 grain on the nose. This is the recommended starting powder load that several sources have indicted.  This load is a general shooting combination in the velocity range of 2500 to 2600 fps.  I will not claim these to be 1,000 plus yard sniper rounds.  If you want or need ammo with more powder and therefore more velocity and distance see my other sales.  These work fine for plinking and are a cheap round for practice at shorter and medium distance ranges.  I have two lots of 24 with the paint still on and two more lots of 24 without paint.  If you want quantity of 100 I will ship a mix of paint/no paint.  Please realize these bullets are also advertised elsewhere and here in other lots sizes so if they sell elsewhere I will have fewer to sell here and may have to amend my quantity.  I can ship a lot of 24 rounds in a flat rate $5 box and in a $12 flat rate box can fit 100 rounds easily.   Feel free to contact me via email on here but I am not a big texter.  I am also going to list some projectiles tonight to give more detailed photos for those who wish to see.  Thank you for looking.

I recently purchased a Serbu .50 cal and went overboard on reloading supplies and a Lee .50 Press Kit.  I have way too much and need to sell off some projectiles in lots of 100. The photos show my actual projectiles for sale.  I have over 300 projectiles lubed, sized, cleaned and ready to ship.   My projectiles are mil surplus/pulls 650 grain API which have been resized in my Lee .510 resizer for consistency.  Projectiles have all been cleaned to a shine and no longer have silver paint on the tip- they are VERY clean and show no pull marks once loaded.  Sized and polished projectiles are $.60 each and  I would rather sell in lots of 100, but might consider orders of 50.  Photos are mine taken at my kitchen table last week.  My cleaned projectiles get mistaken for new parts all the time.  These are the cleanest pulls you will ever see online.  NO marks visible once loaded.  These cannot be distinguished from M33 Ball ammunition and they have the same flight characteristics as other 650gn.  I am showing a cutaway for viewers to see how much copper jacket is actually on these.  Even the FMJ M33 projectiles are steel core and lead base sealed.  side by side they look the same.

Be over 21, and have a Florida Drivers License and be a non felon. I will fill out a bill of sale.

It features a black polymer frame with integral steel rails from Walther, a silver stainless steel slide and a ChromeMoly steel barrel: all machined and assembled in the USA. It retains the Walther ""Anti-Stress"" trigger with its short, consistent 5lb pull. The gun has three integral safeties and a manual decocker that can reset the single-action trigger to a firmer double action for added security making it one of the safest guns to carry or keep at home.

The frame comes with three switchable back straps to vary the size of the grip, a fully adjustable rear sight and five interchangeable front sights for varying elevation and windage. The MR9 comes with two 15-round magazines, a cable lock, and an injection-molded carrying case that keeps everything securely in place.

The MR Eagle Series from Magnum Research is a joint American/German effort featuring a black polymer frame with integral steel rails imported from Walther in Germany, a 416 stainless steel slide and a 4140 CrMo steel barrel machined in the USA and assembled and shipped from the Pillager, MN factory. The MR Eagle is a striker fire design and is available in two popular calibers, 9mm and the .40 S&W. Additional features include a fully adjustable rear sight for windage, three replaceable palm swells for various hand sizes and shooting styles, interchangeable front sight blades of different heights, hammer forged barrel, full Weaver style accessory rail and internal safety devices.

I recently purchased a Serbu .50 cal and went overboard on reloading supplies and a Lee .50 Press Kit.  I have way too much and need to sell off some ammo in lots of 100. The photos show my actual bullets for sale.  I have over 300 rounds cleaned, sized, primer crimp removed, primed and ready to load and ship.  All my shells are once fired Lake City brass which have been resized down to OAL 3.945” as needed.  All my projectiles are mil surplus/pulls 650 grain API which have been resized in my Lee .510 resizer for consistency.  Projectiles have all been cleaned to a shine and no longer have silver paint on the tip- they are VERY clean and show no pull marks once loaded.  These are ARMOR PEIRCING so be aware where you live and/or shoot.  I have a case of mil surplus wc872 powder and all three bottles are from the same lot.  I use a Frankford Arsenal digital scale for even more accuracy and precision.  It is not possible to get either when using a “thrower” so every shell I load is 220 grain on the nose. This  load is a great shooting combination in the velocity range of 2750 fps.  Since this is the same weight as an M33 Ball 650gn projectile the ballistics will be the same. I will not claim these to be 1,000 plus yard sniper rounds.  If you want or need ammo with more powder and therefore more velocity and distance see my other sales.  These work fine for plinking and hunting and for practice at medium distance ranges.  Please realize these bullets are also advertised elsewhere and here in other lots sizes so if they sell elsewhere I will have fewer to sell here and may have to amend my quantity.  Each lot of 100 rounds will be $275 and $15 to ship."

Newly refinished, about 25 layers of birchwood casey tru-oil.  There is wear on the rifle.  This is not a new rifle, but fires true.  If you use certain ammo, you will get misfires, misfeeds, and stovepipes.  This is a common issue for the 22 and Marlin.  I didn't like it but it's something I dealt with.  You can see the attached photo of the last time a youngster shot it on the range.  Pretty awesome job at 25 yds.

Just make me an offer and let me know what you have. Pictures will help. Worst I can say is no so let me know how much ammo and what kind you'd like in exchange for your gun. 

I am an Ohio resident, in law enforcement, have a ccw, and willing to sign a bill of sale. Thanks for looking."

Mossberg 835 in Woodlands Camo. Comes with 24 inch ported, vent-ribbed barrel. Bore, chamber, bolt, and other internals in very good shape. Also comes with 2 screw in Accu-chokes. One is extended, X-tra Full Turkey for lead shot only. Other is extra-full, internal, used for steel shot. 

I'm also including the pictured sling from Butler Creek. 

This has been a 100% reliable shotgun. It has never failed to cycle anything I've put through it, from light, target 2 3/4"" low brass loads to 3 1/2"" magnum turkey loads. This thing will eat through anything. I've used it for everything from clay pigeons to small game to waterfowl to deer. 

Action is silky-smooth. The gun is easy to disassemble, clean and reassemble. 

Make no mistake about it: This gun has been used. While she won't win any beauty contests, she will be a reliable companion for years, just as she has been for me. 

Price is $275, which is as low as you'll find this model shotgun on Armslist. Priced competitively for quick sale. 

Face-to-face transaction only. No shipping.

This is not the normal 625.  The regular production model of the Model 625 was introduced in 1989. In 1991–1992, a few were made with 3-inch barrels in .45ACP.  You’ll find plenty with 4” barrels, on up, but very few with 3” and none that I’ve found have the Eagle engraving.  This was sold as a Commemorative (but have not identified which just yet).  I requested the research through S&W and have the paper history.  It will come with Holster, Clips and 50 rds of ammo.  It is very accurate (notice sample of a 625-3 @15yds).

So it is unfired. I don’t have the box that it came with but I did save the label from it.  It comes with 2 magazines (30 rounds each), a lock and a manual. One magazine is still wrapped and needs a good cleaning. These magazines will hold the last round open. There’s no dings or scratches on it. It is a beautiful gun as seen in the pictures. It has great trigger pull (smooth and break cleanly). 

The price is $550.00 (cash please). No trade at this time.  I like to keep it but need to make room for other toys.

For sale is my early 1980s production Pre Ban H&K 91 chambered in .308 Win. This is not a clone, or a parts kit. Its the real thing, 100% H&K and built like a tank in Germany.

MFG date is 1982, making this gun 33 years old. Looks like it came out of the box yesterday.

All black furniture, and in 95%+ condition. Only marks are on the top of the receiver where a claw mount was attached, and a couple marks on the bottom of the hand guard where a bipod was attached. Other than that, pretty much flawless. Does not even have wear on the bolt, or receiver from brass being ejected.

I am the second owner of this rifle, and the previous owner stated that it had a couple of range trips on it. Nothing more. It definitely shows. Has been a safe queen. This was a collector/break the glass if needed piece for me.

Includes H&K Port Buffer (already mounted), 8 German made H&K mags, a nice Galati International mag pouch carrier, and a Swedish Army issue mag pouch also.

This is one of the most reliable guns ever made, and if I had ONE rifle for SHTF purposes... look no further. You just don`t see many of these in this condition anymore.
