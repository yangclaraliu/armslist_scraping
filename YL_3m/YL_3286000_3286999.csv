If you want the side plates they are $30.00 Each. I have 2 Versions of the plate carriers which is the Front & Back also Front/Back & Sides. Also have some side plates 6""x8"" Text or call Cody @ REDACTED or call 520-723-92five-five
(Please serious buyer's only)

I sell the plates by themselves they are $100 Each.
The size of these plate carrier vests are adjustable from ""Small to X-Large""
MIL-A-46100 steel is Military spec armor. MIL-A 46100 armor is used to stop high velocity projectiles (HVPs). This particular grade military spec armor steel is especially useful to protect structures or vehicles from sniper fire or any form of weapon that will emit the HVPs depending on the threat level, various thicknesses of steel may be required to protect vital organs.
The measurement of the plates are both
1/4"" and .393"" also not to mention tested by the US Army test labs.
I had ar500 plates but 46100 material is by far a lot better. Some people say AR500 are military steel but the military never uses ar500. I used a .308 rifle and a .223 at these plates at 36 and 50 yards. Then shot it with AK 47 50rnds, 5.56 30rnds, endless .357/9mm/45cal, 7.62x54R, .30-06 and a 300 win mag 3 times at 250yards, that did flatten the plate but still no penetration. Not to mention shot at it with a .45 handgun...still no penetration. This will not fail to disappoint as it this is one of the best quality steel out there. Ar500 is target material not to be used as body armor. This body armor with the 2 plates and the vest weighs a total of 12 pounds. I've shot at this multiple times with different rifles and Handguns and it still holds up. You could attach MOLLE gear to this vest such as your Hydration water Carrier, Rifle and Handgun Magazine pouches, Radio pouches, EMT Medical pouches and etc.

If you want the complete set of Front/Back & Side set with the carrier vest, 2 side plates, Front and back plates would be $300.00"

I originally purchased this handgun for my wife for home defense while I was out on business trips.  Unfortunately, she doesn't particularly care for its DA/SA control/firing method, and would rather have a larger version of her Glock G26.  So, this gun is for sale, or up for trade for a Glock G17/19/22/23 either GEN 3 or 4.  Would also consider a Smith and Wesson M&P in 40 S&W or 9mm (she likes her dad's M&P40c).

I will provide SIG's description of this particular weapon......

The SIG SAUER® SP2022® is the latest version of our popular polymer framed pistol and features a durable, lightweight and wear-resistant polymer frame with the added tactical versatility of an integrated accessory rail. The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by SIG’s black Nitron® finish. Available in 9mm, and .40 S&W. It also features the SIG SAUER four-point safety system. The SIG SAUER polymer framed pistols has earned an enviable reputation and proven track record of reliable performance in the hands of law enforcement professionals. In December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal awarded SIG SAUER a contract for 5,000 SIG SAUER SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm. 

And these excerpts are from a review on The Truth About Guns blog.......

The SP2022 may look a tad different than the P226 on the outside, but it bears a striking resemblance on the inside. The guns’ functions are identical, both in terms of trigger feel and the single action/double action mechanics. The grip shape is close enough for rock and roll. The SP2022′s slide’s general design and extractor echo classic SIG cues. But there are some distinct differences . . .

The first thing SIG aficianados usually notice: the SP2022′s grip. Unlike Yael Goldman’s cleavage, it’s made of plastic. While the SP2022′s polymer handle may not be as strong as steel who’s gonna break it? You? The SP2022′s significantly lighter than the P226 (a.k.a., ballistic boat anchor); suitable for everyday carry. The younger sib’s improved texture also makes it a lot more grippy.

The SP2022′s “chassis” is made of steel. The actual bits that move along the rails of the slide and keep the gun running are also metal, set into the grip. The SP2022 doesn’t have full-length rails like the P226, but again, do you need that level of build quality for non-special ops? And if you do, pay up. Meanwhile . . .

The SP2022′s slide stop extends past the trigger. That’s because the SP2022 uses a 1911-like system to hold everything together. The same pin that holds the slide stop in place keeps the barrel link and the slide together. The SP2022 also takes down much like a 1911; the slide stop comes out when you match up the right holes.

Another nifty feature: the improved decocker. It’s shorter, quicker, and feels a little better than the old version. SIG’s redesigned the magazine release in a Benelli-style triangle shape instead of ye olde SIG circle.

The DA trigger pull is 10lbs.  The SA trigger pull is 4.4lbs.  It's weight with a magazine is 29.0oz.  It's magazine capacity is 15 rounds of 9mm.  And it comes with 3-dot white-dot contrast sights.

SIG's MSRP for this weapon is $513.00, and you can usually find them for sale NIB for $450-600 depending on the slide, caliber, and sight configuration online or at your local gun store.

This gun has less than 150 rounds in it, and cleaned after each 50.

Also will come with an additional 15 round capacity magazine (it only came with one NIB from SIG when I bought it).

Would prefer to do any deal in Columbia, SC and avoid having to ship via FFL to FFL and all the headache, but will if you are serious.

Message me with any questions you have.

I will say, it is a pleasure to shoot, and has been pretty accurate with even bulk ammo.  Good little pistol, but the wife prefers her Glock.  I have never been a Glock guy, but they are dependable.........and ugly.  Lol."

from what i have read its a czech mauser, action made in 1925 and it was one of the last runs of the yr being that every letter of the alphabet had 9999 made (v9962) I definitely could be wrong. stock does not match numbers on action. Bore looks new no wear showing on rifling. Action is very smooth ( one of the smoothest I have ever felt) Gun was sanded down and re stained and then about 6 coats of polyurethane looks great. the only mark on it is on the buttstock had to big scratches they have been filled but the color is off. I bought this gun thinking I was going to be into older guns but really I like the new stuff so this just sits in the safe.

Here is a Romanian contract Model 1934 Beretta military pistol assembled in 1941, as indicated by the markings on the left side of the slide, and with two original WWII Beretta magazines. The back of the right side of the frame displays Romanian armory mark, ""CM"". 
NO import markings!
CONDITION: Excellent, with 97-98% of original blue still on the metal. All matching serial numbers (frame, slide, barrel). Fine bore with strong and shiny rifling. Very smooth action. Difficult to find pistol without the import marks! Caliber: 9 mm Short (.380 ACP, marked on barrel). Two WWII Beretta magazines with thin metal floor plates and no other markings, both in like new condition (as is the pistol!).

This Beretta model 1934 pistol offered here was manufactured for the Romanian military in 1941. In August of 1940, the Romanian military placed a contract with Beretta for 61,000 model 1934 pistols. This contract specified that the pistols were to be delivered within seven months. The first of these pistols was not delivered until February of 1941 due to the shortage of steel and Romania's failure to send Beretta the entire fund amount for the pistols. Beginning in February of 1941, Beretta delivered 10,000 pistols with the promise of 5,000 more per month until the total contract was filled. By August of 1941, Beretta had sent a total of 40,000 pistols, but the remaining 21,000 were never delivered. This means that there are less then 40,000 of these pistols in existence today. The first of these Romanian contract pistols can be identified with a 0(zero) at the beginning of the 5 digit serial number. The Romanian contract pistols are identical to the Italian model 1934 versions except that the slide is marked 9 SCURT instead of 9mm Corto as seen in the pictures below. These Romanian model 1934 pistols were normally issued to the Romanian officers

There are two regular 7 round mags and an additional +1 magazine. I’ve got the hard case and owner’s manual. 
The Crimson Trace Laserguard is about a year old. The box, instructions, stickers, and tools are included. It’s sighted in for about 50’. The laser is clear and bright, it just doesn’t get that much use. Includes the pocket holster from CT. 
The PJ Holster is IWB, tuckable, two-tone, and set for deep concealment. There’s a matching IWB magazine holder and black OWB magazine holder. The retention is great and the holster disappears nicely under a dress shirt or polo.  
The whole package makes a great EDC set up. I can use this holster concealed for work and family events without needing a cover garment. I’ve put about 300 rounds through since it came back from the factory. 
I'd consider trading for a Glock 26, gen 3."

Good beginner trap gun, would even make a nice addition to your fleet. Huglu makes this shotgun for Tristar, they are the same manufacturer of many CZ shotguns, and I believe they are manufacturing for SKB now (some of their products).

I love this pistol but my department is issuing Glock 42s, so I can't use it anymore.  My loss is your gain.  Pistol was $800 plus the accessories would cost aroun $1,000.  Sale price is $750. No trades wanted."

When I buy ammunition at Gander Mountain or Dicks Sporting Goods all they ask is your date of birth. I am a retired Deputy Sheriff with a photo ID that allows me to carry in all 50 states.

This is the gun that will revolutionize muzzleloading. It is the first of its kind to use an electronic ignition, making it the most-reliable, fastest-loading and easiest-to-clean muzzleloader ever made. The patent-pending ARC™ electronic ignition eliminates the need for a primer. The ignition is completely sealed from the elements and requires no flash hole, ensuring superior reliability no other muzzleloader can duplicate. No parts other than the barrel ever have to be cleaned because of fouling. The ignition is instantaneous, and since there is no pressure explosion, as there is with primer ignitions, there is no accuracy-robbing displacement of the charge. This allows a full, consistent burn of the powder charge at the bottom of the barrel. The trigger pull is incredibly clean because the trigger is actually an electronic switch. One 9-volt battery (included) will reliably fire the rifle at least 500 times, and the battery will last up to 600 continuous hours (25 days). All Electras are equipped with a premium Bergara barrel for tack-driving accuracy. Includes a 3-9x40 KonusPro scope with etched duplex reticle and Durasight rings and bases, a CVA soft case and a Quake Claw Contour Sling. .50 caliber only."

The Electra is the most innovative muzzleloader to ever hit the market. This is the gun that will revolutionize muzzleloading. It is the first of its kind to use an electronic ignition, making it the most-reliable, fastest-loading and easiest-to-clean muzzleloader ever made. The patent-pending ARC™ electronic ignition eliminates the need for a primer. The ignition is completely sealed from the elements and requires no flash hole, ensuring superior reliability no other muzzleloader can duplicate. No parts other than the barrel ever have to be cleaned because of fouling. The ignition is instantaneous, and since there is no pressure explosion, as there is with primer ignitions, there is no accuracy-robbing displacement of the charge. This allows a full, consistent burn of the powder charge at the bottom of the barrel. The trigger pull is incredibly clean because the trigger is actually an electronic switch. One 9-volt battery (included) will reliably fire the rifle at least 500 times, and the battery will last up to 600 continuous hours (25 days). All Electras are equipped with a premium Bergara barrel for tack-driving accuracy. Includes a 3-9x40 KonusPro scope with etched duplex reticle and Durasight rings and bases, a CVA soft case and a Quake Claw Contour Sling. .50 caliber only."

Couple things.  1st u must be extremely bored and unemployed if you have time to sit around and research everyones ad/price on armslist AND waste time emailing when u have no intention of doing business with them

Next....and I find this to be very common by people like you....you arent comparing apples to apples as neither rifle listed is the model I have. ADAMS like all mfg makes several models from entry level with lower grade parts to high end with premium barrels, bcg's etc. Is that a good price from Buds..heck yeah...does that have a thing in the world to do with me and someone else trading rifles?  Heck no. Fact is whatever they have can be bought for less today than even 2-3 months ago so if they want my rifle and I want theirs it doesnt matter if walmart has them for $9.99

I've had this for about two years now and I was never a great shot with it. It has a near perfect bore, which is quite shiny, and improved action. The action was improved to help cycle rounds better, and for most ammo I've used, it's quite smooth. There are some rounds that it doesn't like, but I've mostly used silver tip Bulgarian surplus (I've cleaned the rifle thoroughly after shooting to prevent corrosion). There are a few parts of the stock that were messed up from shipping, but if you wish to refinish the stock it would be easy. The rifle is a 1943 Izhevsk with the scope serial number matching the secondary serial number on the side of the receiver. The scope is in fantastic shape despite being almost as old as the rifle. It is Soviet made scope from Omsk plant 325 ""progress"", it has refubish mark on it and I think the mount is a reproduction. This is one of the earlier rifles imported from the Molot factory into the USA. Overall, the rifle is in fantastic shape and needs somebody to appreciate it more than I do. I will throw in a soft case and 20 rounds of Bulgarian surplus ammo. I will send additional photos upon request."

Competitive shooters have relied on the consistent accuracy of Sierra's MatchKings for decades, resulting in a history of state, national and world records that is the envy of our competitors. Sierra offers the widest selection of 30 caliber match bullets in the world today, producing bullets suited to nearly every form of long-range competition.

The 190 grain #2210 was introduced in the early 1960s, won its first Wimbledon match in 1964, and set a world record of 1153 out of 1200 at the Olympic games in Tokyo, Japan, that same year. This bullet is still a favorite for long-range competitors.

Sierra MatchKing bullets have set the standards worldwide for consistent accuracy in handguns as well as rifles. Since the introduction of the high performance Remington XP-100 and similar handguns chambering larger rifle cartridges, all 30 caliber MatchKings have been used in handgun silhouettes and long-range target competitions. Sierra's famous MatchKing design assures superb accuracy, flat trajectory, and high momentum delivery with low sensitivity to crosswinds at all ranges.

  One of my all-time favorites, the Mini 14 is rock-solid reliable, lightweight, simple to operate & maintain. The rear-set action allows for a very short overall length, and a very well balanced feel. The ""Tactical Model"" saw some improvements over the classic Ranch Rifle, namely in the shorter 16"" heavy barrel. We stripped off all the goofy ATI furniture(also included) & fitted it with a Hogue stock, to give it the classic feel. When we were growing up, we never ran the upper cover, helped the barrel cool faster. So that's how I like 'em, however if you want it, Choate makes a nice vented one that you can score for about $20 on Amazon.



   SAVE BIG!!! Add the venerable Aimpoint 9000SC optic for only $250!!! Will be mounted with the correct Ruger rings. Also included are std 1913 rail-rings if you decide to use it on something else. 

   This pkg deal is an awesome score! We were planning to use this for a full-custom build w/ engraved wood furniture, etc, but have decided to go with a stainless rig instead. Our indecisiveness is your gain!  :)

NEBO Tools is a leading supplier of innovative lighting products and tools. We are a division of Alliance Sports Group, a family owned company with headquarters in Grand Prairie, TX. 

NEBO PROTEC ELITE is a high-powered firearm flashlight and laser. The PROTEC ELITE emits 110 lumens of blinding light in a tightly focused beam with sufficient peripheral lighting as well. The PROTEC ELITE has four lighting modes: Light (110 lumens,) laser, light + laser and light in strobe mode. The water-resistant body is constructed from aircraft grade anodized aluminum. PROTEC ELITE comes with a pressure switch attachment that allows you to activate the light with total control while using the side switch to change light modes.

The PROTEC ELITE comes with a self-locking and adjusting mount that fits both a vented or plain barrel, no tools required. The clamp offers a 12.5 millimeter adjustment allowance. The barrel and flashlight portion of the clamp adjusts 20mm to 32.5mm. Adjustment is controlled by the side latch, just twist to adjust and lock. The side of the mount has an accessory mounting rail to attach additional firearm accessories. 

Features and Benefits:
- One high power LED bulb outputs 110 lumens of blinding light (bulb rated for 110,000+ hours of life)

  If you want a very lightweight AR-type carbine for plinking, hunting, etc without breaking the bank, here you go! Chambered in .223/5.56 with a stainless 16"" barrel, light enough to drag around without weighing you down. Not much else really needs to be said, it's not a rock-your-socks mil spec carbine, and it's also not an absolute pile of trash like the other polymer ""ARs"" on the market.

RM06 Trijicon RMR Tactical Red Dot Reflex Clone w/ Picatinny Rail Mount 

This is a brand new REPLICA of the Trijicon RMR RM06 Red Dot Sight. It has been developed to improve precision and accuracy with any style or caliber of weapon. This Trijicon Style RMR (Ruggedized Miniature Reflex) is made from forged aluminum and is designed to be durable, tough, and lightweight. This sight has a 3.25 MOA red LED that is powered by a standard CR2032 battery. It can last up to 4 YEARS depending on the brightness setting and the outside temperature that it is used at. The new easy-to-use adjusters with audible clicks allow for quick windage and elevation adjustments. It has 5 available brightness settings that can be manually adjusted by pressing the plus or minus buttons on either side of the unit. Aside from normal shooting, it is ideal for rapid-firing situations and/or shooting on the move. 
Why pay hundreds of dollars more (original RM06 = $696 + mount + shipping/taxes) for something that can be had at MUCH less cost! This is a VERY high quality sight that is made well and will last for a very long time! Check us out on facebook.com/fngtactical for more pics and details.

  Demo model of our flagship Series13 rig, the S13 Monster. This is the pinnacle of the Series13 5.56 line, beautifully balanced, accurate, and tough as nails. Recoil? Muzzle climb? Both reduced to almost nothing with this build. The stretched sight radius increases accuracy off the iron sights. Combined with this gun's ability to deliver multiple rounds in a tight group with blinding speed, the Monster is an example of a tool that will push your skillset to the next level, and improve your effectiveness as a shooter.

   This AR is still in great shape, and as with any demo guns we sell, you still get the same Lifetime Warranty as if you bought it from us brand new!

Fiber Optic Front Sight
Ultra Safety Assurance Action Trigger System
3.3"" Barrel
At only 1” wide, the XD-S™ features a low profile rear and fiber optic front sight, enabling easier and faster target acquisition.
A single-position Picatinny rail readily accepts lights, lasers or other pistol accessories. It is one of the only polymer pistols of this size that has this feature, which makes it an easy reach for the light or laser of your choice.

Combined, all of these design features come together to create a superior slim pistol. Though you can find slim designs in other guns, the XD-S™ provides the power of a .45 in a comparatively small package. The comfortable and Ergonomic Point and Shoot design also allows you to shoot naturally at eye level without adjusting your wrist to line up the sights. This striker fired pistol was designed to be an extension of your body, which naturally helps you shoot your best.

Pistol comes in original components package with additional 7 round extended magazine and (1) additional conceal carry holsters.
