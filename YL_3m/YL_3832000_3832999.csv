This piece has had about 30 rounds fired through it. Everything works perfectly. Shooter used Bore Butter and cleaned meticulously after use. Uberti made 44 caliber Walker revolving cap and ball. I chose 44-40 from the caliber selection list but this is meant to shoot up to 60gr powder and was the most powerful handgun of its day and for years. This model has a 9” barrel and definitely fills the holster. Case colored frame, brass trigger guard, beautiful engraving on the cylinder and deep bluing on the metal and American walnut handles. It is a challenge to find any flaws in the finish metal and wood (see pictures). Comes with box, a few round balls, Oklahoma Leather holster and powder flask. I can ship directly to you with tracking number and insurance for $29.00. Don’t miss out on this sweet piece of a nostalgic firearm. These go for about 450 new and this one is like new with box. Prefer cash but any trades will be considered. I won't respond to the absurd."

Great mid-sized gun with all the punch you can want, all the classic Sig functions, Sig quality, and designed for concealed carry.  I have both the DAK and SA/DA w/ de-cock versions of the Sig 239.  This one is the DAK ... the Dual Action Only (DAK) design that Homeland Security and other agencies have now gone to because they feel it's more safe and more dependable.

This gun was designed for those who love/depend on the functions of Sig's 226, 228, and 229 but is small enough to comfortably carry as either a backup or as an ""off duty"" concealed carry.

This is a single stack 40 so you get a 7 +1 in a very lethal round.  After all, if you cannot solve your problem with 8 rounds of 40, you need to spend more range time.

This gun is lightly used with holster wear and comes with two clips.  

I just have too many Sigs (yea, I know, how can a man have too many Sigs?) so I'm trying to cull the pile. 

Prefer FTF but will ship via my FFL at costs.   Cash, ID, and paperwork required.

Sig Sauer gave the discreet, all-metal P238 platform some 9mm muscle, and the result is the P938: the first 1911-inspired 9mm microcompact by SIG SAUER®. Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever all in familiar places.
A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed. With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 can pack six or seven plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame, depending on the magazine (this version includes both).
The SIG X38-TGL Trigger Guard Laser for the P938™ Pistol is a compact, lightweight, red pointing laser used for aiming. The X38-TGL combines pinpoint accuracy and rapid target acquisition with intuitive operation, in a form fitting package weighing only 1.0 oz.
◦Ambidextrous On/Off switches 
◦Compact form factor blends with the lines of the P238 and P938
◦Convenient low profile mounting
◦Windage & elevation adjustments

I may have a small quantity of 45 ACP, but I haven't decided if I want to part with it or not.

I do have .380s, but I just bought a 380 and will be reloading here in the near future. If you want a small quantity I might be able to work with you. Large quantities are out of the question on this one.
If you have any other caliber needs you can always ask. I have a bag full of miscellaneous calibers that aren't plentiful enough to be worth my effort to sort. If you are buying anything else I usually just throw those spare cases in for free.
I have a general idea of going prices based off local and online sales and will do my best to give you the most fair price possible. I usually throw in a few extra pieces in the event that a bad case snuck in. I have removed most of the ones that are unusable, but no one is perfect. Hence why I include extras. There may be a couple dented mouths, but they are usually not bad enough or creased ETC to where they are not easily useable. I try not to include anything I wouldn't reload myself. Cases may be cleaned or dirty. Some of the cases I got ambitious and ran them through, but the vast majority are just as I picked them up. I will be sure to divulge any information that I feel is pertinent to what you want to buy when you send me an email. I have sold a lot and have never had a complaint, so I know you will be happy.

For hunters and shooters looking to step up to an autoloader, the Mossberg 930 is the way to go. This gas-operated autoloading shotgun excels in every environment you do, from walking cornfields to sitting in stands to hunkering down in a marsh. Does pretty well in the check-out line, too. That's right, we managed to load the 930 Autoloader with features, without putting any extra strain on the price tag. 

The 930 handles 12-gauge, 2 3/4"" and 3"" ammunition with ease, from low brass target loads to non-toxic magnum rounds to the latest in sabot slug ammo. The smooth, contoured design and Mossberg Uni-Line receiver deliver instinctive eye/rib alignment for instant target acquisition. Each 930 includes a complete set of specially designed spacers for quick adjustment of the horizontal and vertical angle of the stock, bringing a custom-feel and fit to every shooter. A self-regulating gas system cushions the recoil. There's even an EZ-Empty magazine button when the day is done.

Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). 


The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

I’ve got a German made HK45C/CT up for sale. Includes the following:

HK45C/CT with threaded barrel
Small and medium back-straps
One 8 round flush fit magazine
One 10 round extended magazine
Two flush fit magazine base plates, great for concealed carry
Version 1 detent plate
Version 3 detent plate
Advanced Armament Corp thread protector
Crossbreed Supertuck IWB holster
Original HK plastic storage case and paperwork
HK factory safety lock

I’m not going to go into a ton of detail with a huge story because if you are looking at this, chances are you what it is! This is the German model, not the USA model, for those of you who are HK purists.

This has been my daily carry gun for the past couple years however the round count is pretty low. I would say that this pistol has less than 500 rounds threw it as I never actually fired it more than one or twice a year.

I had this posted at $1050.00 with everything a couple months ago and got a lot of good trade offers but the only thing I’m interested in is cash or a HK VP9. I see HK has a rebate going on right now so I’m going to lower my price to compete with that.

I would like to get $850.00 dollars OR best offer.  I will also trade for an HK VP9 that has the factory Meprolight night-sights installed.

Keep in mind this has a factory HK threaded barrel. Even with a rebate I don’t think you are going to find a better deal. Plus this is a German model, which is no longer imported.

These are very hard to find in stock.  It includes a Redfield Battlezone 6-18 power scope that has been mounted but not bore sighted or fired.  Comes with all boxes and paperwork for the rifle and the scope.  Needing the cash before Christmas.

Would make a great long range gun for someone.  The accutrigger makes the trigger very nice, and the accustock make the stock solid and almost as good as a bedded stock.  I do not get to go shooting anymore.

Rifle cost 599 after tax.  Scope cost 275. Rings were 50.  This rifle would cost 925 to put together not counting tax or shipping.
Will throw in 50 rounds of FMJ ammo as long as my asking price is met.

El Paso Saddlery Co.

Model:
Strongside Select with thumb break (OWB Holster)

Color:
Black.

Firearms: 
Made for Glock 17, 22. Fits 17, 19, 22, 23, 26, 27, 34, 35.

Also fits, just about any semi-auto pistol. Confirmed fittings with thumb break latch closed are Beretta 92 Centurion (tight fit), HK USP Compact. Confirmed fittings, but without thumb break, Springfield XD & XDS, HK VP9, HK P30.

Bought this as one of the first holsters I've ever purchased, but never actually worn it for longer than 5 minutes at a time. Thought I needed the level 2 retention with the thumb break, but quickly got turned on to Kydex hybrid holsters and never looked back to leather. Also, just found that the thumb break was unneeded for me since I typically carry concealed in a IWB holster.

Combined total time I've worn it is probably less than 2 hours. Photo below is taken from Midway's website just so you can see what it looks like."
