As a last ditch rifle, it doesn't have any of the cool guy Arisaka items like the aircraft sight, dust cover or monopod.  What is does have is a decent bore, intact wooden butt plate, decent action, and rudimentary sights made by genuine Japanese child slave labor.  The rifle is rough.  You can tell it was made by kids or others not skilled in the trade.  It's a part of history.  It would go nice with an earlier Type 99 to show the stark differences that an industry destroyed by war will make.  7.7 Jap is a bit hard to find so I haven't had a chance to shoot it.  I'm pretty sure a reloader could get the dies and make brass from 30-06 if so desired.  I just wanted it as a wall hanger."

 Beretta Px4 Storm Compact .40 S&W Pistol JXC4F21

 The Beretta Px4 Storm is a semiautomatic pistol designed for concealed carry and personal defense. Borrowing features from predecessors like the Beretta M9 and Beretta 92, it is rapidly proving itself as a suitable option for law enforcement (both on and off duty), private security forces, and responsible citizens. 

 The Px4 Storm comes in subcompact, compact, and full frame versions. Checkered grips on all models provide a sure grip in less than optimal conditions, and three backstraps (included with every pistol) can be swapped for comfort and fit. The design is based on that of the M9 and 92, and the Px4 Storm cannot be improperly assembled due to distinctive parts and one-way fit. 

 An ambidextrious safety (thumb operated decocking lever) prevents unintentional discharge in the event the gun is dropped. High capacity double stack steel magazines provide enough firepower for self defense and law enforcement. A non-glare coating on the slide resists corrosion and stands up to the abuse expected in the line of duty. 
•Caliber: .40 S&W
•Weight: 27.7 oz
•Action: Double/Single
•Safety: Ambidextrous Safety/Decocker, spring loaded, positively on or off
•Sights: 3-dot sight system
•Magazines Included: 2
•Magazine Capacity: 12 rounds 
•Grips: interchangeable checkered backstraps
•Slide Finish: bruniton coated steel
•Frame Finish: Black fiberglass reinforced technopolymer

I guess this could also be to accomodate a slightly longer frame. It is too small for a SP101, but I would guess it will take other small frame revolvers. My J-frames are all 17/8"" but with the open toe I would guess it will also take a 3 inch barrel. Holster under the left arm and speed loaders under the right.

~Cerakote Micro Slick is a dry-film lubricant that is able to withstand high temperatures and extreme pressures. The Micro Slick coating is able to lubricate, resist wear, and also act as an anti-seize agent while preventing galvanic corrosion or bonding of the metals.  Micro Slick is virtually unaffected by temperatures ranging from below zero to 1200 degrees Fahrenheit. When two adjoining surfaces are coated with Micro Slick it prevents surface-to-surface contact, which reduces friction and wear between the two surfaces. An example of this would be to coat a bolt carrier group on an AR 15 and the inside of the upper receiver. This combination would reduce the amount of friction between the parts and help the firearm to function more smoothly.

Micro Slick out-performs its competitors, such as Nickel Boron (NiB-X), Fail Zero, NP3, Titanium Nitride, etc. Because of this, Micro Slick is not only used on firearms, it is used on high performance vehicles as well, including vehicles in NASCAR."

This is a custom AR-15, utilizing billet upper and lower receivers and cerakoted Magpul FDE.  The rifle has about 300 rounds through it, and is every bit as accurate out to 200 yards (farthest I can shoot at my local range) as you would expect from a rifle built with a Black Hole Weaponry barrel.  The Geissele trigger makes it even more accurate.

Full auto Nickel Boron BCG
VLTOR/BCM Charging handle
Black Hole Weaponry Stainless Steel 16"" barrel, 1-8 twist, chambered for 5.56 NATO

Manufacturers Description: 

The TP9 is light weight, small size and rounded edges makes this a excellent choice for police agencies and militaries which need to have a support weapon carried in the dignitary or VIP protection role, normal patrol, special units, vehicle crew members, aviators or anyone. The only true Tactical Machine Pistol today for professionals that need a lightweight, compact, ambidextrous, and easy to use weapon which will fire the easy to find standard 9mm cartridge. 

The firing system is a simple operation, which means no gas tube to have clogged or locking piece to lose. It is a very clean weapon to shoot; tests of over six thousand rounds can be fired before it effects the functioning. The super light recoil impulse of this weapon is a very easy, comfortable and user friendly weapon to shoot. That is especially appreciated by many agencies, which are hiring a greater number of women and small stature male officers.

I also have some conceal carry holsters that I would love to add to the deal for a great price. (See below for details.)

This single-owner micro 9mm served me very well as my conceal carry pistol for several years and is in excellent condition with almost no visible wear. It was cleaned and lubricated after each use and/or every 2 weeks (currently has Glock-style copper-based ""grease"" on the slide rails). As per manufacturer suggestion I fired approximately 
300 rounds to break it in, plus another 200-300 during later trips to the range. It is crazy accurate and has never had a misfire, jam or other malfunction (not even while breaking it in, actually).

For $550 you will receive the following items:
* Kahr PM9 in original box, with all original materials.
* 2 6-round mags, and 1 7-round mag with extended base plate (2 of these came with the pistol; the third is a Kahr factory mag.)
* Pearce Grip extensions (2) for all (non-.45) micro Kahr models (in original packaging; currently not attached to any of the mags)

SORRY, NO TRADE OFFERS, PLEASE!

I also have the following PM9-specific holsters for sale; these are NOT included in the $550 price, but I will gladly add them for the following great prices:
* DeSantis - Nemesis Pocket Holster (Kahr PM9-specific) - $10
* CrossBreed Holsters - MiniTuck IWB Holster with height- and angle-adjustable metal belt clips (I can't remember if it's cowhide or horsehide; the inner side is the same smoothness and color as the exterior) - $50
* CrossBreed Holsters - Tuckable IWB Mag Carrier (holds 1 mag, older-style ambidextrous design) - $30

Brand-new this would go for about $1000 for the lot; if you buy all of the above I'm only asking for $640, which I think is a mighty fine deal given that it's an entire conceal carry package for one of the best micro pistols out there.

I got it at an estate sale from a guy who dad died and was selling all his possessions ...the sword Weighing just under four pounds, the slightly curved blade measures 35"" long with a width of 1 1/16"", a 27½"" wide fuller and a 19"" long narrow fuller. Blade has stamping in a four-line Ames Company mark. Markings read ""Made by / AMES MFG. CO. / CHICOPEE / MASS"" with all letters within a scroll pattern. Obverse ricasso has stamped ""U. S. / J.T. (?)/ 1860"" stamp. Look at my pictures and you can see it..there's some rusty stuff covering up the lettering but it's there.. I'm not going to but steel wool would remove it to show the stamping..I used photo editing to show stamp ting better ..I did noting to refurbish it it is as I bought it...The steel blade exhibits scattered areas of dark, age discoloration and pinprick rust pitting overall. Blade wears a pleasing, dusky gray patina and appears to have there are some nicks on the blade but not to bad. Brass retains a dark mellow, bronze patina with some surface grime and nick and scratches on it overall. The center-swell wooden handle is covered with original black bridle leather and thin, double twisted brass wire wound around the grips. Leather wraps are peeling and show it age..hope pics are clear enough .Brass wire tight and in fine condition. Cavalry saber exhibits a brass pommel cap in the Phrygian design, common on all M1860 sabers. Pommel brim has no inspector marks visible.

Strong, steel scabbard is unadorned and has acquired a dark, almost plum colored patina with scattered areas of old rust pitting overall. A good steel wool would do wonders I bet, but in not going to.Sword mounts are tight and retain the original suspension sword rings. Steel scabbard shows three or four small dents overall. I read that the soldier carrying the sword would put dents on purpose in the scabbard to help keep the sword from rattling when moving..there's scattered spots of old rust pockmarking. Scabbard had no inspector stamp. Starting this auction at one buck! Any questions please ask

History update
This well-used specimen is a classic Civil War Federal edged weapon that was referred to as the ""light cavalry saber"" by the US Ordnance Department. Saber is one of those rare, early Ames contract, pre-Civil War Model 1860 cavalry pieces stamped ""1860. 1,200 Model 1860 light cavalry sabers contracted in 1859 were shipped south to Virginia on orders from then Secretary John B. Floyd, himself a Virginian. Blades were all stamped with 'US' inspector marks and dated '1860"

I bought it new at the end of 2012 and since then have only put about 2-3 hundred rounds through it. This one is pre-recall but I will forward buyer's info to Springfield after the sale. The reason I haven't dealt with the recall myself is because I live in spearfish and their only shipping option is fedex. Nearest drop location for me is in rapid city and fedex has never been successful delivering to my home or PO box in the past so I don't want to risk losing a $500+ item.  Included with the gun is the original case and accessories with instructions, two 5rd mags. I'mean also including a $40 old faithful IWD holster and 495 rounds of ammunition worth over $150. I feel that $550 is a reasonable asking price when considering the extra ammo and holster minus the inconvenience of the recall. (pistol shoots fine, just have to be conscious of what the recall is for, potential double-fire or firing while chambering a round. Neither of these has happened to me). Please don't low ball me as I do not need the money and do not need to sell, just trying to empty out storage space incase I move in the future.

A short reach from the backstrap to the trigger creates a comfort level that will challenge any standard-sized, striker-fired pistol available today.
