I don't need to sell it, but if something's right, I wouldn't feel too bad about letting it go. I purchased this rifle in 2012 at the Roanoke gun show for $99. After owning it for a couple of months, I bought a second which had more historical value to me, so I played a bit with this one. It has a Boyd's thumbhole stock, custom scope mount and NC Star 2-7x 32mm scout scope. I used this combo to shoot sporting clays laying on the backstop at the local public ranges at 100 yards with surplus ammo.

My total investment into this gun is ~$300. I'd like to break even. The gun is not counterbored. I'll give you the original stock as well, if you'd like it. 

Cash price is $300, but I'll also accept trades - I am looking for a CCW, and prefer the S&W line. I'd love either a M&P Sheild in .40, or S&W Bodyguard in .380. I'd entertain other trades, but those are my preferred. I'm in Roanoke, would be willing to travel a little, depending on the circumstance. Best contact method is through the PM system, as the email it generates will follow me to my cell.

The unpleasantries: I am not shipping anywhere.  F2F transactions only.  I will be asking to look at ""good boy"" credentials.  You will be signing a very basic bill of sale.

No type 53's.

I'm at work all the time so please email, or you can text 910sixfivezero3292. .

$25each
Loaded with Hornady's popular V-Max polymer tipped bullet, SUPERFORMANCE Varmint ammunition is filled with proprietary propellants that increase the velocity ratings 100 to 200 feet per second compared to other popular brands. Because there is no increase in pressure, regardless of the caliber, there is no increase in felt recoil but there IS an increase in efficiency and high speed performance. Plus, SUPERFORMANCE Varmint loads are versatile and will perform flawlessly in all rifles, including semi-autos. 

Hornady's V-Max Bullets feature a polymer tip which enhances accuracy and promotes devastating expansion. The tip raises the ballistic coefficient for faster velocity and helps to stabilize the bullet in flight. It also acts as a wedge, initiating bullet expansion. The copper jacket provides the necessary bearing surface for maximum stability out of the barrel, and the jacket is built to withstand the fast twist rates of the most advanced varmint rifles.

I bought this as a spare a few months ago just in case two of my kids wanted to shoot at the same time (I have a bunch of AR's including another 15-22), and now realize that I just don't need it.  These things are an absolute blast to shoot - good for hours on the range shooting zombies or out on the farm plinking.  This would make an awesome Christmas present for some lucky kid out there, and I'd love to see it go to a good home.

I live in Holly Springs, but will make the transfer at Fuquay Gun & Gold.  They're great guys, and I trust them with every aspect of my business - including transfers.

Great for hunters, trappers, or those wishing to escape the zombie apocalypse. Just to prove how bad-ass they are...Stallone used one to take out a helicopter in Expendibles 2! Seriously though...I have two of them and they are a lot of fun. I can't justify needing both, as my wife and kids are scared of them. But I will be keeping one...forever.

Engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or available SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly.

Would love to trade for a CZ P-06, HK USP Compact, possibly a springfield xdm in OD green .40. I also have approximately 500 rounds of ammo to go with in trade for .40 ammo. 

The P-01 is a compact, alloy-framed decocker model with light rail.

SKU: 91199.
Categories: 75 Compact 
Product Description

The P-01 9mm (accompanied by the P-06 in .40 S&W) was designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame made it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public. Recently, the factory decided to upgrade the slide stop spring which in turn means the current models may not carry the NSN"

It has a couple of excellent upgrades for reliability. (1) Murray's spring loaded firing pin. New style, won't break. (2) Wolff mainspring - again for reliability and certain ignition.

Yugo SKS's are not even in the same league as a Chinese SKS, and I like them better than the original Russian ones too. The stocks fit Americans and are longer than either Russian or Chinese stocks. They aren't seemingly made for midgets. The finish is super on them - especially the unissued ones like this.

This is a Model 59/66 A-1. So it is the highest evolved SKS. The integral grenade launcher also acts as a flash suppressor. the pop-up front and rear night sights are present. It has its original folding bayonet. the rifle is all matching including the original teak stock, and the magazine and trigger guard. The cleaning kit is present in the butt.

My son and I regularly shoot this one at (and HIT) an 18 inch steel plate at 500 yards with it. It is extremely accurate for an SKS. Not a toy. It is also a collectible rifle as well as a practical one. Ammunition for these is something on the order of $5.89 for a box of 20 at Walmart or Sportmen's Warehouse. 

The rifle's condition is virtually mint, and there are no dents, dings, or scratches on it. 

Price is $400, or I might take an interesting trade or partial trade on it. You will like this SKS. 

Contact me through Armslist and we'll get together for you to see it in Santa Fe. I will be willing to ship to your FFL as well for an additional $25 on receipt of payment should that be better for you."

Would love to trade for a CZ P-06, HK USP Compact, possibly a springfield xdm in OD green .40. I also have approximately 500 rounds of ammo to go with in trade for .40 ammo. 

The P-01 is a compact, alloy-framed decocker model with light rail.

SKU: 91199.
Categories: 75 Compact 
Product Description

The P-01 9mm (accompanied by the P-06 in .40 S&W) was designed for LE and Military duty, but its compact size and the reduced weight due to its forged alloy frame made it ideal for discrete carry as well. Equipped with a decocker, the P-01 provides convenience for those who prefer hammer-down carry. The P-01 was the first CZ model to benefit from updated manufacturing technology at CZ’s Uhersky Brod factory. The components of the P-01/P-06 are completely interchangable with every other P-01/P-06, with no individual fitting required. This required some very careful re-design so that the reliability and accuracy were not impaired. Since the time of its introduction (designed in 2001, NATO-approved in 2003) the production upgrades have been rolled out to most of the CZ 75 family and several new rifle models as well. The 1913 accessory rail easily accepts any of the industry-standard lights and lasers to assist low-light use. After 3 years of some of the most aggressive small arms testing ever, the CZ P-01 won the honor of replacing the CZ 75s previously used by the Czech National Police. Reliability:  The U.S. Army “Mean Rounds Between Failure” (MRBF) requirement is 495 rounds for 9mm pistols. During testing of the CZ P-01, the average number of stoppages was only 7 per 15,000 rounds fired. This is a .05% failure rate or an MRBF of 2142! For many years, the P-01 carried an NSN engraved on its frame, making it the first NATO-spec pistol ever available to the public."

This guitar is brand new minus sitting in the gig bag for a few years, very seldom played. Stock single coil pickups by Seymour Duncan in the Neck and Middle positions and a Seymour Duncan '59 Humbucker in the Bridge. 5-way selector switch with separate volume and tone knobs. Includes the original gig bag. Made in Canada. Bought new in June, 2012 and only selling because I mostly play classical guitar with a 2"" wide neck and couldn't adjust to the smaller electric guitar neck width. Save money on a like new and solid built guitar that has a great rock sound from the Humbucker in the Bridge and a cleaner blues & jazz sound from the single coils at the neck and middle positions. Paid $769.00 new - can show the original receipt. Get a like new guitar that is priced to sell !
I reduced the price from $550 to $450 firm, to get this sold. A great deal to save $320 on a mint condition guitar.

  I have a pristine Pre-Ban COLT AR-15 SL in .223/5.56 which I am looking to sale or trade. Willing to sell for 1,1oo.oo CASH or trade for the value of 1,3oo.oo. These will not lose value and can only go up unlike all the other RRA, S&W, Aero and DPMS which depend on being full of ""tactical"" mods to sell for more(just saying). I have fired many, built some of my own and can tell you this COLT is on-point and very accurate compared to most of the competition. Take in mind, I am not bashing on other AR's, its just the value that I am pointing out..

  So, here is what I am looking for - A Ruger GP100, Security 6, Mini-30, M1A/M1 Garand(CMP), Tactical Benelli SuperNova, Glock 17 or AK-47(NO single stack or VZ) and we can negotiate price/value of either/or depending on what is at hand and condition. Also, take in mind the AR is also in TOP shape, has been a safe queen and will also come with EXTRAS like upgraded Hogue grip, quad-rail, Magpul angled grip, six position stock, all the original parts and with extra Factory mags. Low-ball offers will not be given the time of day, many of you know what you are getting, look up the price's and see what they're selling for and where the market is for collectors of these- this one is priced to sell.  And don't forget - If its not a Colt, its a copy.

You want a rifle for suppressor use that will handle those Aguila 60 grain subsonic rounds with ease.  This is the rifle for you.  It also will shoot standard 40 grain bullets well also, but accuracy with the hyper velocity light weight loads like CCI Stinger will not be stellar."

I've put close to 10,000 rounds through it and noticed a slight bulge in the barrel . I've never had a squib and have personally put most of the rounds through the gun . I  contacted beretta and they said it was common with barrels towards the end of their life . Not sure how I did it with 10,000 rounds, i think theyre rated for over 30,000 rounds and I haven't even put many hp through it . But I don't shoot it anymore so I've factored a new barrel and new recoil
Spring into the asking price cash only and not willing to travel  .Also , the rifling looks perfect . Typically you'll see a dark spot where the bulge is located but the rifling looks brand new which leads me to think there was some sort of defect in the barrel to cause it to start to fail
Prematurely . I had a gunsmith friend of mine look it over and shoot it . He said it wasn't an issue . The only reason I even mention the barrel is so you know exactly what your getting and so there's no surprises once the deals been made . There's no cracks or signs of stress in the slide or frame either . The recoil spring was replaced at about 6,000 rounds so it'll probably need a new one soon .
It's in good condition other than than the mentioned problems . Some small scratches in the finish as well comes with 2 mags ( us made model ) no trades I need the money for Christmas gifts .

The only reason I'm doing this right now is to pay for repairs on a vehicle that was in an accident mid last week, so I'm not going to be able to entertain any trade requests or drop the price as I'm already losing almost $200 to sell it quickly.  First things first, here are the specs on the 1911 from the factory:

Caliber: .45 Auto
Magazine: 7+1
Barrel: Stainless
Twist: 1-16 LH
Overall Length: 8.5""
Overall Height: 5.5""
Trigger Pull: 3.5 - 5 lbs.
Finish: Satin Black Oxide
Grips: Double Diamond Walnut
Avg. Wt. (oz.): 38.5
MSRP: $729.00

With that said and done I'll tell you that a lot of time and energy has gone in to this weapon since I received it a month ago in trade, including a trigger job.  The feed ramp has been polished, the barrel has been polished and throated.  The base of the firing pin stop has been polished.  The trigger bow has been polished and the trigger channel deburred.  The sear and disconnector have been deburred and polished on the surfaces that required it.  The sear spring has been polished and adjusted slightly.

With all the smithing out of the way on to the Wilson Combat parts that were fitted and installed: hammer, wide competition thumb safety, competition match trigger, beavertail.  It comes with Pearce Grip rubber side panel grips.  This firearm also has a match grade barrel installed in it.  All in all what I have in to this weapon is nearly $950 when all things are said and done, not including what you'd normally spend on a gunsmith to do a trigger job and polish all the internals. which can easily be $75-150 depending on who you use.  The only flaw is a small scratch next to the magazine release from the previous owner, but I had eventually planned to cerakote the frame in FDE and toss desert digital grips on it, so it didn't bother me.  It has just about 200rds through it and it can run everything I put in to it.  It's run Federal aluminum, TulAmmo steel, Winchester white box, and Remington gold saber without a single hiccup.  This weapon is a super reliable tack driver now and would be great for home defense or EDC.  I'm former law enforcement and do some firearm instruction and I would trust the lives of my family to it, it's that reliable.

I'm asking $750 out the door for this weapon and it will come with all the original stock parts, hard plastic Remington case, and two 7rd magazines.  I will also require a valid FL driver's license and a bill of sale to be signed to protect both parties.  If you have any questions or would like to see more pictures, please contact me.  If you're going to offer less than I'm asking or to trade, please don't waste either of our time, this is a heck of a deal and it makes me sick to sell my project gun, but need outweighs toys.

Have a good one!"
