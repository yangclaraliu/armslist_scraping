Read Their Fine Print!! This Listing is for One Factory Brand New in the Hard Case Beretta M9 9mm Semi-Auto Pistol with 2 15 round magazines. Factory Part # J92M9AOM This gun comes with DAVIDSON'S LIFETIME REPLACEMENT GUARANTEE!! Factory Description = This legendary semiauto handgun has not only won the historic contract with the US military in 1985, but has achieved a triumphant contract renewal after more than two decades of hard use in the world’s toughest and most extreme conditions, from the scorching deserts of Iraq to the frigid heights of the Afghan mountains. A contract renewal after this kind of use and abuse means a product that has kept its promises--and then some. Simply put, there is no pistol today that is as durable, reliable, dependable, easy to use, safe and accurate as the Beretta M9, the handgun that has rightfully earned the nickname of “World Defender.” When we talk US military standards, we talk hard numbers, not opinions. The M9 has been put through impossibly-rigorous durability and reliability tests that greatly exceed any kind of real-life situation--and it has passed them all with flying colors. For instance, it will keep functioning in temperatures as low as -40 F and as high as +140 F, and it consistently fires over 35,000 rounds of commercial ammunition before a failure. It will keep functioning reliably even after being buried in the sand or snow, or being repeatedly dropped on hard surfaces like asphalt or concrete. Beretta’s engineering experience and the quality of the steels used enable this kind of reliability, on which America’s servicemen and women depend every day.  Another official test that the M9 had to pass was at the firing range. Even here, the demands of the US military far exceed most conditions in which a handgun is used--and even here, the M9 delivers. As per government testing guidelines, this pistol is capable of firing 10-shot groups of 3 inches or less at a distance of 50 meters (approximately 55 yards), with consistency and reliability. With other brands and models of premium pistols, this kind of accuracy may only be attained with extensive (and expensive) modifications and customization with after-market parts, while the M9 offers it right out of the box. The M9 offers a variety of tactical features that make it equally safe, easy to use and dependable in the holster of military personnel as well as for home or personal defense. Its reversible magazine release enables the use of either hand for tactical magazine changes, while its ambidextrous safety-decocker makes the pistol flexible for right- or left-handed persons or for shooters trying out different gripping or shooting styles. Its Bruniton finish with military-style markings is highly resistant to sweat and corrosion, and after shooting, a tool-free disassembly latch makes it simple and quick to take the pistol apart for cleaning. These and countless other useful features make the M9 the choice of the US military, as well as individuals wanting the absolute best for sport or self-protection.

I made a mistake trading for this- I shot it again and I just don't like .40 cal.  $525 for everything you see here!   That's buying the glock for $367.50 and paying Internet pricing for the ammo. Your getting the recoil spring and mag rebuilds free. I'm taking a beating on this so if it doesn't sell soon I'm going to just trade it in. 

   For sale is a gen 3 glock 27. It comes with three 9 round mags,a brand new 15 round mag,and 2 older restricted LE/govt. only mags.I replaced the springs in the older ones to make them reliable. I will include one of the X grips shown.  I also put a new factory recoil spring assembly in the pistol. I have 5 brand new boxes of federal HST 165 grain ammo at
$27.50 a box-this is some of the very best self  defense ammo you can buy, and 2 boxes of blazer practice ammo at $20 a box. This is exactly what I paid for it.. I took this pistol in trade and bought  all the springs and extras with the intent of keeping it. I shot 150 rounds through it and it was 100 percent reliable - turns out I don't like .40 caliber.  This was a backup gun for a retired local police officer and was carried everyday- it does show holster wear. Pistol and mags is 475, and ammo is priced as above. Will not sell the pistol without  the ammo but I will sell the ammo first if you need some- it's an excellent price.  Only trades I would be interested in are gen 3, 9 mm. Glocks with equal ammo trade. Face to face only at my shop in Dixie manor. ID and signature required. Please no silly offers- I'll just keep it and practice with it before giving it away.

This upper was built with only the best components.   It runs great and it is incredibly light weight.  It is very fast and it feels amazing.  You will be surprised every time you pick it up.  The mid-length gas system is very soft shooing.  It includes a standard A2 style flash hider but if you use a quality comp, like the PWS556 or BattleComp, etc… then it turns this already amazing rifle into a flat, fast, tack-driving, machine.

I have tested 55gr, 62gr, and 77gr factory ammo.  It all shot great.  This upper has fired approximately 100 rounds of each (300 rds total).

Ok guys I've been toying with the idea of selling my Rock River Arms LAR-15 for a while. I recently finished building an AR-15 for my wife and now I want to build myself a custom one (not to mention I just bought a Sig Sauer today). So here it is, first I bought it from Barking Irons Firearms based out of Prairieville, Louisiana on July 6th, 2013 after I got home from deployment. It costed me 1026$ which for a RRA is the norm. It came with a full A2 rifle stock which is still on it. I did switch out the flash suppressor for an A1 style (XM-16E/M-16A1 style) as well as the pistol grip is from a XM-16E/M-16A1. I also removed the handrail and put a free float UTG handrail on it. It has an A2 style gas block/front sight and a flat top upper receiver that has a Magpul BUIS on it that I got the same day I bought the rifle. The rifle is completely mil spec. I'll go over the specs:

16"" HBAR MIDLENGTH - approx 500rds through it since I bought it w/ A1 compensator
Flat top upper with M4 style feed ramps
Lower is well a lower, mil spec trigger, just has a A1 pistol grip
Handguard is a UTG and I forget the exact model but its midlength


Great shooter. Anyone who owns a Rock River Arms knows its a great gun. I just want to do myself a custom build thats all. Nothing is wrong with the gun internally or externally other than normal wear scratches. I was going to keep it for a long range platform but decided to go another route and do another CQB rifle. I'll let 2 30rd mags go with it as well as what ammo is in those mags so you basically have 60 ""free"" rounds to see for yourself. Me and my wife are going out to C2 shooting range in Pungo this thursday (Oct 23) probably for a family fun day. If you would like to meet us there and try it out you're more than welcome to all you have to do is pay your own range fee and any other ammo you want to put through it. I really don't want to let her go (yes its a she, her name is Piper) but its time for something different in my life AR-15 wise. 

Call or text Charles at 225-two8one-0106 for pictures
I work 5-12 Sunday-Thursday so I cannot take calls during those days/hours

I also have an M1 carbine if interested I can do a twofer, it'll just be a little more expensive and your wife/husband or whoever will be a little more pissed. Its not really in pristine firing mode unless you stain the wood, and reassemble it. It just did get reparkerized so. if you'd like, 1250$ for both OR $900 for JUST THE AR-15

The M1 is National Ordnance that I got in a trade for my 1911 once upon a time. Solid gun, shot once from a 30rd mag and had two hangups due to using Tula steel cased ammo. Not sure on round count but there is still some rifling in the barrel."

The stock is in excellent condition and shows no signs of being refinished, no cracks no heavy marks at all and the checkering is clean, a beautiful piece of wood. Swivels and sling are in great shape too and are included.

The barrel appears all original in finish, there are a few very very thin scratches in a few places but overall shows wonderful. The stampings are clean and show well, this gun has a very low serial number of 1073. Redfield rear sights are in good working conditions and markings are clean and ratchet clicks work fine. Front sight is original and in great condition. 
There are three H&R magazines, (2) ten rounders and (1) 5 round all of which seem just fine and engage and disengage properly. 
The inside of the barrel shows nice and shiny and clean of defects to my eyes. The cocking plunger and trigger mechanism and safety function fine in dry firing. There are little to no signs of any corrosion showing internally on parts, there is still some crud to be cleaned. I don't know of any missing parts. I will point out that there is some minor distortion to the trigger guard flat area (against stock) where the trigger protrudes through. This is the 'old' style trigger guard and all components on this gun to the best of my knowledge are original. If anyone sees that I am wrong or have misinformed please let me know, I am not an expert by any means. 
I will ship to your FFL in CONT US at your expense and will properly and safely package the gun. I recently sold a few very nice Winchester rifles here and this rifle is another from the same collection. 
I am open to discussion so don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or offers to consider. Monies going toward a reloader or another pistol, thanks!"

I believe this might need some minor repair as the cylinder slides back when opened to eject spent cartridges, doesn't affect the firing or functioning of this gun but thought it was worth mentioning. It locks up tight--timing is good 6'' barrel is bright and shinny and double and single action both work fine. The revolver overall looks nice and wood grips in very nice condition with wrong screw to secure grips, Im sure getting different grips for it won't be that hard. This revolver is being sold in ""as is condition"" because of its age and reputation, I own many of these Rohm revolvers and they never given me a problem.

The new FNS features a highly-ergonomic frame design that includes an ultra-low bore axis to reduce felt recoil and two interchangeable backstraps to personalize the grip fit to the user. A MIL-STD 1913 underframe rail is standard for light attachment and an aggressive checkering grip pattern improves control under the harshest shooting conditions. The new FNS is fully ambidextrous, allowing the user to access and activate the manual thumb safety levers, slide stop lever and magazine release button with either hand from either side of the pistol. This ambidextrous design not only helps adapt the pistol to the user it makes the FNS easier to train on, qualify with and use effectively under stress. Standard features on the FNS include a hammer-forged stainless steel barrel, a forged stainless steel slide with front and rear cocking serrations, a full-length stainless steel recoil spring guide rod and FN's exclusive low-profile Deep-V three-dot night sights. The FNS-9 offers a 17-round magazine capacity and the FNS-40 holds 14 rounds, both come standard with three magazines and a locking hard case.

If you arent familiar with the pm9, it is about the lightest 9mm pistol you can get. Great for carry options and the walther match grade barrel makes the accuracy awesome. Thanks for looking."

This is an awesome package. The 100 rd break-in procedure was followed exactly as recommended and the round count is 140. I originally purchased it for hog hunting but am moving out west so I need something different now. This rifle is essentially brand new, other than the break in which as you know would cost in excess of $100 to do yourself.

I would consider trades (full or partial) for the right hunting rifle or high end scope. No caliber less than .308 and 300wm or bigger must have a removable compensator."

527,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3626527,For Sale:  Barnett Vengeance RTH Package,"Appleton, Wisconsin, United States",$ 900,"Listed On: Sunday, May 27, 2018",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"***NIB*** Barnett Vengeance Reverse Limb RTH Crossbow Package The Barnett Vengeance represents a quantum leap in crossbow evolution. It is the first crossbow to combine a lightweight CarbonLite Riser with reverse draw technology. In this radical new reverse draw configuration, the limb pockets are moved closer to the trigger assembly and the limbs face forward on the bow, thus shifting the center of gravity closer to the shooter’s body. This drastically reduces the weight at the front of the crossbow, which is essential for a well-balanced shot. The most technically advanced riser ever created for a crossbow, the CarbonLite Riser removes approximately 43% of weight from the riser, which dramatically shifts the balance point to the shoulder. The combination of the reverse draw design with the CarbonLite Riser allows the Vengeance to provide the steadiest and most accurate shot possible. Decorated in a carbon fiber finish or in a high-definition camouflage, the Vengeance is available through retailers as a complete package with crossbow, quick detach quiver, three 20” arrows and an illuminated 3x32 Multi Reticle Scope. Features 43% Lighter Riser with our Patented Carbon Riser Technology Reverse-Draw Technology Adjustable Pistol Grip CROSSWIRE® String and Cable System 18"" Axle to Axle The package comes with: Premium Illuminated Scope Rope Cocking Device Cross Carbon 3 Arrow Quiver 3 20"" Headhunter Arrows Ed's Boat Sales & Outdoor Superstore is a stocking retail dealer so please contact with confidence.

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil. The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

If this pistol is still available by December 4th, I will be adjusting the price upward to reflect the additional time & driving the visits to a FFL will entail. 

UPDATE: Since it appears that I will end up selling the pistol on Gunbroker & not wanting the hassle of shipping ammunition, I sold the ammo (mostly +P) & lowered the price for local sale. 

Colt Government model Mk IV Series 70 in rare 9mm Luger caliber. Comes with genuine Colt carrying case, original Colt owner’s manual, five genuine Colt stainless steel magazines & one original Colt blued magazine. as well as an old military style leather holster (stamped on flap with “US”) in black.  

To be fair to everyone, I'm not desperate, so ""low-ball"" offers will not be considered. In addition, neither am I interested in ""parting-out"" & selling the items separately. 

Trades? I certainly appreciate the offers, but I'm not really interested in motorcycles or boats (in the Winter in the PNW?) nor an AR, AK etc. I would consider a Ruger Blackhawk convertible (38, 357 & 9mm) or (45 LC & 45 ACP) that are available NIB for around $600 (pistol, shipping, fees & tax) on the Internet.

 The polymer magazine that revolutionized magazine technology for the AR-15/M16/M4 platform just got even better. The third-generation PMAG further expands the strength, reliability, and versatility of the original PMAG. Along with all variants of the AR-15/M16/M4, the GEN M3 is fully compatible with the HK® 416 and MR556A1, M27 IAR, British SA-80, and even the FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S. It’s molded from a polymer formula that delivers distinctly greater resistance to crushing and all forms of impact, with extra reinforcement in the mag catch and feed lip areas. A new-design four-way anti-tilt follower ensures even smoother feeding, even when contaminated by dust or grit. Pop-off dust cover, included, helps minimize debris intrusion and prevent damage during storage. The removable floorplate is both stronger and slimmer for easier side-by-side carry in tight mag pouches. A pen dot matrix on each side allows consistent ID marking that resists handling wear. PMAG 30 is available with plain, solid sides or a clear polymer window on each side that lets you see the load status at a glance. Windows are made from an all-new, advanced clear polymer formula that offers even more resistance to chemicals and impact than the original MagLevel PMAG. PMAG 40 has solid sides. The added capacity means fewer reloads, saving precious seconds for competition shooters.

The Savage 110 BA Law Enforcement is a bolt-action long-range tactical rifle chambered in .338 Lapua Mag.
The 110 is part of Savage’s Law Enforcement series and is equipped with the patented AccuStock and AccuTrigger (Accu abbreviated for accuracy). 

The AccuStock uses a fiberglass lining within the stock, which wedges the action in the stock (on top of screwing it in) rendering it immobile ensuring the rifle will shoot straight. The barrel is free-floated, so the stock doesn’t interfere with its action. The actual trigger of the 110 requires a very short pull, which is great for a precision rifle, but since it is a tactical rifle light triggers pose a safety hazard because of accidental discharges. So Savage implemented the AccuTrigger, which is basically a trigger on a trigger. The AccuTrigger prevents accidental discharges by using an internal lever that must be lifted before the firing pin can punch forward. Also, shooters don’t have to switch the safety off after sighting in.
