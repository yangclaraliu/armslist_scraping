It’s a great gun for the wife or young shooter, or just a great small caliber to keep in the truck or around the house. With the exception of a checkered stock, the plastic recoil plug, and the cocking bolt/ locking bolt, it’s identical to the Stevens Model 87 series, with parts being interchangeable.  The parts mentioned are different only cosmetically, and will function perfectly if interchanged.  The bore is mint.  The metal finish is beginning to age, but has no rust, and no bare metal spots.  The stock has a chip knocked out of the toe (see photo), which has been sanded smooth for cosmetics, and a scuff ion the finish on the right side.  Other than the chip and scuff, the stock has very minor wear.  I can e-mail photos of any part(s) of the gun upon request - just send me your e-mail address.  I prefer a local sale but will ship outside the area (Payment via US Postal Money Order Only) to an FFL for an additional $35 - but your FFL must be wiling to send me a copy of his license for verification.  I prefer cash (local), but may be willing to trade for the right pistol or rifle of similar value (trade is local area only). Let me know what you have – the worst I can say is “No, thanks”.  I will meet with you for a local sale – daylight hours only – in a public area within a 20 mile radius of the Mobile, AL airport. $110 Firm.  If the ad is still up, it's still available."

The radios are listed for parts as I am not sure how the transmit. Initially when I got the radios and took all the pictures where the lighting was good. I put each radio in the charger to see if the red light came on inside (that is why the picture showing the red light on the charger is so dark) Five radios had the red light come on when put in the charger, two did not. I swapped two of the batteries out with the four extra ones, and they got the charger light to power up. The four extra batteries are just added to the deal. The point is two of the pictured batteries were swapped into the radios to get them powered up. 

 Please see the pictures for the exact condition of the radios. The seven radios have all buttons and knobs, but have clear signs of wear. One of the radios does not have a back battery cover and duck tape was used. Each radio comes with a battery and there are also six chargers (one charger is missing the red light cover for the red light to indicate charging.)

I have a 1850s area percussion Blunderbuss for sale. I’m not sure of its origin because I can’t find any proof marks anywhere. I believe it is under the barrel. I am afraid to remove the barrel, as I do not have the proper tools. There is some etching on all the screws and trigger plate, butt plate and hammer. The barrel is elliptical shaped and made of steel. Overall the condition is excellent. I tried to research this gun, via the Internet, and found one real similar, almost exact. That one was made in Belgium.

The guy I bought this from had it in his family for several years, he told me he and his grandpa shot it last back in the early 70s. This gun has been very well taken care of, the stock has some scuffs/small dents but has no cracks or splits. Very good condition for its age. I took this gun to a gun shop and they confirmed that this is an original not a replica, they too were afraid to take the barrel off."

I ran a Streamlight mounted flashlight in a weaver style mount and it lock on just fine also had a forward grip installed, same thing, locked on well.

I bought this new and love it. I have shot 410 slugs and buckshot as well as many different kinds of 22LR from it with never one misfire. 
Both the 22LR and 410 shoots straight.
I took the trigger guard off but still have it if who ever buys this wants to put it back on. 
I preferred it folding tighter when packing it.
I put some leather on the lower barrel so my hand would not get hot when shooting it. Only really needed this when I was shooting skeet.

This is a super cool gun that is no longer made.

This is an unmodified Danish military rifle. These were already in Europe and sold to Denmark after WWII. The stocks were stamped with the rifles serial number. This rifle was made during ww2 in 4-44 and has no import marks. It has a nice stock that is original and the pictures don't do it justice.  The barrel is marked S-A-5-49 and has a nice bore. Most Danish rifles have mismatched European made parts but on this one all of the parts are Springfield Armory and seem to be original since it was re-barreled in 1949. Serial number 2795xxx. I am only selling because I need money for other things. PRICE IS FIRM...

I bought from a guy who bought in 2006 as soon as it was released to the US and has just sat in the safe since.. 30 rds or less thru it. Any questions just ask.

The upper comes with aircraft aluminum flip up iron sights, tactical light w/ laser, and Sig Sauer STS-081 red dot sight with end cap covers mounted on a quick detachable riser. The GPI Manufacturing lower is a dedicated 9mm only receiver that has a Rodgers magazine well funnel fore grip with finger grooves, the longest buffer tube on the AR market (9 1/8 inches long) with a rubber cap on the end, Hogue rubber pistol grip, ambidextrous single point sling attachment end plate, and utilizes the 32 round Colt SMG magazine which comes with 2 magazines (and locks open to the rear after the last round is fired). This lower CANNOT be utilized with any other AR platform except for the 9mm only and the buffer tube is set up for the future installation of a SIG TAC Brace (if the new owner wants it that way). With the long buffer tube installed, it makes it easier to have a good place for a cheek placement when sighting in and firing at the range without your face too close to the sights.

If you have inquiries or questions, all that I ask is that you would respect the sellers wishes when the questions/inquiries are answered. What I am asking is--please don't low ball my selling price for any outrageous offer.  The price is $950 or best offer--and I'm NOT asking for any trades please. For NC residents, you will need a photo copy of your NC drivers license, your NC CCW permit, and sign a bill of sale along with a photo copy of my NC drivers license and NC CCW permit.  All NC laws and ATF laws apply in this transaction. If you’re looking for an FFL transfer and shipping, then the extra costs will apply to the buyer.This AR pistol was my first build to own and loved it ever since. My son and I (both of us former military) have taken this firearm to the indoor range, along with my other AR pistols, and shot this with great performance. This is not the first time that I've sold other firearms of mine. I don't have to sell this item, but since I own many other AR pistols in different calibers, I'd figure that I'd give a try out on the website. You can email me for more details or questions. I thank you for your time and inquiries."

I am looking for a deal on an AR-15.

I have a configuration in mind, 5.56 only, 16"" 9 twist barrel, flat top, but at the right price I would have some flexibility.

Probably not interested in S&W, Windham, Bushmaster, DPMS, PSA, Del-Ton, RRA or Stag. A Colt is ok quality but you probably want too much for it. No plastic receivers.

Black Rain, Spikes, BCM, Mega, something like that.

I have cash in hand and ready to meet F2F.

This is the most beautiful Transition I have ever owned retaining 100% of the GORGEOUS Pre-War oven blued finish. Most 1924's are worn or handled to the point where the finish begins to darken or is worn away. Not this perfect specimen of Pre-War Colt craftsmanship! This is what Transitions must have looked like when they were factory new. The 1937 ""replacement"" slide matches the lower perfectly and is stamped with the frame serial number under the FP stop. It is my opinion that the original upper was lost or damaged and was replaced at the factory with this slide during or after 1937. Again, as you can see in the pictures, the slide matches the receiver perfectly. Finishing this off this fine pistol are the original walnut 28LPI checkered grips. Please use the pictures as proof of actual condition."

It's a TAC-Driver..! I have custom loaded ammo that is shooting under 1-MOA at 200 yards. 
So here are the upgrades this rifle has: 
Cryogized barrel and bore polished. Blackstar did this work. 
Compass Lake Trigger, installed by them. 
Muzzlebreak
Fluted barrel, done by Skips gun works. 
Locked rear pin, have the original push pin. 
Large in assembly, not the small pins. The pins measure .069-.070.. 
Leupold scope and Burris solid rings. I'll sell with or without. 
I have a 20 & 30 round mag.. Also I have the original trigger 
Surefire light can be included for an additional $50 (screaming deal)
Like I said, this rifle is a work of art... However, I have decided to sell it. I don't shoot it like I thought I would. I'd still like an AR just to keep handy if Ya know what I mean.! 
I have the load data I will pass along if you are interested. 
I'm asking $1100 for the rifle, mags and original trigger. 
If you want it with the scope, also brand new, add $325.. You do the math. 

So here's the catch, I'm open to trades.. I'm looking for an AR, just not this advanced.. A lesser model will work fine for me. Also, I do a ton of action pistol shooting so I'm in the market for a Glock 17-L or a Glock 34 ... Let me know what you have and maybe we can work a deal or part deal/trade.."

New Benelli Supersport 12 Gauge; Features 30"" Barrel, The Benelli SuperSport and Sport II are the ultimate choice for a fast 12-gauge shotgun or 20-gauge shotgun for sporting clays.
These Benelli shotguns are truly ""speed guns"". The SuperSport's ComforTech® recoil-dampening system allows the shooter to recover for the critical second shot up to 69% faster than with other comparable shotguns! Couple the quick recovery speed with a ported barrel that keeps muzzle climb to a minimum and it's doubly fast. And the ComforTech® system's special gel recoil pad and comb insert reduce felt recoil by up to 48% compared to the competition. For traditionalists, the stock of the Benelli Sport II features beautifully figured A-Grade walnut with a satin luster finish, a right-hand contour gel recoil pad and cut checkering on both pistol grip and forend. When one clay often separates the winners from the losers, the SuperSport and Sport II, with their superior reliability, faster recovery time, lower recoil and denser shot patterns, are almost like having an unfair advantage"

New Benelli Supersport 12 Gauge; Features 30"" Barrel, The Benelli SuperSport and Sport II are the ultimate choice for a fast 12-gauge shotgun or 20-gauge shotgun for sporting clays.
These Benelli shotguns are truly ""speed guns"". The SuperSport's ComforTech® recoil-dampening system allows the shooter to recover for the critical second shot up to 69% faster than with other comparable shotguns! Couple the quick recovery speed with a ported barrel that keeps muzzle climb to a minimum and it's doubly fast. And the ComforTech® system's special gel recoil pad and comb insert reduce felt recoil by up to 48% compared to the competition. For traditionalists, the stock of the Benelli Sport II features beautifully figured A-Grade walnut with a satin luster finish, a right-hand contour gel recoil pad and cut checkering on both pistol grip and forend. When one clay often separates the winners from the losers, the SuperSport and Sport II, with their superior reliability, faster recovery time, lower recoil and denser shot patterns, are almost like having an unfair advantage"
