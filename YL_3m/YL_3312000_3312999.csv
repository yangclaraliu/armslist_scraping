This is not your typical, mass marketed, paper thin 12 gauge steel, ""safe"", which only LOOK secure and carry a laughable ""rating"" of RSC (""Residential Security Container"").

This is a real safe capable of stopping a breach with 2 HOURS of fire protection.

Its measurements are 66"" high, 30"" wide, and 26"" deep and weighs a considerable 1080 pounds. That's not a typo, its nearly 1100 pounds.

The weight of a safe will give you an indication as to how much solid steel was used in its construction. Compare that to other safes with similar dimensions weighing in at 500, 600 or even 700 pounds with walls which ""LOOK"" thick but are mostly comprised of cheap fire proofing wrapped in a thin layer of metal.

This safe is a STEEL BEAST and will offer real protection of your documents, valuables and firearms.

Want to buy it new? Call the Wilson safe company in Philadelphia and ask them about their model ""200"" safe located on this page: http://www.wilsonsafe.com/#!fire-safes/c9yn

But make sure youre sitting down before you call. A whopping $3225.

Ever heard the phrase, ""they don't make 'em like they used to""? Their modern day version of this safe is 200 pounds lighter...

It was previously used to safeguard violins valued at over $1,000,000 each.

Do the research then rush over and buy this thing before someone else does.

You are looking at a complete upper assembly from a Gen 4 Glock 19. All internal parts are included. All parts are OEM. The slide and barrel have both been cerakoted. I bought this a few months ago and used it on my Glock 23 frame. It will allow you to shoot 9mm from your 23. It will also work as a replacement upper for a Gen 4 Glock 19. I am also including an Ejector for a Glock 19 Gen 4. Some people have reported ejection issues when using a Glock 19 slide on a Glock 23 frame. The ejector is the only different part in the 2 frames and will solve the issue. I didn't have any issues to this part is brand new. I do not know how much the item was used before I bought it. I put about 150 rounds through it. I decided to stick with the 40 s&w round. 

The slide is cerakoted in H-237 Tungsten Grey. I included a picture of how it looks on my G23. The barrel is cerakoted in H-146 Graphite Black. The coating on the slide is mint. The barrel is good, but shows some signs of wear. Some of the coating near the feed ramp has worn off a bit and there are some external markings that don't impact the performance at all. You can't see them unless the barrel is removed from the slide. The serial numbers on the slide and barrel match. All of the internal pieces of the slide are installed, and the recoil spring is included as well. OEM block sights are installed. Just drop it in and shoot. Be sure to use the correct magazines for the caliber that you are shooting. 

The cerakote finish gives the slide a nice light texture and makes cleaning very easy. The cerakoting alone is worth $100-150. I included the professional pics that the cerakoting company sent me as they were doing the work for me. The slide still looks that good. As mentioned earlier, the barrel is in good but used condition. 

This will only fit Gen 4 models. I know it will fit and function on a Glock 19 and a Glock 23. I am pretty sure it will also work on a Glock 32, but I recommend that you confirm elsewhere before making an offer or buying.

This is a post recall manufactured gun, therefore all of Springfield's kinks were worked out before this one was even made.

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY

This listing is for ONE magazine; winning buyer, however, may take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price with no additional shipping charges. Please read this ad carefully and study the photos. Triple K magazines work, but they will require some slapping and repeated insertion, ejection, and slide cycling, about 20 times right off the bat in most cases. Most of us who’ve been in the firearms business for any length of time came to know Triple K Manufacturing through their excellent leather gear. Triple K has been in business since 1946. Of all the manufacturers, Triple K is the only source left for magazines to fit many discontinued firearms. Photos show specimens of the Triple K #1297M, their blue steel magazine to fit the Star Super B pistols chambered in 9mm Parabellum. These magazines will also in one and only one variant of the Model B pistols, the ones whose grip frames do not have the slot at the forward section of their grip frame butt edge, as the photos show. California Manufacturer Triple K is the last man standing for Star Magazines since the demise of both Interarms and Star Echeverria in 1998. Construction on these magazines is all steel, from the bottom of the contoured steel floorplate to the top of the stepped steel follower. This magazine holds 9 rounds of 9mm Parabellum, 9mm Luger, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm caliber. It will not work in Super Bs chambered in 9mm Largo or .38 Super. It will not work in the A, B with Slotted Grip Frame Butt, BS, BKS, or BM models. The Super B is distinctive; it has a take down or disassembly lever on its right side. The 1960 Spanish Israeli Police Star Super B in some of our photos is not included, of course, and we are not advertising it for sale on this listing. We’re offering these brand new Triple K magazines each for only $ 29.00. Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into any of the six boroughs or 176 some odd zip codes, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

Good luck tracking down quality, Russian made magazines for the gun... Unless you buy this package! I have a brand new, unfired folding stock Vepr 12 that comes complete with 3x Russian 8 round magazines, 5x Russian 5 round mags and 4x SGM US Made 10 round magazines. The gun also comes with a custom multi-cam Beez Combat Systems chest rig made for use with Russian 8 rounders and can adjust to fit the SGM 10 rounders if you so desire. 

All of the parts are straight on this gun! The top rail is NOT canted like on many other Vepr 12s (I've owned several V12s, this was the only one that didn't have any cant at all) and the gun has a factory installed folding stock with adjustable cheek piece. Like I said previously, there are a lot of other Vepr 12s on ARCOM right now because of the recent ban on imports, but this is the only sale offering all the gear you need with this combat shotgun to employ it effectively. It's a turnkey setup that will save you time and money trying to track down rare magazines that are also banned from import, and magazines that WORK with these guns. Don't miss out on this deal, once it's gone, it's gone. Trijicon Reflex and 12ga ammo not included. 

Price is 2000$ for the entire setup. Payment via USPS MO or Paypal (+3% or gift, no mention of guns), you'll need a FFL that will accept private transfers. Buyer pays shipping, it'll be around 40-50$. 

NO TRADES. If you send a trade offer I'll assume you're illiterate, and therefore cannot possibly read a 4473 to fill it legally purchase this gun and complete the transaction, so don't do it."

A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles.

The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms.

This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers.

This load is the direct result of customers wanting the deep penetration of the expanding Barnes X style bullet in a 380 auto+P load. See the below real world velocities from my stock real world pistols. We always use over-the-counter firearms to establish our velocities as using extra long laboratory test barrels gives false high velocity readings and is misleading to the customer who will be firing the ammunition in the real world, not a lab.

1231 — fps - Browning Double Action-3.75 inch barrel
1235 — fps - Walther PPK-3.5 inch barrel - (faster than longer barrel above, no typo)
1130 — fps - Kel Tec PA3T-2.75 inch barrel
1136 — fps - Kahr P380-2.75 inch barrel
The all copper, long-for-weight, Barnes bullet is so long that when seated to an OAL of .940 to .950 inch, the base of the bullet will make a slight bulge in the case, but this DOES NOT affect feeding or chambering as the bulge is not pronounced enough to cause any problems, but in order to avoid endless emails, I’m mentioning it here. In fact, that bulge provides enough resistance to the bullet base, to stop the bullet from being battered deeper into the case upon feeding, which is a very good thing. If we load to a longer cartridge OAL, to eliminate the bulge, the cartridge will be too long to fit some magazines. Feeding was 100% in our over-the-counter test guns.

We are using a flash suppressed powder so the shooter will not be blinded if dropping the hammer in low light, which is when almost all civilian shootings occur in America."

Warranty 

Huntertown Arms warrants its silencers for life against everything but stupid.
Lowest price point on the planet. For 2014, stronger. Shorter. Quieter.

From our inception the goal was simple - create a great quality silencer with best-in-class suppression that could be purchased for less than the price of the tax stamp. The Guardian 22 was that silencer. After several thousand satisfied customers (and the lessons learned from them), the Guardian 22 has gotten a well deserved facelift.
New for 2014, we've improved the best in class price / performance to implement changes you've asked for. The new Guardian 22 is shorter, stronger, and quieter. And we didn't change the price.


•	The entire serialized registered part (not just a thread insert, like a few of our competitors) is now made of heat treated 17-4 precipitation hardened stainless steel, protecting your investment in case of a catastrophic failure of your silencer.
•	A 316 stainless steel tube to handle your most abusive use.
•	All baffles are encased K baffles, providing a ""tube within a tube"" for ease of cleaning and durability.
•	The first baffle is stainless steel, with all other baffles constructed from aircraft grade 7075 Aluminum for strength and durability.
•	Length and outside diameter have been reduced.
•	Sound level reduction is improved over the earlier Guardian 22 model.
•	Retail price unchanged at $199.
You could spend hundreds more for another .22 suppressor, but ask your self one question - why? Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, upgradability, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Guardian 22 has it all.

Suppression

The Guardian 22 compares favorably to silencers costing two to three times as much on the market today, demonstrating our commitment to provide the best sound suppression possible. The Guardian 22 utilizes encased K baffle technology, a tried and true baffle technology used in the quietest silencers available.

Maintenance

Just because you can take a silencer apart when it's clean doesn't make it user serviceable. How many manufacturers claim to have user serviceable silencers, but when you use it you find out their claims are just that - claims. Their special tools break, don't work, or you didn't buy them because they wanted extra money, on top of the price they charge. Or worse yet, you lose or misplace them.

Even if the tool worked, you can't get the silencer apart to clean it yourself, after as few as a couple hundred rounds fired.

As with all Huntertown Arms silencers, all it takes to disassemble your Guardian 22 is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, good strong set of jaws, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools are required. Ever.

Guardian 22 baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Guardian 22 core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it.
