Product Description- Amazon.com

The Bushnell Yardage Pro Scout compact laser rangefinder can display the distance of a larger object up to 700 yds. The monocular design provides continuous distance measurement as multiple targets in the field of view are scanned. Battery included. Color: Hunter Green.
Hunting and golfing will never be the same with the Bushnell Yardage Pro Scout. Its 10- to 700-yard range with 1-yard accuracy (plus or minus, without reflectors or special devices) makes it perfect for golfing, bow hunting, and archery. The pocket-sized Pro Scout is water resistant and comes with a standard 3-volt battery.

How a Laser Rangefinder Works
Bushnell's Yardage Pro rangefinders use an invisible, eye-safe Class 1 Laser beam (as classified by the FDA) which is ""bounced"" off distant objects with the press of a button. Then, the rangefinder's high-speed digital clock measures the time it took for a laser beam to reach a target and return to the unit. Next, using advanced digital electronics, the rangefinder instantly calculates the distance within + / – 1 yard and shows the range in either yards or meters on a through-the-lens LCD Display. The entire process is so fast that less than a second elapses between the time you press the button to generate a laser beam to the time the exact range to your target is displayed.

Reflectivity of Target Types
Because rangefinders ""bounce"" a laser beam off the target in order to take a measurement, their range is partially determined by the reflectivity of the target. In other words, hard or ""reflective"" targets – like a rock cliff or semi-truck – can be measured at greater distances than soft surface targets – like a deer. Ranges for moderately reflective targets, like trees, fall somewhere in the middle. Most experienced hunters will use their rangefinder to frequently estimate ranges to near and distant landmarks before they actually encounter a game animal. By ""pre-measuring"" ranges to spots where a trophy is likely to appear, they can concentrate on making an accurate shot when the moment of truth arrives.

Through-the-lens LCD Display
Bushnell Yardage Pro rangefinders are fast and easy to use because everything you need to know is displayed on our built-in, through-the-lens LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). Here's how it works:

	A. Targeting Modes
Scan
The Scan mode allows you to pan across the landscape while viewing a continuously updated LCD display of the distances between you and the targets you scan with the viewfinder. 
Rain
This feature compensates for precipitation to guarantee an accurate distance measurement through rain or snow. 
Zip
Zip allows you to accurately measure longer ranges (beyond 150 yards) when looking through foreground clutter like brush or branches. 
Reflector
This feature increases the maximum measurement range for most highly reflective objects"

In the last four years the HD7 Red Dot sight from LUCID has been battle proven and tested in the very capable hands of Law Enforcement and Military professionals. While we believe in the old adage, ""If it's not Broken, don't fix it."" It was time to make a set of customer requested improvements to the HD7 and introduce the Generation III Unit. These improvements include capped turrets, a new reticle set with more capabilities for the operator built in and the availability of a KillFlash Accessory.

As with the original version of the HD7 you don't have to compromise with the GEN III HD7. At LUCID we recognize that no two shooting situations are ever the same. We feel, your optic should be able to provide functional feature benefits to assist in most situations. The HD7 has been designed from the ground up to be a strong, reliable optic that offers the most in operator selectable features and benefits that exceed the market standards at a price that is friendly to the wallet.

It holds 8 rounds, 7+1, plus you can ""Ghost"" load this one as well. Google ghost loading a shotgun to see what I am talking about, it is a way to add an additional round, besides what the gun will already hold.
It will chamber and fire both 2 3/4 or 3 inch shells. It is a fighting shotgun, it will handle slugs, and steel shot as well. I have not had one feeding issue with it. I have fired both high and low brass, and reduced recoil rounds out of it, as well as slugs.
I do have the box, lock, manual, shims and everything that came with it. It has one minor blemish on the rail where I had at one time tried a red dot reflex optic on it. I have a close up of it in the pics.
Also I have installed a Mesa Tactical side saddle on the receiver, it holds an additional 6 rounds. I have also installed an over sized bolt/charging handle. I do have the original as well. I am very meticulous on maintaining my firearms, outside of the blemish on the rail it is like buying a new gun, without shipping or sales tax. Plus you get the extras. I have mine priced competitively, and will not respond to low ball offers or silly trade offers.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatchedaccuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

price considerably and sell it. up until the slide stuck the item was a wonderful firearm and functioned perfect. This item also has a great leather holster and night sights. This gun is around a four hundred dollar gun.  please text offers or questions.... first reasonable offer takes it. Plus lifetime warranty. Im selling because I just need the money and and don't have the tI'm to send it in and wait for all that...plus pay shipping. I'm taking offers. hoping to sell this weekend .

Up for sale/trade is a Custom Epiphone Les Paul Flametop w/ hardshell case, extra accessories and a Rare Marshall Half-stack in a cream/white colored tolex.

The amp comes with the footpedal, and all cords. Extras for the guitar include a new dunlop cleaning kit, polishing cloths, an extra set of DR white nylon strings (just put a new set on the guitar itself also), about 80 picks, a matching cream pickguard, and several sets of speed knobs (one white set, one cream set, and the original metal and stone set), professional yamaha guitar cable. All mods to the guitar were done by a local professional. I will also include a copy of guitarsmith 2014 with cable. Asking $1500 OBRO, cash is king.

I will also trade all for 500 rounds of factory brass cased .40 FMJ ammo. or 600 rounds of 9mm FMJ brass cased factory ammo.

The 18-round magazine capacity lets you fire rapidly without reloading frequently, and the checkered polymer grip offers a firm, reliable grasp. The smooth trigger provides great feel, and with ""Strike Two"" capability, the pistol will automatically reset the trigger for double-action restrike after a misfire. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

RAZORBACK EDITION in Burnt Bronze and Razorback Engraving

There will only be 500 of the LWRC SIX8 SPR RAZORBACK EDITION produced. This rifle features a factory burnt bronze cerakote and Razorback engraving on the magwell. These LIMITED EDITION rifles will include 500 Rounds of Federal 90 Grain Gold Dot 6.8 SPC ammunition.

This rifle will be sure to sell out fast due to the limited edition production, factory burnt bronze cerakote and custom “Razorback” engraving.

The SIX8 weapons are short-stroke, gas-piston operated rifles chambered in the 6.8x43mm SPC cartridge. This cartridge was developed as part of the Enhanced Rifle Cartridge Program in which U.S. Special Operations soldiers, as well as armorers and other technicians from the U.S. Army Marksmanship Unit, played a major role. Its primary purpose was to address the deficiencies in terminal performance seen with the 5.56x45mm NATO cartridge, while allowing the soldier to carry the same number of rounds with minimal weight penalty. It succeeds in doing so because it uses a heavier bullet with excellent accuracy, which delivers more energy across all effective ranges.



Until now, a major drawback of using the 6.8 cartridge in an M4 style weapon has been the lack of reliable magazines. So, when LWRC designed the SIX8 family of weapons, they started with the magazine. Partnering with Magpul, the leader in polymer magazine engineering, LWRC designed the first polymer 6.8 magazine. Building upon the magazine, LWRC designed the SIX8 platform for maximum reliability and improved ergonomics. The upper and lower receivers are designed to accommodate the slightly larger polymer magazine and to perfect the feed geometry for the 6.8 cartridge. In addition, we have prompted Federal Ammunition to develop new lines of affordably priced, high performance 6.8 ammunition for commercial, law enforcement and military applications.



As with the IC family, the weapons in the new SIX8 family are fully ambidextrous and equally suited to right- or left-handed operators. The SIX8 rifles are based on the familiar Stoner M4/AR15/M16 architecture, but they have been optimized specifically for use with the 6.8 cartridge.



The new SIX8 family combines the ultimate in ergonomic user-friendly rifles with the outstanding mid-range 6.8 cartridge."

I might have a box of ammunition in the case, if so I'll put it in with the listed price.

 The T-14 shotgun was developed by Turkish company Safir Arms. It isbroadly based on the famous Ar-15/ M16 rifle, but has several patented features necessary for reliable functioning with shotgun-type ammunition. At the present time it is offered in only one caliber, .410x65 (also known as 36 gauge, 2/12 inch chamber). With .410 caliber bullet weighting 7.5 gram (116 grains) manufacturer claims muzzle velocity in 700 m/s (2,290 fps)range, providing muzzle energy of about 1,800 Joules (1,320 ft-lbs).The T-14 shotgun is semi-automatic only and is available in different barrel lengths to make it legal for civilian use in various countries that permit its citizens to own shotguns.

The T-14 shotgun is gas operated weapon with rotary bolt locking. The gas system utilizes annual (ring-type) short-stroke gas piston, located around the barrel. For maintenance and cleaning gas piston can be removed from the barrel after removing the front sight with its base. The bolt group externally resembles the Ar-15 bolt, but has redesigned bolt head with three radial lugs and ejector, optimized for rimmed shotgun shells. The receiver is similar in design to Ar-15 rifles, and made from aircraft-grade aluminum alloy and consists of two parts (upper an lower), connected by two cross-pins. Trigger unit and manual safety also resemble same units of the Ar-15 rifle.T-14 shotguns are produced either with integral, M16A2 -type carrying handle and rear sight block, or with M16A3-type flat-top receiver with Picatinny rail. Furniture is made of plastic,and buttstocks are available either in fixed or in telescoped (M4- type) variety.Detachable box magazines are specially designed for rimmed shotgun ammunition."
