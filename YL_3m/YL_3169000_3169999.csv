Product Description


There has never been a higher demand for self defense handguns than there is today. The greatest demand is for the smallest, lightest gun available, but this has drawbacks. Generally these guns are difficult to shoot well, lack stopping power and recoil can be a problem. If you can’t hit or stop what you are shooting at, what good is the handgun? We can understand all of these concerns as we face them every day as well. We wanted to give our customers the smallest, lightest gun that we could without sacrificing accuracy, dependability and stopping power.

Presenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.

The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.

Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson.  The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish and available in both 9mm and .45 ACP. Stopping power is not a concern.

If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed.

The Magnum guns had 6-1/2 inch barrels, round loading gates, checkered black hard rubber grips, and no firing pin groove in the rear of the cylinder.  They were roll-marked   “RUGER SINGLE-SIX WIN. .22 RF MAG. CAL” in two lines on the left side of the cylinder frame.   In early 1960 the Magnum Only guns were also made available with varnished walnut grip panels.
These Magnum Only guns were put in a special serial number range of their own beginning with 300000 and ending at 340XXX.  About March 1961 Ruger began to produce these Magnum Only marked guns with an extra .22 caliber cylinder.  The extra cylinder, the .22 caliber in this case, had the last three digits of the gun’s serial number stamped on its front face, close to the cylinder base pin hole.   The idea of producing these dual cylinder guns or a “convertible” came from customers requesting that Ruger retrofit their “Magnum Only” single-cylinder guns with a .22 caliber cylinder or their .22 caliber only single-cylinder guns with a Magnum cylinder.

In case you are unfamiliar with nickel Boron, it is an ion bonding process that results in a finish that is like stainless steel in appearance, however, it has a lifetime warranty to NEVER chip, crack, or rust. This stuff is near indestructible. I have seen torture test that are unbelievable. People have left guns with this coating in Salt water for 12 months without a single spot of corrosion. They also say you don't have to ever clean or lubricate the gun because the nickel boron has high lubricity. All you ever do is give it a quick wipe and pass a patch down the barrel. However, having said that, this gun has been cleaned regularly anyway.

This pistol is in like new condition. I bought it new and have put maybe 75 rounds through it. I'm only selling to make room for a new purchase. The pistol comes in the original box, with two magazines. One of the magazines has a finger grip extender that makes drawing and firing much easier. The grip has a rubberized talon decal to help with the grip, but if you don't like it you can remove it. Also comes with the factory speed loader and a nice leather in the waistband holster from Tagua. Let me know if you have any questions, and thanks for looking!

****If you're looking to protect your; family, house and possessions from those who are hell-bent on the idea of depriving you of any or all, this weapons platform is for you. It's firepower, capacity and accuracy turns one shooter into 3. It will handle 2.75inch and 3.0inch shells of ANY LOAD.  It offers a capacity of 14+1 and enables a proficient marksman the ability to hit targets over 150 Yards away, despite it's short length. Lastly, it's smooth action and rugged design allows a competent handler the ability to put 15 Rds on target in less than 5 SECONDS. It has a very sturdy feel and is far lighter in weight than any other weapon of its type. It compares closest to the V3PR or Saiga Shotgun and puts both to shame in terms of FEEL, ACCURACY, WEIGHT,  EASE OF USE, CAPACITY, ETC... I can say that, as I've owned several of the others mentioned. There is No Competition. The KSG is FAR SUPERIOR IN EVERY WAY. Even though the V3PR and Saiga are both Semi auto and the KSG is a pump, I really believe that the KSG offers FIRE SUPREMACY to the operator.  Lastly, like the AR, the KSG is designed to be a Modular Weapons Platform and meant to be completely customized to fit the needs of its user.

Looking Mainly for CA$H, But May Consider a PARTIAL Trade for ARs, AKs, Garands, Etc...
Send an offer, who knows, I may decide to take a lesser offer.
Before SOME of you ""INTERESTING FOLKS"" jump all over me about the price and tell me that you can buy KSGs on Gunbroker for $800, I say go ahead and do it. If you've ever bought guns on Online Auction Sites, you'll know that you're gonna pay the BIN price plus; Fees($15-25), Shipping($35-60), Tax($90-120), Transfer Fees($30-75), etc.... That's at least $170 to $280 on top of the listed cost. Plus, don't buy from the wrong seller, who's going to try to scam you or who's going to send you an Email a week later saying the gun is no longer available or it is on Backorder and won't ship for several weeks or longer. Lastly, you get to pay via check, money order or PayPal and then pray that the seller is legit and maybe you actually get the gun in a week or so and you open the box and notice a big scratch on the side of the receiver and the bore is fouled on this ""BRAND NEW"" gun. So now maybe the seller actually is willing to give you a replacement,  but first you have to pay to ship the gun back and then wait another week or more..... and this is a positive outcome compared to some of the things that I've run into and heard about when purchasing firearms online.  Why not save the headache... sure, maybe Gunbroker has a few a little cheaper than mine, but check out some others on here. Also, consider all of the EXTRAS that I'm including and the fact that you can see and handle mine in person and see if you like it.

Pull weight from the factory is set between 4.5-5.5lbs. Shipping will incur an additional $10 charge.

Description - 

This National Match two-stage trigger from RRA is an excellent trigger for your AR15 rifle. These are used frequently in Varmint and Long Range AR builds where a lighter 2-Stage trigger really helps accuracy and round placement. These triggers come pre-adjusted by Rock River gunsmiths as a matched pair and drop in all mil-spec lowers with no adjustment necessary for an easy drop-in install. Rock River 2-stage NM pins are .1555 in diameter and are not recommended or designed to be used with .154 pins or .170 Colt lower receivers. .1555 RRA Trigger pins will install in any standard milspec lower receiver without modification but may be noticeably more snug than the .154 pins upon install. 

This kit includes trigger, trigger spring, trigger pin, disconnector, hammer, hammer spring, and hammer pin. This 2-stage National Match trigger kit is for a lower which already has a lower parts kit installed.

This does NOT include any detents, takedown pins, or other parts to complete a stripped lower.

Also selling KNS Anti Rotation Pins - GEN 2 MOD 2 in FDE .1555 (over size), and JP Enterprise Enhanced Reliability Spring Kit (RED hammer spring) so check my other listings.  I will also be adding my ALG-QMS single stage trigger as well.

Asking $90.00 - MSRP is $108.00 from Rock River.

Shipping if out of area will be an additional $10."

Description:
The X-Bolt Eclipse Hunter features a beautiful laminated stock that offers extra stability, a Monte Carlo cheekpiece for improved eye-to-scope alignment and a thumbhole grip for more consistent finger-to-trigger reach. These few changes result in elevated accuracy potential both in the field and from the bench, without adding significant weight.



Beautiful wood Laminate stock  with thumbhole grip provides durability and a solid, rigid platform for the glass bedded action and stock. 
Monte Carlo cheek piece improves eye-to-scope alignment. 
Durable low-luster blued finish reduces reflective glare 
Button-rifled barrel is triple checked for quality and individually hand chambered and air gauged to ensure consistency and accuracy. 
The target Crown enables the uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the barrel, preventing a shift in trajectory. The Crown is recessed to protect it from accidental damage that degrades accuracy. 
Free floated barrel eliminates contact interference from the fore-end, enabling the superior barrel craftsmanship to perform consistently and accurately. 
Drilled and tapped for X-Lock scope mounts that use four screws for each base to provide a rock solid optic platform. 
Adjustable Feather Trigger minimizes the ""human factor"" by eliminating creep and take-up — providing a crisp trigger pull that ""breaks like glass."" 
Low profile action allows you to mount the scope extremely close to the center of the bore to minimize the offset between point of aim and Point of Impact. 
60° bolt lift keeps the thumb and fingers clear of the scope when cycling the action and allows the bolt to be operated in a smoother/quicker motion. 
Top-tang safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. The shooter can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld. 
Detachable Rotary magazine is built from tough polymer and is designed to stop forward movement of the cartridge by contacting the shoulder of the case rather than the tip of the projectile. This prevents bullet tip deformation and recoil induced bullet seating depth change. 
Bolt Unlock Button allows the bolt to be cycled with the safety engaged. 
Innovative Inflex Technology recoil pad uses directional deflection to pull the stock down and away from the face to reduce perceived recoil.

X300U-A
The powerful and versatile SureFire X300 Ultra WeaponLight for handguns and long guns features a high-performance LED that generates 500 lumens of stunning white light focused by a Total Internal Reflection (TIR) lens to produce a tight beam with extended reach and significant surround light for peripheral vision. The virtually indestructible and highly efficient LED generates tactical-level light—more than enough to overwhelm an aggressor's dark-adapted vision—for 1.5 hours per set of batteries. 

The X300 Ultra can be attached to a pistol or a long gun since its Rail-Lock® system permits rapid attachment to and removal from either Universal or Picatinny rails. Its high-strength aerospace aluminum body is Mil-Spec hard anodized for superior toughness and is O-ring and gasket sealed to make it weatherproof."

This railed handguard is a drop-in replacement for the standard AK handguard and fits all AK models with a standard length handguard.  It is extremely easy to install and provides rock-solid rails and co-witness capabilities. The entire system is light weight, keeps the shooter tucked tightly into the rifle, and provides the options of either using iron sights or the optic. 

The Burris Fast Fire III is an excellent, lightweight micro dot optic with a 3 MOA dot. The Generation III is much easier to adjust windage/ elevation and replace the battery than previous models.  It can be used on handguns or rifles of any caliber with a standard weaver/picatinny rail mount.  

Both the sight and the rails are brand new, with no issues. I have never fired a round with either on the rifle.  They have been mounted only.  I loved the setup on the AK, and the co-witness. I just decided I wanted to go with Bulgarian military parts only.  If you are looking for the ultimate tactical AK optics setup, this is it.

I am a Marine Corps veteran and I've used high quality grease and oil, this rifle has been well cared for.

It can be prevented by putting tape over the deflector or left alone so that people know that it's not a safe queen.  I've only put a few magazines through it.

The rifle has a few rounds through it for a youtube demo.

ok, the race is on. I would like this sold today before i change my mind.

The original price was 740 and tax. I am making it the total amount since it is so very pretty. This wood on this is exotic looking in nature and one that rarely comes around. That is unless you buy a grade V or something. The wood on this with its high glosss is such a nice work it has that special look and feel to it. When you take a look at the image you can immediately tell you have something special available here to buy. Things like this are usually held onto but i am looking to get another item and this is the only thing right now that i can part with.
Now the 1000 price is over the original price. I have seen four of these this spring for sale and not one of them touches the pretty looks of this one."

Just so you know, this is one complete pistol and one frame/barrel/magazine. The FCM which is basically the trigger and firing assembly can be swapped from one to the other. That way you can have full size pistol, compact or sub compact when you need it. It only takes a minute or so to swap between the two but only one can fire at a time. I believe you can get another FCM online for roughly $200 (last I checked) shipped to your FFL."
