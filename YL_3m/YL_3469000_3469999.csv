In general design, it is actually a modified hybrid of the Soviet AKMSU and AKS-74U carbines, but is easily distinguished by the design of pistol grip and especially by the handguard (which is longer), which is made out of a different wood type and has three cooling vents instead of the usual two. This feature gives the M92 less overheating on full auto mode.

With this kit installed, it solves all of the problems of the factory trigger, giving you a solid piece aluminum trigger with a single center trigger safety that does away with the inferior hinged trigger from stock.

I have put no more than 250 rounds though it.  I bought it to convert my rifle for 3 gun competition however, I just never had found time to compete.

The upper has an AK-74 compensator. [I believe I also got the compensator  from Bushmaster... but I am not positive.]  I have lost the original Bird cage style flash suppressor.

It has a few marks from being stored (But you would have to look for them to find them) [It has been stored since 2006].   Cost from Bushmaster (retail) today for this set up is 768 dollars.  The receiver is immaculate, cleaned and lubed ready to go.  I am asking 400 (firm...which is <1/2 of new retail) . I have the original A2 receiver that I would sell for 50.00 with upper (retail for that part is 124...it is basically new).

The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed.

The P220Â® Carry Elite Stainless is an 8+1 capacity carry-sized pistol with a full-size frame. Chambered in .45ACP, the P220 Carry Elite Stainless features the new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The new SRT was designed by SIG SAUERÂ® to deliver the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset 60% shorter than the standard DA/SA. This short reset provides for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting making it ideal for competitive shooting. With its enhanced ergonomic features of a beavertail grip, front strap checkering and front cocking serrations, the P220 Carry Elite is an excellent choice as a big bore carry pistol. Its beavertail grip allows the shooter to obtain his or her grip quickly and with confidence even under stress. Each P220 Carry Elite Stainless comes equipped with SIGLITEÂ® Night Sights and the all-stainless construction provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long.

Inc.  It was completely made in Poland so it features a Polish receiver and a Polish cold-hammer forged and chrome lined barrel.  I gave this gun to a professional gunsmith and added a Polish Tantal stock which is very similar to the stock that came with it but is much stronger and has a sling attachment on it. I will include the original side folding stock as well.  I then added a new muzzle brake by CNC Warrior since the I.O. brakes are very brittle and I do not really like the slant muzzle brakes.  The gun was refinished in a semi-gloss molyresin finish which is extremely durable and beautiful.  All this work was done by Meridian Ordnance which is an extremely competent and professional gunsmith company here in Kentucky. The owner does superb work on Ak and Ar-15 platforms as well as other gun platforms. I would recommend Meridian for any of your gunsmithing needs. I did not have any work done to the gun that changed the operation of the firearm. It is brand new and unfired. I bought the rifle at Centerfire Systems for $499.99 before taxes. The Tantal stock cost me $50.00. The work and refinishing of the gun cost $150 and the muzzle brake cost me $35.  I have five brand new Croatian metal magazines which have a bolt hold open feature like the Yugo mags and they cost me $18 a piece at Centerfire. I also have four Magpul mags that cost me $15 a piece and I have the original two American made polymer mags that come with it as well, so I have a total of 11 mags that come with the gun.  Six of the mags are fully loaded with Tula FMJ ammo and one of the mags has 20 rounds, so 200 rounds total come with the gun.  The rifle also has a Magpul pistol grip which cost me $20.  In the total package I have over $1000.00.  I am asking $900 obo for the total AK package. I am not looking for trades and lowball offers will be ignored. I know how much the gun is worth and the work I had done to it is worth as well.  If you are looking for a quality made, military grade AK package then send me your offer. Thanks and text me at REDACTED if interested. $900 or best offer."

Very clean and well taken care of. Comes with a 35 round mag, a 15 round mag, and a case.
 This is a relic from the Ban- and Pre-Ban period of the 1990s. This is an AA Arms Pistol, model AP-9, manufactured from 1991 until 2001 in Indian Trail, North Carolina. It is a direct descendant and copy of the notorious Intratecs KG-9 from the late 1970s. This was, to the best of our knowledge, the final clone of the KG-9. The KG-9 stirred up some action and warnings from the BATF. The KG-9 and this pistol, the AP-9, will release the sear from a bolt position that is only about halfway open. While the Intratecs had aluminum alloy lower frames, this one has a rough textured polymer lower frame. It is more ornage than its predecessor, with larger sights and a grooved muzzle barrel instead of a threaded barrel. Weight empty is about 3 1/2 pounds. Barrel length is 5 inches.

Built on our legendary pump action thatâs become the gold standard for high-risk applications, the Model 870â¢ Express Tactical with a quick pointing 18 1/2"" barrel and includes our extended ported Tactical Rem Choke. It packs a full 7 rounds of 2 3/4"" or 3"" 12-gauge firepower with the factory installed 2-shot extension.

The Model 870â¢ ExpressÂ® Tactical with XSÂ® Ghost Ring Sights is optimized for rapid target acquisition and precise shot placement with the XS blade sight and XS Ghost Ring sight rail (fully adjustable for windage and elevation), which accepts optics and sight systems as well. Both models have black synthetic stocks and fore-ends with sling swivel studs. Receivers are drilled and tapped.

The all-stainless construction of the P220Â® Elite Stainless provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long. As the next generation P220, the Elite builds on the exceptional reputation of out-of-the-box accuracy with the addition of SIGâs new Short Reset Trigger or SRT. The SRT provides you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable short reset for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. No production pistol is more closely identified with superior performance than the P220 and the new P220 Elite offers shooters new features that enhance the pistolâs performance. These features include an ergonomic beavertail grip which allows you to obtain a confident grip from the holster even under stressful conditions. The beavertail also permits shooters to grip the pistol as high as possible without worrying about slide bite. Front cocking serrations, front strap checkering, SIGLITEÂ® Night Sights and custom wood grips complete the P220 Elite."

I used one of these in Iraq, and loved it. It's light, feels good in the hand, stable, and its two for the price of one. Works great as a monopod too.

This is a WWII-era rifle, with the approximate dates of manufacture I found online--based on the serial number. The throat and muzzle wear is written on the tag, as well. 

Ser#: 3062xxx (approx date of manufacture: JUL/AUG 1944)
Service Grade; muzzle reading: 2; Throat reading: 4.
There is a ""67"" marked on top hand guard (looks easily removed but I am not altering the rifle in any way prior to sale) and a ""P"" proof mark stamp/cartouche on the stock/handgrip.

***SERVICE GRADE: (Good to Very Good) 
Service Grade Rifles show less wear and better appearance than Field or Rack Grades. Good to very good condition. Rifle wear will be exhibited by worn and mixed colors of the parkerized finish. There may be some minor pitting on receiver and other metal parts. Wood will be either Walnut, Birch, Beech or other variety and will be basically sound but may have minor hairline cracks, dings, scratches and gouges. Wood may not match in color or type of wood. Wood may be of new production on Service Grade Garands. Bores will be generally good with only minor imperfections. The barrel crown may be nicked, but the muzzle will gauge ""3 or less"" and the throat erosion will gauge less than 5.

The hard case is included and the rifle appears to be in great working order. I have not fired it, however. I will consider a partial trade for a S&W Model 69 .44 mag revolver as well as holster/belt combos for a Colt peacemaker.

Will include the original rear sight, don't think you will want to put it back on.....as the Carbine sight is MUCH better.....but it is included. Can be swapped back out with no problems.

I have four 20 round mags and a cheap 40 round mag that goes with it. The 40 round mag was given to me from a friend and its not very pretty, but the 20's look brand new. 

The rifle is in good condition. Very clean and functions 100% with all mags included. It will spit your empty brass into the next county though, and that is the major reason for me loosing interest. I shoot in a grassy area, and loose 50% of my brass. For the bright side though, it has positive extraction ! Ha ha.

Each container holds ten 20-round boxes of 180 gr. swift scirocco cartridges.  Muzzle velocity is 2700 fps and muzzle energy is 2,913 ft. lbs.

From Remington's website: ""A break-through line of big game ammunition that combines many of the best performance features developed over the last half-century. The remarkable Swiftâ¢ Scirocco Bonded bullet which combines polymer tip ballistics with weight retention is unquestionably the most advanced polymer tipped bullet ever to sit atop a factory load. Of course, our precision loading process â using the finest available components â ensures that itâs delivered with quality unmatched by any other brand.

The Scirocco cut-away shows how the unique combined design features make our new Premier Scirocco line some of the most versatile and reliable big-game ammunition offered today. The expansion-generating polymer tip and the boat tail base combine to defy air resistance at the front end, and reduce drag at the back. The progressively thickening, heavy-based, pure copper jacket is bonded to the lead core to preserve bullet integrity and retain over 75% of its weight at all velocities. Finally, the bulletâs precise concentricity and secant ogive nose profile produce accuracy you would be proud of in match competition.""

Price comes to $1.25 per round ($25.00 per box) for one 200-rd container or $1.125 per round ($22.50 per box) for both vs. $1.95+ per round ($39 per box) before tax or shipping at Cheaper Than Dirt or Cabela's.  Please see links below:
