I received this gun in a trade with the intention to blast lots of holes in a piece of paper at the price of $.20-.25 a hole, but in the end I have only shot one box of 20 rnds though it just to make sure the gun functions properly (which it did). 

The gun is in great shape with minimal scratching on the bluing, no dents or scratches in the stock, and a nice shiny bore. The wood stock is original and is extremely difficult to find, as I have only located a few complete 30’s with the wood stock of them while having it, so unless you want to drive to Idaho; this is your chance to snatch one up. This gun is in such good shape that I can only surmise that it has spent most of its life acting as a heavy item to keep gun safes from floating away, rather than in the woods or at the range. Reasonably I would say the gun is at 99%. 

The older model Tasco 3-9x40 scope on the other hand is a different story. I can personally guarantee that it has not been sighted in, and looks like it was used as a chew toy for some bionic robot dog somewhere. But it is one of the scopes they made in Japan before they started making junk, so the optics is clear and the up/down, left/right adjustment is clicking and can probably be brought in to center.

The rifle comes with a 5 round Ruger brand flush mount detachable magazine. Asking $850 OBO."

It was well taken care of and cleaned after each use.  I have put maybe 100 rounds through it.  It has a custom riser with a mounted scope. Scope is a 3-9 X 32.

The Smith & Wesson SW99 is a modern, polymer frame pistol that is nearly identical to the Walther P99. The SW99 features an internal striker, as opposed to the classical external hammer. It is chambered in 9mm Para, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP. The pistol lacks a manual safety; instead a de-cocking button is placed on the top rear section of the slide, which when actuated, places the firearm into double-action mode. This mechanism differs with each variation of the action, which will be explained below. The SW99 features several safety features including a loaded chamber indicator on the right side of the slide, a protruding, red-painted cocking indicator, and a drop safety. As with the P99, the cocking indicator does not protrude from the slide of the QA variant unless the weapon is fired, as it is in a constant partially cocked state.[3] The SW99 also features a fully supported chamber design, which leaves no portion of the chambered round exposed. Because of this there is less chance of injury to the shooter and/or destruction of the pistol, should the casing head rupture."

Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

From the Manufacturer
The Armasight Nyx14-3 Bravo is the new standard by which all compact multi-use monoculars will be judged in future. The Nyx14-3 Bravo uses optics that are equal to or better than current Military issue night vision units, built into a tough, compact and ergonomic composite housing. We built this body to surpass MIL-SPEC-810 specifications, and so the Armasight Nyx14-3 Bravo can withstand salt water, rain, high humidity, extremes of temperature and still give unsurpassed levels of performance. The Armasight Nyx14 is available with a whole array of accessories like -- 3x, 5x and 8x magnification lenses for mid-long range viewing, head or helmet mounts to allow the unit to be worn as a mono-goggle, various weapon mounts for tactical or hunting use and high powered additional IR illuminators for long range use. The Nyx14-3 Bravo is equipped with a high-performance Gen 3 Bravo tube which provides a resolution of 62-72 lp/mm. This kit also comes with 5x lens included. It is the only night vision device that will meet the challenge of such a high number of tasks and accomplish them all with ease.

About as short as you want an AR pistol at 7.75"".  At this short of a length you should look to piston driven systems like an AK rifle for various reasons having to do with the gas porting.  There are cheaper piston rifle designs than Primary Weapons Systems (PWS) that use a metal-on-metal and a short stroke piston design that is intrinsically flawed -- The gas should drive a LONG STROKE piston - NO banging metal on metal, period.

The UTS-15 tactical shotgun is a 12 ga. pump action shotgun with two 7-round alternately feeding or selectable magazine tubes, that measuring 28.3” in overall length with a 18.5” barrel chambers for 2 3/4” and 3” magnum ammunition. Constructed primarily of fiber reinforced injection molded polymer the UTS-15 weighs only 6.9 lbs, for quick pointing and easy handling. The top mounted picatinny rail allows for the mounting of a wide variety of both iron and optical sights, which coupled with Beretta style barrel threading for choke tubes allows the UTS-15 to adapt to any situation (sights and choke tube not included). These are the newest and current production of UTS-15 shotguns Generation 3.

It has 259k miles on it. I have had it for 10 years, I am the third owner. I bought it off my older sister who had bought it from an elderly couple. This car has been serviced at the Honda dealership all its life and well taken care of. I am selling it because we have too many cars in the driveway. Sadly my Wife wanted a mini van this year and my beloved Accord has to go. Most of the miles are highway miles when I used to commute on I-5, has just been used to drive back and forth to work locally since. This vehicle has never let me down. Very little has gone wrong mechanically with it because I kept up on oil changes and regular servicing (timing belt was last done at around 220,000 miles). Car has nearly new tires from Costco, new title and registration (2016 tags), and has an Alpine aftermarket stereo with MP3 AUX cord (never upgraded the speakers, always meant to). It has leather and a moon roof plus automatic windows and locks. I priced it at $1,400 because there is an issue with the ABS light coming on and the car is 19 years old so there are some quirks here and there. Drives and corners great, always has. If interested let me know at REDACTED. Thanks!

Description
The Browning Buck Mark Contour 7.25 URX is a large-frame chambered in .22 LR. The Browning Buck Mark is a line of .22 caliber pistols and what makes the Contour 7.25 URX is that it features a 7.25″ barrel with an overall length of 11.3125″ and a nominal weight of 2.4375 pounds. It has alloy receiver with a matte blued finish, a contoured barrel and uses Browning’s patented Ultragrip RX, an ambidextrous contoured grip system that offers ergonomic grooves for fingers. This system is meant to increase grip consistency and overall accuracy.

Buck Mark pistols use a blowback action, meaning the rearward motion of the spent casing powers the mechanical reloading processes of the gun.

Common features for the Buck Mark line includes a 16 click per
revolution adjustable Pro-Target brand sight instead of just 12 clicks.
It’s made from a lightweight machined aircraft grade aluminum alloy. And
it has Browning’s trademark gold trigger.

Stelzig Houston, Texas Holster/Belt Rig, .41 cal, mfg. 1906 with 5 1/2"" barrel. There's nothing better to document ownership of an item than seeing it captured in a vintage photograph, and we have not one but two photos of this rig being worn by it's original owner. Adolphus A. Bacon was born in Missouri on April 4th, 1879, and his family moved to Victoria, Texas just one year later. By 1904, Bacon was serving as a constable in Victoria, soon being elected by Sheriff Bob Weisiger as Deputy Sheriff of Victoria County. Bacon would hold this position until 1912. He then became a rancher for several years, and moved to Houston, Texas in 1925. He took up position as a guard at the National Biscuit Company (now ""Nabsico"") between 1926 and 1929, and from 1930-1932, Bacon worked as a guard at the Union National Bank in Houston. He passed away February 3rd, 1934. This revolver and holster rig were on his side right from the beginning and saw use through all his Sheriff, ranching, and guard days. It was passed down through the family until being sold in 2012. The gun was originally blued from the factory, but Bacon had it Nickel plated at some point during it's life. Approx. 80%+ of the frosty re-nickel finish remains. Otherwise the gun is completely original with matching serial numbers and clean original screws. The steer head pearl grips are original to the period and fit the gun perfect. They show vibrant color and pleasing wear, and there are five ""kill"" notches on the left edge. The bottom of the right grip has been chipped in two places and carefully glued back together, and there appears to be traces of blood under the grip. I would assume Bacon hit someone over the head with the butt in a scuffle. The action works well and the cylinder locks up tight, however the last click of the hammer doesn't quite seem to hold. The bore shows strong rifling (slightly worn near the muzzle) with very light scattered black powder frosting. The serial numbers and patent dates are slightly washed from when the gun was refinished, however they are all readable.For only serious buyer .Willing to ship."
