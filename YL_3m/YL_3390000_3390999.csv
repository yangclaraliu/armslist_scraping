This Zastava AK comes with two 30 round metal magazines (BHO followers), sling, side rail mount, and original box.  The rifle has 200 rounds through it and functions great.  It is definitely a heavier receiver than a WASR, you can feel the weight difference.  These rifles don't come with a rear sling mount or a sling.  I installed the rear mount and added the sling.  I also added a side rail optics mount.  It has a quick detach lever and provides a top rail for an optic and a side rail for whatever else someone might want.  The only minor imperfection on this gun is that the front sight post has to be set more to the left to shoot straight.  You can see it in the third picture.  As it is set right now it shoots perfectly straight and is very accurate.  Since this is a long gun a FTF transaction would be fine, provided the buyer can show they are a legal PA resident and state that they are not prohibited from owning firearms (LTCF preferred).  Really looking to sell, but if you have any trades you are welcome to offer."

Its the finest piece of wood I have ever seen on a production rifle. The rifle features a set trigger and I had the gun smith at Steyr America here in Bessemer mount a Swarovski Z5 3.5-18 scope on it with Steyr Quick Release Scope Mounts which retian their zero even during detachment, they also serviced it for me, its in great condition. The scope has a ballistic reticle sighted in with additional adjustment horizontal cross hairs for 275, 320, 380, 430, 480, 520, 560, 600, and 640 yards; the main cross hair is zeroed at 200 yards and the iron sight are zerod for 100yrds which means they are also on at 25yrds and only a bit high at 50; all of this is for 165 grain Federeal Fusion ammo but I also have charts for Hornady and other manufactured ammunitions. However tyne rille is sighted in with the Federal Fusion trophy bonded tip ammo. I have only fired three boxes of ammunition in this rifle since and its in great condition. 

I'm asking top price for this rifle and its worth it. It is in excellent condition, short of a custom gun this is the finest rifle on earth. Weatherby actions might fire more rounds through larger cannon like barrels, many people make much cheaper rifles but no one makes a smoother action, a faster pointing, or a more accurate production rifle, and few custom gunsmiths could do any better. This is an extremely light rifle, even with the scope. I have a Jeff Cooper Scout and its about the same weight; scopes included this one is acutely lighter. 
The scope I am happy to keep but I will sell it; the scope mounts alone cost me $500 before labor. I paid over $2,000 for this rifle at Mark's Outdoors, I'm not going to sell it for any less. I'm not looking to trade anything in particular but I'm willing to listen to good offers for other fine rifles, a nice M1 Carbine, or pistols either made in America or Germany .22, .45 ACP, or 10mm; and four wheelers. Thanks for looking!"

 This Zastava AK comes with two 30 round metal magazines (BHO followers), sling, side rail mount, and original box. The rifle has 200 rounds through it and functions great. It is definitely a heavier receiver than a WASR, you can feel the weight difference. These rifles don't come with a rear sling mount or a sling. I installed the rear mount and added the sling. I also added a side rail optics mount. It has a quick detach lever and provides a top rail for an optic and a side rail for whatever else someone might want. The only minor imperfection on this gun is that the front sight post has to be set more to the left to shoot straight. You can see it in the third picture. As it is set right now it shoots perfectly straight and is very accurate. Since this is a long gun a FTF transaction would be fine, provided the buyer can show they are a legal PA resident and state that they are not prohibited from owning firearms (LTCF preferred). Really looking to sell, but if you have any trades you are welcome to offer."

If you were to buy a new laser and CW45 you would easily spend over $640.

I you are just interested in only the CW45 the price is $395, If you would like the Crimson Trace Laser guard only it is $150.  It also fits Kahr Pm45, Tp45, Cw45, P45.  These are $175 new.  I believe this to be the best carry .45acp option out there.  More capacity and better ergonomics than any other similarly sized .45acp on the market."

If your not familiar with his scout rifle concept it is an ultralight rifle with a spare magazine that clips into the butt of the stock and a pica-tiny rail that allows you to mount a normal scope traditionally or a long eye relief scope forward. It also sports collapsable iron sights, a fluted barrel, and detachable sling. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_rifle
      This rifle I bought last year from Marks Outdoors Sports here in Birmingham. I have mounted a Zeiss Victory FL Diavari 6–24x72. With a lighted mil-dot reticle (#43) with normal eye relief in the traditional configuration. The scope would cost over $5,000 new; I am prepared to breakup the set but it has been professionally mounted and sighted in at 200 yards. I've only fired 2.5 boxes of ammo throughou this rifle since it came form the factory; Styer's American headquarters is here in Alabama, I had them clean and service the gun and verify its superb condition. So no low ballers please. I will not part with the scoop for less than $4,000.00
I paid over $2,000 for this rifle at Mark's Outdoors, I'm not going to sell it for any less either. I'm sure there are several of these available with a thousand rounds throughout hem. I'm not looking to trade anything in particular but I'm willing to listen to good offers for trades on other fine rifles, a nice M1 Carbine, or pistols either made in America or Germany .22, .45 ACP, or 10mm; and four wheelers.

The gun was built by Mean Metal Guns in Spring Valley, IL, and boy can they build a rifle!! This is by far one of the best rifles I have ever had the pleasure of shooting. This thing is just a tack driving machine out at long ranges and has killed many a critter since I've owned it. I originally bought the gun to do 3-gun competitions, but that adventure has been since put on the back burner. I use quick detach optics for my hunting and competition shooting, and the stuff holds zero!  Here are some of the specs:

>Seekins precision milled/ matched upper and lower.
>22 inch stainless steel bull barrel (capable of shooting 1/2 MOA groups)
>1:8 twist rate
>Will shoot 5.56 -OR- .223
>Rifle length gas system
>Standard 5 lbs 2-Stage trigger
>Mil Spec BCG and buffer system
>Seekins 13.5 in quadrail
>Oversized take down pins
>Oversized forward assist button
>Oversized Bolt release 
>Houge rubberized ERGO grip
>A2 synthetic stock
>BUILT IN AMBI BOLT RELEASE (the option that sold me on the rifle and is only available with seekins precision)

I have added and will include in the sale:
>Bravo Company GUNFIGHTER charging handle- MED size ($45)
>Spikes Tactical- Dynacomp muzzle break ($90)
>Magpul gen 2 AFG ($35)

>>>EOTECH, OFFSET IRON SIGHTS, AND BIPOD NOT INCLUDED IN SALE<<<

>But I will consider throwing in my long range optic for an additional $325. ($75 off new price!)
Burris PEPPR quick detach rings (orig. $120)
NIKON P-223 4x-12x precision AR optic with Spot-on BDC reticle (orig. $250)
Butler creek flip up lens covers (orig. $30 for both)

Again, if I didn't absolutely have to sell this gun I wouldn't ever consider it. I have approx. 1500-1750 rounds of high quality brass (HORNADY, PMC, OR LAKE CITY) through the gun with no failures. Gun was always thoroughly cleaned after every shooting session. This is not a safe queen, I actually believe in using my guns, so it does have some minor normal wear marks on it. I can pick this gun up any day of the week, and smoke a pop can size target out at 300 yards. This rifle is more than capable than going beyond that range, but my current shooting range is limited. Longest coyote kill shot was ranged at 250yards with Hornady 55 grain V-max ammo. 

You wont find this good of a deal anywhere else right now. Bought the bare rifle new a year and a half ago for $1700, only asking $1400. Will negotiate a reasonable offer. 
If you have any interest or questions please feel free to email me at REDACTED.  CAN SEND MORE PICS, ARMSLIST WONT LET ME ADD MORE THAN 1. Thanks"

This listing is for an unused, but no tags; Eberlestock J107M Dragonfly backpack.  Coyote Tan in color.  Actual pack in pictures.
MSRP is $399 on this pack from Eberlestock. I am not trying to recoup full price, but I will ignore lowball offers. Reason for selling: purchased for backpack hunting, but ended up winning a silent auction for another Eberlestock pack (Team Elk Pack), which I currently use.  I am willing to sell or trade the Team Elk Pack, if preferred.  The Team Elk Pack is used, but shows no signs of wear.  The Dragonfly has not been used and currently will not be.
Sale or trade.

Weight:	   9 lbs. 8 oz.
Volume:	   4,900 cu in

The J107M is a variant of Eberlestock's Dragonfly pack.  This newest member of the Just One family is at the pinnacle of backpack design.  With the patented Cam Expansion and built-in Backscabbard™ that made the Just One famous, the Dragonfly raises the bar, featuring a high tech suspension system, a huge range of adjustability, and more patented and proprietary features than any pack made.  A full slate of premium features includes a full framesheet, which augments the internal aluminum stays to give a very stable load bearing platform, and a fully adjustable shoulder harness and beefy #10 zippers.  If you need a pack that is scalable for multiple missions, you should consider a Dragonfly."

All stock except for Hogue grips with added palm swell (rubber gives it a sure grip and the swell fills the hand nicely). Well built, accurate gun.

Was cleaned every time it was shot and has been meticulously maintained with only about 500 rounds through it. Minimal holster wear from the trips to the range but otherwise no other marks or damage. It's been a safe queen mostly. Comes with (2) 8 round magazines. Asking $400 OBO. Feel free to text for quicker reply REDACTED.

This is a K serial number pistol with a matching serialized magazine.  The serial number dates it to 1943.  The acceptance stamp is an Eagle over ( C C ) on the left side of the pistol, which is a police acceptance market.  The right side has the Eagle over an N on the frame, on barrel visible from the ejection port and near the muzzle of the barrel which is covered by the slide.  No pitting, some holster wear in the finish but overall in good shape.  This gun has NOT been refinished.  Mechanically in excellent shape.  The grips are still tight and in great condition.  The holster is pliable and in good condititon, the strap on it has become unthreaded but is undamaged otherwise.

Hey all,
I have a really old German Mauser 25 auto pistol that I picked up in trade. I got it with the intent of doing some work on it and having it be a new caliber, but I have had some things come up that will be eating too much of my time. So, i would rather pass it along and let someone else enjoy her themselves. It is a model 1914 Mauser 25 acp. The serial number dated it to around 1916-17 (best i could tell at least). It is actually a comparatively low serial number (5 digit serial). It is in average/decent condition for its age but not “terrible” compared to what I’ve seen elsewhere. Has heavy bluing wear, dings, and a  crack in grip, but is still a decent looking gun. The main issue this one has is that it jams up feeding/ejecting almost every shot. It is possibly as simple as replacing a spring or giving it a really good polishing on the feed ramp/throat. It could even be that the only 25 auto ammo i had to test her with was some cheap/older blazer stuff, which i have had some issues with in other guns. Either way, I simply don’t have the time to get her “fixed up” or i would and then keep her (or sell for double! haha). I know that in this condition and shooting fine they sell for substantially more than what I am asking. Also, I have found most replacement parts online from normal places, so this could be a fun and easy little project!"
