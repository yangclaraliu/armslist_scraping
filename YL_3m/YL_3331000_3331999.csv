Can a pistol small enough to carry every day have all the features, performance and power you would find in a full-size handgun? Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?

The XD-S® Single Stack  from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.

The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.

The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.

Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

Come check this pistol out in person @ The Arms Room of Charlotte. Give me a call @ 980-237-eight9eight1 if you have any questions. Shipping can be arranged for $25.

Read Their Fine Print!! This Listing is for One Factory Brand New in the Hard Case CZ-USA P-07 9mm Semi-Auto pistol with a 3.8"" barrel and 2 15 round magazines. Factory Part # 91086 he CZ P-07 is the updated version of the CZ 75 P-07 Duty. The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry. Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range. The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.

Read Their Fine Print!! This Listing is for One Factory Brand New in the Box Kahr P380 Semi-Auto Pistol in .380acp with one 6 rnd magazine. Factory Part # CW3833 Caliber: .380 ACP Capacity: 6+1 Operation: Trigger cocking DAO; lock breech; ""Browning - type"" recoil lug; passive striker block; no magazine disconnect Barrel: 2.58"", Conventional Rifling, 1 - 16 right-hand twist Length O/A: 4.96"" Height: 3.9"" Slide Width: .75"" Weight: Pistol 10.2 ounces (w/o magazine) Grips: Textured polymer Sights: Drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight, pinned in polymer front sight Finish: Black polymer frame, matte stainless steel slide Magazine: 1 - 6 rd, Stainless The CW380 pistol has a 2.58 inch barrel, an overall length of 4.96 inches and a height of just 3.9 inches. It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip. The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight. Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.

This is a very rare and unique pistol of which less than 1000 were manufuctered worldwide by Beretta. Beretta created the 92/98 Billenium pistol with connoisseurs and expert marksman in mind. This gun is very different from standard Beretta 92/98 series pistols. For starters, the gun is made in Beretta's factory in Italy.The frame is manufactured from a special high resistance steel and a special satin/polished nickel alloy is used for the finish. The slide is slightly heavier than standard 92/98 pistols for better stability and less felt recoil. The slide has special machine cut patterns to aid in gripping the slide for chambering or clearing a round. The safety on this gun locks the slide/sear in closed position and is ambidextrous. The trigger on this gun is in a word, SUPERB! It is a Single Action Only trigger that was specially tuned by Beretta to be very light with no creep whatsoever. This competition trigger is micrometrically adjustable. The grips on this gun are carbon fiber for a high-tech look as well as strength and durability.

CZ 75 B Ω OMEGA w/ OMEGA TRIGGER SYSTEM, 16 ROUND MAGS

This consequently substantially simplifies thorough maintenance of handgun. The materials used, forming of parts and their functional interconnection together enhanced durability, operating life and reliability of the new trigger mechanism above practically qualifiable value.

Originally issued to the Czech army in 1958, the VZ58 is still in use by both the Czech and Slovak armies, their police and customs agents. Though similar to the other rifles of this style in appearance, the VZ58 uses a completely different bolt and fire control system. Even with a machined receiver, the VZ2008 is lighter than most similarly styled firearms with a sheet metal receiver. Century's semi-auto version features a U.S. made receiver machined out of a bar of premium steel and a quality U.S. made barrel. All metal parts are bead blasted and coated with a non reflective finish. Will not operate with AK 47 mags. Comes with four 30 rd. mags with carry case, Cleaning Kit, and Bayonet.

Looking to sell my yugo 59/66a1 sks. I got my sons a puppy a month back and it has been having a issue with it's lower jaw. The vet wants 500 to do X-rays to find the problem. Don't claim to know a bunch about the sks in general but everyone who sees it say I got a great example of a quality rifle. It has all matching numbers as far as I can tell. It also has the grenade launcher and bayonet. I'm told this is the rarer a1 version due to a night sight tab on the front sight. It has the cleaning rod as well as the cleaning kit in the stock. The only thing it's missing is the spring that ejects the cleaning kit inside the stock. I paid 350 and am asking the same. I will include the 20 or so rds I have as well. Messages don't seem to work all the time so text or call is best. REDACTED or REDACTED. Need to try and make this happen fairly soon so if interested please let me know. Thanks in advance. Jason

This rifle has a low round count, and was originally a De-Banning project for me, but I haven't had the time to finish it to fruition. The only thing that has been done to this rifle, is the replacement of the Chinese Double Hook Trigger Group with a Tapco Double Hook Trigger Group. Also, the Shepard's Hook was replaced with a Krebs Custom Hammer & Trigger Pin Retainer Plate. Other than that, the gas tube handguard is loose, but I'm sure if you're purchasing this rifle, you'll have it replaced with an American Made stock set.

The rifle is in good physical condition and has no mechanical issues.  I have fired roughly 500 rounds through it w/o issue.  It is not picky about ammo.  The rifle is missing a couple of the original pins and does not have the original side folding stock.  Nothing which has an impact on it's usability.  The rifle comes with 2 magazines, one 30 rounder and one 20 rounder.  It also comes with the original box and manual.

Pricing for this rifle is difficult as it's not high tech and decked out like most of the current tacti-cool rifles, but it is also a very unique item and would be considered by many a collectors item.  I believe that $675 is a fair price that lets it land somewhere in the middle of these two categories, but please feel free to make me a reasonable offer.  I am also open to the trades I have listed below in that section.

Nickel Boron (NiB) is a durable coating that provides reduced friction with excellent corrosion resistance. NiB impregnates the surface and becomes part of the metal. This process produces a surface harder than the metal itself. This characteristic provides overall wear properties superior to hard chromium. While NiB works as a lubricant additional dry film lubricate can be applied. The reduced friction reduces heat generated by metal-on-metal contact, so the gun runs cooler and parts last longer. Easy to clean, too—fouling brushes right off. This allowing for less time spent on cleaning and maintenance compared to the standard Mil-Spec coating."

My shoulder hurt. But she ran flawlessly, and was hitting consitantly in a very small grouping. I have completely removed all cosmoline from the weapon INCLUDING the entire bolt assembly. The firing pin is setup perfectly! and it comes with the mosin tool, so you can check yourself! Also comes with the original bayonnet. For the record, it has NOT been counterbored, and the soviet hammer and sicle stamp is in flawless condition.

I am looking to sell her for 200 with tool and bayonnet. I stopped at cabelas multiple times searching for the perfect mosin, and after weeks, I stumbled across this girl. I hate to sell it, but she deserves a home where she can get to the range more. If you know your mosins, youll be aware what a gem this is!

I will only be there for a few days. Thanks!

I have an early model Czech VZ.24 Mauser. This gun is truly loaded with history (search google to find out). It is also revered by many (including Nazi soldiers of WWII, who used them in Stalingrad after capturing Czechoslovakian factories and also sent them to their Romanian allies) to be better than their own Mauser K98. As it was made in 1924, it is generally believed to have inspired the German design of the Karabiner 98k. These rifles appear to be moderately rare and few are around today as compared to the K98. To make it more rare, it is a Bolivian Contract rifle with Condor bird marking. Only 101,000 of these are around. This rifle has NO IMPORT MARKINGs, and as Bolivia has not released this gun for import, it is likely a vet bring-back. It also has numerous markings indicating that it was made by the Czechs and also accepted into their army (Z within a circle; ""E"" in front of a rampant lion) before being contracted out. I have been told my numerous experts that this gun features many components of a very early VZ24.
It is a great rifle in excellent condition, I am only trading this because I am seeking a rifle I can put on display (and shoot) in front of my U.S. WWII militaria collection. 

I am aware of the value of this rifle, as well as Mausers in general. I will politely respond (with rejection) to lowball offers, but please save us both the trouble. 

I do not wish to sell this wonderful rifle, but will only trade. I will add cash as needed, but can also throw in a revolver: http://www.armslist.com/posts/3323425/south-carolina-handguns-for-sale-trade---22-cowboy-style-revolver---hardcase---nice---

The new SRT was designed by SIG SAUER® to deliver the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset 60% shorter than the standard DA/SA. This short reset provides for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting making it ideal for competitive shooting. With its enhanced ergonomic features of a beavertail grip, front strap checkering and front cocking serrations, the P220 Carry Elite is an excellent choice as a big bore carry pistol. Its beavertail grip allows the shooter to obtain his or her grip quickly and with confidence even under stress. Each P220 Carry Elite Stainless comes equipped with SIGLITE® Night Sights and the all-stainless construction provides shooters with greater control over recoil. The additional weight of both a stainless slide and frame, along with the enhanced ergonomics of a beavertail grip, make this .45ACP an absolute pleasure to shoot all day long.

This gun was passed down to me when my uncle had passed away. It's something my uncle cherished and clearly took amazing care of, I have done the same and held this gun for over 4 years now, and put maybe 30 rounds through it. It truly is an amazing gun to own and shoot. From all the research I have done, I understand this is a rare gun in high demand from collectors. Serial number 4276 Which dates this gun to 1957. This was part of the first production of .44 magnums that Ruger had started in production starting in 1956.

The trigger housing is SAI. Sights are the correct M14 sights graduated in meters.

The previous owner installed the recoil pad, which makes this rifle a real pleasure to shoot. Also it has a QD sling swivel mount in the front drain hole which I believe was for kind of aftermarket bipod. The compensator that is on it is supposed to be a Navy pattern comp. I don't know if that is true, but I like the way the shorter comp looks, and it works great.

I have two M1A's and no matter how I try I just can't justify having two rifles that are basically the same.

 Beretta Px4 Storm Compact .40 S&W Pistol JXC4F21

 The Beretta Px4 Storm is a semiautomatic pistol designed for concealed carry and personal defense. Borrowing features from predecessors like the Beretta M9 and Beretta 92, it is rapidly proving itself as a suitable option for law enforcement (both on and off duty), private security forces, and responsible citizens. 

 The Px4 Storm comes in subcompact, compact, and full frame versions. Checkered grips on all models provide a sure grip in less than optimal conditions, and three backstraps (included with every pistol) can be swapped for comfort and fit. The design is based on that of the M9 and 92, and the Px4 Storm cannot be improperly assembled due to distinctive parts and one-way fit. 

 An ambidextrious safety (thumb operated decocking lever) prevents unintentional discharge in the event the gun is dropped. High capacity double stack steel magazines provide enough firepower for self defense and law enforcement. A non-glare coating on the slide resists corrosion and stands up to the abuse expected in the line of duty. 
•Caliber: .40 S&W
•Weight: 27.7 oz
•Action: Double/Single
•Safety: Ambidextrous Safety/Decocker, spring loaded, positively on or off
•Sights: 3-dot sight system
•Magazines Included: 2
•Magazine Capacity: 12 rounds 
•Grips: interchangeable checkered backstraps

The FS2000 carbine is gas-operated and uses a rotating bolt lockup for reliability and greater accuracy. Its 17.44"" cold hammer-forged MIL-SPEC barrel is fitted with a muzzle brake.

The FN FS2000 Tactical is a compact, reliable and accurate semi-auto only carbine with a 17.4"" civilian-legal barrel and is suitable for security, personal defense or competition. The gas-operated system fires a wide variety of 223 Rem. (5.56x45mm NATO) ammunition fed from standard M16-style magazines. Fired cases are ejected through a forward port away from the operator. 

The FS2000 sports both a factory optic and a top-mounted M1913 rail for mounting optical, electronic or laser sighting systems (under the optic cover). An angled-face muzzle brake helps minimize recoil.

It has a 25 inch Skeet barrel(on shotgun in picture) and a 29 inch Full barrel, both in perfect shape. The hardwood on the shotgun is also in great condition, and shows very little wear. I've had the shotgun for 8 years now and bought it from my buddies father who had it in his safe and never used it. The only reason why I'm selling this fine piece of American craftsmanship is that I just have too many shotguns. I'm looking for a pistol, so it makes perfect sense to thin out my shotgun population and make room for a handgun. I'm wanting 475 bucks OBO, but please no lowballs guys.
