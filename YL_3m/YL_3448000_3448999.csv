Don't know about the M9?, read below

Beretta M9

This legendary semiauto handgun has not only won the historic contract with the US military in 1985, but has achieved a triumphant contract renewal after more than two decades of hard use in the world’s toughest and most extreme conditions, from the scorching deserts of Iraq to the frigid heights of the Afghan mountains. A contract renewal after this kind of use and abuse means a product that has kept its promises--and then some. Simply put, there is no pistol today that is as durable, reliable, dependable, easy to use, safe and accurate as the Beretta M9, the handgun that has rightfully earned the nickname of “World Defender.”


Dreamlike Durability and Reliability

When we talk US military standards, we talk hard numbers, not opinions. The M9 has been put through impossibly-rigorous durability and reliability tests that greatly exceed any kind of real-life situation--and it has passed them all with flying colors. For instance, it will keep functioning in temperatures as low as -40 F and as high as +140 F, and it consistently fires over 35,000 rounds of commercial ammunition before a failure. It will keep functioning reliably even after being buried in the sand or snow, or being repeatedly dropped on hard surfaces like asphalt or concrete. Beretta’s engineering experience and the quality of the steels used enable this kind of reliability, on which America’s servicemen and women depend every day."

STILL IN BOX. NEVER FIRED
OVERVIEW:
This All-American pump gun brings hunters the best of all worlds. Beneath no-nonsense, ready-for-work exterior of the Model 870 Express lies the same quality, precision, and dependability that you'll find in our legendary Model 870 Wingmaster®, but at a much more affordable price.

Like all Model 870 shotguns, this workhorse features a receiver milled from a solid billet of steel for maximum strength and reliability. The silky-smooth twin action bars prevent binding and twisting so that you'll always have the chance to get off a second shot. Appropriately dressed for the hunt and not for the wall, each shotgun sports non-reflective black matte metalwork and a no-frills laminate stock and fore-end. Both the 12- and 20-gauge models are offered with your choice of a 26- or 28-inch vent-rib barrel with a Modified Rem™ Choke and single bead sight.

Its solid, dependable action makes it America’s favorite, and our continual upgrades make it the most advanced, well-rounded family of pump shotguns around. Along with continually evolving designs, this shotgun’s superiority is a matter of rugged dependability, great pointing characteristics and versatility.In fact, the Model 870™ has been the standard for slide-action performance for almost 60 years1.

KEY FEATURES:
 28"" vent-rib bead-sighted barrel
Standard Express finish on barrel and receiver
Shoots both 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells

They don't make these guns anymore with stainless controls and all steel parts. NO PLASTIC! Very little use. This gun was in a case for over 20 years. Made in Italy in 1993. Comes with (2) stainless steel 15 round magazines. The mags alone go for $100 a piece because they don't make the stainless steel magazine bottoms anymore either. Comes with original black grips as well as silver alumagrips. Has the old PB markings instead of the new arrows. No lawyer markings on the slide. Very collectible.

The revolver comes complete with all the documentation, case, original box and 200 MINI-MAG 22LR COPPER PLATED ROUND NOSE rounds. 

The sticker on the side of the box states in part:

MODEL: 05413 
SERIAL NO: 548-34031
CATALOG NO: LCR-22-LG
CALIBER:  22 LR
SYNERGISTIC HARD COAT/BLACKE

The revolver was purchased so my wife and I could target shoot, but unfortunately my wife passed away before we had an opportunity.  I am selling the revolver at a loss because of the way my domestic situation changed.  

The owner's manual pages 11 and 12 states, ""The 8-shot RUGER LCR-22 has the same basic operational characteristics as all other LCR revolvers.  This .22 cal. model is chambered for the .22 Long Rifle cartridge.  The .22 Short, .22 Long and .22 shot cartridges can also be fired from this model.""

Know what you are purchasing because my knowledge of this weapon is limited to what I find in the manual.  In other words, I don't know much and all I am able to tell you is this.  The gun has never been fired and has been in the box since it was purchased. 

The handgun cost me $682.77, plus the ammunition for a total cost of $702.00.  Even though the Ruger is unfired - never fired and new, the Ruger is being sold at a loss with a Buy It Now price of $550.00. 

$550.00 is more than fair and will save you over $175.00 if you go purchase this from a store.  No counter offers accepted - No haggling - The price is firm eliminating any back and forth price negotiations.  You will not find a deal like this again and if you do, well, you are quite lucky."

Rifle is chambered in .30-06 and is in pristine condition. It is a late serial number rifle and the barrel date matches the serial number and appears to be the original barrel from November of 1918. Bore is fantastic and this rifle appears to have been unissued. These are getting harder to find in this kind of condition. Bolt, receiver and barrel are all Eddystone parts, as well as the majority of other parts but there are some small Winchester and Remington parts mixed throughout. I assume when it went through re-arsenal it received some different parts. I have fired about 50 rounds through the rifle and it is very accurate at 100 yards. Included with the sale or trade is approx 230 rounds of surplus .30-06 ammo as well as a bayonet. The bayonet was cerakoted green at some point but is still the proper bayonet for the rifle.

This rifle is in great shape with hardly any blemishes.
Any blemishes are on the barrel itself. Lower receiver in perfect condition.

This rifle shoots great at the range and is accurate in a consistent manner. 

Would prefer getting cash in return but I will entertain trades if you can convince me it's worth it. Buyer must meet in person and I am not willing to drive to your house or let you come to mine for that matter. Must show NC CCL or must fill out a bill of sale at time of purchase.(Valid NCDL required on bill of sale)

My price is $850. List price will not go any lower.
The gun is worth every penny! Offers welcome, but cash price is final.
Trades that make sense will be entertained.

With the Bushnell HOLO sight you'll be on target as soon as you raise your firearm. Sighting through this holographic daytime optic is different than any other type of sight you've experienced; the eye relief is unlimited, and your field of view is as wide as you want it to be. Without projecting light of any kind, an illuminated circle and cross hair reticle seems to float out 50 yd from your muzzle. In a flash you can get a bead on any moving target, and your follow-up shots will come quickly and easily

100% water, fog, & shock proof

Low battery warning and auto shut-off

40 Hour run-time on two 1.5V ""N"" type batteries

Compatible with any firearms with Weaver-type mounts, including shotguns.
Illuminated Ring & Cross Hair Reticle 
The illuminated 1 MOA dot inside the 65 MOA circle and cross hair reticle provides rapid target acquisition. 20 user-selectable brightness levels to ensure visibility of the reticle under any ambient lighting conditions.

This is the model that was made by EOTech for Bushnell, it is basically an EOTech 512 model that lacks the outer guard and takes Type N batteries instead of AA.

The Sightmark 3x sts tactical magnifier allows shooters to quickly acquire the target, and then move the magnifier out of the way without having to detach the unit. Inspired by military and law enforcement applications, the magnifier is designed for use in conjunction with holographic, collimated reflex, and other compatible weapons sights, giving the shooter the benefit of a reflex sight and scope in combination. The magnifier increases the magnification of the accompanying sight, boosting sighting range and improving target recognition--especially at medium range distances. The Sightmark 3x tactical magnifier can assist in quick target acquisition up to 200 yards and accurate target shooting at 100 yards. The magnifier also features extended eye relief for comfort, a wide field of view, and high-quality multicoated optics for improved visibility and clarity. The Sightmark 3x zoom is compatible with most Picatinny and Weaver mounts, and is designed to work with EOTech, Aimpoint, Trijicon, and other brands. In addition, the magnifier's lightweight, waterproof, fogproof, and shatterproof frame provides durability in all elements. The side to side mount is great for rifle or pistol.

The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.
TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.
Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.

The gun is in excellent condition, never carried. Has been my range plinker, about 200-300 rounds through it. Production is late November of 2012. It is the model with no manual safety and no magazine disconnect safety. 

I have replaced the original slide stop lever with the latest revision from Smith & Wesson, the newer slide stop levers has a bump on the inside that the trigger bar rides on, keeping it in line while releasing the trigger and giving the familiar ""click"" of the trigger resetting, something that the M&P line of pistols was known to have an issue with. 

I have also replaced the factory sear with the APEX Tactical hard sear. It gives the trigger a much smoother and slightly lighter uptake and a much crisper break. I have the original slide stop lever and sear which will be provided with the gun. 

Along with the upgrades it includes four factory 10 round magazines, the factory box, paperwork, lock and all 3 backstrap inserts. 

I originally paid $540 + tax for the gun. $30 each for the two additional magazines, $40 for the APEX hard sear and $30 for the new slide stop lever. In all I have well over $700 into the gun and everything included.

I have a Century Arms CETME - HK91 Clone that has been set up as a DMR.  
This gun has been a great shooter, the softest 308 I have ever shot.  The gun is in spec,  Bolt gap at .12.

This is a blast to shoot, and because of the HK fluted chamber, the CETME can eat up the Russian steel ammo like Wolf and Herters.  In fact I will include 500 rounds of Herters with purchase.

Here are the Specs

CETME Century Arms Clone - with Threaded Muzzle break
4 stock sets - MagPul PRS adjustable Target stock, Tapco M4 adj 6 point Stock With a Linbsaver pad. Standard HK Green and CETME Wood sets
HK Heavy duty buffer, and Buffer Technologies Bolt buffer {2 - one in gun, one nib}
Ergo Palm Shelf Grip
Custom Trigger Job by Williams Gunsmiths of Illinois = #5.5 Lbs pull
Polished bolt
Extra bolt head, Rollers, spring kit, extractor, and extra firing pin
15 HK mags in new pouches
3 different Scope mounts including STANG HK style claw mount
Port Buffer
UTG Tri Rail hand guard
American Defense - Quick disconnect bipod adaptor with Harris bipod
Soft case

This gun has been a fun gun, but I am getting into the 3 gun heavy, and the CETME does not have a bolt hold open, and not as fast on the reload as an AR, hence the sale.

The price $1300.  The price is very fair, especially with 500 rounds of ammo !  I work out of Reno and I come back into town on the weekends.  Thanks"

The contrast in color is achieved by the brush polished flats of the slide and nickel accents. The combination of the TRUGLO® Tritium Fiber Optic front sight and the rear SIGLITE® night sight, provides excellent target acquisition, whether shooting day or night. To further enhance the low-light use, the Equinox™ comes equipped with an accessory rail.

This is a 2012 production gun (according to the serial number), comes with matching factory box/case, warranty/registration papers, cable lock, and owner's manual. Also comes with two factory magazines (1-17rd and 1-20rd-brand new mag). I bought the gun used. But this gun is mint. By the looks of it, hasn't been fired much (probably less than 100 rounds) I have not fired the gun myself. In addition, I'll include 200 rounds of FMJ ammo (not pictured), and a brand new hip/belt holster with the gun. Must be at least 21 years old to buy or trade this gun, and have a valid ID (KY DL, KY CCWL). $450 obo, or trade. No low ball please. I got way more than $450 tied up on the gun and the extras.

Gun fires and cycles great. It has a few minor scratches on it but all in all is in good shape. It's been a great gun but just doesn't get used very much and I would rather trade it for something that I would use. Has a choke on the barrel I don't remember what kind.

I'm not by any stretch in a hurry to trade and my mortgage is paid so no real need to sell.( see the trade section for a package deal if you have something really nice) Yes it's a WASR. I get that but I've owned a stack of these in my day and have never got one that was as bad as the horror stories we've all herd. This one is good and straight, no heat treat issues, never a problem ever. It's everything an AK is billed to be. I picked it up used and it was already fitted with the tapco side folder. Not the most solid stock I've shouldered but I love the fact that from a folded position I can flip it open with my fingers and never leave the ready position. I further upgraded the hand guards with a quad rail set up, houge grip, four reticle site, forward grip with integrated 170 lumen light, and red dot laser with preasure pad. I'm sure there's an item or two I'm forgetting to list but you can figure most of it out from looking at the pic. I am not including all the mags seen in the pic, I will include one 30 rounder since there will be another AK in my near future. Note my location I'm not at all interested in lengthy car rides to meet up for a trade no matter how good the deal is. Your more than welcome to bash my rifle, low ball me, or try the general Armslist run around this site is so well known for. Just realize that wont put this rifle in your hands."
