I spent 879.01 plus all the shipping on this entire set and like I stated before everything is BRAND NEW and in its original packaging (see pictures). Never been used at all. This kit is literally everything needed to start reloading immediately. The only thing you would need is to buy a die set for whatever caliber you wanted to reload. Which you can get on amazon for between 20-60 dollars depending on the brand and quality level. But this is a top of the line set up and I'll let it go for 750$ which saves you over a hundred dollars right off the bat and then saves you another 100$ on shipping. I also have tons of brass, powders, bullets, primers and everything else needed. Thanks for looking!

I have a Sig P239 9mm Handgun available for sale!

The pistol comes with 2 magazines and a leather IWB holster

The pistol has several additions to it as well:
Hogue Overmold Textured Rubber Grips
Tungsten Guide rod (with spare polymer guide rod)
Short Reset Trigger System includes both short face trigger and standard trigger
And spare SIG factory internal parts (sear, connector, etc)

The pistol is in overall very good condition with light surface wear from occasional carry and the ever present ""SIG smile"" on the barrel from firing, I have fired probably 450 rounds through it during practice, when I replaced the guide rod this past spring I also installed a new recoil spring.

The gun is exceptionally accurate for a compact pistol and the SRT trigger in single action is superb.

To buy this pistol you must be over the age of 18, willing to meet face to face in a public place, and must present a valid drivers license and either a valid permit to carry, or a valid permit to purchase, must be willing to sign a bill of sale. No Exceptions, Sorry.

Unfortunately as a student in need of tool money for school, I regretfully have to let go of one of my favorite carry guns. Please feel free to contact me for more information or pictures if needed."

Has been very lightly used and is in almost new condition, less than a year old.  I'm not 100% sure but I believe it may have had a spring kit installed, trigger is very smooth and lighter than other models I have felt, feels a lot like a Kahr trigger.  Basically a budget priced glock 23.  This is the new model SD40VE, NOT a sigma. Will come with its box, two 14 round magazines, and depending on what you have to trade I can also include a Blackhawk holster and 100 rounds of .40.

I like snub revolvers, so I would like to trade it for a Taurus M85 or Poly Protector in .38.  May consider other snub revolvers but must be in .38 special.  No charters please and I'm only interested in a .38 snub, no rifles or shotguns please.

The only marks on it are from mounting it to my AR and mounting my EOTech on it.  Comes with the supplied adjustment wrench.

From Manufacturer: Converts low-profile EOTechs to lower 1/3 cowitness, and provides a better cheekweld too.
The LT110 is another mount designed ""by request"". The LT110 raises the EOTech by .275"". This extra height sticks the irons low in the EOTech's window...you can still see the irons if push-comes-to-shove.
The response has been outstanding. The extra height is just what the EO has been needing. The design had room for a piece-of-picatinny on the back, so we put it there and now you can mount a PVS-14 or Aimpoint 3X Magnifier in perfect co-witness.
Like all LaRue mounts, it is precision-machined out of bar-stock aluminum and matt black anodized to provide a durable non-reflective surface finish. The locking LaRue Speed Lever provides outstanding return to zero; the optic can be removed, and replaced, without loss of zero. Guaranteed."

Excellent + shape:  see pics.  Per Ruger's serial # checks this is from 1973.  I bought this used to remind me of my first deer rifle I ever had but sentimental value just doesn't mean as much as it used to.   I fired 5 rounds through it after I bought it and then put it in the safe.

I apologize for the blur on the one pic but you can still see the interior of the chamber and tell this one hasn't been abused.  This one is in excellent condition.  If you're thinking of one of these, don't let this one  get away!  There aren't many left which haven't been heavily used or abused!

Scope is an unknown (to me) generic -- you can have it.

I'm not interested in any trades and I'll completely ignore ridiculously low offers (unless you want to sell me your brand new 4 wheel drive truck for let's say $3,000, maybe $3,500 if it has less than 1000 miles)?   See how ridiculous that sounds?  

Although this is a rifle, I prefer CPL holders.  All others will be required to provide valid Driver's license, current address & phone and will be required to sign attestation statements found on a valid ATF Form 4473.

Excellent+ shape:  see pics.  

You won't find many in this excellent condition and the model 19 2 1/2"" barrel .357 Combat Magnums are getting harder to find and the collector value is constantly on the rise.  This one is 90-95% shape and the cylinder doesn't even have the typical score marks around the cylinder as most do. In this condition, they're going for 850+.

This one is a rare find.  Don't let it get away.  

I'm not interested in trades of any kind on this one.

I love this pistol, but just don't need it and it's been a safe queen since I purchased it.

Price is $450

If you're interested, throw in an extra $100 for a Lone Wolf .40 barrel AND .40 mag (you're getting $145 value for an extra $100 if you want it with this Glock 33).  Then you'll have 2 calibers with the change of a barrel and magazine.

I also have 4 boxes of ammo for each caliber:
For the .357 -- 1 box of 50 Remington target rounds and a box of Sig V-crown defense.  
For the .40 -- 2 boxes of Remington defense ammo
You can have the ammo valued at $90 retail for $50 extra if you want it.

Total package price if you're interested in an all-in-one package would be 450(pistol) + 100 (Lonewolf barrel and mag) + 50 for the ammo = $600.

$450 for the pistol only.

Up for trade or sale is my awesome little HK P2000SK in 9mm. This piece has been my carry weapon for a while now, and has been nothing but accurate and reliable. This is the v2 light LEM trigger set up, and personally, I think it is the best trigger to have in a carry weapon. The pistol is in great shape overall, with a slight bit of holster wear in the typical place (around the muzzle.) I would rate it a 9/10 as far as condition goes, and the round count is very low. The factory box and accessories, including the spare back strap are present, as well as three magazines."

I bought this revolver around 7 months ago from the original owner. The reason I'm selling is because I went to Alaska for June and wanted something with me, and now I don't have much of a use for it! The original owner had it for a little less than 2 years when I bought it from and kept almost all the rounds he shot through it. He was planning to use them to reload but never got around to it. I myself have put MAYBE 25 rounds through it, so total round count at most wouldn't be over 150 rounds. It comes with an awesome grip that actually makes it very tame. I was pleasantly surprised at how controllable it was for a .44 mag. The front sight is a fiber optic which makes it very easy to pick up as well. It will come with the gun, 35 rounds of 180 grain Remington target rounds, 14 Winchester Platinum tipped 250 grain hollow points, a box of Hornady XTP 300 grain bullets for reloading and over half the casings fired through it, again for reloading. It's a great gun, has been shot very little and is in excellent condition. This gun would make a great woods gun for carrying with you hunting or fishing, as it's very light for a big bore yet packs a very large punch. It'd also be great just for shooting with your friends if your looking for something a bit out of the ordinary that won't break the bank like a brand new big bore revolver! Text is best, asking $469. (503)593-805eight. Also, don't waste my time if you're not legal to own a firearm. I'll be over in Central OR this next week for a bit of time so I can arrange something over there.

Info:

The Smith & Wesson Model 500 is a five-shot, single action/double-action large caliberrevolver produced by Smith & Wesson, firing the .500 S&W Magnum cartridge, a .50 caliber bullet.
It is built on S&W's largest frame, the X-Frame, which was developed because none of S&W's existing double-action frame designs could handle the muzzle energy and pressures generated by the .500 S&W cartridge.[2] It is the most powerful production revolver in the world today, and it is being marketed as being ""the world's most powerful handgun"" by the manufacturer.[3] There are a few other larger revolvers like for instance the Pfeifer Zeliska .600 Nitro Express revolver, however none of them are a ""production"" revolver. The Model 500 can fire a bullet weighing 350 gr ( 22.7 g; 0.8 oz) at 1975 feet per second (602 m/s) generating a muzzle energy of over 3,030 foot-pounds force (4.1 kJ).
Articles, statements, and opinions vary widely on this firearm. Any of the available bullet weights can be relied on to take game at a range in excess of 200 yards (183 m), a feat matched by only a handful of other handguns.[citation needed] The advanced design of the firearm helps in counteracting recoil felt by the shooter. This includes the sheer weight of the firearm, use of rubber grips, the forward balance, and the use of a compensator. On certain S&W Performance Center models the compensator is replaced with a full muzzle brake.
Like most big caliber handguns the Model 500 is suitable for sport and hunting applications. The high energy of these rounds make it possible to hunt extremely large African game successfully.[4"

Approximately 200 rounds fired. 

A recent HK pistol design, the P30 is a modern police and security pistol that combines function and safety. Ergonomic features include a special grip frame with interchangeable back strap inserts and lateral plates, allowing the pistol to be individually adapted to any user. Ambidextrous controls include dual slide releases and magazine release levers.
This V3 variant has a conventional double-action/single action trigger and a serrated decocking button located on the rear of the frame.
A Picatinny rail molded into the front of the frame makes mounting lights, laser aimers, or other accessories easy and convenient. The extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator providing a subtle tactile and visual reminder of a loaded chamber.
Extensively tested, the P30 has already been adopted by several European police agencies. Excellent weight and balance make the P30 naturally pointable, easy to control, and accurate to shoot. An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions. During a (2009-2010) endurance test, a P30 test pistol fired more than 91,000 rounds without any major component failures.
