If it was fired it was very little and maintained exceptionally after. Set up for target/competition shooting. Has a powerful Tasco Custom Shop scope on it. Asking $800 or best reasonable offer. Not looking for any trades at this time. Will sell according to all current state and federal laws so do your research. Will ship at your expense to an FFL of your choice. Will transfer at an FFL within reason between us locally. Feel free to ask questions and I will do my best to answer them. Thanks for looking.

Up for sale is my MacBook Pro that has treated me very well the past couple years. I have cleared it completely clean and put a fresh Mavericks OS X on it. This system is ready to go! This would be great for anybody, student or for business. Still runs very fast, battery holds great charge. Comes in original box with original charger. Like the day I bought it new! I kept it in a case its whole life, but it has a scratch or two. It's missing one of the rubber bumpers on the bottom, but a new one can be glued on for cents.

Not a scratch on it, blueing is perfect. Tang safety M77's are getting harder to find, especially in this caliber. I mounted the Leupold 3.5x10 on it and started load development soon after I got it and boy does it shoot. It particularly likes the 60gr Hornady SP's, shooting under 1/4 inch at 100 yards. Shot some 50gr Hornady VMax's and the groups opened up to about a 1/2 inch. If you're a hunter and a reloader, this is your rifle. I have a semi rare Savage 220 Swift on the way or I'd keep it. I prefer Savage over just about any manufacture for a bolt gun. 

The Leupold can be added in for the right price, otherwise it will be $375. VX-3 3.5x40 and matches the rifle perfectly. Its about as classy of a combo as you can get for a Coyote/Predator rifle.

Serial numbers are on the receiver and the barrel, and they match.  Comes with nice leather sling, 95 rounds of new-production re-loadable ammo, bayonet, and cleaning accessories.

  Rifle has all-original parts from what I can tell.  1926 was the only year the Lange Vizier rear sight was used on this rifle, which makes it something of a rarity.  The stock has been re-finished in Tung oil, and is a perfect match to the original.  Most of the original bluing is gone, and there is some pitting on some of the metal parts, but nothing that will affect safety or functionality.

  I have not shot this rifle, so I cannot tell you how it groups.  The Crown looks good to me, and the strong rifling and good trigger makes me think that it'll be a pretty good shooter.

  The Bayonet appears to be a Model 1917, and has quite a bit of erosion on the blade, but is still functional and fits the very nicely.  One of the wood handles has a repaired crack.

  60 rounds of ammo are new-in-box, and 35 are reloads from a professional manufacturer, loaded to factory specs.  The cleaning supplies are some brand-new nylon and brass brushes, some used brushes, and an aluminum jag.

  Price is $200.00 even, and I am located in Conyers, GA.  I'm willing to travel about an hour to meet up, and do not want to ship.  Breakdown of price is $150.00 for the rifle, $40.00 for the ammo, $10.00 for the bayonet.  This model in similar shape seems to go for around $250-$350 by itself, and that's with the typical leaf sight from other production years."

KelTec P-3AT compact pistol chambered in .380 ACP. The P-3AT is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .380 Auto cartridge. It was been developed from Kel-Tec's highly successful P-32 pistol with negligible increase in weight and size. The slidestop has been eliminated and the magazine capacity reduced to 6 rounds due to the larger cartridge. The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 6 round capacity. The KEL-TEC P-3AT is the lightest .380 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-3AT is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-3AT ideal for female shooters. 

The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The blued slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular inner frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The grip is checkered black polymer. The overall weight, loaded, is an incredibly light 11.1 ounces. This pistol ships in a hard padded case.

Designed with versatility in mind, slots at the two, six, and ten o'clock positions allow the attachment of optional Picatinny rail sections and other accessories for mounting tactical lights, slings, grips, etc. Reinforced, heat-resistant polymer construction provides operational durability without the weight and expense of an aluminum rail hand guard. Front extensions and lower lip provides additional operator protection from hot front sight assembly.

About this rifle:
Starting in 1964, Marlin produced this variant of their popular Model 99 rimfire rifle, stylized to look and feel like the WWII- M1 Carbine. It has a standard 18-inch barrel, the same length as the M1. This also produced an overall length of 37-inches, within a bullet's length of the original. Since the Marlin was a .22LR and not a .30 carbine, the action and barrel were lighter, at 4.75-pounds. Forgoing the detachable box magazine of the M1, Marlin kept the under barrel tube mag but shortened it to hold just 10-rounds to keep the profile of the gun similar. A stock redesign and military style ramp sights completed the transformation.

Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection. It’s the pistol’s small size that makes it easy to carry concealed whether in a discreet holster, purse or on the ankle and yet the outstanding ergonomics of the grip design allow for comfortable shooting even in large hands. At under 23oz in the stainless version, the sleek single-stack P232 is a pleasure to carry throughout the day. No wonder it’s one of the premier off-duty guns carried by federal agents and law enforcement professionals today.  This model comes with the Hogue finger grove grips and siglite nite sights.

The R-108 is one of the later versions of the line, so it has the good ejector that is spring loaded for return (The early ones didn't have this and you had to manually return the ejector before closing the cylinder, or end up gouging the heck out of the frame). There is a light cylinder ring, and very little if any finish wear, this really is a nice one, gang.. The original birds head grips have no cracks or dings (kind of an oddity as well). My thought is that this is a very low round count handgun. Great little carry along for a walk in the woods, to keep in the nightstand, or any other reason to own a good shooting little .22. These short barrel versions are pretty scarce, and are bringing way too much money on Gunbroker. I would like to get $300 or thereabouts for this one.

The ""Taurus Judge®"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 3"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

It has been shot a dozen times (shoots beautifully) and cleaned thoroughly after each use.  There is some wear on the grip and butt stock.  The rifle comes with four magazines - a 5 round, 20 round, and two 30 round magazines.  The MAK-90 also comes with 220 rounds of 7.62x39 ammunition and a sling.

You know it is a A1 model because of the night sights on both rear and front sight post. It also has the original grenade launcher sights, and grenade launcher muzzlebreak. It really is a sweet shooter, and Ive been able to get 1 1/2 minute groups at 50 yards. Never was able to find a range longer than that to test, and those group swere done off hand standing. This is the brother of the Ak47 and in my opinion and loads of others far more accurate and reliable due to the barrel and milled receiver. Is in 7.62x39mm. I am looking for a more home defense firearm  which is why I am looking to part ways with this. I love it, I absolutely love shooting it, but I am looking for a pistol. Glocks, M&Ps mostly. Also may be interested in shotguns. Any other offers, still email me. I will reply and possibly accept your offer. I also have alot of ammo with it, to make up any difference in trade cost. Email, and we can discuss any and all offers."
