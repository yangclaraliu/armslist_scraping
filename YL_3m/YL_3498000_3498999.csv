The P230 is one of the most reliable back-up pistols available with a well-earned reputation as a rugged, accurate shooter. Its proven design of perfect balance, smooth contours and rounded, snag-free edges make it ideal for personal protection.

Product Information
Lyman 2-Cavity Bullet Molds are made from solid leaded-steel and machined to an exact and smooth super fine finish. The molds are then heat treated (that is why they are blue in color) and feature hardened steel alignment pins to provide many years of bullet casting service. Sprue plates are made from solid steel, ground flat and held tightly in place with tempered steel spring washers and screws. In addition, break-in is often half the time required for iron molds."

I've put 300 rounds though it. Past owner hunted with it twice. Never even broke it in.  It hasn't had a failure yet, which is better than my Ruger 10/22 surprisingly.   I just don't like having a ""fake ar15"".. I'd rather the real thing.  

$375. with iron sights, or $425 with red dot.  Comes with two magazines. 

It's a great little budget red dot by Bushnell( Retails around $100.) Best you can buy unless you bump up into the $300+ price range. Nutnfancy on youtube has several reviews on them.

The underfolding stock locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, the stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it."

The underfolding stock locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, the stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it."
