6,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3685006,For Sale/Trade:  *LOOK*  Redring Sight BRAND NEW (MSRP $899.00)  Will take $700.00 for sale or trade,"Edmond Area, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma",$ 700,"Listed On: Friday, November 7, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Redring shotgun sight was developed for use on any shotgun with a rail. The Redring helps beginners and seasoned shooters achieve better aim on the moving target and hit more targets successfully.

Unlike traditional sights sold on the market, the Redring features smart technology that allows the shooter to immediately take fast and instinctive shots with both eyes open. This sight is not for aiming, it’s for fast shotgun shooting. It gives the hunter another reference point to confidently bag the birds with less-to-zero collateral damage to game.

The features and benefits are packed into this compact, easy-to-use, parallax-free shotgun sight. For any shooter, including hunters, the Redring reads the backlight and adjusts the ring intensity to the prevailing light. On a dark background, such as in an early morning or dusk light condition, the ring light is weaker and in a bright background like bright sunlight, the ring light is stronger and more visible.
 Redring is also an effective rangefinder. The size of the ring on the target is equal to the shot diameter at 65 feet (20 meters). The shooter receives an instant indication when the target is within shooting range or if it is too far away for a sure shot. The results are more targets hit, more birds taken and less ammo wasted.
 The low profile Redring mounts quickly and easily on the rib of the gun. The sight does not need to be calibrated or sighted-in; it’s ready to go! The Redring comes with recoil absorbing mounts for shotguns with a rib width from 5 to 11.5mm.
 Because the anodized aluminum sight is lightweight there is no discernible effect on the weight or balance of the gun. An energy saving, shut-off function automatically shuts down the sight saving the Redring’s power after 4 hours of continuous on. The shut-off function can also be programmed to fit the shooter’s time afield or on the range.

It is a 70 series made in 1980. It has the cleanest crispest trigger of any handgun I have ever had the privilege of handling. To me it's the perfect size at 4.25"" it's just long enough to go shoot at the range, yet small enough to carry. It's set up with beautiful classic style wood grips almost as a homage to its heritage, the original Colt handgun that was a pivotal part in America winning both WW1 & WW2. At the end of the day, with all that being said, it's an amazing handgun simply because it's a Colt!

These aren't as common to my knowledge anymore, there's one currently up on gun broker for $1300 that was made a little after mine according to the serial number.(i can send the link upon request)

I'm only selling cause I'm looking for something new, I like black and I like tactical, with night sights. Honestly I'd love something around the size of mine that can be carried but isn't too small.

16"" 6.8 ARP Scout profile barrel- 4150 CMV: 4150 CMV 6.8 Scout profile barrel with a more accurate 6.8 ARP chamber and Hybrid 5R rifling 11.25 twist . 1lb-12oz M4 feed ramps, mid length gas system, .700 under the guard, .750 gas block dia. .700 dia from gas block to muzzle. 5/8-24 thread muzzle. Melonite treated barrels have proven to last 30% longer than chromelined barrels and are more accurate. Hi perf. chamber and barrel allow for ANY factory ammo to be used along with the hottest handloads. These 5R barrels usually produce 60-80fps more than the common 11 twist 4 groove barrels and are as fast as some 20"" barrels. These barrels are as accurate as any 6.8 barrels made, many report 1/2"" groups at 100yds with Hornady 110gr HPBT factory ammo. The 4150 11595E steel Melonite(QPQ) treated barrels we sell will last twice as long as stainless barrels-60 rockwell VS 28-30 of the stainless. The final finish meets or exceeds stainless steel corrosion resistance. 416 stainless barrels .980"" in diameter do not meet the 2:1 burst/hoop strength safety ratio required by the firearms industry standards in anything larger than the 5.56. We only use the stronger 4150 11595 E barrel steel in all of our barrels. 

6.8 9310 alloy superbolt & firing pin: Our bolts are not just a normal AR15 bolt design made from 9310 like most of the others on the market. We have taken the current AR15 bolt to the next level by completely redesigning the lug and cam pin area as well using a stronger 9310 Vac-ARC alloy to make this the most durable bolt on the market except our 800 series bolts. Notice the thicker web between the recess and the lugs and the larger radius at the root of the lugs. The area of attachment and strength was increased by 24%. 

M-16 Carrier or BCG: True Mil Spec M16 carrier, phosphate treated, chromelined bore(where bolt rides). Same carriers used in Colt, FN, and sold by BCM. BCG options below include carrier, bolt, firing pin , cam pin, and firing pin retainer."

Hi there. Made the decision to switch back to 9mm. Got rid of my Glock 23, and now I'm looking to get rid of the Glock 22 as well. I am looking to trade for a Glock 17 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com) 

Comes with everything in the original box. 5 mags (3 factory, 2 extended 31 round), lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me."

I have approximately had about 500 rounds through this rifle with the majority of those rounds being slow controlled shots at long range. I broke in the barrel like I do with all my rifles (is it needed probably not but I do it anyways). Its an incredibly accurate rifle easily capable with sub-MOA groups (the .223 Wylde chambering is great) as long as you are doing your part. I was able to hit 16"" ringers out at 200-300yds with ease.

Also being a piston driven platform, the bolt and carrier have always stayed immaculate (although I never let more than 2 range trips go by without a thorough cleaning).

The 0560BW retains its ELMAX® powdered steel for the extreme edge retention, high strength, and toughness a hard-use knife demands.

The handle is basic black 3-D machined G-10 on the front, and lightweight, strong 3-D machined titanium on the back. The titanium frame lock, with steel lockbar insert and lockbar stabilizer, ensures a rock-solid lockup every time.

G-10/410 front handle, 410 black oxide back, SpeedSafe assisted opening, RJ Martin designed.

BlackWash™ Gives the Scrambler a Cool New Look 

The Scrambler is a cool and classy knife to begin with. But now Kershaw has added an extra measure of cool with our BlackWash finish. BlackWash gives a knife that already-broken-in look—like a favorite well-worn pair of jeans. The coating also provides an extra measure of protection for the metal and helps hide any additional scratches you may put on the knife during normal use.

Designed by RJ Martin, the Scrambler’s drop-point blade is hollow-ground so it breezes through slicing tasks, while the large flat-ground top swedge adds to its good looks.

The blade steel offers strength and good edge retention. All the metal on the knife—blade, front bolster, and handle back are BlackWash finished. The comfortable, secure-grip handle features textured G-10 on the front side and a sturdy frame lock on the other. The bolster is extended to provide forefinger protection and to ensure the knife sits firmly in the hand during use.

The Scrambler opens quickly and easily with the ambidextrous flipper and SpeedSafe assisted opening. It includes a reversible pocketclip for left- or right-handed carry.

Hi there. Made the decision to switch back to 9mm. Got rid of my Glock 23, and now I'm looking to get rid of the Glock 22 as well. I am looking to trade for a Glock 17 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com) 

Comes with everything in the original box. 5 mags (3 factory, 2 extended 31 round), lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me."

It is a great weapon and very accurate, even with old ammo. The picture below is at 350 yds and it holds that grouping. One slipped away but hey it happens. The weapon itself has the archangel pro mag stock. I did not drill and tap a scope mount, instead I found a manufacturer in Arizona who found away around that. Its a receiver wrap mount which I was weary about at first, but after I have put round after round and kick after kick it has held strong and not moved. The scope is a Vortex Crossfire II rifle-scope. Long eye relief, fast focus and quickly adjustable to your needs. The adjustable cheek rest is great for this so you can have perfect sight alignment, no matter the case. Around 400 rounds of ammo and two 5 round mags as well. I purchased a custom bolt because I needed the bent type. Now this was made with new grade aluminum and cast to replicate the original bent bolt design of the PU type rifles. Flawless action. Now the piece I had made was just the bolt handle, the rest of the bolt is original. Still have that as well if wanted, as well as the wooden stock. I will say I love this system and not really wanting to sell unless the offer is right. I know most people wouldn't dump the money I did on a mosin but i did. I had it valued and priced so I know what its worth. Almost the same value estimates from 4 different FFL dealers...3 in Ohio and one in Kentucky. If you have a Pistol AK or a simple and standard AR you would consider trading? Let me know or if you have an offer in cash, im all ears. Just curious to see whats out there..any questions feel free to ask. Thanks. REDACTED kinsey"

It was an impulse buy, I thought ""agh what the hell"" but I don't know I have a need for it lol everything functions exactly as it should. The only thing ""wrong"" with it are that the screws were a tad too tight from the factory and my little screw driver slipped a couple times trying to loosen it. The minor damage is showed in the last picture. I know I'm gonna lose a little here but I'm firm at $175. Let me know if there is any interest in this.

This belonged to my 76 year old father who purchased it brand new. The date code on the gun is 05 93 for May 93 and it was made in Germany. I don't think the new ones are made in Germany. This has the T01 trigger which is adjustable. The stock is near perfect and I can't find any marks on it. The blue on the gun is in very good shape with a small rub mark on the bottom of the trigger housing. My dad kept it in a padded case and rarely shot it. I would say my dad didn't put more than a 100 pellets through it. About 11yrs ago he was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease so he shook too much to shoot it and it sat in his closet. There is no surface rust either. $160.00 + actual shipping.

Heritage Rough Rider Limited Edition Civil War CSA Georgia 22LR / 22Mag Combo Single Action Revolver Blue With 6.5 Inch Barrel In Commemorative Box. New Heritage 22 Mag Cylinder Also Included.

Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state- of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.

The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.
