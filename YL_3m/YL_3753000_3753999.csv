This is reported to be at least 15 years old, with an amazing grouping of classic and collectable knives that would be the envy of any Swiss Army Knife collector.  The display case is 3 sided and rotates on the attached base with a ball bearing mount.  Due to the age, most of the original stickers have come loose, but are included with the display(preserved on waxed paper), and can be reattached with spray adhesive if  you desire.  The case itself is in great condition as you can see from the photos.  If you were to go to the Victorinox website and purchase these items individually (some are discontinued models) you would pay over $1,200 for the knives alone, plus taxes, shipping and handling feesâ¦.and the display (no longer available from Victorinox) sells for $300 or more IF you can find on in the secondary market.  So to recreate this display would cost at least $1700 or moreâ¦.and it wouldnât be original, like this one.
Here is a listing of the knives and accessories included in the display case.  They are attached by doublesided tape, and there are a couple of items that could use straightening and reattaching (beginning to come loose), but they are all currently fastened as from the factory.

Built on an NDS-5 reciever with a buldged trunnion. I believe the finish is parkerized.

Comes with a LPS 4x6 Tip 2 PSL scope (non-illuminated model) that includes the rubber eyepiece and lens cover. A side rail was added that FITS BOTH AK-Style AND PSL-Style SCOPES! The only real negative about this is that the rivet heads are unfinished, which is an easy fix..

Has custom maple furniture that is slightly oversized for more grip area, I found the handle to be uncomfortable to me so I swapped it out for a standard M70 grip. The stock has a very comfortable raised cheek rest to use with the scope, but makes it a little difficult to use the iron sights.

The muzzle device is also unique, it's a FAL browning-type flash hider that has been welded (very cleanly) to a cut-off muzzle device in the proper 14x1 LH thread. It makes for a very effective flash suppressor, plus it looks great by giving the rifle a very DMR look.

The rifle has recently been looked over and checked by Texas Shooter Supply in Spring, TX to ensure it is safe and functional. They even removed the previously modded trigger group and added an improved Tapco G2 that they did themselves, the gun has a very light and quick break, fully single stage.

I am the second owner, it has a fairly low round count and the barrel is in very good condition with sharp lands and a shiny bore. The barrel is non-chrome lined Yugo Milsurp.
Comes with 3 magazines and a set of milsurp Zastava handguards plus the original matched maple grip. Leather sling.

Zeiss scope in the pictures is NOT included!!

Rifle has less than 100 rounds through it and is in almost perfect condition.  Few very slight marks on the stock and some slight wear near the tip of the forend near the sling stud from hunting.  Check pictures for details, very hard to get them to show up.

Other than that, this gun is in pristine shape with a gorgeous fancy grade walnut stock.  MOA trigger is set to around 3 pounds and breaks like glass.  Fantastic rifle, just more power than I need for the hunting I do.  Great chance to pick up a basically new Super Grade at a reduced price!

I accept payment only through money order or Paypal, Paypal is preferred.  Will only ship to licensed FFL after receiving a signed copy of their license.  Buyer pays fixed shipping cost.  Also willing to sell locally for cash of course.

An all original 1927 post-converted dragoon model and a 1942 sporterized model. 

I am selling everything in the picture as one bundle. I have spent far more than the price I am listing everything as. The only reason I didn't list it at 750 or so is because of the more rare 1927 hex receiver model I have. 

I am open to splitting the two up and working out a different package. But everything that comes with it will be split down the middle too. I am not selling a rifle without what it comes with. I am emptying myself from Mosin's altogether and focusing on an AR-10 build. EVERYTHING needs to go.

Does amazing work. Both rifles cycle very nicely. While I do have fun and love them a lot, I have more pressing things I need to use the money for. 

I have actually had offers at the private range I attend for the 1927. Definitely sought after.  

The Scope is a Sight Mark 8.5-25x50. It has light up green and orange cross hairs and originally it was $300. I also have 2 cheap bipods I tried with it. They both work, I just had different ideas. The only thing not pictured is I also have the original oil cans and field kits too for them, and the snake for the barrel. 

The 3 cans of ammo are the correct 7.62x54r and are Bulgarian silver tip. Steel core rounds. Most ammo for this gun was

Based on this number the manufacture date is somewhere around 7/1918.  However, the barrel is stamped 10/18, so it might actually be closer to that.

This rifle appears to be unaltered and complete, except for a sling and the sling swivels which are missing.  From what I can see, without stripping the gun down, the barrel (5 groove), receiver and parts directly connect to those items are all marked ""R"" (Remington).  The front portion of the stock and rear swivel mount are marked ""E"" (Eddystone).  The bolt ""celebrates the diversity of the manufacturers"" - the bolt handle is marked ""W"" (Winchester), the rear cap is marked ""E"" and one other visibly part is marked ""R"".  

The metal seems to be polished with a certain level of bluing, although is seems rather gray.  There appears to be no serious rust, probably due to its nickel steel.  The proof marks and acceptance stamps are all quite clear.  The stock has a lot of dings, dents, nicks and a couple plugs, but, no cracks.

It doesn't appear that it has gone through an arsenal rebuild program.  If it did it was at least spared the Parkerized sandblast and refinish, except for the rear cap on the bolt.

My son got it from a friends dad with the intention of turning it into a hunting rifle.  I believed he fired a couple shots through it.  

It is hardly perfect, ""Good"" condition (maybe?), but I hope it's nice enough that someone might want to preserved for its historical value.  It was the predominate US rifle in WW I and most likely the type my Grandfather and his brother carried.

This shotgun is in good condition.  The metal / bluing has a few minor scratches and some minor rust spots.  Inside of the barrel is shiny and clean.  Overall the metal work is pretty good.  The finish on the butt stock has been worn off on some of the edges and scratch off in several other places.  The forend looks fine. 

This was my youngest sons first shotgun.  He has since bought a new one, so it is time to pass this one on to a new owner.

You must have ID / WDL and be eligible under State law to possess a firearm.

P.S.  I took it out to test fire it and find that it periodically does not eject the empty correctly.  To my eyes everything seems to be where it sould be.  I wanted to have the gunsmith look at it but he is unavailable until after the ""trading deadline"", so I have opted to note the problem and lower the price."

Ideal for women, or young people with tight clothing.Very easy to disassemble and clean, very simple construction with only few moving parts.This Handgun is in great condition its very accurate and had less than 50 rounds trough it. Its been functioning flawlessly, without any problems.literally no recoil and excellent accuracy on 25 yards.Caliber .25 with hallow point personal defense rounds, its the way to go if your are concern about the size, weight and easy concealing.Compared to full size handguns and they all weight around or over 2.5 lbs with the full 15 rounds magazine.

Online research:Â ""In other states for example (ct) there have been six self-defense shootings employing the MP-25 over the last 20 years. All six have been fatal for the attacker. At 100% fatality rate, this weapon exceeds both the .45ACP and .357 magnum for lethality. Obviously simple is too small to draw any real conclusions, but it is important to note that 6 rounds of .25 at close range means a lot of blood lost for the bad guy.""With todays boom in ammunition prices, this is a cheap modern self defense .25 bullet can make a lot of damage.Gun Review: Raven MP-25 Semi-automatic pistol""Raven MP-25 has a tumultuous history and remains a controversial piece of the American firearms scene.

I have a like new Smith and Wesson 1911 ScE scandium framed Bobtail Commander with blued slide and very nice scaled factory grips. It has the original box, papers, bushing wrench, two mags (1 with bumper) and fairly bright night-sights.  It shoots great, looks new, and I hate it.  I picked it up because I wanted to give it a good home, but I prefer Glocks now and I can't stand the 1911 ergonomics any more.  

If you would like to give this poor, lonely 1911 a loving home, it can be yours for a $975 rehoming fee.

Or I will trade the 1911 for a Glock plus cash, or two Glocks.  I like the following Glocks, but I'll consider any trade offer that isn't another 1911.
Gen4 G19, G17, G22, G26, G27, G30, G29, G21, G20, G35, G41 plus $300 to $350 depending on the model

If you have accessories for the Glock, I'll consider them in lieu of part or all of the additional cash.

I also like S&W N-framed and L-framed revolvers, K-framed snubbies, Leverguns, and 45colt revolvers (except Judges).

The photo of the 1911 ScE is a stock photo from S&W, but mine looks exactly like it, and is in like new condition.  If you are interested I can take pictures of the gun and email them to you."
