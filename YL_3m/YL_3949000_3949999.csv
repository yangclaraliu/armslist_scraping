With the new Ultra Safety Assurance (U.S.A.) action trigger system, this polymer framed pistol is as comfortable as it is safe.
The XD's frame is made from a proprietary polymer material that has produced a pistol that is extremely durable, reliable and lighter than popular competitive models.
The frame is checkered in front and rear for a more positive grip, even with wet or sweaty hands. The XD's also have a slide release, ambidextrous magazine release button, and a quick turn disassembly lever, allowing for amazingly fast and simple field-stripping."

125,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3949125,For Sale:  Custom Panfish Ice Fishing Rod,"Argos, Marshall County, South Bend, Indiana",$ 15,"Listed On: Friday, January 23, 2015",Fishing,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Finding another half this good would be difficult let alone at this price. You won't be disappointed.  I've had several offers to buy it on the ice but I didn't need the funds then.

I bought a pair of these 10 years ago and only fish maybe 3-4 times a winter so it's hardly abused.  Glass blank spiral wrapped in carbon fiber. Cork grip. Neon colored rod tip. Custom finish and high end work on this rod. 56 inches long.

Very slow action that makes a 5 inch bluegill fun as heck and enough backbone to land medium sized bass on 2lb line.
Spring bobber on it is as light as anything out there. A No 10 jig takes the spring half way to the pole or more.  When they are just nibbling, you'll see the bite.

Selling because, as said, I have two and another I use more that is longer and in a ""pinch"" till payday (once a month) and if not sold  by the time I come into a few bucks it will be deleted here.

I paid 40 dollars for each 10 years ago. THEN added the reel and the spring bobber.
15 dollars is firm and a steal for this class of rod.
Lower offers will be ignored. Sorry if that seems rude.
Pick up only.  Southern Marshall County. 20 miles from  S. Bend right down 31.
Again........this needs to sell and sell immediately or it will no longer be FOR sale. Selling ONLY due to financial need. (Old , retired, poor. LOL)

This is a very fun way to shoot 9mm. The metal parts are in good condition as well as the wood, outside of a few handling marks (see photos). I recently fired 200 rounds though this carbine and it fired everything I put in it: Steel case, aluminum case, a lot of brass, hollow points, FMJ, etc. Not a single problem. What a conversation piece!

*** Watch this video of this rifle shooting.

What you are getting:
Marlin 9mm Camp Carbine with hooded front sight.
One 12 round Marlin stamped factory magazine that reads ""MARLIN 4 Shot"" however it actually holds 12 rounds.
One 20 round Marlin stamped factory magazine that reads ""MARLIN 9mm"". These exact magazines were only produced from 1985-1989 so they are hard to find and $75-$100 when you can find them.
One Marlin Branded 1.5-5x Post Reticle scope with Weaver brand see though rings, so you can still do fast acquisition using the iron sights. This was $125 used. Also hard to find.

This may be a once in a lifetime total package! I already spent the time and labor hunting down the additional MARLIN magazine and MARLIN scope to complete this unique package.

BARREL: Approximately 16.5"" barrel with good bore and rifling. The total length of the carbine is approximately 35"" and only 6 lbs., making it light and ideal for a ""Camp Rifle"".


ACTION: Very smooth and crisp action. This was test fired and worked well for me.

MAGAZINE: Two factory MARLIN stamped magazines. A 12 round and a 20 round.

HISTORY:
The Marlin Camp Carbine is a auto-loading carbine chambered for either 9mm Parabellum (or .45 ACP), formerly manufactured by Marlin Firearms Company of North Haven, Connecticut. The carbine started production in 1985 and has been discontinued since 1999.
As the name implies, it was designed as a utility firearm to be used around hunting camps for foraging or defense. The 9mm Parabellum uses the same magazines as popular handguns in this calibers, in keeping with a convenient American tradition of having a carbine and handgun using common ammunition. The carbine operates by direct blowback. Usually, the receiver is drilled and tapped for a scope mount. The stock was made of walnut-finished Maine birch.
The Camp 9 Carbine uses a detachable magazine that inserts into the magazine well in front of the trigger guard. The Camp-9 rifle magazine can be replaced by magazines from 59-series S&W pistols. The Camp-9 magazine well is sized for 12-round magazines; magazines with higher capacities extend beyond the bottom of the well. A 20-round magazine was produced, but discontinued in 1989.

I went from being very inaccurate with it to having a nice lightweight carry gun I can trust to hit my target. I am just more of a 1911 style guy and though I have become accurate with this smooth double action trigger, I just prefer to keep all of my carry guns single action. Truth be told I often carry this one because it is so easy to conceal and so light instead of my much nicer custom 1911s.

REMINGTON 27950 PREMIER 300RUM 150GR SCIROCCO 20 Rds AMMUNITION PR300UM5

A break-through line of big game ammunition that combines many of the best performance features developed over the last half-century. The remarkable Swift™ Scirocco Bonded bullet which combines polymer tip ballistics with weight retention is unquestionably the most advanced polymer tipped bullet ever to sit atop a factory load. Of course, our precision loading process — using the finest available components — ensures that it’s delivered with quality unmatched by any other brand.The Scirocco cut-away shows how the unique combined design features make our new Premier Scirocco line some of the most versatile and reliable big-game ammunition offered today. The expansion-generating polymer tip and the boat tail base combine to defy air resistance at the front end, and reduce drag at the back. The progressively thickening, heavy-based, pure copper jacket is bonded to the lead core to preserve bullet integrity and retain over 75% of its weight at all velocities. Finally, the bullet’s precise concentricity and secant ogive nose profile produce accuracy you would be proud of in match competition.
Premier Core-Lokt Ultra Bonded and Swift Scirocco bullets are in a class off their own. Bonded bullets offers hunters the unique combination of excellent accuracy, superb weight retention and expansion with overall superior terminal results.

An open notch rear sight with luminous (non-radioactive) contrast points allows for fast and accurate target acquisition, even under poor lighting conditions.

Gun is in great condition,  no wear marks.  Has less than 500 rounds through it.
$1100,  yes the gun retails around 1000,  but a threaded barrel from Jarvis will add $300,  plus whatever for the G10 grips,  plus I’m throwing in the stock barrel as well.
I can negotiate but pretty firm,  any negotiation would have to reduce the package, no G10 grips, no extra barrel etc.

She is a genuine ex-sniper Mosin Nagant PU Sniper dated to the end of WW2 era 1944 and will make a great addition to your collection ""as is"" or could very easily be converted back into an original PU Sniper Mosin with the addition of a SVT scope. This Mosin rifle has an Izhevsk marked Russian ""Hammer & Sickle"" high wall receiver (the only receiver type chosen as suitable for a true sniper). She has been refinished to very good condition and has a ""smoothed up"" crisp light trigger action and an absolutely beautiful wood grain stock. This PU Sniper Mosin HAS NOT been counter-bored and the bore shines with excellent clear and deep rifling. The original scope mount holes in the receiver have been arsenal filled but could be easily tapped out if one desired to convert her back into an original sniper PU rifle with SVT scope and base mount. The possibilities are limitless with this base genuine PU bent bolt ex-sniper Mosin Nagant rifle. I tried to take many close up pictures to accurately capture the fine craftsmanship found on this historic Russian PU Sniper. The wood stock is in excellent condition and you can clearly ""see"" the cutout and professional repair for where they had previously mounted a sniper scope to the receiver. This wood repair could easily be removed to facilitate another scope installation or makes for a fine conversation piece when sharing the history of this rifle with your friends. Again, many possibilities exist with this unique ex-sniper bent bolt combination. Feel free to ask any questions. I will ship to C&R holders or to your FFL if desired. As you may have noticed, the importation of all Mosin Nagants has dried up considerably and genuine Sniper PU Mosins are almost impossible to find anywhere anymore. As such this de-commissioned ex-Sniper Mosin will likely become a fine investment.

It will come with everything it did new (Box / Manual / Backstraps / 2 - 13rd Magazines) I will consider firearms plus cash or preferably a Glock 19 Gen 4 with a Remington 870 Tac / Mossberg 500 / Ruger 10/22 with cash coming from me depending on what you have. Below are a few items that I would be interested in.

This Russian laminate stock is gorgeous to behold when the sunshine reflects off the laminated grain! The laminated wood stock on this particular Mosin Nagant is in truly excellent condition as is the very well preserved metalwork including bolt and bore - she looks almost new but is incredibly over 80 years old! This Mosin HAS NOT been counter-bored.  I have seen very few Mosins that rate as high in excellent condition representing the finest of old school Russian quality craftsmanship.  Please note that the bayonet numbering does not match.  I have taken many close up pictures to capture how special this particular Mosin truly is (unfortunately I can only list 5 here on Armslist so email or text for additional pics)  I have seen very few Mosins that rate as high in excellent condition representing the finest of old school Russian quality craftsmanship.  I will ship to C&R holders or to your FFL if out of state.  Also, you may have noticed that the supply of Mosin Nagants has dried up dramatically since the Russian/Ukraine crisis erupted.  Importers are also saying the well is dry.  Mosins, especially one of this superior quality with both the highly desirable Tula + HEX receiver and laminated stock , should be a great investment. 

Nagant's History and General Description: 

Russian M91/30 Mosin Nagant Rifle 7.62x54r caliber, 5 round Bolt Action. Mother Russia's most historically proven early battle rifle and our most popular selling rifle by far. And why not, these fine rifles have been meticulously refinished in Russian arsenals before release for export and they look great. Not only are they 100% functional, but they have a reputation for being reliable, hard hitting, and extremely accurate. The 7.62x54r round was the Warsaw Pact heavy caliber from the early 20's until modern day, so surplus ammunition is very plentiful and extremely affordable. This renown cartridge is more powerful than a .308 and ballistically rivals our 30/06 caliber. This round is more than adequate for harvesting any Big Game animal in North America. Rifle is extremely accurate up to 300 plus yards with open sights and is capable of accuracy out to 1000 yards with proper optics. Without a doubt the Mosin Nagant M91/30 provides by far the most bang for the buck of any rifle on the market today. Here you have a gorgeous rifle both rich in history and yet still more than capable of taking any big game in North America at respectable yardage, fires affordable ammo, and can be obtained for less that the price of a high end pellet rifle or 22.

I got this pistol in a multi gun trade from one of my best friends. Low round count.

I added the night sights, took it to the indoor range, then cleaned and it's been in the box in the safe ever since. The night sights are Meprolight Tru Dot ML-102240 orange rear, green front and very bright. Look them up for more info. ($80 including installation). 
Comes with factory box, papers, and three (3) fifteen (15) round magazines. I have plenty of pictures if seriously interested.
Must have CCP or purchase permit stamped by sheriffs dept, but prefer CCP. Bill of sale and all laws will apply. MUST meet in Burlington. 
NO TRADE OFFERS PLEASE, CASH ONLY. I can accept $400 , ;but I will take off night sights and reinstall the factory ones. Night sights are easily sold on ebay for $50-70."

This is a real tack driver for a great price and is fun to shoot. If you like the metallic sound of silhouettes falling you’ll love this weapon.
It has a 24” crowned, bull barrel with 1:10 twist, free floating in a Michaels of Oregon stock. The trigger is match grade and breaks very nicely. 
The optics are a Springfield Armory Gen 2 Government scope with built in range finder, .308 Bullet drop compensator and internal bubble level to eliminate any canting of the system on those long shots (selling for $750 on ebay). With this scope you don’t have to take your eye off the target to determine range and ensure there is no cant in your hold. When I took it out to the range the first day, I shot the groups you see below at 100 yards and I am not the best shot.
The weapon comes with a Harris bi-pod, Leupold scope mount and rings, Eagle shooting mat, Dewey cleaning rods and bore alignment tool to ensure you don’t scratch the barrel during cleaning.
The sale also comes with the original Savage stock in which the barrel is pillar mounted if you decide to go back to basics. I’ll also throw in the .50 cal ammo can to help organize your trip to the range.  I’ve put about 75 rounds through this system, which is just about enough to break it in.
Asking $950 for everything.  Please text Dan at 614-four two zero-0309. Face to face cash transactions only please."
