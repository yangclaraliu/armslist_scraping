AYM production. 

This rifle has the uncommon AYM production code that denotes it was manufactured in Slovakia, town of Považská Bystrica.  The very first run of the M-52 or VZ-52 were produced in this plant in 1952; production moved after only one year.  This is an early production gun.  

Although all VZ-52 rifles are uncommon, the most prevalent marking are from the Czechoslavakia SHE plant production.  Overall, all VZ-52 rifles are very difficult to find and very collectible. 

This rifle is good overall condition.  Tight bolt action, clean barrel, and nice rifling.  The unique folding bayonet operates as well.  The stock has been ""refurbished"" or painted black; I think this was done by the importer (fairly common).  Stock can be stripped to reveal the original wood if desired.  

Weapon is in original 7.62 X 45 caliber (some were re-chambered in the more common 7.62 X 39), and this gun also has original barrel length at approximately 20.5"". 

10 round clip included. 

Again, this is a unique opportunity to own a rare production of a fairly scare rifle

One of my safe queens, time to part as I would like to see a few other guns in the safe. This is a legit 9mm MP5 not that 22lr look alike. Made by Turner Fabrications who has been making MP5's for a long damn time, its the closest you will get to an Genuine HK MP5 without taking out a second Mortgage! Note, HK does not make MP5's anymore, they havent for awhile, finding one for sale is near impossible, and if you do, it is going to cost $5k-$7k. This thing is in perfect condition and functions flawlessly.

$2,700 cash or trades listed below. You will pay over $3,500 to buy all this new after its all said and done, Get mine and save atleast $800. This MP5 is Built by Turner Fabrications and comes with signed letter of authenticity. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So here it is:
-There is one on Gunbroker right now being sold by Turner Fabrications for $3,100(Gun and 1 Mag!):
http://www.gunbroker.com/Auction/ViewItem.aspx?Item=461182104

-Also at Turner Fabrications website for $2,999(Gun and 1 Mag!):
http://www.turnfab.com/9mm-Standard-Three-Lug-pistol-German-Parts-9mm-standard.htm

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Barrel Threaded 1/2x28 and 3-Lug for multiple suppressor mounting options.

-NAVY SEF trigger group/housing (this MP5 shoots Semi-Auto ONLY tho)

-Has a ""Action 3"" bolt group with F style bolt carrier, this means it will fire F/A with a NFA Registered F/A Trigger pack. These bolt groups are banned from further importation and cost about $1,000, check hkparts.net to confirm for yourself. Couple this with a registered F/A Sear installed in a F/A pack and your ready to blast rounds. Obviously NFA Rules apply if you take this route, and it costs $$$.

-MFI Low Profile claw mount($130)

-1 HK 30rnd Mag
-2 additional KCI 4th Gen 30rnd Mags ($20 ea)

-Brand New Tactical Folding stock($140). Was going to SBR it, but decided to hold off.

This is a J Stevens Pocket Pistol in 22 long I believe. I put a 22 long cartridge in it and it fits but didn't try and shoot it because dad had a tag on it that said too old to shoot, black powder wall hanger only. I looked it over and it seems like everything works and the bore looks nice as do the grips. Some of the nickle looks to be worn off but looks like a nice conversation piece. Looks to be about 1880's being the production number so that would put it in the Black Powder era. The firearm absolutely has to be transferred to you and the paper work done as I Prefer to sell FTF at an FFL only. Don't really want to ship but if you absolutely need to it would be shipped from my FFL to your FFL ONLY! The Gun Broker in Oregon on 82nd is where the fire arm will be sent from.

I have a Crossbreed holster in good condition that I can include with the purchase if the offer is right. The holster has the ""action cut"" which allows gun to be removed quickly. You can also tuck your shirt in and wear the holster.

Let's play who is the moron.  Here are your options:1. the idiot that lists on Armslist a used version of this firearm for $$$$ more than what I am asking for BNIB;2. the guy that pays that for the used one; or3. me for selling brand new fireams at such incredibly low prices.My wife picks #3 (but for totally unrelated reasons).NIB Armscor AK-47 Style .22lr Semi-automatic rifle with beautiful hardwood stock 10rd mag w/Lifetime Warranty. From the same manufacturer that brought us the Rock Island 1911. The MAK22 is a .22 Long Rifle equipped with an 18.25 inch barrel and blue finish wood stock pistol grip. The stock magazine is 10 rounds with an option to upgrade to a 15 round. The AK22 is outfitted with a post front sight and an open U-notch with elevation adjustments. Very few in stock.  This is a cosmetic copy of the AK.  None of the parts are interchangable with a real AK.  They have been making pretty much this same gun for over 30 years.  It is very reliable.  You can find 25 round mags on the internet.  The gun is perfect.  The streaks shown on the metal are from the light coat of oil put on by the factory.  It wipes off.  Photos were literally taken right after the box was opened. Here is a link to a video I put together on this rifle and the very similar M1600.  I was having all types of problems with the camera, so please tolerate the amatuer nature of the video: https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=rn8FqootQwI   I sell new firearms with full manufacter's warranties for less then many dealers are asking for used guns. The name of the game is inventory turnover. I am not looking for customers stupid enough to pay a sucker's price. Check everyone else's price, and then if you are serious about buying, give me a call. I have the lowest prices in the Greater Tampa Bay Area. You might find lower, but only if you are willing to travel to PullmyChain, North Dakota. I even beat most of the National Internet dealers, and will save you the cost of paying shipping and a transfer fee (assumes you are a local buyer). Out-of-State (non-Florida) sales made easy. Will ship to other FFL(s),  including even the crazy law State of CALIFORNIA (only  if the particular gun is on the California State list of approved firearms) - Before you buy, make sure you can legally own this firearm where you reside.

The pistol is in like new condition with only 60 rounds down the barrel and most of its life spent laying in the safe. As you can see from the photos the original gold grease is still on the slide and frame rails (not a lot as I tend to clean this off as soon as I purchase new) and not a scratch on the pistol. I am including in the trade the following: Glock 22 gen 3 with factory case, lock, paperwork, factory fired casing, two mags, cleaning rod, and a Blackhawk paddle holster. I am interested in trading the above for a factory configuration gen 3 or 4 Glock 23, 32, or 26 ONLY. If trading for a 32 or 26 I will throw in the full box of Hornady Critical Duty. As you can see from the photos I also have a Bersa Firestorm .22 with the factory box, paperwork, fired casing, two mags, trigger lock, gun key for internal lock, wrap around Bersa one piece grip with finger grooves (not factory) and roughly 300 rounds of Remington .22 ammo. I will include this in the trade if your pistol has plenty of extras such as nights sights, extra mags, etc. I hate to do this but I'm sure someone will ask so: No I will not trade my stock Glock that costs the same new as the above listed trade models for your Glock and the .22. I will trade the Glock with holster for a clean stock 32, 23, or 26 in the same condition. Again if you have extras equaling the value of the .22 we can work out a deal, I'm more than reasonable. I will drive up to 20 minutes from the Mason area to meet. CCW preferred. If interested or if you would like further pictures please reply to ad or text me only at 513-six-three0-6551.

REMINGTON ARMS COMPANY, LE DIVISION
Important differences between Remington 870 Police and 870 Express shotguns
The 870 Express has been an important part of Remington’s offering to the sporting market.
It was designed to meet a price point in the commercial market while still providing classic 870 functionality.
All of Remington’s 870’s have interchangeable parts, even if they have cosmetic differences.
It is also important to note that many manufacturers use the 870 Express platform for their Police / Combat models.
Without exception, every manufacturer who utilizes our 870 platform serves to upgrade their system to a more efficient, street worthy platform.
While the 870 Express is still an 870, the best pump shotgun on the market, there are some very important cosmetic and functional differences between it and the 870 Police.
To our customers in Law Enforcement, Military, Corrections, and Security, whose lives depend upon the unfailing performance of Remington shotguns, the Police modifications are of paramount importance. Synopses of the variances are provided below.

• 870 Police shotguns go thru a special 23 station check list – ranging from visual inspection, functional testing, test firing, and final inspection.

• All Police shotguns are assembled in a “special build area” at the plant in Ilion, NY. This section is secured and serves only to build LE and Military shotguns, with the same factory personnel working at that assignment each shift.

• All parts that enter the “special build area” are visually inspected by hand to ensure top quality and functionality.

• Due to heavy recoil in buck and slug loads, all 870 Police guns have a longer magazine spring which ensures positive feed and function.

• A heavier sear spring is used to generate a reliable, positive trigger pull between 5 and 8 lbs.

• A heavier carrier dog spring is used to ensure when the carrier elevates the shell, it will be held there until the bolt can push it into the chamber. This ensures positive feeding when using heavier payload rounds.

• Police shotguns do not have an ISS (Integrated Safety System) which is a locking mechanism on the safety of commercial shotguns. This type of locking mechanism can cause delay to an officer who needs the weapon but does not have the appropriate key. LE shotguns have the standard, proven, cross bolt safety.

MSRP
$1,662.00 USD 
Presenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.
The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.
Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson.  The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for conceal ability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish. Stopping power is not a concern.
If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed."

About as short as you want an AR pistol at 7.75"".  At this short of a length you should look to piston driven systems like an AK rifle for various reasons having to do with the gas porting.  There are cheaper piston rifle designs than Primary Weapons Systems (PWS) that use a metal-on-metal and a short stroke piston design that is intrinsically flawed -- The gas should drive a LONG STROKE piston - NO banging metal on metal, period.
