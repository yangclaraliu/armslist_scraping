I have the following for sale or trade.
romanian psl with correct scope* in great condition *
2 10rd magazines
about 400 rds of 7.62x54r silver tip ammo.

As you probably know if your looking at this post this gun is extremely rare nowdays, I'm looking to sale or trade it, I do have just a few items I'm looking at trading.  Now, if you look these up, 5-8 years ago these went for
right near $800 and as some of you know, these rifles are now going for $1200 in rough shape to $1600 in good shape.

This gun does shoot the excellent 7.62x54r ammo, why is it great you ask? Mainly because it's the same ammo you can get for a mosin Nagano rifle, it's cheap, very good, and very abundant, this gun is essentially a heavy duty ak rifle that shoots a huge round...  this gun was designed to engage targets at greater distances than the ak47 but at less distances than the ""sniper rifles"" thus making this classified as a dmr or designated marksman rifle..

The 10rd box magazines make ripping off multiple shots pretty easy, the heavy hitting 7.62x54r is a much better round than many people think, you can easily get 4-700 yards with this rifle with just a bit of patience and skill.  

This brings me to trades and value, what am I looking for you may ask?

I'm looking for the following.
arsenal ak in 7.62x39 or 5.45x39 with magazines/ammo.
very nice converted saiga ak47/74 rifle with ammo and mags. (Would take .223 saiga if nice and converted with ammo and mags)
vepr 12 with mags and ammo

You can offer other things, but I will likely say no unless it's an interesting combloc rifle (NO SKS rifles please!) Or something like a glock 17 long slide and 9mm ammo and mags.  

I already have a nice saiga 12, so unless it's a extremely nice saiga 12 or vepr 12.

I value this firearm at around *PRICE DROP* $1200 cash/ $1300 trade... I AM negotiable to an extent, please make an offer, but do NOT ask me what my bottom dollar is..

Trade Value $400 NOT ACCEPTING CASH AT THIS TIME
I have a S&W Shield 9mm with No Thumb safety for trade at this time. My Shield will come with everything it did new and has had 75 rounds through it. I am entertaining the idea of trading this Shield due to me wanting a 26 or 19 to replace it as a vehicle gun. This Shield is in great shape and has very few rounds through it due to it not being my primary Shield that I carry. It has set in a kydex holster after being shot at one range outing to ensure function check. Obviously if trade is worth more cash/trade will be negotiated but am not looking for a $600 Glock with tons of work being done to it.

Comes with original box, manual, lock, and three factory 14-round stainless Para mags. This is one of the few 14-round 1911s out there.

This is a new-era Para, built in Charlotte at the new factory where quality has improved immensely over the old days. I was so impressed with this gun in fact that I bought a new Para Recon, and then just recently a Para Black Ops. I don't need three full-size 1911s so this one has to go. I have additional 14 round Mec-Gar (OEM) magazines that I can include for a reasonable price if you want them. This was $800 new. It is not an Expert series level for Para, more like an Elite series. Fit and finish is very nice, and the trigger is very smooth for a Series 80 fire group.

Price is $550 face to face in the Charlotte area (you must have a pistol purchase permit or concealed carry permit). Add $25 for shipping from my FFL to your FFL if you are not in the Charlotte area. I can send many high resolution pics."

Hi Power. Take a true classic to the range. When it was introduced early in the 20th century, the Browning Hi Power 9mm pistol was a revelation. It offered the perfect balance of handling, size and firepower, with an impressive 13-round magazine capacity. Over the years, the Hi Power has aged gracefully and continues to have a loyal following among those “in the know.” Whether you are a novice or a seasoned shooter, you will appreciate the fine craftsmanship and function of these classic pistols, the sure heft of the machined steel frame and slide, and their natural pointability.

Even with the double-column magazine, the grip is narrow to neatly accommodate nearly every hand size, and the single-action trigger provides a smooth, consistent pull. As reliable, accurate and easy to shoot as ever.

It is brand new in box and never been fired. 

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the new addition to the SAM7 family – the SAM7UF rifle. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features expected in the SAM7 Family. From its reinforced under-folding buttstock to its 14x1mm left hand muzzle threads with muzzle nut, every component of the SAM7UF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7UF rifle is bound to become a sought-after and collectible firearm.

The New Reinforced Under-Folding Stock
The SAM7UF utilizes the modern straight-back under-folding stock, which locks perpendicular to the action and the bore of the rifle. In order to provide a more secure and firm lock, whether in a folded or extended position, this stock locks on both sides of the receiver with 4 solid pins. The reinforced, straight-back folding stock stabilizes the rifle which significantly reduces the climb and gives the shooter much firmer control over the firearm for improved accuracy and effectiveness. These are major improvements over its predecessor, the tilt-down stock, and this rifle will surely exceed it. 

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7UF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process. 

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision, and durability.

The Browning BDM is a semi-automatic pistol designed and manufactured by the Browning Arms Company up until production ceased in 1998. Similar in appearance to Browning's (FN Herstal) P-35 model ""Hi-Power"" pistol, the BDM was actually a new design created to compete in service trials as a standard issue pistol for the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation. However, the BDM was not ultimately adopted for issue by the FBI, and was instead sold only in the private market.

The Daniel Defense Offset Flashlight Mount is designed for use in conjunction with a vertical foregrip which is mounted on the bottom rail. The Offset Flashlight Mount may then be mounted on either side rail for ambidextrous use. It is designed so that as the shooters forward hand grips the vertical foregrip, his thumb has quick and perfect access to the rear button of his flashlight. This setup eliminates many accidental light discharges because although the action to the on/off button is quick and natural, it is also deliberate."

When you decide to purchase this kit, I will build the lower receiver that you have provided, while you watch. It will take approx. 30-45 minutes for this build at which time you will have a complete Carbine, or Pistol that you are able to take away. Both the Carbine and the Pistol uppers have been test fired to ensure they strip the rounds properly from the magazine, feed those rounds into the chamber, fire the rounds effectively, extract the spent casing from the chamber and then eject that spent casing from the weapon. If it did not do any of the functioning tasks correctly, consistently, it would not be here for sale at this time. With your built lower, these weapons are ready for whatever........

AR 15 Carbine are pictures 1 and 2.......This Carbine has a 16"" barrel with a ""wylde"" chamber which is specially made to accept both .223 and 5.56 rounds and is from Maric Arms, it is made from parkerized steel and has a twist rate of 1:8. The compensator is a dragon head sound and flash director. The upper receiver is from SAA and is forged from Mil-Spec 7075 T-6 Aluminum and has M4 feedramps. The Bolt Carrier and Bolt are from SAA and are of excellent quality. The handguard is a Yankee Hill Free Floating Diamond series Spectre length (9.675""). The gas block is low profile standard aluminum and the gas tube is carbine length at 9.75"". 

The lower will be built with a standard Lower Parts Kit from Aero, but the different grip you will get, instead of the standard BS grip, is pictured. The different trigger guard that you will get is pictured, and is a polymer curved guard for room for a gloved finger, and not the standard BS straight trigger guard.

AR Pistol is picture 3.......This Pistol has a 7.5"" barrel with a ""wylde"" chamber which is specially made to accept both .223 and 5.56 rounds and it is from Maric Arms, it is made from parkerized steel and has a twist rate of 1:7. The compensator is a sound and flash director made by Kineti-Tech. The upper receiver is from SAA and is forged from Mil-Spec 7075 T-6 Aluminum and has M4 feedramps. The Bolt Carrier and Bolt are from SAA and are of excellent quality. The handguard is a Yankee Hill Free Floating Diamond series Carbine length (7.290""). The gas block is low profile standard aluminum and the gas tube is pistol length at 6.75"".

The lower will be built with a standard Lower Parts Kit from Aero, but the different grip you will get, instead of the standard BS grip, is pictured. The different trigger guard that you will get is pictured, and is a polymer curved guard for room for a gloved finger, and not the standard BS straight trigger guard.

Picture #4 shows a 16"" Carbine length upper that has the same components as the 16"" listed above, except, the full float hanguard is not a Yankee Hill and the flash suppressor is a standard A2 birdcage. All else is the same as explained above. It can be purchased the same way with your ""supplied"" upper built and attached, or as a complete upper (as pictured) only. Your choice.

Picture #5 shows a 7"" AR Pistol upper. This upper has a Karri's Arms upper receiver made from Mil-Spec 7075 T-6 Aluminum with M4 feed ramps. The barrel is a Karri's Arms 5.56 Nato 1:7 twist 7"" parkerized barrel. There is a ""Devestator"" muzzle break. The bolt carrier and bolt are both from Karri's Arms and is of high quality. The gas key is properly staked. The barrel is full floating with a generic aluminum handguard. This Pistol upper can be purchased as a complete upper only, or, can be combined with a complete lower receiver build with ""your"" supplied stripped lower as the others above are described as well.

All of these weapons are of quality parts and would retail at a brick and mortar store for approx. $900-$950, maybe more.

My price to you, for everything you see pictured is...... for the Carbine (pictures 1 and 2) $675 and the Pistol (picture 3) $650. The Carbine in picture 4 is $560 complete with the same items you see in pictures 1, 2 and 3. The Pistol in picture 5 is $540 complete with the same items you see in pictures 1, 2 and 3. These prices are all inclusive of building ""your"" stripped lower and then connecting the upper to the lower, handing it to you for your immediate possession. If you have ""other"" parts you would like for me to add then let me know and this will be done at the same time.

If you are interested in the upper only (and have your own lower to use) then the prices for the Carbine upper (pictures 1 and 2) complete is $540 and the Pistol upper in picture 3 is $520. The Carbine upper in picture 4 is $420. The Pistol upper in picture 5 is $400."

Up for sale is my stainless steel Walther PPK, assembled by Interarms, which are regarded as being better than the later S&W ones.

This gun is in great shape, no rust or damage, just slight wear you'd expect from an older gun. It will come with 4 magazines, all quality mags that work 100%. 

I have a LH IWB Tagua holster I'd throw in as well. Plus, an unused LH OWB Bianchi holster for an extra $20. I realize this won't be for everyone since holsters are very personal, and I'm a lefty...

I've been consolidating into just 9mm and 45ACP, and this is my only gun left in 380 Auto, the only reason I'm getting rid of this sweet piece.

I had a few issues with the slide not returning to battery, and read up on it. People said the factory 20# spring may not allow the slide to travel back far enough, not giving it enough oomph (technical term here) to return to battery. Swapping in a Wolff 17# spring would correct that. So I did, and it's been 100% reliable since, even with crappy steel cased Tula. I still have the original factory spring I'll include.

I also have approximately 600 rounds of ammo that I'll sell. 200 WWB FMJ, 100 Prvi FMJ, 100 Brassmaxx FMJ, 50 Perfecta FMJ, partial box of Aguila FMJ, partial box of Tula FMJ, 100 HPR HPs, and 24 loose Federal HPs. I'll do 40 cents per round on the FMJ, and 60 cents per round on the HP. I think that's beyond fair, and probably a bit cheaper than you could get all of this new. Buy all the ammo for $250 extra.

What else can I say? The timeless design of this gun speaks for itself. It's still sexy decades after it's design. This is the James Bond gun after all!

Cash is king, but I'm not opposed to trades. NO JUNK! No offense, but I don't own crap now, and I'm not planning on it in the future. Only interested in pistols in 9mm or 45ACP, or rifles in 5.56/223 or 7.62x39. Would consider a sweet hunting rifle though.

Email me on here, or call/text me @ 5 one 3 - four 6 zero - 5 two 7 two.

Thanks for looking."

Up for sale are 2 holsters I don't need any longer. I understand this could be a hard sell, since holsters are very personal, specific to 1 type of gun, and I'm a lefty...but I figured I'd post these up.

First is a Garrett Industries Silent Thunder IWB for a Kahr PM9. It's a Kydex shell, lined with premium leather. Very highly reviewed! And I have not only the heavy duty standard clip, but 2 extra nylon clips, and the dual belt loop leather. The whole setup cost me $160 I think. I discovered I'm just an all leather kinda guy when it comes to holsters. $75 OBO - this is virtually unused!

Next is a Bianchi OWB for a Walther PPK. This is 100% unused! It has the thumb snap, and I believe was called ""Accu-mold"" style. Stopped carrying the PPK, so never used this. I believe it was $35 new, $15 OBO

Buy both and I'll make you an even better deal! I'll trade for other cool gun stuff, ammo, etc. I can't use these, so anything is better than nothing!

It does have the normal barrel finish wear due to the rough phosphate coating on the barrel. Everything else on the firearm in like new, perfect condition.

 This MK25 does come with the phosphate coated, chrome lined barrel (same exact barrel as featured in the Combat variation) phosphate internals, strong Sig night sights, Navy anchor and bar code sticker ect ect... I have more pictures if interested."
