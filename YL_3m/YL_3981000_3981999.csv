Whether it's security, military, law enforcement or civilian sport shooting, step up to striker-fired perfection with H&K's VP9 Pistols. In development for more than four years, the VP9 is H&K's first striker-fired handgun since the P7 series was introduced in the 1980s. Its premium light-pull trigger has a short take up with a solid, single-action-type break followed by a short, positive reset. Customize grip configurations by changing the three included backstraps and six included sideplates to accommodate various hand sizes. All controls, including the magazine and slide releases, are ambidextrous. Patented charging supports at the rear of the slide enhance leverage and grip for racking the slide, speeding up reloading and making it easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. Extended Picatinny rail molded into the polymer frame supports up to 5.6-oz. accessories. Proprietary captive flat recoil spring improves shooter control. H&K's hostile environments finish protects the steel slide from corrosion and wear. Heckler & Koch's limited lifetime warranty.

Barrel has been shortened and recrowned. Bent bolt has been installed. This is not a cheap hack job on the bolt. In an ATI Monty Carlo stock. The rear sight has been removed. Sighted in and ready to hunt. I have the original bolt and I also have the portion of the barrel that was removed just to show it off. Very well done. Getting all this done wasnt cheap. The gun itself was $150, the bolt was over $100 as I didnt use my original bolt. The Scope was $60 and is new to the gun. The scope rings cost about $20. The gunsmithing to install the scope mount and on the barrel to shorten and remove the rear sight was around $75. So I have right around $400 into this. So if someone wanted to buy one already completely sporterized here you go. The only thing someone might want to do is put in an aftermarket trigger but that is another $100. I decided not to as this one has a very good original trigger. It is better than most. You can decide on that upgrade after you test this. I think you will find the trigger pretty nice. Finally I have a large ammount of the best non-corrosive ammo I could get for this. I have over 400 Silver Bear 203grn soft point hunting ammo that can be purchsed seperate if you want for $140. Almost all this ammo is the same lot so after you get it sighted where you want it then all should get pretty good accuracy throughout all the ammo."

It still functions well. In fact, it shoots quite accurately. Timing is slightly loose, which is to be expected out of an older gun but it doesn't spit lead out of the forcing cone and there is no sign of flame cutting on the frame.
It was imported by JL Golef of New York City, which is what the trademark on the left side of the frame represents.
The barrel has at some point been cut from probably 6"" to 4"". It has been properly re-crowned and the front sight is set at it's correct zero. The gun shoots very well.

For safety reasons DO NOT use +P .38 loads in this (or any other) old-school .38 pistol. Only use standard velocity factory loads. This gun has held up pretty well for it's age (and considering the questionable nature of Spanish guns from that time period) but it was never meant to run anything hot by today's standards."

TC Contender older model. Beautiful condition. 
.357 Magnum 10 "" barrel with older Burris Made in USA 1X scope.
.22 10"" barrel with older 1X Burris USA scope 
Both scopes are crystal clear. The .357 was used for steel sillhouette targets at 200 yards. The .22 is set up basically the same way. Totally cool old school set up. Perfect working condition. The trigger is absolutely one of the best triggers I have ever come across. Also inclued in the package are 80 special hand loaded rounds. 200 grn gas check RCBS bullets in WInchester cases , producing 1100 FPS ! 
I recently purchased this set up from the original owner. I can provide more pics if needed. Asking 650.00 for the whole setup. Would sell the .357 with ammo for 425.00 (this is a great price) . Will sell just the ..22 barrel for 225.00 (also a great price).

530,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3981530,For Sale:  Hot Pink and Zombie Green single point slings,"west, Colorado Springs, Colorado",$ 13,"Listed On: Tuesday, February 10, 2015",Tactical,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I can meet you locally for the exchange, or ship it to you. I will only ship if purchased through my Etsy store (https://www.etsy.com/listing/217188140/custom-riggers-belt-perfect-tactical?) I ship to US addresses for $7. I will not accept money orders, or anything like that.

If you want a custom made sling at a great price, don't be afraid to hit me up for a quote.

I'm currently offering this sling in both hot pink and zombie green.

Anyone can be a door kicker, but to kick doors and look good doing it, you probably need something like this. Hot sling, hot price, hot color. What more could you ask for?

Here is the 30 second description, because I know we are all probably to busy slaying zombies to read all the details. The long, technical, and boring description is below this one.

This sling is sweet, made with hot pink nylon webbing and contrasting black thread. Adjustable from a 60 inch loop to a zero inch loop. This sling will fit you. Universal webbing adaptor is included, and will fit all weapons with a 1 inch sling mount, or you can just wrap it around the buffer or thin part of the butt stock as shown in the picture. This sling is rough and tough. Guaranteed for life. If it breaks, send it back, and I will repair or replace it.

Here is the long, technical, and boring description:


This is the toughest single point sling you will find, made of flat nylon webbing. The webbing has a breaking strength of 3000 pounds, and maximum recommended safe work load is 1000 pounds.

Fully adjustable from a 60 inch loop to literally a 0 inch loop. This sling features a polymer fastex buckle with the female portion on the body of the sling. This allows you to manipulate your weapon from a carry stance to a shooting stance without the sling grinding against your clothing or your gear. The buckle slides along the sling instead. This is smoother, faster, and more comfortable. This sling also facilitates the ""dumping"" of your primary weapon to producing a secondary weapon. 

This sling is great for those who serve our great country as breachers, and choose a shotgun as their dynamic entry tool of choice. After the breach, you can easily slide the shotgun away to your non-doinant side and produce your primary weapon.

Additionally, the fastex buckle provides a quick detach point. This also allow you to purchase one sling for multiple weapons, and just leave the connected portion on the weapon when not in use. I am proud to offer these great adapters at a value that exceeds their price in one of my other Etsy listings: https://www.etsy.com/listing/218908141/tactical-rifle-sling-adapters-hk-clip?ref=shop_home_active_1 The hot pink color isn't currently listed there, but just shoot me a message if you want one, and I will make it just for you and put up a special listing just for you.

If you would like this sling, or any of the slings I offer in another color, configuration, or anything else, please let me know. I am sure I can make your custom sling or gear to a level of exceptional quality for a price you will be happy with.

As you can see from the photographs, I take great pride in my trade. All stitching is done on an industrial sewing machine using size 92 bonded nylon thread. The industry standard is size 69, but I make my own gear with size 92, and I feel that I should offer you the same added strength and durability also.

All items ship same day or next day unless otherwise noted. I ship all of my orders from the great state of Colorado in USPS flat rate boxes. Free shipping for up to two additional slings."

Crimson Trace Lasergrips in an exclusive rosewood finish with the classic 1911 double diamond pattern and the Kimber logo.
As seen on Kimber Crimson Carry II pistols.
Activated by a pressure pad just below the trigger guard, Crimson Trace Lasergrips project a bright red dot downrange, an important aid in training. Reading the dot immediately shows the advantage of proper grip and trigger control, which can dramatically improve accuracy and reduce time between shots for any level of shooter.

I will only ship if purchased through my Etsy store (https://www.etsy.com/listing/217188140/custom-riggers-belt-perfect-tactical?) I ship to US addresses for $7. I will not accept money orders, or anything like that.

If you want a custom made sling at a great price, don't be afraid to hit me up for a quote.

Anyone can be a door kicker, but to kick doors and look good doing it, you probably need something like this. Hot sling, hot price, hot color. What more could you ask for?

Here is the 30 second description, because I know we are all probably to busy slaying zombies to read all the details. The long, technical, and boring description is below this one.

This sling is sweet, made with zombie green nylon webbing and contrasting black thread. Adjustable from a 60 inch loop to a zero inch loop. This sling will fit you. Universal webbing adaptor is included, and will fit all weapons with a 1 inch sling mount, or you can just wrap it around the buffer or thin part of the butt stock as shown in the picture. This sling is rough and tough. Guaranteed for life. If it breaks, send it back, and I will repair or replace it.

Here is the long, technical, and boring description:


This is the toughest single point sling you will find, made of flat nylon webbing. The webbing has a breaking strength of 3000 pounds, and maximum recommended safe work load is 1000 pounds.

Fully adjustable from a 60 inch loop to literally a 0 inch loop. This sling features a polymer fastex buckle with the female portion on the body of the sling. This allows you to manipulate your weapon from a carry stance to a shooting stance without the sling grinding against your clothing or your gear. The buckle slides along the sling instead. This is smoother, faster, and more comfortable. This sling also facilitates the ""dumping"" of your primary weapon to producing a secondary weapon. 

This sling is great for those who serve our great country as breachers, and choose a shotgun as their dynamic entry tool of choice. After the breach, you can easily slide the shotgun away to your non-doinant side and produce your primary weapon.

Additionally, the fastex buckle provides a quick detach point. This also allow you to purchase one sling for multiple weapons, and just leave the connected portion on the weapon when not in use. I am proud to offer these great adapters at a value that exceeds their price in one of my other Etsy listings: https://www.etsy.com/listing/218908141/tactical-rifle-sling-adapters-hk-clip?ref=shop_home_active_1 The hot pink color isn't currently listed there, but just shoot me a message if you want one, and I will make it just for you and put up a special listing just for you.

If you would like this sling, or any of the slings I offer in another color, configuration, or anything else, please let me know. I am sure I can make your custom sling or gear to a level of exceptional quality for a price you will be happy with.

As you can see from the photographs, I take great pride in my trade. All stitching is done on an industrial sewing machine using size 92 bonded nylon thread. The industry standard is size 69, but I make my own gear with size 92, and I feel that I should offer you the same added strength and durability also.

All items ship same day or next day unless otherwise noted. I ship all of my orders from the great state of Colorado in USPS flat rate boxes. Free shipping for up to two additional slings."

WWII US 225Q Commando Fighting Knife - 
In the Burma Campaign, the Chindits, whose long range penetration groups were trained to operate from bases deep behind Japanese lines, contained commandos (King's Regiment (Liverpool), 142 Commando Company) and Gurkhas. Their jungle expertise, which would play an important part in many British special forces operations post war, was learnt at a great cost in lives in the jungles of Burma fighting the Japanese. The United States formed the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) during World War II under the Medal of Honor recipient William J. Donovan. This organization was the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and was responsible for both intelligence and Special Forces missions. The CIA's elite Special Activities Division is the direct descendant of the OSS. In mid-1942, the United States formed the Rangers. The United States and Canada also formed a sabotage ski brigade for operations in Norway who became known as the Devil's Brigade, officially known as the First Special Service Force, during their eventual service in Italy. Merrill's Marauders were modelled on the Chindits and took part in similar operations in Burma. 

These specialized troops required specialized knives to do the job. 

Manufactured by Cattaraugus. The model 225q was designed for use by the US special forces. With a very stout blade measuring approximatlly 6 inches. Leather handle with a checkered pommel. The knife came with a leather scabbard.

Two rare collectibles. The Wild TigerCorps Bayonet from 1907 is one of 10,000. Low Serial number. (See pictures) The WWII Cattaraugus 225q Commando Fighting Knife was designed for the original Army Rangers. The blades of both a very good with no nicks. The scabbard for the bayonet is metal. I purchased this bayonet from an antique store in Cincinnati in 1979. If my memory serves me it has been painted brown. I covered it with the black tape seen in the pictures. The dealer told me the low serial number denotes that this belonged to
a high ranking member of the Corps, but I have never verified that. The sheath for the 225q 
is original. It has a pinpoint hole at the tip of the blade. I covered it as seen in picture for 
comfort (and safety), as I occasionally carry it stuffed in my bellyband.



Sword bayonet for use with the .303 caliber Short, Magazine, Lee-Enfield No. I Mk. III (SMLE) rifle.

The Type 62 is a re-badged British Pattern 1907 bayonet. Siam purchased 10,000 SMLE rifles and Pattern 1907 bayonets from Britain in 1919 to equip the ""Wild Tiger Corps,"" royal bodyguard of Vajiravudh, King Rama VI (reigned 1910–1925). The tiger figural on the ricasso is representative of the Wild Tiger Corps. Year 2462 on the Buddhist Calendar corresponds to 1919.

SMLE rifles and Pattern 1907 bayonets were taken from British stocks, refurbished by Birmingham Small Arms (BSA), and remarked with Siamese markings. The bayonets were shipped with standard steel-mounted leather scabbards. However, the leather rapidly deteriorated in the tropical climate, so the Siamese made a replacement steel scabbard body to which the original steel mounts were brazed.

The Wild Tiger Corps (Thai: กองเสือป่า) was a national paramilitary corps founded in Thailand in 1911 by King Rama VI. Inspired by the British Volunteer Force, the unit was intended to maintain civil order.

The unit drew its Thai name from the Sua Pa Maew Morn scout corps founded by King Naresuan around 1600 AD."

I also installed the Short Reach Trigger (not to be confused with Short Reset Trigger).  I've put about 100 rounds through the gun and it fires flawlessly and is SIG accurate. The serial numbers all match and the gun is KB stamped meaning it is an original W. German gun. All springs needing replacement were done. I have a new recoil spring for the pistol as well, but the one in it still functions fine. Obviously this gun will be a bit of a project gun if you want to coat the slide again, but the stainless looks sharp too. Asking $600, but will listen to offers."

I will included with this an original ad from Hunting and Fishing Magazine, Feb. 1934, just an awesome compliment to such a rare rifle.

The Faxon ARAK-21™ is a gas piston actuated, complete upper receiver assembly designed to seamlessly interface with the standard AR-15 platform. The total extent of the interface is simply the take down pin, and the pivot pin. The new ARAK-21™ upper receiver offers you all its features with no change to your current lower receiver and can be installed in less than one minute with no tools. 

The BAU is comprised of the barrel, gas block, muzzle brake, gas piston, gas adjuster, and barrel trunnion. The only removable part of this assembly is the gas adjuster knob. The gas adjuster knob has 4 settings. Three of the settings allow different gas flows for optimum operation, and one setting blocks the gas flow for a single shot operation.

The upper receiver includes the charging block, standard charging handle, lower forearm with screws, three aluminum full length picatinny rails, three insulating shims, bolt carrier assembly, lower recoil lug with spring guide rod, and dual recoil spring system. Along with your new ARAK-21™ upper receiver you will receive your owners manual, and two allen wrenches that will fit the screws that attach the lower forearm, and the front picatinny rails.The upper receiver is fully machined from an aircraft grade 6061-T6 aluminum billet in a one piece design that incorporates a full length picatinny rail (Mil-STD-1913) on the top and three additional rails on the muzzle end of the receiver, making it a full M4 style quad rail upper. The top picatinny rail is laser engraved for optic placement. There are also half-length picatinny rails available.12 ½” length BAU is available in 5.56, heavy profile. 16” and 20” length BAU’s are available in both the 5.56 and 300 BLK. There are two profiles to choose from, medium and heavy. BAU’s can be interchanged in less than 3 minutes by removing the (6) captive allen screws on the bottom rail using the enclosed allen wrench.
