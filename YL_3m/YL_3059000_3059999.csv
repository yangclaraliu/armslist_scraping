Reacting to many requests from the marketplace for a subcompact SIG SAUER pistol, engineers designed the new P238 as a smart looking, small handgun built with the same accuracy and reliability as large frame SIG SAUER pistols. With an overall length of just 5.5 inches a height of 3.96 inches, and weighing just under a pound, the SIG SAUER P238 is the ultimate firepower in an all metal frame concealed pistol. The P238 is built on an anodized alloy beavertail style frame with fluted grips for comfort and a secure hold during rapid-fire usage. The stainless steel slide features the popular SIG SAUER slide serrations and improves overall performance and accuracy. Additionally, the contrast sights or available SIGLITE® Night Sights are removable and adjustable for windage. The sear and trigger return spring are redesigned to prevent spring over-ride of the ejector during assembly. The new SIG SAUER P238 is shipped in a lockable hard case with one 6 round magazine.

It comes with a brand new Streamlight tlr-3 (fits sub-compact to full size) that's never had a shot fired with it attached, and only been turned on a few times once attached to the pistol to see how bright it was and how well it functioned.

As a bonus I'm throwing in a new adjustable shoulder holster with tie downs, thumb break, and a dual mag pouch opposite the holster.  The shoulder holster won't accommodate the light on the gun.  I bought it in case I ever wanted to carry the gun but never actually used it.

It provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator. The TA31RCO incorporates dual-illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to be always illuminated without the use of batteries. The Tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber-optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness. Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides the shooter with quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and Exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, another firearm, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  I do not need anything in trade right now, but will trade if it makes sense on my end.  If you offer something of less value and do not mention adding cash or other to the deal, I will assume you want a straight trade and pass.  Same on your end, if you have something of higher value let me know what you are looking for on top.

I encourage all of you to follow strict protocols when doing deals. If your buyer/seller will not meet you at a gun shop, ALARMS!! If you must meet in a public place, do it in daylight, have someone else with you and know your surroundings.

Kit has everything you need to replace the standard gas system in your AR-15 and convert it to a reliable, positive-cycling, gas piston system. Eliminates venting of hot gases and powder residue into the bolt carrier and receiver for reduced fouling and less wear on the action. Feeds more smoothly, maintenance is easier, and the gun runs cooler, too. Short-stroke piston shaft eliminates concussive gas expansion in the upper receiver for less violent cycling and reduced felt recoil. Easy to adjust for three levels of gas release: normal fire, firing with a suppressor attached, or a single round fired without cycling. Picatinny rail on the gas block provides mounting space for a variety of front sights. Installation requires removal of original gas block, but no permanent alterations to barrel or upper receiver. Remove the piston system at any time and reinstall the original parts. Replacement handguard provides extra internal clearance for piston rod and has internal shield to protect your hand from heat buildup during sustained fire."

564,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3059564,For Sale:  Advantage Arms Gen 3 Glock 17/22 - .22lr Conversion Kit - Mint Condition!,"North West Las Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada",$ 225,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 14, 2014",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hello, Hope your having a great day.

Today I am selling my Advantage Arms Gen 3 Glock 17/22 - .22lr Conversion Kit. This kit also will fit a Glock 17L, G22, G31, G34, G35, G37. (This kit will not work with any Gen 4 glock, the design is different in some ways and are not compatible with the new style design). Previously I purchased the same type of kit but from a different company (Tactical Solutions). I had nothing but trouble with that product because their slide is made of Steel. The Advantage Arms slide is made of Aluminum which is the perfect amount of mass to be pushed back by any .22lr round, therefore not one problem whatsoever with any type of ammo.

This is a Glock Gen 3 slide conversion kit that can be installed by simply removing the slide off of your current handgun and putting the Advantage Arms .22lr version slide on to your beloved Glock frame the same way, load the 10rd. magazine and you are ready to shoot .22lr caliber rounds. Included in the box is the 10rd magazine and a speed loader (just like the stock loader in the Glock boxes when you purchase them). The magazine works flawlessly and have not had one issue with feeding, stovepipes, anything. 

This is a great option for training. This package helps a shooter: young, female or male get used to the grip and the feel of the handgun without the recoil or the price we all pay for the expensive centerfire ammo (9mm, 40 S&W, .45 ACP) just to practice.

Everything when purchased is still inside the original box and not altered in anyway. Some parts not even used. 
Included in the box :
The Advantage Arms Slide w/ Barrel Inside
10rd Magazine w/ Speed Loader
Cleaning Guide Rod w/ Patches and Bronze Brushes
CLP (Cleaner, Lube, Protector) 05. oz Bottle

This Conversion Kit has had less than 100rds. shot through it with not one problem at all. This kit is not picky with any brand of ammunition and is a blast to plink around without damaging the pocketbook. It is in mint condition and not one scratch on the slide in anyway. I have the original box as seen in the pictures with every accessory included. There has been no gunsmithing or altercation to any part what so ever. The only reason I am selling this is because I sold my Glock 17 a few weeks after I bought this Conversion Kit to buy an M&P 9 Pro. I would rather someone make use of this great product than it sitting in my closet not being taken advantage of.

I am asking $225 just because of the mint condition it is in and how well it has been taken care of.

If interested please Call or Text Max at REDACTED

Thanks!

PIONEER 2400WATT AMP MODEL GM-D9601 

BIG POWER, SMALL SIZE 
Pioneer’s new extra-efficient Class-D digital amplifiers mark a dramatic improvement in power output capability, yet are 50% smaller than the current GM-Series Class-AB amplifiers. That makes them more versatile in terms of installation as well as performance. 
IMPROVED CIRCUIT DESIGN 
To prevent circuit shutdown, Pioneer's new digital amplifier circuit ""Protection Control System"" senses its internal temperature and automatically moderates input level accordingly. Stable, durable circuitry lessens the risk of high input power for the unit to achieve 1 Ω connection. This design enhances the flexibility to connect multiple subwoofers to a system. 
VARIABLE LOW PASS FILTER 
For extra flexibility, a variable LPF makes audio frequency more adjustable according to subwoofer characteristics and personal listening preferences. The GM-D9601 LPF is adjustable from 40 Hz to 240 Hz. 
TURN UP THE BASS 
Every new Pioneer Class-D amplifier has a wired bass boost remote control for optimal bass level adjustment according to listening preferences and music characteristics. 
SPEAKER LEVEL INPUTS 
What, you DON'T own a Pioneer headunit? Well, we won't hold it against you. In fact we'll even help you build onto your system. The GM-D9601's speaker level inputs allow you to connect your OEM unit (or any unit that doesn't have the typical RCA-type inputs) without having to buy add-on adapters. So, the install goes faster, you save money, and you've got a Pioneer amp in your vehicle."

Springfield Armory SOCOM II rifles are compact, powerful, close-quarter battle rifles. But being chambered for 7.62mm NATO. They still pack plenty of punch to reach out and make that crucial shot at a distance. They feature 16-inch barrels (the shortest allowed for a civilian-owned rifle) made possible by a re-tuned gas system. A proprietary, high-efficiency muzzle brake virtually eliminates muzzle rise, enabling you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow-up shots. The new Cluster Rail System of the SOCOM II further enhances its versatility by accommodating virtually any optic, light or other accessory designed to fit a standard picatinny rail.

Here is everything you need to get into 50BMG shooting. All you have to do is add your scope and begin having fun !! If you have been looking into the 50BMG game you know there is much more to it, than just buying the gun and running down to WalMart for some ammo. 
In this extensive package you have one of the most accurate 50BMG bolt guns available, the Armalite AR50A1 with .7 MOA accuracy!! This Big Boy comes complete with a Picatinny rail 15 MOA scope base, Schilen Standard Single Stage trigger, custom mono pod and Bipod adaptor (so any Harris type bipod can be used), and of course all the paper work and tools that came with the rifle from Armalite. Additional extras include: over 120 pieces of once fired brass, 120 armor piercing bullets , 50 Speer FMJ bullets, 20 rounds of loaded ammo, 2 pounds of 50BMG powder, 2 boxes of 100 count CCI 50BMG primers (these are $50 each if you can find them) , a Lee 50BMG press with dies, case trimmer and mounting block. The rifle breaks down to fit into two included hard cases for transport and storage. Add all this together and you have a package that would run well over $4,500.
