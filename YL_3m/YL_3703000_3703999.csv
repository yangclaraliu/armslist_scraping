It's made by Hopkins & Allen Arms Co of Norwich, Conn. USA.  It's has a pretty thick barrel (not damascus) and is chambered for 2 21/2 standard shotgun shells.  I have fired target loads, and it's great fun to shoot!  The ejector works as it should.  The hammer and receiver are case hardened.  There is a saddle ring attached to receiver under the barrel (it's hard to see in the pics because gravity pulls it down in-line with the picture angle); this is actually a take-down screw as well.  When removed, the barrel will slide out of the receiver for easy cleaning and transport.
The checkered wood is in beautiful condition, with no damage or cracks.  The steel butt plate is also case hardened.
The price is firm.  I may be interested in interesting trades with cash in either direction, just let me know what you have.

Comes with its original box and everything it came with as well. It would be nice if buyer has a transfer FFL lined up, but I have one in my neck of the woods that is pretty decent with transfer fee. I also have a TDI LHV-47 with it, solid bit of kit for opening up some options while maintaining close to original form. I also have 2,800+ rounds, most of it is Wolf 125gr Soft point, 2k of it is in unopened cases.  I can provide  pictures of it all, just ask for specifics. Ideally going as a bundle sale, not looking to be stuck with the ammo or the rifle on their own."

I have not fired the shotgun. I received it needing trigger assembly and I acquired that and extra parts.
I Installed the trigger assembly and it racks fine. 

Every shot the release lever needs to be hit. 

My guess is it needs a release lever actuator spring (works off of the hammer to pull the release. 

It also has a little trouble feeding at some points. 
The ramp seems to be Bent in a slight bit, being bent back to normal should fix this problem. It Will load then sometimes will have to push the ramp Down a little bit to let the round enter the receiver.

""Hornady XTP bullets were designed for hunting, self-defense, and law enforcement. One of the great things about the XTP bullet is reliable performance, it features controlled expansion where six serrations divide the bullet into six symmetrical sections. These sections weaken the jacket to allow controlled expansion at low velocities and ensures fragmentation does not occur at high velocities. The XTP bullet is really known for its stopping power. They were designed from the beginning to expand reliably at a variety of handgun velocities and deliver deep, terminal penetration with every shot. Most handgun bullets are designed to perform at a single factory-specified velocity where the XTP bullet is designed to offer controlled expansion over a range of velocities. 

Each XTP Bullet has a swaged core and drawn copper jacket to ensure uniform expansion and in-flight stability. Adding a cannelure to this bullet keeps the core and the jacket locked together while also allowing the cartridge case to tightly crimp, adding security at high velocities. This is not loaded ammunition."""

I took it to the range one time and put 20 rounds. It still looked new.
The scope will come with rifle it's a weaver 3-9x40 
It has aftermarket scope rings, a bipod that's 13-24"", and a strap and a sleeve that holds I think 8 rounds.its a good gun for hunting deer and hogs.

Thank you!"

I bought one of the last ones Noveske made before they switched their focus to gen 3 products.  12.5 was considered by John to be the most versatile barrel length for a 5.56 rifle.  Short enough to handle well, and long enough to get good stability out of 77 grain bullets.  12.5 is generally considered the sweet spot for barrel stiffness and accuracy, and is ideal for an urban recce build.  Just research 12.5 builds and you will fall in love.  This upper has arguably the most accurate hammer forged chrome-lined barrel available!"

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."

I only use one as a CCW and now have my eye on a 1911.  There are quite a few options available online for holsters and other accessories.  Read the reviews online for this handgun.  It is highly rated.  Used in several different Military and LEO scenarios as an issue weapon.  Easy to carry CCW, reliable, and a very dependable handgun.

It started as a “sporter” and has since been converted (front and rear) to accept standard AKM furniture. Currently installed is a very nice set of battle field pick up wood that has been refinished to the color you see. The barrel has been threaded and has a Yankee Hill Phantom flash hider installed. This is a more “collectible” saiga rifle as not only does it have the “X” dimples in the receiver where the trigger/hammer pins go, but it also has the “Y” dimple as well. This marking would have been used for the auto sear pin. It’s my understanding that only a limited amount of these came over early in importation. This is a 06 import model. Includes the pictured bakelite 30 rd mag."

Overall a very nice carry gun. Small, accurate polygonal rifled barrel. The pistol is double action so you can carry it with the hammer down and it will cock the hammer when the trigger is pulled. You can also double tap a round if the primer does not go off on the first hit, though I have never had that happen.
