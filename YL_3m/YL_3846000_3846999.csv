The rifle is all original other than missing the top part of the stock behind the rear sight and that the stock has been shortened at some point. There are wear marks on the barrel that show it did have the full length stock for most of its life. Action is smooth and the crown looks pretty good. The ugly part of the rifle is that while transporting it home via plane somehow the stock cracked and broke on the grip. The break was not able to be pinned and fixed so I had the stock fixed just for looks. This rifle is not shootable with this stock an aftermarket stock will be needed.

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.
The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity."

It grouped fairly nice at 50 yards and was content with the accuracy. The specs for the rifle are as follows:

-MPI BCG Semi Auto Profile
- Thor Industries Barrel, Carbine length gas system that is Government profile with a BCM low profile gas block
- CMMG Lower with A2 style stock, Magpul MOE+ grip
-Free float tube that looks to be DPMS
- Standard Charging handle

The rifle has is hydrodipped in Snake skin and it is professionally done and is even throughout the rifle. This can be removed from what I understand fairly easy with the right tools but from my use of the rifle it seems hard to scratch off.

Any questions feel free to ask. I'm looking to get $550 or best offer for this. Not really looking for trades but will do partial trades but there must be at least $300 cash with the deal."

Has plenty of holster wear from being a surplus handgun, but is in excellent shape mechanically. Has a ""decocker"" that allows you to safely lower the hammer on a loaded chamber, and acts as a safety in that the hammer cannot touch the firing pin while the decocker is in ""safe"" mode. Disassembles easy for cleaning.
I have 4 magazines total (which sell for about $40 each on ebay) and 138 rounds of 9x18 FMJs.
I have carried this Makarov for a little over a year, and it is so comfortable/thin that you forget you are carrying it.

What is the difference?
The .45GAP is the new 45-caliber. It utilizes .451"" diameter bullets in 185gr, 200gr, and 230gr weights. It also houses the bullet in a shorter casing than the .45ACP, so it can be chambered in smaller handguns. The .45GAP cartridge is actually shorter than a 9mm cartridge. Modern powders and propellants have made the .45GAP possible, and one should consider that the .45ACP has a lot of empty space inside the casing, which some consider unnecessary. The .45GAP, ballistically, is nearly as efficient and effective as the .45ACP, and combines its ballistics with reduced recoil and smaller cartridge size to make the optimal .45 package.

The differences between the .45GAP and .45ACP is similar to the differences between the .308 and .30-'06. Ballistically they are very close, but the .30-'06 (like the .45ACP) has a longer casing and therefore allows more flexibility in loading up or down. The .45GAP also recoils less than a .45ACP, and in testing, shooters report the Glock 39 producing less felt recoil than the 27 and 33. They do report it recoiling harder than the 9mm 26 and lapse time between shots in doubletaps is increased. However, through training, one can overcome the slightly heavier recoil and slower shots. After all, you're launching a 230gr .45 bullet, not a 115gr 9mm bullet.

The Glock 39 offers an excellent big caliber option for someone wanting to keep the dimensions of the gun very compact. The Glock 29/30 are considered subcompacts, but are fatter and bulkier than some may prefer. The Glock 39 is a great alternative."

Made by DWM, and chamber-dated 1917, the pistol has all-matching serial numbers, the correct, wood-based magazine is not numbered. The pistol also has Imperial German proof marks, there are NO importers markings anywhere on the gun. The pistol has lots of finish wear, and there is a small but noticeable area of freckling just rear of the sideplate. The original wooden checkered grips are worn pretty good as well. A tiny bit of the original straw remains. The pistol’s bore is still fairly crisp with pretty good rifling – overall condition of the gun is about good. Not a pristine Artillery, but it’s an honest gun and all-matching – a pretty good addition for your collection!

771,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3846771,For Sale/Trade:  Fisher CZ20 Metal Detector for cash or trade for handgun,"Little River, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina",$ 600,"Listed On: Thursday, January 22, 2015",Handguns,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Your CZ-20 QuickSilver is truly an all-purpose metal detector
engineered for land, beach, salt and fresh-water treasure
hunters. Here are some important built-in features:
1.
Leakproof:
Submersible to 250 feet, headphones
and all.
2.
3-Tone Target I.D.:
A low tone for iron; a mid-tone
for pull tabs, foil and most gold rings; and a high
tone for U.S. coins, silver rings and some gold rings.
3.
Visual Target Response:
Two bright, red LED’s flash
over targets, varying in intensity according to
target signal strength.
4. Depth:
Patented Fourier domain signal analysis.
Two
deep-seeking, ground-compensating VLF
signals (one at 5 KHz and one at 15 KHz) provide
twice as much target information for accurate
analysis and identification.
5.
Two Search Modes:
A silent-running, slow-motion
target-I.D. mode and a hot, wide-scan autotune
mode for all-metal searching.
6.
VCO No-Motion Pinpointing:
Just push the
pinpoint button and the signal tone increases in
pitch and volume as the center of the coil
approaches the target.
7.
Big-Target Alert:
Ordinary detector circuits
overload on large, shallow targets, identifying them
as good targets. But not the CZ-20. A distinctive bell
tone immediately warns you that the target is too
large to identify.
8.
Faint-Target Audio Boost:
The lower range of the
volume control is like any other that you’ve used.
But as you increase it above mid-range, strong
target sounds remain at a fixed volume while faint,
deep-target sounds continue to get louder.
9.
Pushbutton Ground Balance:
Just push the
pinpoint button and lower the coil to the ground.
Then set the ground control just below the audio
tone and you are precisely tuned for on-site
conditions.
10.
Separately Sealed Battery Compartment:
Protects the electronics from accidental flooding.
11.
Spider Coils:
Your choice of the all-purpose 8-
inch or deep-seeking 10 1/2-inch Spider coils. Light,
tough and with open centers for accurate
pinpointing. The hot, little 5-inch coil is great for
extremely trashy areas, tight spots or highly
mineralized ground.
12.
Balanced, Comfortable and Hipmountable:
Cushioned arm rest, soft foam grip and a control
housing that slips off the handle and onto your belt.
13.
Easy to Use:
Just pick it up, set the control on
the red circles and start searching in a “coins-only”

I traded for this from the original owner. I was wanting a rifle to put a Krebs rail and A 105 stock on. But this one is just too pretty to cover up. Anyhow he has done an exceptional job on the conversion. It has a real Russian hand guard retainer, not a bolt on. The correct 45 degree gas block. The correct front sight post with spring pin for the slant muzzle break. The wood is a dark red-orange hue, that looks really good in the light. She shoots really well. I just don't want  to cover up all the work he did. So heres the deal, I think in our current market this is at least a 1100 dollar rifle. So thats what I'm asking obo. Or trade for another 7.62x39 16in Saiga,(unconverted) and 500 cash. Thats really the only trade I'm looking for. Comes with either grip (i just prefer the magpul) and the one steal mag.
