Product Description:
With an industry-best 95% light transmission across 300% more of the visible light spectrum, backed by a rigorous recoil testing process that ensures reliability, plus the anti-fog protection of Rain Guard HD, the benefits of owning an Elite Riflescope are undeniable. But it's not about how it looks on paper. It's how it shines at last light when the buck of a lifetime steps into a clearing. On the top of a mountain with a goat in your crosshairs after a week of harsh treatment. When your canoe flips and a lesser riflescope would be rendered useless. We don't make advancements for advancements sake. We engineer the finest in the world of experience to magnify yours for life! The Elite Riflescope features magnum recoil proof construction one-piece aluminum tube. It is 100% waterproof, fog proof and shockproof. 1/4 MOA audible/resettable windage and elevation adjustment fast-focus eyepiece. Developed by Bushnell(R) engineers for the lowest-light hunting situations, the patented FireFly(TM) reticle illluminates the crosshairs after only a quick 10-second flashlight charge. Unlike battery powered reticles, which often fail at the absolute worst times, the FireFly will glow green and you'll see your crosshairs against your quarry. Comes with the Elite(R) Lifetime limited warranty."

M4S1 - AR15/M16 Hand Guard System With Removable Rails

CAAâs M4S1 M16/AR15 carbine handguard sets the standard for a stable and rigid design by combining interlocking top and bottom handguard sections with a bottom rail that can be mounted to the existing sling swivel mount for additional rigidity. M4S1 handguard will not move once locked in place, providing repeatable zero. This is the first lightweight polymer handguard designed to withstand the extreme operating temperatures of a gas piston system. This extreme heat resistance is achieved by manufacturing the M4S1 from a proprietary heat resistant polymer, including heat shields and providing significant upper and lower handguard venting. The M4S1 also works with standard direct gas operating systems. The M4S1 includes two interchangeable lower rails of 4â & 1.75â lengths. This allows the operator to quickly change rails based on mission need. The two 1.75â side rails are removable if not required. With the side rails attached, there is enough room left on the contoured handguard to hold it comfortably. 

    Lightweight polymer handguard designed to withstand the extreme operating temperatures of a gas piston system.

I have had the action parts polished and installed an Apex Tactical spring kit. It has a nice trigger for a J Frame. I've also added Crimson Trace LG-405 laser grips ( factory grips included also). The gun has zero rounds through it outside of the factory, but does show a turn line on the cylinder from dry fire exercises with snap caps. Other than that the gun is mint.

100% Factory Built AR

Gun Selling for $1000-1100 on gunbroker avg pricing stock without upgrades.  The Blackhawk rail ($150), sling adapters ($46),  FDE butt stock ($49), and grip ($27) were factory installed.  The front grip ($38) and Ladders (appx $50) I installed.  You can look those prices up on Black Hawks website.  They are actual without tax.



This is $1400-1500 worth of gun and add ons without taxes, so don't waste our time low balling me and if you can buy it elsewhere cheaper, then go do it, I dont need to know about it. Please don't email or text me to tell me.



Im Asking $1200 FIRM cash price  ..........or $1300 trade price as I'd rather have cash, but love to trade.   Again, dont waste our time if you dont want to pay this.  I dont need to sell it.



I really want an AR .308 new or like new and depending on gun, cant add cash, but maybe another gun with it.  I like Sig 716, but they have $200 rebate right now new so I cant trade high dollar for one since I can buy one $1300-1400 right now, but if we are close and its FDE preferably or black secondly, try me.  Also like DPMS SASS and obviously higher end Ar's too.  I can add stuff if you have quality optics on it that work.

I would do my Colt and an NAA .22LR / .22mag Revolver like new toward a 716 

Or my colt and a mossberg 500 tactical with appx $500 in it toward a 716 and ammo 

If DPMS SASS could possibly work out all 3 guns toward it

Other Trades I would consider are pistols plus cash or multi gun only Glocks (Gen 4 preferably ), Sig P238 or 938, Kimbers, Colts, Springfields, nicer brand 1911's,  possibly other Sigs like P226 in new condition but unless multi guns, possibly revolvers if new or like new condition..........all would need cash on top.  Don't want any pistols for even trade, would need at least $375  cash on top of one pistol please.  If your gun is fired, especially sigs, its used, so dont try to tell me its worth MSRP 



If you have two glocks in 9mm,  40 or 45....maybe 357 sig ......Gen 4's or Gen 3's w/ extras or OD, I would do both plus $150 cash   also interested in Glock 42 but would need another $50 each one

Or Sig P238 and Glock plus $150 cash

Or Sig P238 and P938 plus $100 cash

Or Sig P226 Navy and $450 cash or trade

Regular P226 and Glock plus $100

Nice 1911 and $375 cash if its worth at least $925





Im not interested in war relics, collectibles, junkers, hi points, keltecs, shotguns or hunting rifles.

My son's dirt bike broke yesterday and I need the cash to fix it.  Text (preferred) or call 719-640-7354.  I live in Simla and work in Cripple Creek Monday-Thursday.  That being said, I can meet you pretty much anywhere between Limon and Cripple Creek.  I would meet you as far south as Pueblo or as far north as south Denver (Cabela's) if you are coming from either one of those directions and wanted it all.  I will be going up to Greeley today, Sunday, 7-27-14, if you live anywhere along the way and are interested in the rifle.  Thanks for looking."

The PF-9 retains the best features from our P-11 and P-3AT pistols combined into the flattest and lightest single stack 9mm configuration ever made. The barrel, locking system, slide stop, assembly pin, front sight, recoil springs and guide rod are adapted from the P-11. The PF-9 is nearly identical to the P-11 in length and height and shares the same exterior controls. The shorter trigger system with integral hammer block and the extraction system are adapted from the P-3AT. Just like the P-11, the PF-9 will accept +P ammunition, however, not with continuous use.
     The rear sight is a new design and is adjustable for windage with the supplied allen wrench as well as for elevation with the use of shims (not included). The included 7 round rectangular magazine is supplied with a finger extension base plate and numbered holes. The under barrel accessory rail shares the dimensions of the MIL-STD-1913 picatinny rail although there is only one locking notch in the forward position.

The Marlin 22 in the picture has been sold and is NOT for sale.  I thought the description above was pretty clear but I have had about 10 emails asking if my price was for both guns.  I will take new pictures of only the shotgun this weekend as I have found there are a lot of people who can not read."

Glock 23C Gen 3 with Truglo TFO sights in original case, with manual, lock, cleaning rod/brush and speed loader. Also included: one 22rd mag, three 13rd mags, four 10rd mags, steel guide rod with extra power spring and factory guide rod with factory spring, Wilson Combat Shok-buff Recoil Buffer, three extra Glockmeister extra power and normal guide rod springs, one mag-well plug and one mag-well plug with integrated punch tool, JP Enterprises Extended Mag Release (factory release included), Glock extended Slide Release, .40 Cal BoreSnake and 400rds FMJ (Blazer and Armscor  180 grain) .40SW and 50 Federal  HydraShoks in 30 Cal Ammo Can. I will even thow in a belt holster if you need one for free.
Gun has less then 2000rds through it, has slight holster wear at front of slide. This gun has been babied. I am original owner, bought it 14 years ago. Truglo sights were installed June of 2013 I purchased from Brownells on 5/28/13, I have receipt.

Only serious buyers please. The price of $600 is firm as you are getting a great deal at that price including all the extras and ammo. Iâm selling it because the wife doesnât like the recoil and I recently picked up a new Glock 19 in FDE for me. I might be interested in a trade (worst thing I will say is no thanks), I like quality ARs, M1As, Scars, Tavors, tactical shotguns 12 or 20 gauge, Remmington 700 SPS Tactical, (Iâm sure the wife would prefer cash). 

Please text me at eight five six five six two two seven seven nine, to discuss.
Thanks for looking!

CORRECTION: Four 13rd Mags included, Four 10rd Mags and one 22rd. Only three of the 13rd mags are in pic but you get 9 total mags."

I think it's a damn good deal for a really good shotgun. Rifled barrel, 3 inch chamber.
I'm selling because I need money to buy a car because the flood a couple weeks ago killed my car.

Perfect condition no scratches no dings. And is very accurate if you read up on it a little.

The crossbow is one off of budk for 100-150 and I'm selling it for 60. With bolts. Some are camo and some are black and I have extra tips.
Accurate the way it is but I'll throw in a scope. 150 pound

Last is a gamo hornet 50 bucks. With ammo and centerpoint scope with zoom and multicolored recticle.
I had it camo taped but I did it kinda crappy so I took it off. The tape left residue but it will come off.
It's pretty quiet I shoot it in my back yard.
It goes for much much more online but I don't need it because I'm moving to a place where I can shoot my .22"

No Trades.

The receiver is newly manufactured with ""model 98/85"" above an attractive American Eagle crest. The bolt sleeve is German mfg. as it contains a German serial number. The stock is new and appears to be Birchwood. The sling looks to be original German mfg. The sling buckle appears to have a Persian proof mark. Because of the German proof marks on the barrel, it appears to be late year FN mfg. The barrel is bright and looks strong. This is not a barrel that saw WWII action. It is a post WWII barrel. On the top of the barrel is a proof mark ""K"" under a star, below the K mark is a crown over ""E"" over ""LG"" over a star. The letter ""E"" over the star is the mark of Auguste Jamart, a proof house test supervisor who conducted the testing of FN barrels at the Liege Proof House, from 1929 to 1959. This proof mark indicates that the barrel is of FN manufacture prior to 1959. There is a waffenamt, eagle over 880 proof mark on the sight base.

The gun is C&R eligible. Must ship to a C&R or FFL out of state, or direct to you, with proper identification, in Ohio. Do not bid if your FFL or C&R will not accept shipment from an individual. I will provide a copy of my Ohio Driver's license.
