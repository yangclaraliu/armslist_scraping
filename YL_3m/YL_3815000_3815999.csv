What's the Difference?!
COMPARING THE RUGER LC9S AND THE RUGER LC9S PRO:
The LC9 features a manual thumb safety where the new Ruger LC9s Pro does not. The other major feature change is the Magazine Disconnect Safety. The Ruger LC9 has a magazine disconnect where the New LC9s Pro does not.


WHAT'S A MAGAZINE DISCONNECT SAFETY?
Glad you asked...

The Magazine Disconnect feature makes the firearm inoperable if the magazine is securely locked into the frame of the gun. No magazine, no shooting.

Available in .338 Lapua Magnum, .300 Winchester Magnum and .308 Winchester, the precision grade barrel can be removed by simply loosening two bolts using a standard Torx wrench. Besides reducing maintenance and logistical burdens, this unique design allows for user level caliber interchangeability and serviceability with the MRAD rifle's barrel kits. The MRAD also boasts Barrett's fully adjustable match-grade trigger module, which is user accessible. The thumb-operated safety can be configured for left or right hand operation. The ambidextrous magazine release can be used intuitively while retaining a firing grip and cheek weld. Integrated into the MRAD rifle's 7000 series aluminum upper receiver is a 21.75 inch M1913 rail with 20 MOA taper. The forward receiver is drilled and tapped for accessory rails to be mounted at the 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions. The MRAD stock is foldable for enhanced portability yet locks in as solid as a fixed-stock rifle, creating a rigid platform for consistent firing. During transport the stock folds and locks onto the bolt handle maintaining the same rifle width whether folded or extended. Made of a temperature-resistant polymer, the adjustable cheek piece also offers a consistent rifle-to-user contact point. The rifle's length of pull can be set to five different positions with the push of a single button. From its quick-detach sling mounts to the Barrett Multi-Role Brown color that blends into any environment - every detail of the MRAD has been carefully designed to create one thing: a high-performance rifle you can truly make your own. Mounted on this rifle from the factory with Barrett rings is a Leupold Mk 4 4.5-14x50 long range riflescope. The Leupold sports a 30mm main tube, mil dot reticle, and M1 turrets. Rifle will ship with two 10-rnd mags, 2 rail sections with flush cup mounts, and one plain railed section. All in Pelican 1750 case."

The Beretta Px4 Storm is a semi-automatic pistol manufactured by Beretta of Italy and intended for personal defense and law enforcement use. The Px4 uses the same short-recoil, rotating barrel action as the Beretta 8000 models and uses the same trigger and safety system as the M9/92/96 series, while being completely different in design from either. Light-weight polymer construction with steel inserts, a modular trigger group, fully enclosing slide, Picatinny rail, and changeable backstrap options for the grip are a radical departure from previous Beretta designs."

    Notes: Pictures are of a previous model I had in stock, the current one up for auction has not been out of the box. The front sight may be red or green pending what Dan Wesson is installing at the time. Also the serial number will be different than what is pictured.

    Features: The PM9 is the only Government size Dan Wesson model chambered in 9mm Luger. We have offered this model in limited quantities in the past and always have demand greater than production capacity allows.

    This gun features our Clark style rib on top of the forged slide with an adjustable target sight in the rear and a popular fiber-optic sight in the front.

    The slide also features front and rear cocking serrations. The frame is forged stainless with an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI front strap checkering.

    We have polished the flats to a soft-brushed finish and sandblasted the rounds for a nice contrast.

    We have installed Double Diamond cocobolo grips to finish it off. With the low cost of 9mm ammunition and lack of recoil, this is the perfect model for getting acquainted with the 1911. This model shines both at the range and in competition. (9+1 capacity).

Most of these were ordered for customers that bailed out of the transaction.

1.) Springfield XDM 3.8 9mm Bitone with standard length grip.  This is the full kit with 2 magazines, holsters and speed loader.  My cost with shipping was $590.  Highly doubtful that you will find this gun for under $650 anywhere.  Big box stores sell it for $699.  Yeah, you can order it online and not pay tax but you will pay shipping and then a transfer fee.... where does that put you?  add it up!

2.) Beretta Nano 9mm Black.  $360  This gun retails typically $400-$430 depending on where you go.

3.) *USED*  Taurus PT92 9mm Black.  has 1 box (50 rounds) through it, looks new, feels new.  I have $400 into it, that's what I want out of it.  Dealer cost on a new one is $450, these would typically sell retail for $500-$550.

4.) Taurus mod. 66 Stainless 4"" .357  I have $425 into it, that's what I want for it.  Dealer cost right now on these is $457 and they are not in stock.  They have been out of stock every time I look for the past 6 months.  This is a very nice .357 for the money.

5.) CZ model 83 Browning 9mm (.380 auto)    This is a used surplus gun that came from an importer that imports them, inspects them and sells them to dealers.  This is a cool piece for any collection.  Its very similar to a Walther PPK.   Its in good shape, just has some wear on the finish.  I have debated keeping this for myself.  I personally would send it off and have it re-blued and find a set of new grips for it and it would be a nice safe queen/conversation piece. $300

*****Unfortunately I do have to charge sales tax to IL residents as I am a legit dealer.  I know... it sucks but hey.... you're still saving money.********

I WILL SHIP to an FFL out of state.  Not a problem!  If you are in the Kenosha/Lake Geneva area, there is a dealer in Paddock Lake I will deliver to for transfer to save you shipping.  I'm up that way anyways so its not really costing me time or money.


Prices on these are firm so don't even bother trying to beat me down.  

NO, you can not email me a copy of your FOID to start the paperwork and save you a trip  ATF says NO to that.

I will entertain trades for other firearms.  Kindly let me know what you have and as much detail about it as you can and we can go from there.  I will not give you retail for your used gun.  Sorry.  Why would I pay more than what I can get one for brand new from the factory?  Does that make sense?  Yeah... people try to pull that all the time.  Just like on the Pawn Shop TV shows.

I have an early model Czech VZ.24 Mauser. This gun is truly loaded with history (search google to find out). It is also revered by many (including Nazi soldiers of WWII, who used them in Stalingrad after capturing Czechoslovakian factories and also sent them to their Romanian allies) to be better than their own Mauser K98. As it was made in 1924, it is generally believed to have inspired the German design of the Karabiner 98k. These rifles appear to be moderately rare and few are around today as compared to the K98. To make it more rare, it is a Bolivian Contract rifle with the small Condor bird marking. Only 101,000 of these were ever contracted, caliber 7.65 (7.65 x 53), to be used in the Chaco War. This rifle has NO IMPORT MARKINGs, and as Bolivia has not released these rifles for import, it is likely a vet bring-back. It also has numerous markings indicating that it was made by the Czechs and also accepted into their army (Z within a circle; ""E"" in front of a rampant lion) before being contracted out. I have also been told by Mauser experts that this gun features many components of an early VZ24.
It is a great rifle in better condition than most (nearly any) VZs I have seen. The action is smooth and cycles rounds beautifully. It functions and shoots just fine. This is one of the best bolt actions I have seen and I am quite fond of it. 

I will drive half way to meet depending on offer. I am also willing to do bill of sale and can somehow fill it out to be compatible with a trade if requested. Really nice rifle but I am looking for something different.

Thanks for looking!

 Has Thompsen Center, TC, scope rings and bases on it, which are much sturdier than the made in china crap most have on a muzzleloader.

 Uses modern primers, not the small old style hard to load caps.

Bolt is easily and quickly removable for cleaning.

Comes with the CVA ramrod, see through scope covers, and the CVA tool that allows you to quickly remove the breech plug for easy cleaning. 

Has a little bit of fouling at the end of the barrel, the way I got it, but has always been very accurate. 

Only selling as I will use my handgun this year.

Feel free to ask any questions. Thanks for looking."

It is in excellent condition.  It shoots very smooth and accurately.  I have shot less then 300 rounds with it.  I am the original owner, and have the sales receipt.  Has been stored in a safe for years.  

This model is the sidearm of the South Korean Military, brought into the U.S. from 1991-2009. It has a record for being a well made and reliable gun.

Type - Triple action (Double / Single Action with Fast Action). Caliber - 9x19 Luger / Parabellum. Weight unloaded - 800g. Length-190 mm. Barrel length-105 mm. 

""The ""fast action"" feature is borrowed from FN’s GP “Fast Action” pistol. In this mode hammer is cocked by the cycle of the slide, then it is pushed forward by the pressure on the hammer head. In this position, the main spring remains cocked, so only light pressure on the trigger is necessary to re-cock the hammer and fire the gun in the “double action manner”. Or, alternatively, hammer can be re-cocked manually to be fired in single action for maximum first-shot accuracy.""

Comes with 13 round factory magazine, original box, and the manual.

Asking $300..cash or willing to trade.  With trading, if there is a value difference, I am willing to add cash for the right gun.  Let me know what you have to offer.

I'm not a professional gunsmith, but everything's tight on this rifle, ten test rounds at the range went flawlessly, the muzzle brake does its job superbly, the trigger is smooth as butter at approx. 2.5 lbs (comes with two other sets of springs to increase pull weight), and the nickel teflon bolt, bcg, and upper not only prevent carbon build up, but make for very slick action. A few cosmetic dings as shown in pictures, happy to meet in the Springs if you want to check it out."

BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE Premium 358 Win. Supercharged 225 gr. TSX (2500 fps) - 20 Round Box




Due to customer request, Buffalo Bore has developed two new powerful and precision loads in 358 Win.

Item 41A features a 225gr. Sierra SPTZ-BT @ 2545 fps out of a Ruger Hawkeye. (22 inch barrel) This bullet is suited for all North American big game from small whitetails to Yukon Moose and Bison. You should limit yourself to broadside shots on larger big game like moose and bison. At expected impact velocities, this bullet mushrooms readily, but holds together to penetrate large shoulder or hip bones.

Item 41B features a 225gr. Barnes TSX @ 2500 fps out of the same Ruger Hawkeye. This bullet can be used on ANY North American big game at ANY angle. The 225gr. Barnes TSX out penetrates typical 250gr. premium partition .358 bullets, but gives higher velocities, lower recoil and flatter trajectories of a 225gr. bullet. If you desire the flexibility of taking very large and dangerous NA big game at raking angles or at straight away shots, this TSX load delivers.

These 358 Win. loads were designed to be the most powerful and highest quality of any 358 Win. ammo in the world. This ammunition is safe for use in any/all 358 Win. rifles that are in normal operating condition."

Do you want to buy a Suppressor or Build a Short Barrel Rifle?

An NFA Gun Trust is a special kind of revocable living trust that is specifically designed to hold weapons regulated by the National Firearms Act (NFA), usually referred to as NFA weapons, Title II weapons, or Class 3 weapons. Illegal possession of an NFA weapon is punishable by a maximum of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance that you comply with all federal, state, and local laws not only at the time of purchase but also throughout the period of ownership.  My NFA Gun Trust is designed to do exactly that.

At the Law Offices of Smith, Dickey & Dempster, P.A., we can draft NFA Gun Trusts for clients throughout North Carolina. Most of the process can typically be completed by telephone and/or email. Clients located near our offices in Fayetteville, Sanford, and Lumberton are welcome to make an appointment to come in and sit down with us.

Want to trade for 7.62X39 ammo, preferably commercial non-corrosive stuff (Wolf, Tula, Herters, Monarch, Russian white box, Norinco, etc).  Will trade round for round for commercial non-corrosive.  Prefer it still be in the original boxes.

Will consider trading for military corrosive 7.62X39, but how I trade depends on what you have and how much we are trading.

Will consider trading for other cartridges as well at bulk cost - 9mm or .223/5.56.  How I trade will depend on what you have and how much we are trading.

Where to begin...

Faxon Firearms_Arak 21 Upper

This upper is from Faxon Firearms in Cincinnati, OH. A top quality build from the finest machines in America. For the upper I have 2 barrels one in 556 and one in AAC 300 BLK OUT. Also, the appropriate springs to accompany them. Both 16 inch barrels with a 1:9 twist. The muzzle device does a great job in mitigating the recoil pulse – very smooth shooting and very accurate cold hammer forged barrels. Side charging handle that is non reciprocating and can be switched left or right.  Long piston driven system with different gas settings.

AXTS Weapon Systems_AX556 Lower

This is a very unique lower. An all billet aluminum lower, milled out with a very attractive design. COMPLETELY ambidextrous – the saftey, the magazine release, and the bolt open close lever all ambidextrous. It is also outfitted with a Magpul UBR stock. The lower has a unique way of holding the bolt open using strong side hand to lock it open as the operator racks back with the reaction hand, it is called the A-DAC System. You will see in the video I post below. There is a long with for this lower to come off the line so there these are hard to find.

The SAFTEY is a Battle Arms development 45 Degree Ambi Safety lever. Made of milled billet aluminum. Smooth actuation from fire to safe. 

The TRIGGER. It is the Geissle Super Dynamic Enhanced(SD-E) Trigger. Straight 2 stage trigger with a pull of 3.5 pounds. 1st stage 2.3lbs - 2nd stage 1.2lbs. It was meant for Target shooting and precision shooting.

The GRIP is a Magpul MOE-K very slim meant for PDW/CQB setups but I find it makes for a great precision shooting grip when laying prone or bench rested on a bipod.


I think that is pretty much everything. It has a total of 400 rounds through the 556 barrel and nothing through the 300 BLK OUT barrel. And cleaned spotless after every session at the range. I put all of the best I could on this set up and a lot of attention went into it.
