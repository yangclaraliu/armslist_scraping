THE LEGEND CONTINUES, the legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic SWAT is a semi automatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate.

Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic SWAT features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as a aluminum quadrail forend that is ideally suited for mounting accessories. The Classic SWAT’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ barrel. SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor."

Rifle is on the heavy side due to stainless steel barrel (which is why it is so much more accurate than most ARs).  This rifle will outperform Colt and Daniel Defense rifles all day.   No trades.  I am selling to fund a .338 Lapua project."

What I'm looking to do is trade it for a sub-compact of either .380 or .9mm caliber. Depending on what you have I realize that there may have to be some bump on my end which I really don't have a problem with as long as it is reasonable.

There are a lot of people who have guns listed on this site that are asking far too much for their pre-owned gun. I have actually seen brand new guns at the gun shows that are cheaper than what they are being sold for here.

The P250®, a modular pistol that allows the shooter to change caliber and size at will....

The SIG SAUER® P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military, law enforcement, and civilian shooters around the world. The P250 will be available in the most popular calibers (9mm, .40S&W and .45ACP). The P250's innovative design enables the shooter to quickly remove the functional mechanism and place it into the polymer grip of his choice. This allows an immediate change in caliber and size;(subcompact, compact and full). And after any change the pistol delivers both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality. Its modularity not only provides incredible ease of maintenance, but also provides a solution for accommodating different hand sizes - there are 6 different ergonomic combinations for each size, accomplished by changes in grip circumference and trigger style. Now you can own the world's only modular shooting system globally engineered to deliver the ""To-Hell -And-Back-Reliability"" you've come to expect from Sig Sauer."

Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever.  The PT-92 continuously out performs the accuracy of the Beretta on the range as well.

Best Sight of 2013: Redring Optical Shotgun Sight
Article by Thomas McIntyre 0 
$750 (redringusa.com) What's most to like about the Redring is that there's not much to it. No doubt, some sights are better, or worse, when it comes to sight picture. But I have, frankly, always had trouble acquiring the red dot in many reflexes; the bright and generous crimson LED circle (which automatically adjusts to background light) in the Swedish-made Redring is impossible to miss. 

Beyond that, the Redring is put together with a minimum of parts, including large pieces of mono-bloc machining for extreme sturdiness. Too big for handguns, the sight comes with spacers and clamps to fit on shotgun ribs between 5 and 11.5mm, with no zero alignment required. The circle covers a 60cm diameter at 20 meters and so acts as a rangefinder, telling you not to shoot if the target's too small in the ring. You can check the battery level and set the sleep timer from six to two hours via a USB port and cable. This sight lets you shoot with both eyes wide open. --Tom McIntyre

The Buffalo Bore Heavy 10 mm ammo is the result of many years of customers requests that we produce several such loads for the 10 mm.

These loads bring out the full potential of the 10mm, but operate at standard pressures and as such, are safe to use in any standard 10mm pistol. Please don't phone us and ask if these loads are safe in your 10mm - THEY ARE - provided your 10mm is a normal operating pistol in good condition.

We are using flash-suppressed powders so your vision will not be materially affected should you be required to drop the hammer in low light.

If you are firing this 10mm ammo from an autoloader and experience high extreme spreads in velocity, it is not the ammo. Here is why and how to remedy the situation.

Full power 10mm ammo has always generated enough recoil and pressure to require a pretty stiff recoil spring in your handgun - this of course depends on several variables such as your slide weight, etc. When the cartridge fires, it generates enough pressure/recoil to prematurely open your breech face in some guns. When this happens, the opening breech face has an effect on the burn rate of the powder. This can result in some fairly high extreme spreads in velocity. If you are experiencing extreme velocity spreads of more than 50 fps, simply install a stiffer recoil spring. For example, I have an original Colt Delta Elite. This gun with the factory spring runs extreme spreads of about 35fps with both of these 10mm loads. I am happy with 35 fps, so I leave the Delta Elite as is. I also have a custom built Para Ordinance with a Nowlin barrel. It runs extreme spreads of about 70 fps with its original recoil spring. When I install a spring that is 4 lbs stiffer, the extreme spread drops to about 35 fps. The new Glock model 20 comes with a recoil spring that allows the breech face to open too soon and my new Glock model 20 will get extreme spreads of about 100fps with the factory spring installed. When I go to a stiffer recoil spring, the extreme spreads drop to about 50 fps in my new Glock model 20. Of course none of this will be an issue in a revolver. None of this will be an issue in real life either, as these high extreme spreads don't hurt accuracy or function. However, I mention this because if you are like me and want things to be as correct as possible, I have outlined the problem and the solution. The industry fixed all these problems initially, by watering down the 10mm ammo over the last several years. The watered down 10mm ammo does not generate the pressure/recoil to open the breech face early. If you want the full powered 10mm ammo we make, you simply need to tweak your pistol. Or just realize that you are getting some fairly high extreme spreads and ignore it or live with it. It's not hurting any thing in reality.

 The FEMARU 37M pistol, wich is also known as Frommer 37M, was developed by 1937 at Hungarian arms factory FEMARU to replace Frommer-designed 29M pistol, made at the same facility. This pistol was of simpler design, when compared to its predecessor, and susequently it was less expensive to make. Hungarian army adopted this pistol in 1937 in 9mm Browning Short caliber (which is also known in USA as .380 ACP). After the start of WW2, Germany placed a contract for the 37M pistols, chambered for the 7.65x17 Browning (.32 ACP) cartridge, which was standard for German armed forces along with more powerful 9x19 Luger / Parabellum ammo. German authorities also requested some design changes, namely the addition of the manual safety. German contract pistols were marked with ""P Mod 37"" rollmark and appropriate calibermarking ""Kal 7,65"" on the left side of the slide. The official designation of the these pistols within German military was P.37(u). Production of these pistols lasted between 1937 and 1944, with total production estimated at about 175 thousands.

 The FEMARU Model 1937 / Frommer 37M / P.37(u) pistol is a simple blowback operated weapon.The return spring is located below the barrel and the barrel is attached to the frame with four lugs below the chamber area, and can be easily dismounted when gun is disassembled. When gun is fired, barrel remain stationary. 
 The trigger is of single action type, with exposed hammer. No manual safety is available on the 37M, but the pistol is fitted with automatic grip safety at the rear of the grip. German contract P.37(u) pistols were fitted with additional manual safety on the left side of the frame, above the grip panel.
 Feed is from detachable box magazines, with magazine release catch located at the base of the grip, behind the magazine well. Each magazine is fitted with characteristic forward-facing finger rest at the bottom. External slide stop lever is provided at the left side of the frame."

The P2000 is an upgraded USP Compact, with interchangable backstraps and a slightly different frame.  It's seen light use since I bought it used, but has been kept cleaned and lubricated.  It's a very accurate pistol and makes for a great carry gun -- roughly the same size as a Glock 19/23.  

I'd really prefer not to separate the ammo from the gun -- trying to move away from .40.  Price for the package as described below is $750.  

The pistol will come with:
- 4 12-round magazines
- Original box with backstraps
- 48 rounds of Winchester Ranger-T 180gr JHP (in magazines)
- 50 rounds of Federal HST 180gr JHP
- 200 rounds of Winchester 165gr FMJ
- 100 rounds of PMC Bronze 165gr FMJ

I may consider some trades.  I don't need another shotgun or .22, and I don't care for deer rifles."

This gun is quite literally good as new, in perfect condition, with zero wear (as should be the case with a pistol that has only had 9 rounds put through it).

It comes w/ factory Siglite night sights, slim profile ergo E2 grips (they feel amazing), and 2 eight round mags, and factory Sig hard case and paperwork. Why buy from a dealer and pay the full retail price of $989.99, plus tax? This pistol is every bit as good as new, and you'd save a couple hundred bucks!

From the Sig website:

The P220® Carry is the latest step in the evolution of the P220 – the most accurate out-of-the-box .45 – and a perfect choice when it’s time to carry the ‘big caliber.’ This “commander” sized pistol features a full size frame with short slide and 3.9” barrel making it ideal for concealed carry. And like any P220 it performs above and beyond because the SIG SAUER® design allows for unparalleled performance regardless of bullet type or weight. This 8+1 capacity single stack pistol is available in a DA/SA configuration and features a durable Nitron® finish, Picatinny rail, and either post and dot contrast or 3-dot SIGLITE® night sights.


FYI: this $800 price is firm. Serious buyers only. Anyone that knows these pistols, knows that this is a legitimate good deal already. No trades.

It's never been mudded, raced or abused in any way. Original owner was just a rich old farmer in Lexington, NC and it never left his farm. Just putted around on it once in a blue moon !!! To see it in person is to believe it. Still has original tires on it with good tread remaining, oil was just changed and it has a brand new battery. Brakes are great and yes, the parking brake works as it should, as do the lights . All cables are mint. The seat is like brand new and the plastic doesn't have a crack and very little rub marks. It still shines like new too. Runs absolutely perfect. If you want an extremely dependable and new looking ATV for hunting, without spending $3,000.00 - $6,000.00, check this quad out today !!!

The price is firm at $1,750.00 as the condition merits the price all day long.

This is a 1965 Weatherby Mark V chambered in the ever popular 300 Weatherby Magnum. This was made in West Germany (serial # P8837), and is one of the finest examples of craftsmanship you will ever see. This was purchased by an older gentleman for a hunt that he never went on. It honestly looks new, and looks even better in person than in the photos. The figuring on the wood is breathtaking, and it has awesome attention to detail in the forend and grip cap.

It is topped with a Weatherby 2-7 scope that was purchased at the same time as the rifle. It is completed with a Buehler mount and rings that are a perfect match to the rifle.

The vintage tooled leather sling and sling swivels will go with the rifle. We also have some vintage 300 Weatherby ammo that will be for sale to the buyer of the rifle.

The rifle will ship in a hard plastic case for safe transport. Shipping will be a flat $45 to anywhere in the US. Credit and debit card payments add 4%. Ohio residents ad 6.5% sales tax. Please let us know if you have any questions. We are more than happy to chat over the phone or on email. Thank you very much for taking the time to look.
