Originally only offered to Service Members and Families. Approximately 750 SWAT units were engraved by Sig Sauer. Sig Sauer Night Stalker Commemorative 556 SWAT Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne) 160th SOAR (A) Rifle. The best features of both the AR and the AK platform. The U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation Regiment (SOAR), “Night Stalkers”, provided the helicopters, insert and cover for the raid on Osama Bin Laden's compound in May 2011. To commemorate this historic event, Sig Sauer manufactured a very limited number of these U.S. Army ""Night Stalkers"" rifles. Sig Sauer is no longer taking orders on these 5.56 NATO's.

Details: WR556-16B-CS-RD CLASSIC SWAT, Long Gas System, Rotary Diopter Rear Sight, Flash Suppressor Swiss Folding Stock w/ Quad Rail Forend. Also works with AR-15 magazines and will shoot the .223. In my opinion, the Sig 5.56 is a far superior gun to most AR-15

I have up on the chopping block today a Glock 19, Gen 3 with still bright (2 year old) Trijicon HD night sights. I don't round count my weapons but believe me when I tell you it is in outstanding shape. (I would upload pics but VAGT hates me, so we can text or email once it becomes relevant to the transaction) 

Coming with the firearm I have 3 holsters, and 4 magazines.

A custom made kydex concealment holster by EDC holsters out of Charlottesville, VA. Check out their facebook for images. Ron puts out some great kit. (Retail $70)

A Blackhawk LVL 3 Serpa duty style holster. 
A Blackhawk LVL 3 Serpa duty style holster for weapon with Blackhawk's proprietary weapon light (which I will include in the deal)

I will part out the holsters without the gun, but I will not sell the gun independent of the holsters. 250 bucks worth of kydex doesn't do me any good without a gun to go in it.

I'm looking to trade at the moment. If you wanna talk cash price, we can do that privately.

After you build this rife you will need to pin and weld a 2"" muzzel to reach your legal 16"" mark. The cost for a pin and weld job should not cost you more than $50 by a local gun smith. All these parts cost me right around $860. I bought the upper receiver used so it has wear on it. The barrel and rail I bought brand new and has never been fired. Let me know if you have any further questions or need detailed pictures. I am selling this upper kit so cheap because I need cash fast.

The light that is pictured is not included, just the mount. I have a substantial quantity of Hornady and Federal 00 buckshot that I will include for the right price.

This shotgun has been ran through at least 2 classes, as well as multiple qualifications, so it does have signs of use, but it goes bang everytime the trigger is pulled. It has been kept cleaned, oiled, and maintained through it all, so it is in good condition considering that. I have been in the military for six years, so I know how to maintain a weapon. It does not look like it has been dragged behind an 18 wheeler, but it does have a few scuffs and scratches. The only reason I am parting with it is because I carry a rifle at work, so it doesn't see much use anymore. I am asking $350.00 OBO, which is more than fair considering the $100+ dollars worth of aftermarket accessories and furniture that you can either use or resell."

I bought this particular gun (for a LOT more than $2,500...I paid $3,200), because I KNEW that it was MD legal (it is 29.25"", just beating the 29"" requirement, and this particular gun was one of the limited number that FN produced and sold with an actual 10 round magazine).  So the piece of mind of knowing that it was unquestionably legal, and that no one could come back later and say it was not was worth my paying a huge premium at the time.

See description,"St. Cloud or Twin Cities, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota",Offer,"Listed On: Wednesday, August 6, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I'm looking for a rifle scope with the following requirements:
It must be a gloss finish. It's a classic rifle and the new matte scopes just don't look right.

I would prefer a higher power, such as 3-12, 4-12 or 4.5-14, since this is a 7mm and will be zeroed at 200 yds.

The objective can't be any larger than 42mm. 

It needs to be a full size scope body, no compacts due to the ring locations on this rifle.

It needs to have a generous eye relief. Something around 4"" would be good.

I would prefer a simple BDC reticle, but this may not be possible if it's an older scope.

I realize I may have to go with an older model, but it must be in excellent condition, as it's going on a classic rifle that's in mint condition.

I'm not even sure at this point what scopes fit all these requirements (if any), but I'm hoping someone has something out there, or at least can give me an idea who still makes something like this. Maybe an older Burris Fullfield, Leupold Or Nikon Monarch.

I don't want any Simmons, Tasco or similar brand scopes. 

If you have something that fulfills most or all of these requirements, please respond to this ad.

Thank you."

FROM MESA TACTICAL WEB SITE: Our SureShell shotshell carriers retain ammunition reliably and, being metal, can withstand the rigors of daily use and abuse. Fabricated from aircraft aluminum, they feature an innovative rubber friction retention system and tough construction to endure years of use and abuse. Since their introduction in the spring of 2005, they have rapidly become our best-selling accessories, and an emerging industry standard.
SureShell carrier yokes are milled from 6061-T6 aircraft aluminum, then bead blasted and Mil-spec hard anodized for a rugged non-glare finish. SureShell yokes are secured to application-specific brackets, and some SureShell carriers include high temperature adhesive-backed die-cut rubber gaskets to protect the host shotgun’s finish.
SIDE MOUNT SURESHELL SHOTSHELL CARRIERS
Most of our SureShell shotshell carriers mount directly to the receiver of leading shotgun platforms. The receiver mounting scheme of our receiver mount SureShell carriers for the Remington shotguns uses a combination of steel fasteners threaded into a steel pin (at the rear) and paired Chicago screws (up front) for more secure attachment to the shotgun without the risk of pinching the receiver. The mounting plate even features a window over the shotgun serial number location, to make it easier for armorers to inventory their weapons.

You will not find a another AR-15 with all these features at this price! This is a brand new in box CMMG M4 AR-15 semi-automatic rifle chambered for 5.56mm NATO. This rifle features a 16"" 4140 Chrome Moly Steel M4 profile barrel with a 1:9"" twist. This barrel boasts CMMG's W.A.S.P. salt bath nitrocarbuerization treatment, sometimes known as nitriding, which offers improved wear, abrasion, and corrosion resistance as compared to chrome lining or phosphating. Unlike chrome lining, where the chrome is built up on the surface, nitriding converts the surface without build-up, so accuracy is not compromised. The barrel and upper receiver have M4 feed ramps for flawless cycling. A ""F"" marked front sight post/gas block is fitted, and a removable MBUS rear sight is included. The upper receiver is forged aluminum with a flat top Picatinny rail for easy and secure mounting of optics. The lower is forged as well, with a low shelf for RDIAS, and is compatible with standard mil-spec componentry. The magazine well is beveled for quicker, more confident reloads. A Magpul adjustable butt stock and MOE style pistol grip are outfitted. Front and rear sling mounts are mounted for easy carrying. One 30 round PMAG is included."

I have 3-100 round boxes, but there are 299 rounds. I opened a box and tested one out of my only .22, which is a pistol. It is loud out of a pistol due to the shorter barrel.

Its in great shape with minimal wear. These have 4.25in commander length barrels and has a lightweight alloy frame making it much easier to carry as a cc pistol. Also has cocobolo hardwood checkered grips, flat mainspring housing, extended beavertail safety, 3 dot sights, skeletonized adjustable trigger, extended safety lever, and ring hammer; basically all of the features that most people want on a 1911.
 Comes with two factory mec gar magazines, case, barrel bushing wrench, fobus paddle holster, and all factory paperwork and accessories.

Its a great gun but I've had a few 1911's and I'm just finding that I'm not a big fan of the platform. I'd like to trade for a different semi auto handgun of some sort in 9mm, .40, or .45. I prefer sa/da hammer fired guns like SIG's, Beretta's, and CZ's, but I like Glocks, XD's and XDm's as well.  Pretty open so feel free to let me know what you have, but I'm not interested in rifles or shotguns aside from pistol caliber carbines. No Tauruses please.

If not interested in trading I will sell for $600.

I have my CCL, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred as I sleep until late in the afternoon.

This gun is brand new becuase I bought the fiirst generation Maxus and had some issues with it.  I have been dealing with Browning for a while trying to figure out what was wrong with it.  They couldn't figure it out either so they sent me a brand new one with all the new upgrades to make it even better.  I loved shooting this gun but have decided to sell this since it is still brand new and go back to a benelli.

It has a Mannlicher stock made of very attractive Tiger Stripe Maple. Sorry, my photos don't do the stock justice. When I turned my flash on to try and bring out the grain of the wood the glare from the flash was worse.
This rifle was my Grandfather's. He grew up in Philadephia near Jaeger's shop (in Jenkintown PA, a suburb of Philadelphia.)

At the time my Grandfather had this rifle made he considered this to be one of the best available varmint rounds, he handloaded rounds that he said were devastating on the local groundhog population. (the time was pre-WWII)
The action is marked ""Spandau 1916"", a K98 Mauser action. This rifle has no other markings on it. I know that typically Jaeger would stamp all of his rifles with his name. I don't know why in this case he did not do that with this rifle. This rifle would have been made very early on in Jaeger's career, he is mostly known for his custom work after WWII. I am unaware of any of his stamped custom rifles made before WWII. Jaeger's shop did the barreling of the action, trigger work, sight mounting, etc. Since my grandfather is not around to ask I can only guess why it was not stamped. My grandfather was a teenager when he had this rifle made up for him. Perhaps he did not want the rifle to have any extra markings on it (my grandfather was that type of guy). My guess is it was a combination of the those two thing. But I just don't know. The rifle is very nicely made and has lots of nice details, even the screws that hold the scope mount have engraved letters on them, not stamped, to show which is the front and rear screw. Great detail all over.

The wrist of this rifle has a crack in it that runs with the grain.

It does not seem to affect the structure of the stock, the stock is very sturdy, but visually you can see it.

It has a peep sight installed and drilled for a scope mount, the period scope mount is included.
This rifle is a great package that shows what a well funded youth would get as a varmint rifle pre-WWII.

I have many additional photos available. Send me an email and I would be happy to email you photos.
All offers are welcome and encouraged. Please don't hesitate to contact me.

I will ship this rifle to anywhere in the US for $50, which INCLUDES a hard rifle case that it will be shipped in.

Sorry, no returns. I am not an FFL and can't directly receive a return. I would be happy to email you any additional photos so you know exactly what you are buying.

The .454 Casull is one cartridge that Buffalo Bore Ammunition does not load to it's full pressure limit. When loaded to it's full pressure potential the .454 Casull can become unreliable and unpleasant to shoot. At upper pressure levels, heavy bullets tend to jump crimp - tying up the cylinder. (wouldn't this be great in an emergency) Also, fired brass can stick in the chambers. 

Buffalo Bore Ammunition feels that a 360 gr. bullet (or 325 gr. bullet at 1525 fps) at 1425 fps is still very powerful, comfortable to shoot, and TOTALLY RELIABLE. At these levels, these bullets give up nothing in killing performance."
