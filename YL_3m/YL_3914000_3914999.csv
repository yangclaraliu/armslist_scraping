Since this rifle was manufactured before 1899 the federal regulations allow me to ship directly to an individual. It does not have to go through a FFL holder unless your state has regulations requiring that. I am not a dealer so be sure your FFL will accept firearm shipments from an individual if an FFL must be used."

This gun was machined by ATEI with front cocking serations, more effective rear cocking serations, and milled for the Trijicon RMR. The work done by ATEI seats the RMR extremely tight and low. No other mounting options I have seen, on any gun, compare. Following the milling, the slide and barrel were finished with the self lubricating nickel boron. It also has suppressor height Trijicon night sights installed that co-witness with the RMR. Also installed is the APEX bullet proof extractor and spring. The trigger linkage is polished and a smooth faced Glock 17 trigger installed as opposed to the stock 19 trigger face. The trigger is exceptional while maintaining the reliability of OEM parts.

Package includes, Boxes/paperwork, firearm, RMR (adjustable RM06 3.25 MOA), and 3 magazines.

Shooters searching for incredible performance in a match rifle need look no farther than the National Match M1A™ from Springfield Armory®. The National Match M1A™ is purpose-built for one thing: winning competitions.

The list of features that distinguishes the National Match M1A™ series starts with the fact that the action is glass bedded into the new walnut stock. This provides a rock-solid platform for the rest of the rifle – like the medium-weight National Match barrel. A crisp 4.5 – 5lb National Match tuned two-stage trigger will ensure you can place your shots exactly where and when you intend. The .0595” hooded rear aperture sight gives precise ½ MOA adjustments for both windage and elevation. The rear sight combined with the .062” front sight blade gives the shooter precise target acquisition capability. A National Match recoil spring guide and match-tuned gas cylinder ensure that the rifle will operate with reliable accuracy.

If you’re ready for a rifle that will help you get to the top of the leader boards, consider the Springfield Armory® National Match M1A™.

Generation 2 Glock 22. 
Gun has been my regular carry and range gun for quite a while. Within last 6 months all internal springs were installed by a glock armoror and I added a stainless steel guide rod with new recoil spring. Comes with one (1) fifteen round magazine. This is a well used and well cared for gun with tons of life left, barrel grooves are still very good condition. Has never malfunctioned a single time on any ammo. Must have either a concealed carry permit, a signed and stamped purchase permit, ID,  and we will both get a bill of sale. No trades, price is firm(meaning if you offer lower you will be wasting your time). Must meet in Burlington. If you are reading this post then the pistol is STILL AVAILABLE, so please only ready serious buyers."

Includes carrying case and two ten round magazines.





Here's some info fro Beretta's website:

U22 Neos: Today's Best Plinking Rimfire Pistol

Designed and manufactured in the USA, the new U22 Neos is a single-action .22 LR caliber plinking semiauto pistol. Although designed with the entry-level pistol shooter in mind, it is also ideal for training and can be adapted to the needs of experienced users. Its modular construction makes it easy to modify with a variety of options and accessories, while still being affordable both as a base pistol and as a fully-accessorized system.


Cool, Futuristic Design

Even while designing a plinking pistol to be used for informal shooting, Beretta did not cut corners. The lines of the Neos bear the unmistakable flavor of renown Italian designer Giugiaro--the same mind behind several of our most attractive offerings. The result is a sleek and ergonomic rimfire pistol that feels as good in the hands as it pleases the eyes.


Fully-Modular Construction

The Neos is constructed of five modular parts that may be easily disassembled and reassembled without any tools. The ergonomic grips are constructed of super-durable fiberglass-reinforced technopolymer with non-slip inserts for a comfortable and warm hold. The barrel is available either in the classic Beretta blue finish, or in stainless steel (""Inox""), to satisfy the tastes of every shooter. Most of these elements may be replaced with the rich assortment of accessories that is available for this fun .22 semiauto.


High Performance

Reliable, durable, easy to maintain and remarkably accurate, the Neos features an integral rail that accepts Weaver-style scope mounts as well as a fully-adjustable target rear sight. The firearm is also equipped with a cocked firing pin indicator at the rear of the pistol. The single stack, 10-round stainless-steel magazine features an easy-grip knob that allows you to compress the spring from outside, thereby making loading extremely quick and easy.

(OSS). It is coupled with HK’s unique new Modular Rail System (MRS) to provide the shooter with a high performance integrated weapon system. The modular rail system (MRS) for the MR556-SD allows the shooter to place individual rail components and accessories anywhere along the length of the seven free sides of the forearm using the slotted interface. HK has been working with OSS to develop the next generation of advanced suppressors for the HK MR series of rifles and carbines. These suppressors are comprised of two modules, a Back Pressure Regulator (BPR) and a Signature Reduction Module (SRM)™. The BPR1425™ on the MR556A1-SD captures and controls expanding gases instead of simply trapping the gas with baffles. To further reduce the sound signature of the MR556 and eliminate flash, the OSS SRM4 module can be added to the end of the BPR1425. Important Features of the MR556A1-SD MODULAR RAIL SYSTEM (MRS) Repeatable rail segment mounting in any position along the 14 inch forearm (9 inch MRS also available) Self-captured rail segment hardware Two integrated Quick Detachable (QD) sling attachment points just forward of the receiver Optional positionable QD mount attachment Octagon profile allows the OSS suppressor to be installed/removed with the rail in place MRS provides more comfort to the shooter’s support hand OSS SUPPRESSOR Typical 18 dB reduction with the BPR module installed without SRM Less than an inch of increased weapon length with just the BPR Eliminates up to 95% of the back pressure created by traditional suppressors Attenuates the noise signature without adversely affecting the operating system Redirection of expanding gas within the BPR reduces felt recoil and muzzle rise Greatly reduces weapon fouling Little increase in bolt speed Reduces component wear and overheating common to legacy suppressor designs Reduction in back pressure greatly diminishes toxic gases expelled back at the shooter"

I bought this new a few months ago and have only shot 40 rounds through it.  All ammo shot through it was Federal Gold Medal Match 168grain SMK's.

Accuracy was very good.  At the time I was shooting with the stock trigger, which was standard mil-spec.  I have since put a Rock River 2 stage National Match trigger in it, but have not taken it to the range since.  It is a great trigger, and should tighten up groups nicely.  The pic of the two groups was 100 yards on the bipod, BEFORE the new trigger.  This is a very nice rifle.

Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing. • Easy to ConcealEasy-to-Conceal Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days. • Personal Protection Made Easy Personal-Protection-Made-EasyThe Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue. • Easy to Use and MaintainEasy_to-Use-and-Maintain The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol.

I have a very nice savage 64. No rust. Very Nice. Looks juist like when purchased. 

Kept well oiled and in good storage. Iron sights. No optics. Synthetic stock. Shoots well. Bought it for a basic gun. It is indeed that. Shoots well. Doesnt jam easily. Even with crappy ammo. 

I never used it enough. Ran a two boxes of 100 rds through it. Cleaned it, lightly polished the bolt and trigger( just finely sanded and steel wool, no trigger work) and put it in the safe. 

Partial to Bolts... would trade for a bolt. Or anything else you feel, just no muzzle loaders or crappy guns. 

Otherwise 150 takes it. No ammo. Thats partly why Im selling."

Never had an issue with this pistol it has shot every type of 40 cal ammo I've fed it, although i dont use crap for ammo, i refuse to use Tul Ammo and similar cheap garbage on any weapon i own. It has been cared for extremely well and I've used Slipstream lube and grease on it for lubricant and i always clean prior to storing if i used the weapon at the range. May have a total of 500 rounds through it, Maybe. I use my S&W 40 for CCW which i have probably 2000$+ into with the Trijicon RMR, milling and other mods so i dont even carry this at all and it hasnt gotten much use. Just sits in my gun safe at the house. I'm looking for $750 OBO cash, not looking to trade anything. Got my AR15, shotguns and other handguns the way i want them i dont need accessories either. Thanks for looking."
