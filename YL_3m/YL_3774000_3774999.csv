I added a Tasco 3-9x scope and acquired two 10 round mags.  They are better than the original 5 rounder (threw it away), but they're not perfect.  This gun feeds the first 9 rounds just fine, but the 10th usually doesn't go into the chamber without some fiddling with the finger, putting it into launch position.  These rifles seem to be famous for mags that aren't great, and compared to a lot of stories, these mags are pretty good.  9 good feeds out of 10, if you run the bolt briskly.  The mag springs seem to be just too weak to position that last round for chamber entry.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's an aftermarket replacement mag that's better, but I haven't found it.

Overall, great light rifle for someone who isn't 6'4"" and 275 lbs.  

It's in very good condition and I haven't put more than about fifty rounds through it.  I bought it sight unseen and it's physically a bit too small for me.  And I'm a lefty, and right handed bolt operation is harder than I thought it would be.

Not worth shipping/Xfer costs, Houston area is best, I'll meet you somewhere that works.  :-)

The last time out with it, about a year ago, I put twenty rounds into an area the size of a playing card at 100 yards.  Not spectacular grouping, but I have learned I""m not a very good shot with an awkward small rifle.  (I do better with my Savage 110 left hand bolt in .270 Winchester)."

The M37 was the cream of the ground .30 caliber air-cooled Brownings. It was also, sad to say, the last production .30 caliber Browning to be adopted by the US military. After WW2 the Army needed an improved tank machine gun. The 1919A4 had some drawbacks as a coaxial tank MG so work began around 1950 to produce a serviceable weapon. Design prototypes included the 1919A4E1, T-151, T152 and the T-153. The T-153 was ultimately adopted as the M37 in 1955.

 The M37 can be fed from either side and has a link chute opposite the feed side. The bolt has dual tracks for alternate operation of the belt feeding pawl. The pawl can be reversed and the pawl lever moved to the other side. Two wedge shaped switches close off the unused track, and the ejector can be reversed. The top cover can easily be opened from either side by rotating a winged knob. The gun is charged from the rear via a retracting slide. The driving spring is captive and is secured to the right side plate at the rear by sliding a conical block into a dovetailed slot. There is no driving spring rod protruding through the back plate. The back plate envelopes the receiver sides and can be easily removed by depressing a latch at the top. There is a horizontal trigger safety, and the left side sight base has been eliminated. The rear sight base is integral to the top plate.

 This would be a great collection piece or enjoyed by itself or along side another 1919 in a dual mount(not included)

 This package includes gun, AA tripod, 1919 mount with ammo can holders on either side(one for belted ammo the other catches links.), 300 links and linker.

 The Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V11, based on the popular V9 series, was designed for shooters who prefer the benefits of the KeyMod system integrated in the new SLiM Rail™ (Slim Lightweight Modular). KeyMod is a recoil resistant, two-part, direct attachment method for accessories that offers outstanding “return-to-zero” when accessories are removed and reinstalled. The new SLiM Rail™ 15.0 offers incredible weight savings as well as superior cooling, ergonomics, and modularity while maintaining the strength and durability expected from Daniel Defense. The long, 15” rail gives operators the option to have the support hand extended out closer to the muzzle allowing them to drive the gun more precisely and prevents over travel when transitioning between multiple targets. This combined with our mid-length gas system, which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick, but precise rapid fire. An uninterrupted picatinny rail on top and KeyMod attachment at 3, 6, and 9 o’clock, ensures plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. The DDM4v11 is equipped with a free-floating, Cold Hammer Forged, 16” Government profile barrel and the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Buttstock and Pistol grip.

I'm sure your questions will be answered if you read through, if not, by all means drop me a line.


For sale I have a complete AK-74 package.

Rifle shoots excellent and functions flawlessly (as AK's are known to do) The only reason I'm selling is I'm looking to get a M1A and I already have a Couple of AR's that will fill the same role as this rifle.

Breakdown of whats included.

AK-74 built by Waffen Werks purchased last year and has 180 rounds through it.

From The Website:

These high quality AK-74 rifles are built from all matching Bulgarian AK-74 parts sets. Rifles are built to exacting standards on a new U.S. made Waffen Werks receiver. Each rifle features a brand new chrome lined U.S. made barrel properly chambered for the 5.45x39 round. They have been extremely accurate.

Rifle features a Tapco G-2 trigger set and a U.S. grip and is fully 922r compliant with all AK-74 mags regardless of country of origin. Rifles also incorporate a side rail for easy installation of scope rails or accessories.

New $619.

AK-74 Accessory package, 4 30rnd parts kits, mag pouch, bayonet and oil bottle. $169

2 Tapco 30rnd parts kits $24

900rnds 7n6 ""banned"" ammo. Full case $240 Since its a partial case I'll value it at $200

AK ergo grip, so you can actually hold the rifle. $20

Kvar O.D. green ""NATO"" length stock, A inch longer to fit us decadent capitalist pigs in the West. I have both the original stock and grip that will go with it. $47

""Venezuelan"" PK-A red dot. A excellent red dot that was built for the Venuzualian Army by the Russians. The great thing about this particular sight it that it uses a regular AA battery and it sits low enough to co-witness the stock AK sights. It also allows a proper cheek weld on the rifle a huge plus. $400

Total price if bought separate $1479

My price $1200. Non negotiable!

No Trades unless your looking to trade a M1A Loaded with a stainless barrel.

I will not break up the package it's all or nothing, sorry I just don't want to deal with all the hassle. I'm in no hurry to sell, I really have no need to sell just trying to diversify my collection so the price is the price. Don't bother contacting me saying ""I found all this stuff at the gun store for $30."" If you did, great, buy it. Don't bother telling me.

You want to do the Dealer thing you line it up, and cover the fees.

I wont travel out of the Denver Metro area so I hope your local or willing to travel.

Handmade hidden compartment gun bench built right here in Ohio.  Keep your firearms nearby and hidden and safe from thieves yet still available lightning fast when needed!  On this bench I installed high strength magnets to keep the lid shut so it appears to be nailed down just give it a firm pull and it lifts right up!   Bench is very solid and built to last! Stained and Polyurethaned to protect the wood.  Holds firearms up to 39"" long.  

(I designed this bench to be accessed with lightning speed in mind regardless of lighting conditions no need to search for keys or hidden buttons or side drawers that pull out to access the compartment because you know what all those things as nifty and neat as they might sound take up one very valuable thing to accomplish, TIME!  and in a emergency TIME can make the difference between life and death. with my bench all you gotta do is pull on the top and grap the gun and that's it!   My competitors like to boast that their side opening or drawer type opening hidden compartments don't disturb whatever's placed on top of the table or bench, my thinking on this matter is so freaking what if some fancy candle stick or flower pot that's resting on top of the table gets thrown to the floor when you open it because in a emergency the only thing that matters is TIME! not house decorating.     If you want a bench or table let me know.

Custom Sizes also available upon request. Down payment required.

Discounts Available to active or retired LEO or American Military Members. 

Pricing options also available to FFL Dealers looking to purchase more than 1 bench 
(Allow 3-4 weeks for me to build multiple benches, can be stained different colors)

Back when everyone thought that the pump action shotgun couldn’t be improved, the Benelli Nova Pump proved otherwise. Completely original and innovative, the 12-gauge pump incorporates a polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics make the gun not only pleasing to look at, but a delight to hold and handle. Distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and forend in place of conventional checkering provides a positive gripping surface and complements the innovative engineering of the Nova Pump. With dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, the Nova 12-gauge shotgun handles anything from target loads to 3-1/2 Inch magnums. Realtree MAX-4™ finish."

I have all handloaded myself.  Each round is made up of a once fired brass case, and each case has been trimmed to the same length.  The primer used is a Federal Large Rifle primer. The powder used is IMR 4831 and is loaded to the Nosler manuals recommendation of 53-55 grains. The bullets used in some are 165 grain Sierra spitzer boat tails. Some are loaded with  165 grain Sierra Spitzer hollow point boat tail. Each case was loaded very carefully and in my experience shoot much better then any factory ammo I have found. I have several to sell and have plenty of supplies to make more if you need more. Any and all funds gained by this are going to help pay for a study abroad program, so please purchase! I am looking to get about $1.25 per shot because of the tolerances I put on my loads but depending on the quantity we can work something out.

This upper has been very accurate (and very loud) especially with 77Gr ammunition such as Black Hills. I've run around 120 rounds through it, broke it down and bedded the barrel to up the accuracy about halfway through that and its a nail driver now with a 4-16x42 Nikon M-223 scope.

I'm the 3rd owner and I bought it from the original owner's son.  The shotgun is from the late 60's / early 70's based on my research of the serial number.  It takes 2 3/4"" and 3"" shells and shoots wonderfully.  The barrels are 26"" and chokes are full and mod or imp cylinder (not sure).  It's great for turkey and clay pigeons and hardly ever misses!  YMMV!  It's in very good condition as you can see from the pictures but it's not for a collection.  It wants to be in the field with someone who loves shooting.  The gun was made in Japan and assembled in Korea.  I don't need to sell the gun so don't bother with low ball offers, I won't respond.  I want the gun to have a good home.

Then threaded into it with a set screw is a folding adapter (folds to the left) that allows the installation of a buffer tube. The folder portion can be removed and a standard buffer tube can be used for a fixed stock, so you have both options.

Although I'd like to say I'll get back to all who submit an offer, life just doesn't happen that way.  So, if I don't get back to you, you'll know you were outbid.

Face to face, cash only at FFL.  Buyer pays all transfer fees.  Will not ship.  Please don't offer a trade, as I'm looking for cash only.

The Sig Sauer P250 was designed specifically to address the future needs of the military and law enforcement professionals around the world. The innovative design of the removable steel frame housed in a polymer grip module allows agencies and units to change caliber, pistol size (subcompact, compact and full), trigger length and grip size without changing the issued serial number. The steel frame controls the rearward motion of the slide- not the polymer grip, as in other pistols. The result is both outstanding accuracy and reliable functionality even with laser/light accessories mounted to the polymer grip's accessory rail.

In terms of price, I am not going to be one of those guys on armslist that jacks up the price for a used Glock for more than the retail.  With that said, I am also not going to just give this.  I believe 475-480 is a reasonable price. I also have between 600 and 700 rounds of .40 ammo.  Mostly Federal FMJ but also some assorted Critical Duty and Speer Gold Dot Hollow Points.

The Izhmash Saiga autoloading shotgun incorporates the Kalashnikov design, providing reliability and simplicity of operation. Outstanding accuracy is achieved by the smooth bore, Lancaster style elliptical barrel, which imparts a spin on projectiles, increasing accuracy and exterior threading to accept chokes. The chrome lined barrel, chamber and gas system resist corrosion, making cleaning easier and extending the life of the shotgun. A lightweight, impact resistant polymer sporter stock and forend are checkered for comfortable control and include 3/4” sling mounts. An oversized trigger guard allows use with gloved hands.
