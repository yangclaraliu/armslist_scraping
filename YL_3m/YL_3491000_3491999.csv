The end of the war in Europe overtook widespread issue of the No.5 and most of the operational use of this rifle occurred in post-war colonial campaigns such as the Malayan emergency, where engagement ranges tended to be shorter and its handier size and reduced weight were an advantage. This is where the ""Jungle Carbine"" nickname comes from. Production began in March 1944, and finished in December 1947.  This one is Dated June 1944 and has always been a great shooter."

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability andneed not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

For sale / trade is a Sig Sauer P-229 (.40 caliber) with two magazines and the factory hard case.  

This is a smooth firing comfortable firearm.  I’ve only had it out to the range twice but had no FTF or FTE issues.  It’s a pleasure to launch rounds downrange with, but I’m migrating toward .45 caliber and so this one is up for sale / trade.  

Trades I’m interested in include:  

AR-15 / M-4 with 16” barrel in 5.56mm
AR-10 in .308 with at least an 18” barrel
1911 in .45ACP 
High Standard – Double Nine (.22 LR)

If you are sending me a trade offer let me know the value you place on your trade.  If it’s a high estimate or I’m not familiar with aspects of the firearm (accessories, private manufacturers, etc.) I may ask for a price breakdown, that’s not to insult you it’s to better inform me.  If your trade is worth more we’ll work that out too.

Additional photos available if required.  

I check email at least daily for messages and can reply by text if you include a cell phone number.  

I will need to see a valid state or military ID, either a MN PTP or PTC,  and fill out two sets of private party transfer paperwork – one for each of us.  


Happy Trails."

I am the original owner, and bought it new when the .40's in the more ""carryable"" size (23's) first came available.  They were very controversial at the time!  Anti-gunners were afraid you couldn't see them at airports or in metal detectors!  Round count is around or under 300, so it looks like new.  I kept it in a rug - never carried.  It includes the two original Glock 13 round magazines and a third Glock 10 rounder (good for practice - save the other two for serious business!) that I bought during the Clinton years.  I also have a very nice VEGA holster that is also near new (never carried - just put the pistol in a few times to check for fit).  This holster can be used for small of back carry, upright strong side (right) or forward tilt (right).  I also have a HOGUE finger-grooved sleeve on it, which makes it non-slip and perfect in the hand (perfect in my large sized hands, anyway).

NO MAGAZINE SALES into NEW YORK CITY 
This listing is for ONE Magazine. Buyers, however, may take any number of extras at the same per-mag price and with no additional shipping charges. Beretta introduced its flattest smallest yet 9mm subcompact in Las Vegas at the 2012 SHOT show. The Nano’s .91 thickness puts Beretta in the class with competitors Walther’s PPS and with the unpretentious Kel-Tec PF9 and its LC9 version marketed by Sturm Ruger. This is the flat plate, short, concealable variant of the Nano’s factory replacement or extra magazine. Manufacturer is Beretta USA of Accokeek MD. Construction is smooth finish stainless steel body with viewing ports, steel spring, and blued steel cartridge follower. Floorplate is stainless inner against hard polymer outer plate, grooved for fit to the pistol and for easy disassembly for cleaning and maintenance. Each magazine holds 6 rounds of 9mm ammunition – 9mm Luger, 9mm Parabellum, 9x19, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Each magazine is factory packaged. Factory part number is JM6NANO9. The unpackaged photo specimen came with one of the new pistols we had in stock at press time on this ad. These magazines will only fit a Beretta Nano pistol chambered in 9mm caliber. They will not fit a Smith & Wesson Shield, will not fit a Walther PPS, will not fit a Kel-Tec PF9, will not fit the 8 track tape player of a 1969 Pontiac Gran Prix. We’re offering these factory Beretta Nano 9mm magazines each	for only	$23.00.	 Not for sale to residents of New York City. Any magazine deliveries into New York City require written permission from the Police Commissioner, so we cannot ship magazines into New York City, per NYC Code 10-131.10.

With the introduction of The (M) Factor™, Springfield's reputation in ergonomics, intuitive operation, and handling is taken to a whole new level. Match Grade Select Fit Barrel and XD(M) Gear included. The ideal grip angle of the XD® has been carried over to the XD(M)®, but slightly modified contours in the grip will leave you wondering whether you're gripping the gun or it's gripping you. Deeper, longer, and more slide serrations equals a better more penetrating grasp. The ""all-terrain"" look of the new XD(M)® isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. The angle and depth of each contour in the grip has been calculated for maximized control vertically, horizontally and torsionally. The rugged Melonite® finish on the XD(M)® is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion-resistant, hard surface. The XD(M)® match-grade barrel takes precision manufacturing to a whole new level never available within the firearms industry. The new XD(M)® trigger has the shortest travel of any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow-up shots.

 I was suspicious about the two phone numbers, and then he gave me the usual B.S. story that panhandlers often give about his dad being in the hospital and he's selling it to pay his dad's hospital bills (major red flag) and on top of that he talked with very broken English, so I did a little research on those area codes and a lot of scams come from those area codes. The people calling are actually in places like India, Jamaica, Taiwan, Somalia, etc. but their calls are somehow routed through those area codes. First he said he was in California, but then he wanted me to send a money order to North Carolina. I didn't.
 So just a heads up to everyone, the same people who do telephone scams are now targeting Armslist users so be very cautious who you buy from, ask lots of questions, and use some common sense when dealing with people and your money."

He first claimed to be in California, but wanted me to send a money order to ""his family in North Carolina"" (I didn't) He then went on to give me the usual B.S. story panhandlers often use about his dad being in the hospital and he needed the money to pay his father's medical bills (red flag!) And he also used very Broken English. He used a Spanish name, I think these scammers have figured out that their English is broken so they pretend to be Mexican in hopes that that will explain away their broken English.
 Well, I did a little research on those area codes and a quick Google search said that said that a lot of scam calls AND TEXTS come from those area codes. Often the callers are actually in somewhere like Somalia, India, Taiwan, Jamaica, etc. but they somehow route their calls through US area codes. So these scammers aren't just calling random people anymore, they're also searching ads and targeting people who want to buy things. So just a heads up to everyone, be careful about who you do business with, ask lots of questions, and just use common sense when dealing with people and YOUR money!"

It is in very good condition with no rust or pitting in perfect mechanical operation, I took it out and shot it last month.  The only problem with it is that it was a California import so it is missing the bayonet lug (which is not necessary bad since it's the perfect candidate for a bulpup conversation!)  Also when it was purchased it was missing the gas tube latch, so I simply used an AK gas tube latch and a clamp.  This does not affect the function of the gun nor the safety of using it because of the design of the gas tube it is perfectly safe with this modification.  But it does look a bit off which is why the price is so low.  The importation of these is banned now so get yours before the dissappear into the mist!
