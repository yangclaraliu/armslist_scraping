I can sell the Leupold VAR X II 3x9x50 Scope with it for an additional $250. This is the higher end scope to better stand up to the recoil of the 7mm. The Winchester Model 70 is called the “Rifleman's Rifle"" by many because for more than 70 years, the bolt action rifle has been praised by law enforcement and the military for its precision, accuracy and performance. Front and Rear sight removed. Hardwood stock is very good, with no marks, or wear, or field abrasions! Blueing is about 95% and has an excellent bore. Very smooth action, overall a clean gun, chambered for the 7mmm mag.
The 7mm is recommended for Law Enforcement and military applications out to 1000+ meters. But keep in mind she kicks more than the .308, but is a nice compromise between the 308 and 300 Win Mag, because the 7mm shoots the lighter bullets at higher velocities, and there is a lot of power there.

The rifle is a 1993 model I bought new. This rifle is the Grade 1 version. The A bolt rifle was discontinued in 1996  I think the next generation was the T bolt (not 100% sure on this).

The stock is a high gloss finished Premium Black Walnut wood and is checkered. The grip cap is Rose wood as is the front fore-end tip. The butt plate is black plastic. The barrel and receiver are finished with a high luster blue. 

The receiver is grooved for scope mounts. The gun has a smooth, fast operating bolt action with a 60-degree bolt rotation and the signature Browning A-bolt knob. The gold-plated trigger is user adjustable and the trigger guard/bottom iron is made of aluminum. 

The barrel is free floating. The standard detachable box magazine holds 5 cartridges. A 15 round magazine was available as an accessory. It also comes with a nylon camo sling. I do have the owners manual with it. This is obviously a premium rifle. 

The Scope is a Bushnell Sportview 4 power, 32 mm adjustable objective wide angle lens. This scope is designed for a .22 rifle. The objective lens is adjustable for a parallax free range from 7.5 yards to 100 yards. Most high powered rifle scopes start at 50 yards to infinity. 

The scope lens are fully coated, anti glare, fog proof and water proof. The windage and elevation adjusters are audible and resettable. The scope mounting rings are up graded from the standard scope rings that normally come with a .22 scope. 

This rifle will gain in value as it has over the past 20 years. Look at it as an investment as well as a super nice squirrel gun. I'm asking $700.00. I will entertain  trade offers. Maybe another lesser .22 rifle and some cash to boot?"

Very custom AR15 Rifle. This gun has a rifle length gas system on an 18"" barrel with an adjustable gas block. I would guess the round count is under 1000. I have not really used this gun in about 2 years. I recently replaced the bolt  and carrier- not because it was warn, but because I needed a good bolt for another gun. So, this one now had a brand new bolt and carrier. The grip is a Hogue and the rear site a Magpul. The front is an illuminated fiber optic Truglo.  It has an adjustable Rock River Arms stock and the front grip is an extended carbon fiber tube. The upper and lows are DPMS, with the upper being a light weight flat side. This is a very soft shooting and accurate 6 pound rifle.

It is a 92 Eagle Talon Esi that has a rebuilt title by me since the motor that was in it was destroyed when i bought it but body was good. The motor slipped time so i replace it with the motor from my 91 eagle talon tsi that needed more body work and paint then it cost me to buy the 92 body. The body is an uncommon color and in good condition for its age with some fading on the roof, leather interior w/ a tear on the side of the driver seat, sun roof, and lots of spare hardware.
So it is a 92 esi body with the following
91 tsi 4g63t 6 bolt motor
91 tsi 5sp manual transmission FWD
91 tsi axles both driver and passanger side
91 tsi ecu
91 tsi radiator
91 tsi stock side mount intercooler
wire harness has been modified from a esi to a tsi harness
Evo 3 16g turbo
Braided stainless steel oil and cooland lines for turbo(stock return oil line)
ported 2g exhaust manifold
3"" ram air intake w/ a hacked air box
evo 8 fuel pump rewired
voodoo mbc
brass shifter bushings on transmission side
emissions delete
Glowshift boost gauge
Clevite 77 performance main and thrust bearing
new rod bearings
intake and throttle body gaskets have been resently replaced
Z racing rims that need refinishing/painting

It does have an oil leak from around the pan and near the turbo oil return line. Will need new tires since it sat for awhile with the previous owner(flat spots and cracks on the walls) and i didnt drive it enough to want to replace them. Has a high idle at start up then eventually goes down(boost leak somewhere). It needs an all around check and maintenance since i never got to all of it. Battery is newer but from it sitting will need to be charged/ jumped. best thing would be trailer it even though it could drive just since it hasnt been driven in a bit besides to move it.

With the swap and upgraded, i have just over $4000 in it and a ton of hours of labor but since it does need some TLC i am only wanting $2500 In trade out of it.  This is a project car.

Perfect for pocket carry as it easily fits in jeans pocket and weighs nothing.  But I want a little bigger pistol.  That is why I list a Glock 42 as something I will trade for.  Not really interested any other 380.

Must be 21 to buy.

Gun comes with 2 mags, one with pinky extension and one flush, and the canvas carry bag.  All stock and original."

Includes all factory paperwork Gun lock and box.

Mossberg based this on the Stoeger’s Double Defense design with their Thunder Ranch edition of the HS-12 over-under tactical shotgun. Mossberg decided to ditched the automatic safety that haunts most double barrel shotguns. Making the Mossberg Thunder Ranch HS-12 quick to the gun fight so that when you close the barrels the HS-12 is instantly ready to fire, without the need of engaging the safety button.

It’s got extractors, not ejectors, two barrel-mounted side rails for lights or lasers, a fiber-optic front sight and a Picatinny rail scope mount that also has a rear sight notch. Why double barrel tactical shotgun? Well its simple you can get a tactical shotgun without all the evil black features some states prohibit. No magazine capacity or pistol grip to worry about on this one. Best of all no pumping, just load and you go.

Included with the gun are 80 rounds of 12g Ammo:
50 rounds of Federal target Multi-purpose rounds
20 rounds of Federal Law Enforcement 00 buckshot
10 rounds of Hornady Critical Defense 00 buckshot

If ad is up, gun is still for sale!!  Sorry for the long winded details, but just trying to save you and I some time and hassle.

Please read entire ad, it will answer most of your questions ......if you have a gun or cash (only) to offer, please tell me info on it in initial email or text with what your offer is!!!!!!, I will respond to all resonable offers even if not interested........my contact info is at bottom of page which is better than FGT email.......thanx



Im asking $575  I prefer cash which will get the best deal!!  The only guns I'm interested in are below.



Must be able to meet with in 15-20 minutes of Clermont.  If you dont know where that is, please look it up before offering me anything.  With family health issues, its very hard for me to get to orlando and definitely no further.

Please Dont waste our time if you dont want to pay this or close. I dont need to sell it.

If trades they must be new or like new and fully functional, working perfectly........

I would consider a Gen 4 Glock in 9mm, 45 or 40 with nt sts OD, FDE or Blk.............only exception would be a G42 plus cash or if a Gen 3, OD or FDE

I would also consider a Sig P238 or possibly P938 but only even trade and they must be new or like new. 

I also would consider an AR .308/7.62 new from a dealer that is interested in moving a rifle for $100 over dealer cost and you can get G35 where you can make some off it too.  

If used, I prefer a brand that has transferable warranty like Spikes (7.62 or 5.56) or Core .308      Depending on gun and extras,  I can add cash or possibly another gun or both. ............will consider a DPMS Recon (under $1100 if new), Recon Gen 2, SASS or REPR, (SIG 716 (max $1550)) and obviously higher end Ar's too but I probably cant do more than $2000 in trades and cash unless its got extras that are really worth it for me.

If your gun is fired, especially sigs, its used, so dont try to tell me its worth MSRP......If your a private seller like myself and your looking to make money off this deal, this is not the gun for you.  

I can be fair and reasonable and would appreciate the same.  If you paid full price for your gun at BPS or some high priced place, I can only give you Slickguns or maybe gunbroker best price values toward yours and would do similar on mine.



If its other than above and Kimber, Sig 226, Colt, Smith, bigger named 1911, Governor, new AK or nicer gun, you can try me if its just a great deal for me and not too exotic that I couldn't sell it later if need too, but it has to be even trade, I cant add cash or other guns for these, possibly some ammo, but I'm guessing that will be few and far between.

Im not interested in war relics, collectibles, junkers, hi points, keltecs, shotguns or hunting rifles.

Thanks for looking and I appreciate your reading all this info, just trying to eliminate those that want to talk or trades for goats, speakers, junk or similar.

Now for a little history; the 94 Flat Band Carbines were produced for a portion of 1946, all of 1947 and a portion of 1948. The barrel band was flat instead of usual rounded and polished as a way for Winchester to make a part that didn't require extra machining and work to produce during WWII, when the factories were cranking out military arms.

Smith and Wesson Model 28-2 Highway Patrolman (circa 1963-64), chambered in 357 Magnum. Has been refinished to a polished blue, looks wonderful. Some holster wear at muzzle and barrel lug, drag ring on cylinder. But who cares? The trigger on this gun is wonderful. Double action is smooth, no stacking. Single action breaks cleanly at 4.5 lbs on my scale. When you dry fire it you will buy it...I did. Hogue Monogrip currently fitted.

Included is 62 rounds of Speer Gold Dot 357 Magnum, fresh production. Two HKS Loaders and a nylon HKS belt pouch. Also included is a DeSantis Leather holster, RH. 

All laws WILL be complied with, buyer pays transfer fee. With that in mind the $50 worth of ammo is free with the purchase of the gun, I have reflected that in my pricing. Will travel to meet at your FFL within reason, I am located in the South Metro area.

United States Executive Order 
Of July 16, 2014

The importation of new Izmash-produced firearms is now banned indefinitely in the United States. But that executive order definitely raises some questions for those currently in possession of a firearm manufactured by the now-sanctioned firearms companies. For example, can a gun dealer sell their existing stock? From the FAQ regarding the legality of items already in the United States:

    374. If I own a Kalashnikov product, is that product blocked by sanctions? Am I able to resell a Kalashnikov product at a gun show or other secondary market?

    If a U.S. person is in possession of a Kalashnikov Concern product that was bought and fully paid for prior to the date of designation (i.e., no payment remains due to Kalashnikov Concern), then that product is not blocked and OFAC sanctions would not prohibit the U.S. person from keeping or selling the product in the secondary market, so long as Kalashnikov Concern has no interest in the transaction. New transactions by U.S. persons with Kalashnikov Concern are prohibited, however, and any property in which Kalashnikov Concern has an interest is blocked pursuant to OFAC’s designation of Kalashnikov Concern on July 16, 2014. If a U.S. person has an inventory of Kalashnikov Concern products in which Kalashnikov Concern has an interest (for example, the products are not fully paid for or are being sold on consignment), we advise that U.S. person to contact OFAC for further guidance on handling of the inventory. [7-16-2014]

    375. If I have Kalashnikov products in my inventory, can I sell them?

    If a U.S. person has an inventory of Kalashnikov Concern products in which Kalashnikov Concern has an interest (for example, the products are not fully paid for or are being sold on consignment), we advise that U.S. person to contact OFAC for further guidance on handling of the inventory.

The only marks on it are from being taken in and out of the sheath, which is stated as being normal due to the tightness of the the sheath in the instructions included with the knife.  The Buck 184 ""Buckmaster"" is a large Bowie-bladed survival knife, allegedly developed at the request of the US Navy SEALs. The knife has a blade that is approximately 7.5"" (19cm) long, and is of the classic Bowie shape. The hollow-ground main edge is about 6.5"" (16.5cm) long. The false edge is serrated on one side. The back of the blade features a very aggressive 3"" (7.5cm) long sawback. Maximum blade width is about 1.5"" (3.7cm), and the blade is .288 - .290-inch thick. The blade is forged 425mod steel. The handguard is about 6mm thick, with both ends curving slightly towards the blade. Each end is drilled and tapped for a 2"" (51mm) long, 10mm diameter ""point"" which is designed to allow the knife to be used as an anchor when a line is attached to the lanyard ring at the pommel. The grip is 4"" (102mm) long and 1.25"" (2.8cm) in diameter, knurled and grooved for a sure grip. The grip is hollow, with a usable internal opening secured by the threaded pommel, which in turn is knurled, slightly larger in diameter than the grip, and sealed with a black rubber O-ring. The threaded pommel also secured a 4.5mm thick steel stamping which is pierced to provide a lanyard/rope hole.
The sheath is of black rigid fiberglass-reinforced plastic. Attached to the front of the sheath is one removable black nylon pouch; it contains a full-size Silva Type 12 compass with a red cord lanyard. The back of the sheath has an inlaid sharpening stone. Heavy black nylon webbing is used to cover the stone, secure the two pouches to the sheath, secure the knife in its sheath, and provide a loop for a leg tie. An additional loop of black nylon webbing, with a Fastex-type closure, provides a quick-release belt loop.

Also included are a RAT Worx Picatinny rail and cocking piece (supposed to help smooth cocking - never installed). Aside from some abrasion on the charging handle and some wear where a hot casing lodged itself, this is in excellent working condition. There is some wear on the rail from cosine indicator (not included) mounting, as displayed. Four magazines and ammunition are included with this rifle as well.

$280 firm in cash for just the shotgun or $420 firm with scope or higher in trade value.  I have other items listed, in case someone has something of higher value they want to offer. 

I prefer cash as I do not need anything in trades, but will consider trading as long as the value is there, otherwise, I'll pass on trades and wait for cash.  

If wanting to do some type of trade, let me know if offer is for shotgun and scope or just shotgun, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.

It was carried much more than shot so it does have holster wear, I intentionally took pictures of the most worn spots so you can see even they aren't that bad. It has the Para-ramp which has handled every type of round I've put through it flawlessly.
It has a fully adjustable rear sight and is very accurate. I've owned the handgun for many years now and shoot maybe 1-3 hundred rounds through it a year. The handgun is rated for thousands of rounds of +p and I've only shot standard, so it has a very long life of shooting left in it. 
It comes with two (2) 14 round magazines and two (2) 10 round magazines.

It is in
excellent condition and has a fresh cleaning. If you like the Euro-style handguns
(decocker with exposed hammer) that can tolerate any ammo, this is for you.

Included is the original box, manual, and two 17-round MEC-GAR magazines. This gun was new as of July 1996. I just had Raven Head Arms in Bellevue give this gun a trigger job last month.
You'll be hard-pressed to find a smoother operating semi-auto handgun in your lifetime.

It's never jammed no matter what i've used: Federal, Wolf, WPA, Magtech, CCI
Blazer Brass, Fiocchi, PPU, Herter's black box (Czech), Herter's beige box
(Russian - Tula), Herter's gray box (CCI aluminum), and Brown Bear. Accuracy is cheap with this, as it loves the Russian steel case ammo. For the record, the rebranded CCI aluminum TNJ (total nylon jacket) ammo sold at Cabela's under the Herter's name is freakishly accurate in this gun.

Note: The spare magazine is a .40 cal model, but the .40 cal magazines are
interchangeable with the standard 9mm mags for the A100. The only difference
between them is that the ammo count holes are different and it only counts up to
13, but it holds 17 rounds of 9mm. Operationally speaking, they are the same.

$425. Why am I selling it? Too many calibers = bloated ammo expenses, so I'm
stepping away from 9mm.

Nebraska purchase permit and driver's license required (so i can match your name
to the permit), and you have to sign and date two sales agreements with both our
names and purchase permit numbers on them. Mine for yours, so both our butts are 
covered. No exceptions.

Test envelope date of 8Apr13. I acquired it unfired and have since put 100 DoubleTap 10mm full power rounds and 40 Hornady 40S&W Critical Defense rounds through it with zero malfunctions. The 10mm full power loads are loud and fun, similar to a 357 snubbie and drawing a lot of attention in an indoor range. The Lone Wolf stainless 40 barrel drops in and uses the 10mm mags. I can install the extended slide release & slide lock in five minutes if desired. They came with it and work fine but I prefer a 100% stock gun. Trijicon HD night sights are expensive but my favorites, though the stock white-outline sights come with it. The first photo is obviously stock. The second and third are my pistol.

2) 40 S&W, 10-round magazine with flashlight adapter on base, fits all Glock 40 caliber models.

I purchased the 10-round mag directly from Glock several years ago.  Before the generation 3 models were developed with accessory rails on frame, Glock made these in order to employ a flashlight in combat situations while keeping both hands on the firearm.  The only drawback was the magazine was developed in the Clinton Crime Bill days where magazine capacity was limited to 10 rounds.
