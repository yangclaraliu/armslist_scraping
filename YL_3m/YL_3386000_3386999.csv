I really like this gun. It's a great shooter and VERY accurate. I'd love to keep it but the trigger guard geometry doesn't agree with me and gives me a blister when I shoot it. It has about 200 rounds through it with no issues. Comes with box, 2 15 round mags and all papers.


I'm looking to trade for other 9mm pistols with preference going to GEN 3 Glock 17's and 34's + cash, of course. I'm open to other things as well but I'm going to be picky and if you offer me an XD or a Judge I'm not going to respond. No .40's or .45's. 

For the right trade or additional cash I have a third 15 round magazine and a righthand Garret Industries Holsters Silent Thunder STX 2.0. 

 $650 with 2 mags.   $775 with 3 mags and holster.  $700 with no holster."

I used a quick Google search to fix the problem but that did not help me.

I then decided to get professional help to solve my problem. After having received many quotations from various companies, I decided to go ahead with Online Tech Repair (www.onlinetechrepairs.com). 

Reasons I chose them over the others:

1) They were extremely friendly and patient with me during my initial discussions and responded promptly to my request.

2) Their prices were extremely reasonable.

3) They were ready and willing to walk me through the entire process step by step and were on call with me till i got it fixed.

How did they do it?

1) They first asked me to state my problem clearly and asked me a few questions. This was done to detect any physical connectivity issues with the printer.

2) After having answered this, they confirmed that the printer and the laptop were functioning correctly.

3) They then, asked me if they could access my laptop remotely to troubleshoot the problem and fix it. I agreed.

4) One of the tech support executives accessed my laptop and started troubleshooting.

5) I sat back and watched as the tech support executive was navigating my laptop to spot the issue. The issue was fixed.

6) I was told that it was due to an older version of the driver that had been installed.

My Experience

I loved the entire friendly conversation that took place with them. They understood my needs clearly and acted upon the solution immediately. Being a technical noob, I sometimes find it difficult to communicate with tech support teams. It was a very different experience with the guys at Online Tech Repairs. You can check out their website www.onlinetechrepairs.com or call them on 1-914-613-3786. 

I would definitely recommend this service to anyone who needs help fixing their computers.

Thanks a ton guys. Great Job....!!

I used a quick Google search to fix the problem but that did not help me.

I then decided to get professional help to solve my problem. After having received many quotations from various companies, I decided to go ahead with Online Tech Repair (www.onlinetechrepairs.com). 

Reasons I chose them over the others:

1) They were extremely friendly and patient with me during my initial discussions and responded promptly to my request.

2) Their prices were extremely reasonable.

3) They were ready and willing to walk me through the entire process step by step and were on call with me till I got it fixed.

How did they do it?

1) They first asked me to state my problem clearly and asked me a few questions. This was done to detect any physical connectivity issues with the printer.

2) After having answered this, they confirmed that the printer and the laptop were functioning correctly.

3) They then, asked me if they could access my laptop remotely to troubleshoot the problem and fix it. I agreed.

4) One of the tech support executives accessed my laptop and started troubleshooting.

5) I sat back and watched as the tech support executive was navigating my laptop to spot the issue. The issue was fixed.

6) I was told that it was due to an older version of the driver that had been installed.

My Experience

I loved the entire friendly conversation that took place with them. They understood my needs clearly and acted upon the solution immediately. Being a technical noob, I sometimes find it difficult to communicate with tech support teams. It was a very different experience with the guys at Online Tech Repairs. You can check out their website www.onlinetechrepairs.com or call them on 1-914-613-3786. 

I would definitely recommend this service to anyone who needs help fixing their computers.

Thanks a ton guys. Great Job....!!

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

The 1911-22 is built to the same dimensions as the full-sized 1911 pistol. It features a lightweight metal frame and slide, low-profile three-dot sights, working grip safety and ambidextrous thumb safety, making the 1911-22 a perfect training tool for 1911 fans as well as a fun plinking pistol for all ages."

Commercial ammo available. Shoots very nice, especially with handloads. The bluing on receiver and barrel is in very good condition with no rust anywhere. Rear sight has ""patina"" so it looks gray.
The Krag-Jorgensen rifle was adopted by the U.S. military in 1892 and was produced by the Springfield Armory up until 1904.  It went through various minor modifications during production.  It had a 32"" barrel and was chambered for the .30-40 cartridge which is roughly as powerful as the 303 British or .308 Win.  The magazine holds 5 rounds and is loaded from the side by opening the hinged door.  The Krag has a reputation for having the smoothest operating action of any bolt action rifle.
In the 1930s, surplus Krags were turned into sporting rifles by amateurs and gunsmiths.  They were converted by shortening the barrels and cutting back the wood stock.  A new front sight was added and sometimes new rear sights also.
The rifle I'm selling was sporterized, professionally it seems, by having its barrel cut back to 26"" and a band-type front sight installed.  It has an original model 1902 military rear sight which is adjustable for windage and elevation.  The stock on my rifle is a cut down military rifle stock with the military sling swivels.  The original cartouche is still faintly visible.  The bore and grooves measure .300 and .312 which means it shoots jacketed bullets just fine but if you handload cast bullets you'd need to use bullets at least .312 diameter for good accuracy.
Just as an aside, if I were to sell this rifle a piece at a time, on Ebay I could get over $100 for the stock, $50 for the bolt assembly, $50 for the buttplate and swivels, $100 for the barrel and receiver, and probably $100 for the rear sight.  But I'd rather sell it to someone who will appreciate it in one piece.
By the way, I'm selling it because I have another one that has a peep sight installed.  I'm old enough that I need a peep sight to shoot well."

-= A2 Grip & Carbine-Length Handguards with Weaver Aluminum Rail Kit =-
Standard plastic A2 grip, Colt M4 take-off. Colt dual-heatshield, 7-hole, 11-rib, tapered, 6.25"" carbine-length M4 handguards. They have some areas where the coating on the heatshield was scraped during installation of rail kit, but otherwise pristine. Colt part # SP64673
Weaver 12-slot 2 pc. Picatinny Rail Kit. Two 12-slot aluminum rails for mounting to your standard handguard or most modular rail systems. They're 4.875"" long and are 100% M1913 Picatinny-spec, NOT the smaller Weaver-type. They're tapered so any accessories you mount will remain parallel to the bore axis. Very sturdy, like new except slight rings in the mounting slots from screw heads and scraped areas of finish on the nuts. Weaver part # 48327
Price for A2 Grip, Carbine HGs, and Rail Kit - $35

-= Complete Custom-Polished Colt FCG =-
Fire Control Group including Hammer, Trigger, Disconnector, both pins (.154"" reg pins), and all three springs. Had these parts professionally polished at a machine shop to a 4 micron surface finish. No change to geometry, polishing of engagement faces only. Much smoother than out-of-box pull, but I decided to go a different route. I'll guarantee their perfect function in any mil-spec unit. You can bring your rifle to my range to test these components in your rifle before purchase. - $65

These are all genuine Colt parts, I'm happy to send more pictures and details of forge marks, etc. upon request. They were on the rifle for about the first 150 rounds. Take a look at Brownell's prices for these parts, one of the few places you can get genuine Colt parts (if they're in stock) and my prices are less than 50% of theirs.
Carbine Length HG - $90, part #160-300-001WB
A2 Grip - $16, part #160-308-150WB
Hammer - $60, part #160-305-100WB
Hammer Spring - $4.50, part #160-305-103WB
Trigger - $33.50, part #160-305-105WB
Trigger Spring - $4, part #160-305-107WB
Pins - $12, part #160-000-349WB
Disconnector - $15, part #160-305-104WB
Disconnector Spring - $4.00, part #160-305-106WB
That's $133 plus shipping for the FCG, not counting the $40 polishing job.

EXCELLENT condition Century Sporter AK 74 in 5.45x39.  Gun looks and feels good.  Got on trade and haven't fired it as I have a Waffen that I've been using.  Great round and still available.  Commercial ammo is non-corrosive and the same price or still cheaper (depending on where you get it) than similar 223.  Have owned numerous Century guns and never had an issue with any of them (guess I've been lucky if you read the reviews on the net).  Of course happy owners aren't nearly as likely to speak out and unhappy owners.  

Potential purchaser is welcome to shoot a mag at their expense at a rifle friendly range near me.  I live in Huntersville and work in Shelby.  Will meet in/near Shelby between 8 and 5 Mon-Fr as my schedule allowsi.  

Price is as pictured is $850 (excluding the MVG).

I'll return it to stock configuration for $525.  Comes with one polymer magazine.  I have other mags and plenty of ammo (mostly 7n6) available for purchase as well if you want/need it.  Last picture is the rifle in stock confirguration ($525 price).  Steel mag is extra.

All accessories pictured are US made (UTG Pro, made in USA, Magpul and Hogue) with the exception of the rail covers.  Those are cheap chinese but work.

The trigger guard is also inlaid with silver vines. The highly figured stock displays lots of flame grain with just a few minor handling marks. It has a rosewood grip cap with inlaid bear head outline and a rosewood forearm cap. The gun is scoped with the period correct Redfield 4X12 (Made in the USA) using original Sako mounts and rings. Also included, but not pictured, is the original Sako rear adjustable peep sight. This is truly an outstanding low serial numbered gun from the Pre-Garcia era.

The LaRue POD (Prone Optimization Device) places a 1.75"" section of MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail on the bottom of a Magpul MOE or CTR buttstock. This section of rail is the perfect platform for a monopod or vertical grip, raising the stock up to level the rifle when shooting in the prone. The user can pull the vertical grip into the shoulder for optimum control in stock-seating and can even fine-tune sight picture, by squeezing the grip with the heel of the hand resting on the ground's surface. The section of rail to the bottom also gives additional traction into bench rest bags.

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine."

Purchased new with a test fire date of 11/15/2013.  Comes with the Ruger hard case, all documentation, spent shell casing, lock, speedloader, 10 and 17 round magazines, and pinky extension base plate (not currently installed).  I’ve put probably 200 rounds through this pistol.  It’s very accurate, insanely fun to shoot, and not a SINGLE hiccup with it... just an amazing amount of gun for the $$, and has one of the nicest triggers I’ve ever squeezed on a striker-fired gun.

No trades, I’m selling this to fund another purchase.  You need to have a LTCH and/or a valid Indiana DL so I can make sure you’re not a bad guy.  Must meet FTF, and with my schedule as of late, I will not travel outside the Carmel/Noblesville/Fishers area.

**Sold Pending Funds** Priced to sell at $375.00.

It came mounted on the rifle, I took it off when I unboxed it and mounted a red dot without ever even sighting it in - so it's NIB minus the box. You can see in the pictures it still has some cosmoline on the apertures and elevation turret. Has the square forge marking, dual 0-2 marked large and unmarked small 300+ yard apertures, is 6/3 marked, and has the 'Z' marking so it can be zeroed on a 25yd range for a 300yd battle zero. Each click is .65 MOA with a Carbine-length sight radius and .5 MOA with rifle length. This is the genuine M4 DCH, made of steel - not the aluminum .22LR model. It's late production from last year, so it's one of the very last Colt produced.

Standard FMJs here, but muzzle velocity is higher than average for reasons the manufacturer won’t comment on. It’s about as accurate as you’ll get with milspec if you’re using a long barrel and a slow twist rate, but for a lighter grain bullet this is a beast if you’re using a short barrel with a 1-in-9 or a 1-in-10. Great for carbines and SBRs.

Green Bullet, Lead Free Solid Copper Bullet
Upgrade your ballistics to solid copper ballistics. 

Solid copper match-grade target/hunting/tactical bullets delivers superb accuracy, devastating power, and deep penetration.

Solid Copper bullets enable higher ballistic coefficient than typical copper jacketed bullets and deliver excellent results for 400-1,200 yard shooting, and beyond.  

Solid copper bullets do not expand under extreme pressure like lead. This new projectile provides loaders to load “hotter” rounds that will shoot flatter and more accurately than possible with lead projectiles. 

Each bullet is manufactured to ensure a precise centerline alignment that delivers gyroscopic stability for a flat trajectory. The perfectly round flat tip maintains consistent overall cartridge length. 

Because no lead is used, hunters appreciate the fact that these environmentally friendly copper bullets won’t contaminate any meat they put on the table."

Upgrade your ballistics to solid copper ballistics. 

Solid copper match-grade target/hunting/tactical bullets delivers superb accuracy, devastating power, and deep penetration.

Solid Copper bullets enable higher ballistic coefficient than typical copper jacketed bullets and deliver excellent results for 400-1,200 yard shooting, and beyond.  

Solid copper bullets do not expand under extreme pressure like lead. This new projectile provides loaders to load “hotter” rounds that will shoot flatter and more accurately than possible with lead projectiles. 

Each bullet is manufactured to ensure a precise centerline alignment that delivers gyroscopic stability for a flat trajectory. The perfectly round flat tip maintains consistent overall cartridge length. 

Because no lead is used, hunters appreciate the fact that these environmentally friendly copper bullets won’t contaminate any meat they put on the table."
