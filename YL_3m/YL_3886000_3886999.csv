Thanks for taking the time to view my post. I am looking to sell my Mosin Nagant that I bought 3 years ago while stationed in Oklahoma. I fired 10 rounds through it and then cleaned it up and its been in the closet since. I have no need for this rifle to be honest. It definitely wins the cool and reliable factors but not the practical factors. I am located in Westerville area. I am pretty firm on the price based on what I paid and the research I have done it is very fair. I am looking for a Face to Face meeting in the central Ohio area.

Browning BAR ShortTrac in .243 win. I bought this rifle new in 2010 and have put less than 2 boxes of shells through it.  I bought it for the GF but she quit hunting that year and I don't need it. It has a Burris Timberline 3-9x BDC scope mounted on weaver bases. accurate and shoots great. 
I know what it is worth, so the price is pretty firm. I'm willing to take off the scope and  sell the rifle only with the mounts only for $750. I am open to all fair and partial trades, however I'm mostly interested in military style semi autos or a semi auto pistols. Particularly looking for a hunting pistol (which can be a revolver).

It still has the stickers on it, the original box and all the documentation/manuals.  This is not the standard Axis model, but it's the new Axis II with the adjustable AccuTrigger and Weaver Kaspa 3-9x40 scope.  Included in the price is 26 rounds of premium Federal Fusion 140 grain ammo (I bought 2 boxes when I purchased it minus the 14 rounds fired).

I am selling it only to get the same rifle but chambered in a different cartridge.  I would be glad to answer any questions you may have about it.

I am a private party and not a dealer, so to avoid any risk on either end, this sale is to be conducted in person and with cash only.  I will provide a bill of sale for both parties and require a copy of the purchaser's driver's license.

Fires 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells and has the beaded 18.5in cylinder barrel. Comes fitted with an ATI Talon 6-position adjustable stock with pistol grip and the matching composite forend with a removable 2'' rail on each side for mounting a light/laser if you so choose. All markings/engravings have been recolored in pearl white for high visibility. Also included will be a 12 gauge bore snake, two point sling capable of storing 15 additional shells, 50-75 Winchester target loads and 8-10 Winchester PDX-1 12 gauge segmented rifled slugs. With the scorpion recoil management system incorporated into the stock I, even being of a small stature, can comfortably run 2 3/4'' slugs all day and not have a sore shoulder whatsoever. It's quite a nice setup for the money put into the firearm. Honestly if one were to further upgrade this weapon the only thing I would personally recommend is having the breach and bolt polished for glass smooth operation. Shotgun was purchased brand new in box about 3 months ago for 429.99, stock and forend were ordered for 119.99 plus shipping. Since purchase there have been about 130-150 target loads and 15-20 slugs fired through this weapon, inspect it yourself, you wont find an ounce of dirt/debris. It, as with all my weapons, has been METICULOUSLY maintained to the highest degree. A dirty weapon is a weapon that gets you killed. Trade and cash value are placed at $500 even. Price is flexible as I'm purely posting to see what may interest me. Can add cash for the right trade but selling outright would be nice. Shoot me offers and I'll respond courteously and fairly, all I ask in return is that you don't insult me by offering me well below what a fair market value would be. Thanks for looking. Located in Henry County, willing to travel if the deal is fair."

Smith & Wesson's Extra Large Frame (X) revolvers are the most powerful production and Performance Center revolvers ever built. The Model 460XVR™ was released in 2005 and sports the highest muzzle velocity of any production revolver on the planet. This handgun launches 200-grain, .460 S&W Magnum bullets at approximately 2,300 feet per second. The X-Frames come equipped with compensators to reduce felt recoil.

 -	The Highest Velocity Revolver in the World - 2330 FPS/200 Grain!
 -	The Most Powerful .45 Caliber Revolver In the World - 2400 lbs/ft!
 -	If You Zero its Sights at 200 Yards You Will Bag Your Buck with a Center Hold 0-250 Yards with No Hold Over! Just Center It and Fire. The 460XVR Will Do The Rest

 -	Lighter Loads That The 460 Will Also Fire Include .45 Colt and .454 Casull

The highest velocity production revolver available, the 460XVR is capable of launching a 200-grain bullet at 2,300+ fps, while delivering over 2,400 ft/lbs of muzzle energy. The revolver and the entire 460XVR series offer shooters multi-caliber capabilities, accepting .460 S&W, .454 Casull and .45 Colt. The .460 S&W Magnum revolver features Sorbathane recoil-reducing grips and an interchangeable muzzle compensator that dramatically reduces felt recoil. The 460XVR retains original X-Frame features including a crisp single-action and smooth double-action trigger, 5-round capacity cylinder and a durable stainless steel frame with a satin finish. The commemorative revolver is standard with an 8-3/8” barrel and features an adjustable rear sight with a HI-VIZ light-gathering 
green dot front sight.

Its flat shooting trajectory and outstanding accuracy has helped the 460XVR become the premier long-range revolver in the industry.  With over twice the energy of a .44 Rem Mag and flat trajectory, a 25 yard Zero will still be a Center Hold out to 150 yards.

About the gun:

Smith & Wesson’s new M&P SHIELD™ is a slim, concealable, lightweight, striker-fired polymer pistol. Available in 9mm and .40 S&W, the new M&P SHIELD features a slim design combined with the proven and trusted features found in the M&P Pistol Series. From the pistol’s easily concealed one-inch profile to its optimized 18-degree grip angle, the M&P SHIELD offers professional-grade features that provide consumers with simple operation and reliable performance.

Chambered in 9mm and .40 S&W for proven stopping power, the M&P SHIELD features a high-strength polymer frame with a black, durable, corrosion resistant finish, coated stainless steel slide and barrel. Both models are standard with a 3.1-inch barrel, which contributes to an overall length of 6.1 inches and an unloaded weight of 19 ounces. For fast tracking and smooth target acquisition, the M&P SHIELD is standard with a 5.3-inch sight radius and has been enhanced with a short, consistent trigger pull measuring 6.5 pounds. Featuring a quick and audible reset made possible by the striker-fired action, the M&P SHIELD allows multiple rounds to be placed on target both consistently and accurately.

The Mossberg® Maverick® 88 20 Gauge All-Purpose Pump-Action Shotgun features dual extractors, twin action bars, positive steel-to-steel lockup and an antijam elevator for smooth, reliable performance that won't let you down. The shotgun features a black synthetic stock and forearm for durability and a 6-round magazine capacity with 2-3/4"" shells and a 5-round capacity with 3"" shells. Bead sights help promote accurate aiming, and only 1 pin needs to be removed to field strip for easy maintenance.



The Talon Mossberg shotgun stock from Advanced Technology improves shooter comfort by absorbing a dramatic amount of recoil energy. Everything from a 3.5” magnum turkey load to a door breaching load can now be fired with no pain being transferred to the shooter. The Talon tactical stock also reduces the challenge of reacquiring the target by minimizing the muzzle lift. Constructed from a proprietary DuPont glass reinforced nylon, the stock is not affected by chemicals, load size or extreme temperatures. The solid state system removes limitations from spring and piston type recoil suppression

3M Industrial grade self adhesive soft touch cheekrest pad

More from another review:

The Heckler and Koch 416 Pistol is a handgun version of the H&K 416, chambered in .22LR. This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the 416 .22 rifle. The 416 is a dedicated .22. The barrel measures 9 inches in length and its rails are machined. The 416’s pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic.

Thanks for looking."

Sale location: Gresham, OR
Payments VIA paypal (gifted or add 4%, I can give you more vouches than you have bones if you're nervous) or cash for FTF deals.
Shipping: Not included in prices. I ship USPS to keep costs down as much as I can. I can ship Fedex on your request. UPS can eat a barrel of 1000 dicks, so I don't use them.
Trades: Not looking for trades. But if you happen to have a Surefire MP5 lighted handguard, I'm interested in that.
Other sale notes: I'm perfectly happening hold onto this stuff if I don't get the price I'm looking for. While I don't use this stuff much anymore, I also don't want to take a hit selling it. So if you're looking to lowball, or play the waiting game for months to see if I drop the price, look elsewhere.
All items sold as is, and first come, first served. Holds only done with a 10% nonrefundable deposit, and then items will only be held for a week unless other arrangements are made.

WE G39C (G36c really). Used but still in very good condition. The charging handle flappy bit broke(new ones are 6$ on evike), but charging it is still very easy. Shoots amazingly flat with .28s. Comes with 4 non leaky mags, one mag that needs a new base part (the threads are toast so you need to replace that part and the nozzle and it'll be fine), CA zoom carry handle and 3 Safariland mag holders made for the G36 (all work great, but need a mount. You can easily mount them to a 6004 platform, belt mount system or the MLS). Also comes with the side rails, I just removed them. 260$ for the package. No splitting

Has an ambi mag catch and rear sling plate. Comes with a G&G hicap. Lacks a dummy gas tube which will stop the RIS from moving, and the screw that holds on the back of the buffer tube (just the cover bit) has since been lost to field goblins that eat random bits that fall off guns at games.

G-Code LH Glock 19 holster, CB. Nearly new, but I removed the rivet since it was too tight for KSC/KWA Glocks. There are wear marks from test fitting, but it's never left the house. 15$

Pay attention and prevent a knock on your door.  

Also to the young man TRYING to sound intelligent, but didn't succeed, this is a United States Code pertaining to firearms that has been on the books for years.  So you wanted to know wo to sue?  Sue the U.S. government.

I don't agree with this, but I also don't want to see anyone get in trouble.  

If you are buying and selling a lot of guns, you could open youself up to charges of dealing guns without a license.

The US Code says:
(11) The term “dealer” means 

(A) any person engaged in the business of selling firearms at wholesale or retail, 
(B) any person engaged in the business of repairing firearms or of making or fitting special barrels, stocks, or trigger mechanisms to firearms, or 
(C) any person who is a pawnbroker. The term “licensed dealer” means any dealer who is licensed under the provisions of this chapter. 

Some further definitions:
(21) The term “engaged in the business” means— 

(A) as applied to a manufacturer of firearms, a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to manufacturing firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the sale or distribution of the firearms manufactured; 
(B) as applied to a manufacturer of ammunition, a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to manufacturing ammunition as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the sale or distribution of the ammunition manufactured; 
(C) as applied to a dealer in firearms, as defined in section 921 (a)(11)(A), a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms, but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms; 
(D) as applied to a dealer in firearms, as defined in section 921 (a)(11)(B), a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to engaging in such activity as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit, but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional repairs of firearms, or who occasionally fits special barrels, stocks, or trigger mechanisms to firearms; 
(E) as applied to an importer of firearms, a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to importing firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the sale or distribution of the firearms imported; and 
(F) as applied to an importer of ammunition, a person who devotes time, attention, and labor to importing ammunition as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the sale or distribution of the ammunition imported. 

(22) The term “with the principal objective of livelihood and profit” means that the intent underlying the sale or disposition of firearms is predominantly one of obtaining livelihood and pecuniary gain, as opposed to other intents, such as improving or liquidating a personal firearms collection: Provided, That proof of profit shall not be required as to a person who engages in the regular and repetitive purchase and disposition of firearms for criminal purposes or terrorism. For purposes of this paragraph, the term “terrorism” means activity, directed against United States persons, which— 
(A) is committed by an individual who is not a national or permanent resident alien of the United States; 
(B) involves violent acts or acts dangerous to human life which would be a criminal violation if committed within the jurisdiction of the United States; and 
(C) is intended— 
(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; 
(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or 
(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by assassination or kidnapping.

Although the pistol was bought new here in Oklahoma, he lived in Southern California where he had to drive several hours to find a place to shoot. Consequently, I don’t know that he ever used it. When he passed, it came to us. We have put about one box of shells through it and I can tell you it is a sweet pistol. However, we don’t need another .22. My son and I are more into traditional black powder anyway. I would guess that this has had less than 200 rounds through it. As you can see in the pictures, it has the original box, papers, cleaning kit and serial number matching smaller grips. The larger grips were added by my father. This one has a 6 inch barrel.
I know these sell pretty high and are not that easy to find especially in this condition. I see them on the online auctions for between $1100 and $600. We are asking a firm $700 cash. We would consider a partial trade for some traditional (not modern in-line) black powder rifle especially a CVA Mountain Rifle or Lyman Great Plains. Don’t need another CVA or Traditions Hawken. I will not ship this anywhere. Email is the preferred contact but text is ok also but sometimes it takes a while for me to get it. REDACTED."
