ULCANS is a multispectral, lightweight and easy-to-handle camouflage screen that presents a revolution in concealing military objects – to achieve perfect protection while in static position. The product is available in both woodland and desert versions.

COVERS ALL KNOWN SENSOR THREATS

ULCANS represents the most advanced camouflage technology available on the market today. It has multispectral capabilities throughout its service life, enhancing force survivability by providing protection against visual, as well as near-infrared, thermal infrared and broad-band radar threats.

ULTRA LIGHTWEIGHT NON-SNAGGING CONSTRUCTION

ULCANS is the state-of-the-art in screen camouflage. It is non-snagging, quickly deployed, and withstands the rigors of field duty.

SAVE MONEY

Being multispectral, the screen makes multiple or single layers of conventional camouflage products for different requirements virtually redundant. Due to its non-snagging properties, its service life is increased substantially in comparison with conventional nets.

FLEXIBILITY

The ULCANS system used by the U.S. Army consists of one hexagonal and one rhomboidal screen, available in both woodland and desert versions. It features a simplified interconnect system and effective shape disrupters.

This one is slightly used but still in great shape. Brand new this system is more than twice this price."

Prefer pistols but will consider most anything. Not as interested in shotguns but won't rule them out. I would prefer trading on a Sig P220, P226, P227, P229, P938, or maybe others. Not interested in P250s. I also like stainless Smith & a Wesson wheel guns.

Have Leupold scope base, rings, ammo, and lots of brass I can add for the right trade.

Target Crown

The muzzle of the barrel is specially machined to protect the rifling, therefore preserving and protecting accuracy. This is a critical feature on any barrel. If riflings are damaged in any way, especially at the muzzle, accuracy suffers and it is often difficult to determine the cause.

60° Bolt

Browning X-Bolt and A-Bolt rifles have a short 60° bolt lift. Many competitors' rifles incorporate a 90° bolt lift that is not only slower and cumbersome but places the bolt near or on the rifle's scope, making the bolt more difficult to operate."

I have had this 25-06 for a few years now and absolutely love the gun. It shoots great but I would like to buy another lightweight stainless carry rifle. This is the ONLY reason for the sale. I have hunted with it a little so it does have a few normal marks but it is a very nice rifle otherwise. The stock is bedded and the lop is 13"". It has a 26"" Medium contour target grade/crown barrel, NOT the bull barrel. This thing really shoots with virtually no recoil.

The trades I would consider would be:
257 Roberts
257 Weatherby with ammo and reloading dies
260
280
6.5x55
6.5 Creedmoor 
35 Whelen
357 Mag compact (DAO)
Walther PPS
HK VP9
Glock 10mm SF with extras
Sig in 357 with E2 grips
Steyr handguns or rifles
Sako, CZ and Tikka
Would also consider NICE optics

I'm open to most with the exception of Remington.  I would also prefer to have ammo/brass/dies with most of the odd ball calibers for obvious reasons.

Preference would be for a Stainless Sako, Tikka, Browning or Steyr ProHunter or Scout. I also like CZ's as well but still prefer another SS rifle. Might also consider a SS 260 or Savage lightweight hunter in 6.5 Creedmoor or 260. I can ADD cash if needed to make it fair. 

3 - Different Options to purchase:
1.  $550 Cash gets the gun only 
2.  $625 Cash gets the combo (6-18x50AO Bushnell scope/Ruger factory rings/gun). 
3.  Trade for options listed above (I can Add cash if needed to make it fair).

Price is firm and certainly fair. These are NOT cheap (Mine is the Target Grade model) so please be respectful and skip the lowball stuff . Sorry but I don't have a lot of time with work and family so the deal needs to be close by unless you are willing to do more driving on your end. Bill of sale will be completed as well.  Thanks for the interest!"

The first thing you need to do is ""Get Real"" about your asking price!  No one here will pay retail.  Don't expect to get as much as you paid at ""Gander Mountain"" or ""Bass Pro"" or any other retail store.

Research what your model is actually selling for by subscribing to ""GunBroker"" or other web sites related to guns and doing a search for ""Completed Auctions"" regarding your model.

Example: Asking $700 for a Glock 17L because they aren't made anymore?  If you do you're research, you'll find Glock has made a new run of these pistols and they retail for under $600.  Many more examples are available for current production guns.

Also comes with original factory slide stop, mag release, and factory guide rod. I have not had the time to install the TTI sights yet, however, in my opinion, they are the best competition sights on the market! Much better than Dawson! The DPM System is about the best guide rod you can buy on the market. It significantly reduces recoil, gives better control and accuracy, superior slide and frame protection, improved firing speed, elimination of jams and much more!"

I believe this might be the best possible SKS version there is.  It's a Norinco, matching numbers.  Only upgrade I would consider might be some kind of stock but I personally like the thumb hole wood stock compared to the plastic ones.  This is the M-Model which takes AK magazines.  I'm also including all 7 AK magazines (loaded) I own since I don't have an AK.  SKS accuracy and reliability with convenience of AK magazines.

This rifle also has the Magwedge Kwik Rail which I believe is the best accessory you can put on an SKS-M since there's no need for stripper clilps with the AK magazines.  This rock solid full length rail allows room for both a red dot and magnifier and is even still slotted down the middle to use the front iron sight with the magwedge slot as your rear sight.

I've got different optics I might add on for extra.  The optics shown in the picture are not included and are to show off the rail.

I'm also listing my other regular Norinco separately.  I'll keep whichever one doesn't sell.    Depending on how busy I am, I would consider letting you try it out at the Tacoma Sportsmans Club.

Would like to take a peek at your WA DL and CPL."

It's the 12.5 inch barrel version. I've only put 300 rounds through it. The previous owner was a family friend. They never fired it, so it only has the 300 down the tube. I put up a picture of some damage to the finish near the windage drum. I bought a cheap NC Star sighting tool and the hole wasn't big enough for the windage drum to move into. I thought the drum was just stiff from being new-ish. Me being an idiot, I gave the tool a couple extra whacks with a hammer and made it clamp even harder on the finish. That's what happened there. Besides that, the gun has always shot very reliably and is a fun gun to shoot. I'll include at least a steel mag and a tapco mag. If you have any questions or want a pic of anything else, just shoot me a message. Thanks!"

These started production in the mid 1980's and were a massive hit. This was Colt's answer to those who asked for something smaller than the Commander. The barrel length is 3.5 inches (half an inch longer than most Officer sized 1911's) and has the Officer sized grip.

This pistol is in amazing condition for it's age and is as classy as it gets. It's not perfect, but I'd rate it about 90%. It will definitely win a beauty contest. Extremely low round count by the looks of the internals (has to be well under 400). This gun still needs to be broken in! Sights have a nice white 3-dot system.

The gun comes with the original factory Colt wrap-around grips, beautiful Colt wood panel grips, one Colt magazine, and an extra set of stainless steel grip screws.

Too much history in this gun for me to even consider carrying it. So I will be open to trade offers."

A lot of scope mounts just replace the dust cover and bolt on. The problem with that is that you can't field strip the rifle without loss of rifle zero. The Krebs mount allows you mount a scope on the rail over the factory dust cover that is rock solid and with a single push of a pin you can pivot the mount up without loss of zero for field stripping or cleaning. When you're done just pivot it back down in push the pin in. Also gives the rifle a longer sight radius for improved accuracy. 

I mounted this rail once and decided to go a different way with my rifle.
Like new condition with all mounting hardware.

Larue shipped these rifles with the ""field grade"" barrel, and included is the match grade barrel certificate. Larue is currently contacting customers to mail their upper in for the barrel swap...just waiting on the phone call. If you purchase before I have to mail the upper in, then all you do is contact Larue to tell them, and verify, that you are the new owner of the rifle in order to redeem the match grade barrel certificate. I have confirmed this with Larue. Even if it takes a while longer, the field grade barrels are practically identical and still very accurate, and they also have the PST (port selector technology) on the gas block for use with or without a suppressor.
Price is $4,250 OBO. Serious offers only please. Prefer face to face, but will ship to you for the right offer once funds clear. Must pay using a certified check, which must clear before rifle is transfered. I will provide a firearm bill of sale to complete for records."

This 930 SPX shoots great and is in fantastic condition. It has less than a hundred rounds through it. The gas venting operating system reduces recoil and extends the life of the long gun by reducing wear and tear. I have taken the gun apart and cleaned it after every range session with Frog Lube. 

It has a red fiber optic front sight and a ghost ring rear sight. The receiver has an accessory rail installed so you can mount an optic if desired. The shotgun comes with original box and paperwork. It has not been a safe queen. I have had this gun out at least three times this summer and I have never had a single issue. It has run everything from 3"" magnum slugs to cheap lead birdshot flawlessly. 

Please ask any questions. The only reason I am selling is we have another baby on the way and we need extra cash. No trades please. 

You must be at least 18 years old and be legally allowed to own a firearm. This is my personal shotgun, but I have an FFL so you will have to submit to a background check if buying locally. It is at The Miami Armory by the Dayton Mall, and is available for inspection. I am willing to ship to another FFL. Thanks for looking!"
