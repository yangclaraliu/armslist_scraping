Good for cleaning reloading brass, gun parts, etc.

Considered the powerhouse of ultrasonic cleaners, the stainless steel Lock-N-Load Magnum Sonic Cleaner provides triple the size and twice the power of the original Lock-N-Load Sonic Cleaner.

Designed with reloaders in mind, the Lock-N-Load Magnum Sonic Cleaner excels at cleaning cartridge cases, but simply change over to Gun Cleaning solution, and it also works miracles on gun parts – it does ALL the work – clean pistol barrels, AR bolts, muzzle loader breech plugs and any other metal gun parts with hands-off ease.

Featuring two transducers, the Lock-N-Load Magnum Sonic Cleaner provides far superior cleaning capability over conventional cleaners that only utilize one transducer. Other ultrasonic cleaners merely have an on/off switch for the heater, which can cause parts to overheat and damage sensitive items. The adjustable heating element of the Lock-N-Load Magnum Sonic Cleaner allows the user to dial in the correct temperature to maximize cleaning efficiency without damaging delicate parts.

Its stainless steel housing is extremely durable and easy to clean, and the tighter mesh basket allows users to clean smaller parts. The Lock-N-Load Magnum Sonic Cleaner is a true multi-purpose tool that makes a great addition to any bench.

We're handling the firearms for a raffle being held for VFW 8211. The tickets are $20, and only 1,000 will be sold. Each ticket has a 3 digit ticket number. The drawing will be running during the month of October. This works off of the evening Ohio Lottery 'Pick 3' numbers. Each day in October, the evening 'Pick 3' winning number will also be the number of the winning ticket for the gun raffle. On October 1, the winning ticket number will win gun #1 on the list. October 2, the winning number will take home gun #2, and so on, and so on. Just because a ticket wins once, doesn't take it out of the drawing. If the number is pulled more than once during the month, it wins that day's prize. Tickets will be sold through 9/20, or until we run out- whichever comes first. You can purchase your chance to win at our shop, at the West Milton VFW, or from Rick Pierce. For any questions, feel free to contact us."

Whether you are an elite operator or just carry for self defense, many factors can hinder the comfortable and necessary handling of your weapon like blood, sweat, mud, solvent, etc. This service guarantees a firm grip anywhere and every time you handle your weapon. Why take the chance? 

I do custom grip textures on many polymer framed firearms like Glocks, M&P's, XD's, and any other polymer frame that not only looks good but also enhances the grip texture for a practical use.  I can shave the frame to better fit your hand or to shave some weight for a competition gun. I can incorporate designs into the texture as well. I can do the classic grip tape style texture for ccw or the larger dimple texture for a more tactical feel.. A lot of the gun shops in town will not only keep your firearm for a lengthy turnaround time, they will charge you upwards of $300 for a full job. I also do slide color inlay on the factory engravings. I can turn it around and deliver it back to you in 3 days or less. Check out my website at www.ManGrips.com or on Facebook at https://m.facebook.com/ManGrips?ref=bookmark. Here is some of my work. I am also working with AT Tactical to provide a one stop shop for all your firearm needs.

Its lightly used and in pretty good shape. Very accurate with minimal recoil, +P rated.

Will include the gun and box it came with, around 50 rounds of assorted .38 special, two Bianchi speed strips, and an ankle holster.

I'm primarily interested in trading it for a Ruger SR40c as the title says, don't really care if its stainless or black.  Might also consider a S&W M&P Shield in .40.

This gun is quite literally good as new, in perfect condition, with zero wear (as should be the case with a pistol that has only had 9 rounds put through it).

It comes w/ factory Siglite night sights, slim profile ergo E2 grips (they feel amazing), and 2 eight round mags, and factory Sig hard case and paperwork. Why buy from a dealer and pay the full retail price of $989.99, plus tax? This pistol is every bit as good as new, and you'd save a couple hundred bucks!

From the Sig website:

The P220® Carry is the latest step in the evolution of the P220 – the most accurate out-of-the-box .45 – and a perfect choice when it’s time to carry the ‘big caliber.’ This “commander” sized pistol features a full size frame with short slide and 3.9” barrel making it ideal for concealed carry. And like any P220 it performs above and beyond because the SIG SAUER® design allows for unparalleled performance regardless of bullet type or weight. This 8+1 capacity single stack pistol is available in a DA/SA configuration and features a durable Nitron® finish, Picatinny rail, and either post and dot contrast or 3-dot SIGLITE® night sights.


FYI: this $850 price is firm. Serious buyers only. Anyone that knows these pistols, knows that this is a legitimate good deal already. No trades.

This comes with the factory BDL hinged-floorplate assembly already installed; all you need to do is drop a barrel, bolt, and action into it and screw it down with the screws I included and you are ready to go to the range! This was taken from my brand new never fired AAC-SD rifle that I bought and immediately removed the stock from. I am building a custom rifle and just needed the barrel and action. This has Hogue Over Molding on the grip and forearm area, pillar bedding, and is a HUGE upgrade over stock Remington stocks that are cheap injection-molded plastic.

I see this stock for sale all over the internet going from $75-$100 without the BDL hinged floorplate assembly! Which by itself sells for $150!

Bought it new and it cam packed in cosmoline.  It has a beautiful original wood stock and will come with all the original parts including stock, cleaning kit (which is still in cosmoline), original mag, and sling.  It has a blade type bayonet.  It of course fires 7.62X39 ammo.  The gun is currently in a black Tapco stock and it has a new piston and gas cylinder installed.  It also has a new spring type firing spring installed.  This gun is a LOT more reliable than the typical Chinese models and has been modified to be better than original.  It will come with three Tapco 20 round mags, one Magpull 20 rnd mag, and one metal 30 round mag.  The plastic ones fit better in the Tapco stock.  The metal 30 round mag will fit it but it is a tight fit and I did not want to sand the nice wood stock.  It also comes with the original sight adjustment tool.  It even comes with the original field manual which is signed and stamped!  It is all in Yugoslavian I guess and I can't read it but it is still very cool.  If you are looking for a high quality SKS set up, you get everything you could ask for here!  Please email me if you would like additional info! Note: I am not sure of the manufacturer but chose Universal.  Gun has no rust and has been well cared for as you can see in the pictures.  The gun also is equipped with the grenade launcher and grenade sight....just in case you have any of those around. Thanks for looking!"

It's never been fired since I received it directly from Beretta Corp. as an exchange for my older one. It's the newer version (2012) with the slightly beefier slide for added strength. It comes with everything from the factory and one additional 7 round mag with a pinky extension - made in Italy. I'll also include a box of Fiocci FMJ  and a box of Federal Hydra Shok 65 grain HP self defense ammo. But wait, there's more... I've also got a small poly IWB holster and a (nicer) ankle holster. This a great, all steel gun. Small, but solid - just enough weight to feel really good in your hand. And the tip-up barrel design is great for those who may have difficulty racking a slide. It can be fired double or single action, too. My previous one was surprisingly accurate and a joy to shoot. With all that and Beretta's world class reliability, this is a great choice for a solid backup gun, or even a primary if size is an issue. I'm in the Tallahassee area and require a face-to-face transaction and a bill of sale with ID please. I can travel a bit if necessary. Email, call or text 850-363- one,one,eight,two."

Here you can see the difference between classic Enfield rifling compared to the 5 land and 3 land polygonal rifling.

This seems to be a rare model that DSA made (considering they don't make it anymore and only a few shops have sold them). I used this rifle strictly as a hog gun, which worked quite well. Very clean. I am only selling this rifle because I shifted to another platform and pretty much forgot about this rifle. 

This rifle has a 16 inch fluted barrel with 5/8X24 threaded (for those who want to run a can, and it ran my AAC cyclone flawlessly) flash hider, a full length quad rail an top rail (most models have a gap between the receiver and hand guard), and fixed stock. I have put around 400 rounds through this rifle because like I said I only hunted hogs with it. Other than that it sits in the back of the safe. 

The rifle also comes with the operators manual, rail mounted sling attachment, three 30 round magazines, one 20 round magazine, and one 5 round magazine.

The rifle is fun as hell to shoot but I just don't shoot it as much as I'd like to. So in my eyes I have no need for it.

Trades welcome but mostly looking for a Sig 556R Gen 2 (+ cash), Remington Versamax (hunting configuration) plus cash, Glock 26 Gen 4 only plus cash, bolt guns, quality optics and rifle ammo.... Let me know what you got.

I purchased it earlier this year and it's a great gun, but I've recently discovered Ruger makes an equivalent rifle that shares magazines with the 10/22. I'm selling this FV-SR to raise cash to buy the Ruger. No complaints with the rifle, just looking to consolidate magazines.

The rifle has had a couple hundred rounds through it. Less than 500 for sure, probably less than 250. I've yet to use the threaded barrel, and the cap has been on the entire time I've owned it.

Comes with 1x 5-round magazine and 1x 10-round magazine.

I can also throw in a cheap 3-9x scope that a friend gave me. I've never used it (the one I used on it I'm keeping for the future Ruger), so I have no idea if it's functional, but it's yours at no extra cost if you want it.

The Sig Sauer Adaptive Carbine Platform (ACP) allows any handgun with an accessory rail to be quickly modified into a personal defense weapon or carbine style firearm.  Regardless of the brand, Most pistols equipped with an accessory rail can be mounted to the ACP without the need for modification to the base gun.  Fabricated from solid aircraft-grade aluminum, the ACP sports M1913 rails and the 3, 6 and 9 o’clock positions with a full-length top rail at the 12 o’clock position.  Compatible accessories such as lights, red dot sights and lasers can be mounted for additional functionality.  The ACP brings personal Defense Weapon (PDW) features to almost any handgun.  The ACP offers law enforcement and executive protection agencies the ability to deploy a carbine or SMG, but with the controllability of a handgun.  An integral hand stop permits the user to get a forward grip without the danger of covering the muzzle.  The integral quick-detachable sling mounts allow an ACP-equipped pistol to be carried on a sling for fast access.  The Sig Sauer ACP allows the shooter access to the pistol s frame mounted controls, providing an easy training transition and familiar manual of arms.  The ACP is also compatible with most sound suppressors.  New in the box.  Item #ACP-P

As you can see, the price of just the mods = $1050. The gun was originally $1200. So that's $2,250 - so I'm not interested in lowering the price. The gun is in great shape and has never had a single malfunction, I always kept it very clean and well oiled. I'm not interested in trades and you'll have to get your own mags (thanks to the new colorado mag restrictions, sorry - gotta obey the law as all mine are from before the ban). It does have a few other mods but they only total up to about $50, minor things like a magpul bad lever, etc. I hid the serial number on the picture, and I did put some paint on the lettering (you can use nail polish remover if you don't like it, I just thought it added a little to it). Feel free to ask any questions. I'd be willing to meet somewhere close, preferably at a store that could do the transfer. If you're not familiar with the AR-15 and would like to buy it, lets meet for a while longer so I can show you how it all works. Thanks!"

I bought it used with an unknown round count. Since then I've put less than 500 rounds through it. I'm selling it as I find I don't shoot it much since my 10/22 is more fun as a semi-auto, and my lever gun is more fun as a tube-fed rifle.

There is some light rusting on the mag tube, though it functions just fine.

Get it while it's hot, before 594 goes into effect. I will still require a bill of sale and a glance at your WA driver's license or good guy card.

In addition, I'll include a box of 50rds of American Eagle FMJ ammo, 10-rounds of assorted +p hollow points rounds, a IWB nylon holster, and two new HKS speed loaders with the deal. Must be at least 21 years old, or older to buy or trade this gun. And must be a Kentucky resident with a valid KY driver's license (KY CCDW preferred). $375 for all. Price is firm. No low ball please, I got more than $400 invested on the gun and extras. Will not separate gun, ammo, and extras. Package sale/trade only. No shipping out of state. Local sale or trade only.  Note: the black tape on the gun is just to cover the serial number for security reason. It's not permanent. Thanks for looking.

* This is a repost. Sold this gun a couple of days ago to one of my wife's friends. But she decided and changed her mind that she is not ready to own a handgun yet. And I bought it back from her. And had a couple of trades pending. But all of them fell through. So it's back on the market *"

This particular pistol feeds ball ammo very well but has some minor feeding issues with hollow point. I've put about 200 rounds through it since I've owned it and it appears that it's still in the break in phase. It does handle HP ammo much better than it did when I first got it. Given time and use I doubt it will ever be an issue."

Yes it is higher than you would pay at wal-mart but not much higher.  No standing in line just to find out no .22s came in or waiting an hour to buy a max of 200 shots.  No I'm not trying to rip no one off.  If you do not need .22 ammo then don't buy it.  Just go stand in line or wait another 3 years or god knows how long till it gets back on the shelfs.  My price is .10 a shot and for some of this that's what I payed and for some I payed .05 a shot.  If it concerns you about how much one payed for something and they should sale for less than they payed you should not go to any stores because believe it or not they sale for a profit.   Sorry I seem bitter it's just that people cry all the time on here about people selling  .22 for a profit because of supply and demand but that same people could have a 1800s gun they pay $100 at a yard sale and find out it's worth $1000 and want take a penny less.  I understand that value is what a buyer is willing to pay and a saler is willing to take is something's real value.  If you don't understand that then keep whining and crying about I can't find .22 at wal-mart and pay the extra.  Or don't.  Makes no difference to me at all.  I'm selling some of these for fun.  I have no need to sale and am doing this as more of a hobby.  If you are short in ammo and don't want to waste your time in line shoot me a text.  I travel with work anywhere between Athens and Chattanooga so meeting is not a problem. REDACTED.  Thanks

For your consideration is a like new Kimber Classic Custom - Series 1  Serial #K047202. I purchased this pistol new as a backup to my other Kimber Classic, I added the hogue wraparound grips and took it to the range a few times (2-300 rds) just after we purchased it. Since then it has sat in my safe for the last 14 years.

This auction includes the Pistol and the original Kimber magazine. I would rate this pistol at 99% condition. It is that nice. If you are looking for an original Series 1 Kimber in like new condition then this one is for you.

With it comes 70 Hornady loads, 18 reloads, 20 300 gr Hornady HP bullets, 50 325 gr Hornady FXT bullets, 76 brass, 50 new, 26 once fired. I also have a set of Lee 45-70 dies that go with it. I won't answer stupid lowball offers. I don't need the money, just moved to Fla. where i probably won't shoot it. Call or text 7two4 three17 9592.  $895 obo, make me an offer. You pay shipping.

I hate to let this go, but I already have one in 9mm and am standardizing all of my pistols to 9mm. 

The Sub 2000 is a unique rifle, in that it folds in half for easy storage, making it the perfect backpack or truck gun. Also, this version takes Glock .40 caliber mags, so pair it with any .40 Glock, and you have one heck of a potent 2 gun package! There is a reason why you can not find these little carbines anywhere, because they get snatched up extremely quick and in fact, command a price far greater than suggested retail. Act quick if you want it!

Mine was used VERY little, maybe 50 rounds for function test, then it went into my bug out kit along w/ my Glock (see my other auction if you're interested in the Glock as well). I'm including 4 Glock 15 rd factory mags (1 has a Pearce grip extension), and a Kel Tec soft rifle case (that I paid $70 for). 

Price of $675 is firm. No trades. And no, I will not travel halfway across the state to sell it to you (people sure do have some odd expectations!) If you want it, you need to travel to the areas above. 

Text me at REDACTED for quickest response.


Side note: I do have quite a bit of .40 Cal ammo (both hollow point and FMJ) for sale on another listing, so if you're interested, check out the blue link toward the top of the page that says ""other listings by this seller""."

Also removed that heavy trigger the gun comes with and installed a AR-10 competition Timney trigger with a 4lb pull weight. Next to reduce the recoil for those that like to put some rounds down range I removed the Stock buffer and installed a Hydraulic Buffer the recoil this produces now is less than a 5.56 in my opinion. Finally I removed the flash suppressor and installed a JP Enterprises Tactical Muzzle brake. This thing sounds like a .50Cal and the barrel barely moves after firing allowing fast target acquisition for follow on RDS. Everything done enhances your shooting experience and accuracy significantly while this SIG rests on the GG&G bipod mounted on the rail. This gun stays remarkably clean while being fired since it is utilizing the short stroke pushrod operating system. Best of all is this .308 is chambered for NATO 7.62x51mm. I purchased and modified the gun however am in the process of moving and can't take it. Also comes with 13 20rd P-MAGs and old parts in the event you would like to use them

It comes with the original box and all documentation, factory lock, 2 13 round magazines (which is GREAT for a compact above 9mm), and load assist. This pistol is generation 3, so it has very improved ergonomics and fits in your hand very well. The gun has only had one box of Federal ammo put down the pipe and is in very good condition. In addition to all of this, it also has an extended magazine release and slide release for ease of use. This particular pistol is unique in the fact that while it is striker fired, the trigger stays to the rear if the striker has not been reset. This allows you to know if you have a round chambered without moving the slide. This could make all the difference in a defensive situation.  I can be reached by clicking the contact seller button, or by text (preferred)/phone call at 77zero*54nine-596three.

This handgun comes with the original box and documents, lock, and 2 17 round magazines. This handgun is in very good condition and sports an alloy frame where most pistols today are polymer based. The slight added weight negates the already low recoil of the 9mm cartridge making follow up shots quick and easy. Takedown is also very simple making maintenance and cleaning a breeze. Since the barrel is longer, it also allows for a better shot with the longer distance in between the sights.
