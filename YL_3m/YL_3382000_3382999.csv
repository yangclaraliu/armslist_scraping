It has the stamped steel slide and pinned breech block so it's an earlier model probably from 2000 or earlier. I got this on a trade and I'm not a large gun guy so wanting to trade mainly for a Walther P99 or PPQ. Other pistol offers are fine or AR's but no shotguns or bows, other rifles please. The gun had some slide wear when I got it so I duracoated the slide (I'm a professional painter so it's a professional job). Haven't done the frame and it does have a couple nicks from use but overall looks good. It came with the Hogue grips installed but I preferred the rosewood NRA Law Enforcement grips so I put them on. The gun comes in original case with one 8 rd. mag and two 7 rd. mags plus about a dozen hollow point self defense rds. Value on this is about 600 and I will accept cash if I don't get some good trade offers, with the little wear on this it's a great shooter and a nice example of a German Sig P220."

Its in great shape and lightly used with no issues.  Has XS Big Dot Trijicon night sight.  Depending on what you have to trade or what it comes with I have a number of extras I can include, a couple of different holsters, two Bianchi speed strips with belt pouch, and 120 rounds of assorted .38 Special ammo.

While it works well I just don't like it as well as other .38 snubs I've had.  I'd primarily like to trade it for a Glock 26, but would also consider a SIG 938 or other snub .38/.357 revolvers such as a Ruger SP101, S&W 638, etc.  I'm only looking for handguns along these lines, no Tauruses and no rifles or shotguns please.

I prefer to trade but I'll sell everything for $550

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

Originally a JP Sauer Kar98, but eventually become a russian capture. ALL THER GERMAN MARKING, EAGLES, ETC ARE STILL THERE, and not scratched or worn off. All the parts match, except for the bayonet band. In good condition, looks rough but is still solid. There is no grease, gunk or dirt, left in the gun. When i got it I completely took it apart and cleaned it very thoroughly. 

This gun shoots AMAZING! With a fair condition barrel, At 50 yards/open sights I shot some 1946 surplus ammo through it, and i could cover the group with a quarter! I can show you the target if you dont believe me.

However, feel free to let me know what you have, but only interested in 9mm or .40 handguns, no rifles or shotguns please.

Would far prefer to trade, but make me a REASONABLE cash offer if not interested in trading.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 if interested, texts preferred.

Thanks!"

I used a quick Google search to fix the problem but that did not help me.

I then decided to get professional help to solve my problem. After having received many quotations from various companies, I decided to go ahead with Online Tech Repair (www.onlinetechrepairs.com). 

Reasons I chose them over the others:

1) They were extremely friendly and patient with me during my initial discussions and responded promptly to my request.
2) Their prices were extremely reasonable.
3) They were ready and willing to walk me through the entire process step by step and were on call with me till i got it fixed.

How did they do it?

1) They first asked me to state my problem clearly and asked me a few questions. This was done to detect any physical connectivity issues with the printer.
2) After having answered this, they confirmed that the printer and the laptop were functioning correctly.
3) They then, asked me if they could access my laptop remotely to troubleshoot the problem and fix it. I agreed.
4) One of the tech support executives accessed my laptop and started troubleshooting.
5) I sat back and watched as the tech support executive was navigating my laptop to spot the issue. The issue was fixed.
6) I was told that it was due to an older version of the driver that had been installed.

My Experience

I loved the entire friendly conversation that took place with them. They understood my needs clearly and acted upon the solution immediately. Being a technical noob, I sometimes find it difficult to communicate with tech support teams. It was a very different experience with the guys at Online Tech Repairs. You can check out their website www.onlinetechrepairs.com or call them on   1-914-613-3786.

I would definitely recommend this service to anyone who needs help fixing their computers.

Thanks a ton guys. Great Job....!!

Once upon a time, a ""dissipator"" AR was created by taking a 20"" rifle-length gas system upper and cutting the barrel down to 16"".  This allowed the shooter to keep the long sight radius of a rifle for accuracy, but keep the carbine length barrel for maneuverability.  The proximity of the gas port to the muzzle, however, played havoc with timing and made reliability a hit or miss proposition.   Advances in AR technology  have produced reliable carbine and mid-length gas systems, that can be hidden using low-profile gas blocks.  This allows for a front sight base to be pinned in the rifle position for the longer sight radius without the worry of the unorthodox gas port location affecting operation.   We use the term ""mock"" to differentiate our dissipator from a cut-down rifle length version.  

Barrel: 416 Stainless steel. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system.  Barrel is  is finished off with a classic rifle-length handguard,  F-Marked gas sight base, and A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is made to MIL-SPECS and hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring machined T marks, and a mil-spec finish. These uppers are made for us right here in the USA by a mil-spec manufacturer.

Get yourself or someone else ready with a ready-to-hunt rifle. This gun is a shooter, not a museum piece. It has plenty of evidence it has been in the woods. It has a see-under high-rise scope mount, a basic 3-9X scope (nothing fancy), weaver rings/mount. I replaced a missing buttplate screw and added the rear sling mount. The gun only had a forward mount when I got it. There is a minor amount of surface corrosion if you look real hard and a blemish on the forward barrel area where someone tried to buff a scratch/ding out. Glenfield guns were manufactured by Marlin for major retailers like Montgomery Wards in the day. The modern day equivalent is the Marlin Model 336 series, still produced today. The gun has been cleaned and well taken care of while in my possession. The gun has ""Marlin"" on the buttplate, as all Glenfield 30-30s do.

Springfield Armory SOCOM2 in a Bulldog 762 bullpup
 The Short Rifles M14/M1A Stock System was designed by Sgt. Richard Cabral (USMC Ret.). Rich enlisted in the Marine Corp in 1966-1972, qualified Expert with the M14 rifle and was part of his issue / make up for the next six years, honorably discharged 1972. In 1991 Rich reenlisted in the U.S. Army and went to boot camp at age 42 and graduated and spent two more years with the Army and then 10 years with the Army Guard where he served as company armorer and Marksmanship instructor, honorably discharged Sept 2001. competed at the Inaugural Sniper Nationals in 1991 Camp Robinson Little Rock Arkansas with the M14 /M21. A few years later 2006, he served as a civilian contractor in KirKush Iraq for the Department of Defense. Rich saw the M14 still in service with Snipers and Designated Marksmen from all branches in Iraq. Richard knew from his experience in the Marine Corp and U.S. Army that the M16/M4 had virtues and weaknesses. It is light, short and controllable, ideal for CQB. However, it does not tolerate dust well and a 55 grain .223 bullet is no match for the stopping power or penetration afforded by a 168 grain .308 / 7.62 NATO cartridge in Iraq, the M14 was praised by trigger pullers for its reliability, stopping power, range and penetration against clay walls, but its 44 inch length was a substantial hindrance in urban environments and in and out of vehicles.
2006 Upon his return from Iraq, Rich set to work on a stock design that would shorten the M14 to allow the attachment of modern optics, lasers and lights. As a true Rifleman, he saw simply shortening the barrel as an unacceptable compromise. He researched bullpup designs, starting with the original bullpup designed in 1902 by J.B. Thorneycroft and examined the Israeli experience with a prototype M14 bullpup variant. Rich spent 6 years developing the Short Rifles Stock system. He worked with his Special Forces contacts and sent stocks to operators in the field for real world testing. Shooters who used it in the crucible of combat gave Rich honest feedback, allowing him to make incremental improvements in the design. The result is a rifle that is over a foot shorter than an M14 in a regular stock – shorter than n M16A4 and close to the length of an M4 Carbine. The stock design also moves most of the mass of the weapon closer to the shooters body, allowing more leverage in a CQB environment and places the center of the bolt in line with the shooters shoulder, allowing better controllability. The current design is the 4th Generation of the Short Rifle Stock System and has no peer. Unfortunately, Richard’s focus on R&D left him open to the less than ethical practices of a subcontractor hired to assist with manufacturing the 3rd generation system. This subcontractor pirated the 3rd generation design and has tried to market it under the moniker Juggernaut. As Americans, we cringe at the idea of our technology and ideas being stolen or counterfeited by anyone. The mere mention of the word counterfeit drums up images of fake Rolex's sold in a back alley. If your fake Rolex doesn’t work, it may at least look the part. However, if your counterfeit weapon chassis that looks the part does not work right when the chips are down, the consequences are far more dire."
