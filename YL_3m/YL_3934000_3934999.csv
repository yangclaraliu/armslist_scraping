Beretta Tomcat 3032, chambered in .32 ACP. 
This pocket-sized pistol has the unusual flip-up barrel, designed to load one in the chamber without racking the slide (or, similarly, to unload a chambered round). 
This pistol comes with 2 7-rd magazines, with Pearce grip extensions for better handling. Additionally, this pistol comes with a DeSantis pocket holster. 
Along with the pistol and everything described above, comes ammo.
25 rounds of Hornady Custom XTP hollow point.
25 rounds Speer Gold Dot GDHP hollow point.
22 rounds Winchester white box, fmj.
92 rounds Remington UMC, fmj.
This Beretta is in great shape, and functions flawlessly.
I can throw in an MTM pistol case for full price offer.
Read the reviews online, watch the videos. This is a fun fun gun. Great pocket carry pistol. Snappy.
Open to trades, interested in Glocks or Revolvers."

Can a pistol small enough to carry every day have all the features, performance and power you would find in a full size handgun? Can the ergonomics be so superior that range time is a pleasure rather than a chore? Could you actually look forward to shooting your carry pistol?

The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the best features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.

The XD-S® is the first single-stack polymer framed pistol from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 inches. The XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it.

The strengths of the XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack don’t stop there. Try it with an X-Tension™ magazine (7 rounds .45 ACP, 9 rounds 9mm), and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The XD-S® Single Stack also includes the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System™, grip safety, loaded chamber indicator, firing pin block, and grip safety that make the entire family of XD® pistols safe and easy to use.

Choosing a handgun for concealed carry doesn’t have to be a series of compromises anymore. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice features for power. And you certainly don’t have to carry a gun to the store that you’d rather not carry to the range. Put an XD-S® 3.3″ Single Stack in your hand today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

I'm asking $900 (I have $1400 into this gun) shipped to your FFL from my FFL. I accept USPS money order, certified bank cashiers check, or cash FTF transaction in Las Vegas, NV (where I live). If meeting FTF in LV, you MUST be a NV resident, and be willing to meet at a Metro substation to go though a BG check. Buyers shouldn't have a problem with this, so if you do, too bad. It's the only way I'm selling it FTF. I also accept PayPal Friends/Family if you're fine with that. You're more than welcome to use standard PayPal, you'll just need to cover PayPal fees. You'll get a no hassle transaction on my part. I expect nothing less than the same in return from the buyer. As soon as I am paid, the gun will go immediately to my FFL (New Frontier Armory here in Las Vegas) and be shipped directly to your FFL the same day I receive payment. They will send you a tracking number, and they ship fast!

If you live in a mag restricted state, I cannot include the 13 round mags. Only the 10 round mags will be included. I will however see if I can find someone to trade the 13 round mags for a couple 10 round mags then ship them to you for free. Know your state and local laws before agreeing to purchase this firearm.

I may be interested in a trade +/- cash. I could use an optic for one of my ARs. I've been looking at the Nightforce 2.5-10 x 32 NXS, Vortex Viper PST 2.5-10 x 44, and Trijicon TR22 (green center dot). I own a couple ACOG TA31 w/red chevrons, so I may be interested in another one. A Vortex Viper PST 1-4 x 24 with ADM or Vortex mount would also work, but I'm really looking for a quality optic with a little more power. I'll of course pay the price difference if there is one.

****Selling my slightly used Sig Sauer P290 RS 9MM. Double Action Only. It should be categorized as new since I only fired about 120 rounds or maybe less on it to make sure it functions well. No scratches. Very nice little gun good trigger pull and quite accurate for its size. I bought this last year to be one of my CCW Guns when I apply. But due to work I must move back to SF/Bay Area and as everyone probably knew unlike here Sacramento County its almost impossible to get a CCW Permit in SF County/Bay Area Counties. I already own a Sig P226 for Home Defense. I will not need this gun anymore. It will come with its original Sig Case, 2 magazines (6rd & 8 rd) and the cable lock that came with it. This gun is almost impossible to find and buy in California nowadays. BTW ***The coke can on the pic is for size comparison only. Buyers pays transfer fee which is about $30. Thanks!"

The 5.56 Carbine Quad Rail 16"" Upper is a standard M4 style upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with our salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper you own.

Barrel Material: Voodoo Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel
finished with our proprietary QPQ Melonite process inside and out. Unlike hard chrome and magnesium phosphate, Melonite is a molecular bonding process with the metal. It allows the chemicals to seep down below the surface area of the metal, instead of just adding a top layer. This means that the barrel can be cut to a true rifle bore while maintaining complete corrosion resistance and virtually no wear. It also means that the protection offered is not just a thin layer on top of the material but actually penetrates layers deep ensuring that it does not wear off. Now you have the velocities of a stainless steel true rifle bore with complete protection! You can out last a chrome lined barrel and shoot with the accuracy and efficiency of a stainless steel barrel, all without breaking the bank

I don't have my conceal carry. I'm old school and just go official ranges and follow all federal and state regulations. If this is a concern you may have a photo copy of my ID and a letter stating my intent to follow all official regulations regarding firearms.

Hello, I am having to sell my Gen 3 Glock 17. It was purchased as a trade-in and has been used which is why the price is $300. It still functions well, just has wear. The handgun comes with 3 magazines, one of which was made during the 90's ban (says LE/GOVT use only).  I am selling because I have some repairs needed for my vehicle. Due to the vehicle, I can only meet in XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX as well. I am not looking for any trades and the price is firm."

Up for sale today is an amazing Kel Tec SU 16B rifle. I have used this as a truck gun for many years and it has worked flawlessly without any FTF or other issues. It will come with some sort of monstrum red dot sight. I will say that most people will not want to use it since it probably has lost its juice over the years. I mostly used the iron sights.

The is the Kel Tec SU 16B Version. This rifle runs on .223 / 5.56.

It comes with 2 30 Round AR magazines along with 2 10 Round Custom Magazines that Fit Right in the stock for storage. The SU16 has metal sights and has normal wear throughout the years. It folds in half for sufficient storage and can be easily carried in a backpack for hikes if needed. 

I am asking for 550 for this one, but can entertain offers. I also have the original receipt from the store if needed to be shown, however it is quite faded.

I would like to request that you are a resident of the state of Virginia, have a valid Driver's License, and a CCW."

It runs on .38 Special. The lockup is nice and it rotates well. Single action works flawlessly and double action as well.  It will come with a small carry case.

I would rate this gun on a 1-10 to be a strong 8 considering its age. We had this gun appraised by Winchesterguns.com in Morgan, UT. They told the gun would be valued between 3,500 low 5,000 high depending on condition. We feel our gun is a very strong 4,000 dollar gun so this is my asking price, but I may be willing to move a little bit. Make me an offer. Just to let everyone know I've already turned down 3,000 for the gun three times so that will not buy it.
