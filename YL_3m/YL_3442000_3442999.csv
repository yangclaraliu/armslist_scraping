I now have a xDs that I use for my everyday carry, so this pretty much sits without being fired. If my memory serves me  correctly, it has roughly around 350 - 450 rounds through it (without a single hiccup) and the grouping cannot get much better from a pistol. It has also been properly cleaned + heat-treated with FrogLube every time it's been fired. I did do a few mods to it, which I have listed. I also have all the original parts that will be included.

The Interceptor body armor system consists of an Outer Tactical Vest (OTV) and two Small Arms Protective Inserts (SAPI). The OTV is lined with finely woven Kevlar aramid, these two parts of the vest are both bullet and heat resistant. The vest was tested to stop a 9 mm 124 GR full metal jacket bullet (FMJ) at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the armor panel. 

The vest proved its protection prowess in Afghanistan and Iraq in which many U.S. soldiers were saved by wearing them[citation needed]. In particular, it is credited with saving the lives of 29 American servicemen in Afghanistan. There were delays in equipping the entire force with the Interceptor vest at the beginning of this war.

Series 70 action blued finish. I purchased this from a collector and it had NEVER been fired (I paid a pretty penny for it too because of this but that's another story) I wanted to use it as a carry piece so I went ahead and installed an ED Brown match grade barrel and bushing as well as a new recoil spring all for reliability sake. Everything else on this one is totally bone stock and original right down to the beautiful grips. 

After installing the new barrel ($200) I fired 55 rounds total from it and them out it in my safe. So this one has only seen 55 rounds total since 1981! I have the original magazine as well as the original matching serial box too and it's in fair condition. I've just kind of lost interest with this one and would like to sell to someone who can enjoy it. With the match barrel this one is crazy accurate and the legendary series 70 trigger pull is super sweet!

It has a beautiful blue finish and is a solid 99% condition (very small run mark underneath the slide stop but NOT a full ""idiot scratch"" it's barely even noticeable) this one is truly beautiful and right as can be.

The upper and the lower do NOT wiggle or move at all. They are fitted perfectly. The break down pins come out with ease. I'm not just saying this because I'm selling my Ar-15 but it is one of the best AR-15s I've handled. It is solid and does not rattle like other cheaply built AR15s do. I have 250 rounds through it.

Fully functional 

 The gun is fully functional but was a ""working gun"" on the family farm pre world wars. That means it was shot and shot regularly but well taken care of. 

 The barrel does not appear to be original. My research says the rifle was manufactured in 1908 but there is a patent date of 1911 on the barrel indicating it was replaced at some point. 

 Very cool old rifle that would look great above the mantle and can still be taken out to shoot. I'll also throw in 450 rounds of vintage 22 long. The 50 round boxes go for $5-$10 (empty) each on Ebay

 I inherited this rifle recently. An uncle had bought it for my Dad as a kid, probably in the early 60's. Oh boy you think, what kid wouldn't want their own 22lr rifle? Well this particular rifle was some sort of kit gun where the child was intended to ""build"" it himself. What that means is that the wood is rough, un sanded and unvarnished (see pictures)

 The rifle comes equipped with standard Redfield front and rear peep sites, heavy target barrel and sling swivels. 

 This rifle would make a great project for a father and son/daughter or someone looking for a little nostalgia.

In 1980, Taurus purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil ""lock, stock and barrel"" and immediately sought to improve on the Beretta design, resulting in the popular and acclaimed Taurus 92. Always looking to raise the bar, we've taken this year's models a step further than they've ever been. Most notable is Taurus' specially designed drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame that won't crack or allow the slide to come off. Other innovations include a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety, which is more secure than a slide mounted safety, and allows for a classic SA ""cocked-and-locked"" mode, as well as functioning as a DA decocking lever. Available in fixed sight model 92 you'll be able to face any situation without compromise.


 	Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.
	3 Position Safety Decocker
Try the ambidextrous Three-Position Safety on any Taurus pistol capable of firing in both single action and double action. It's easily operated and provided at no additional charge. Depress with your thumb and safely drop the hammer to de-cock the pistol. The safety returns to the OFF position, ready for double action shooting. Push the safety up and your cocked pistol is safe to carry in the single action mode. When applied to a de-cocked pistol, safety is ON and the first shot is double action.
 	Taurus Security System (TSS)a
All the Taurus family of revolvers features the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your firearm and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.
 	Ambidextrous 3-Position Safety
Features Positive dentents for SAFE, FIRE and DECOCK
 	Accessory Rail
Features the Genuine Picatinny Rail allowing use of many accessories
	Decocker Lever
Allows the Firearm to be safely decocked from the cocked position"

This is a Ithaca 12 Ga Lever Action Shotgun.  This is rare shotgun and one that you should add to your collection.  It is in pretty decent condition and definitely safe for firing.  I could have a good time with this old gun and it would be hard to resist putting it over the mantle when not in use.  This would be a good 1st shotgun for a youth or even a good home defense shotgun for someone looking for a simple to operate gun.  Open the lever, insert a 12 ga cartridge, pull back the hammer, aim an shoot.  The bluing is in good shape and the wood finish is nice.  It has been re-blued along the way.

Started out life as a normal 870 but I cant leave well enough alone swapped out the stock for a mako folding 4 pos stock then added a magpul forend after that it took a trip to a gunsmith and was polished for a very smooth trigger and pump action and tube ext. took it to the range and put about 2-300 shells downrange an then it just sat in the safe.

Can be shipped to your home. This is a Colt Model 1877 double action, single action revolver, ""Lightning"" with a 3.5 inch barrel. The rifling is still visible, at least all the lands and grooves are there. The original nickel finish is gone, only showing a hint here and there of nickel in some places. Much of the original ""COLTS PT.F.A.MFG. Co./HARTFORD CT U.S.A.,"" and Colt leaping horse with patent date stamping on the top of the barrel and left side on the frame is worn away. What shows is...""..TS PT.F.A.MFG. Co./..RTFORD CT U.S.A."".. the address on the top of the barrel is mostly there. The serial number is found on the trigger guard, and frame #38085, in parts on the handle. The Colt factory assembly numbers stamped with #58, within the pistol match, so the trigger and frame, loading gate are consistent, all matching parts to the pistol. The grips fit nice, as they are replacement reproductions to the Colt. The original brass stanchions and screw were taken from the original grips and installed into the new grips. The action functions in double action only, but the cylinder does not advance. The cylinder moves freely by hand, and does not seem to engage the bolt, as the bolt is worn. The trigger spring needs to be replaced, and so trigger does not return fully without manually resetting. The hammer does not work in single action, nor will it stay in the cocked or half cock positions. All internal parts are there. This pistol is a good collectible, ""non-shooter,"" antique Colt 1877 Lightning in .38 long Colt cal. manufactured in 1882.  http://www.coltparts.com/pt_1877da.html"

500,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3442500,For Sale/Trade:  Bear Encounter RH Compound Bow,"Blanchester - Morrow area, Cincinnati, Ohio",$ 295,"Listed On: Saturday, August 30, 2014",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This bow includes Trophy Ridge sights, rest and quiver. There is also a True Fire release and 4 arrows. 60# draw weight, adjustable down to 50#.

I decided to try hunting with a compound bow---I am a complete novice. My nephew is an accomplished archer and bow hunter. He recommended the Bear Encounter as being better than most of the quality entry level bows. There are numerous articles & reviews on the web that give this bow really high marks for what it is, which is apparently an entry level to mid-level bow. There were two used ones on ebay that looked like a good buy, ending about the same time. Not intending to, I ended up buying both. The one I am keeping looks new, literally. My nephew says this one is in VG to excellent condition, but he thinks the string is going to need replacing next season. The arrows appear to be in fine condition; the broadheads are so-so. Owners Manual is available online at the Bear website; it includes directions to adjust draw length or weight. I will try to answer any questions, but please remember I am new to this....I am relying on my nephew's knowledge.

Arrow rest is a fall way, appears to be Trophy Ridge Revolution from pictures I've found online. Sight appears to be a Trophy Ridge Sharpshooter (again my best guess looking at pictures online). My nephew thought it was a great package for the $$ when I bought it, but having two I am now looking to get back what I paid for this one. Price may have a little room for negotiation, but I would negotiate only in person....you can't really make me a legitimate offer unless you're in front of me with money in hand."

The LaserMax was a $300 upgrade on it's own (look it up). What can I say about a Beretta 92? They are reknown world wide for rock solid reliability. Cash price is firm. I will consider trades. 

This comes with original case, houge & original grips, two original Beretta 15 round mags, paperwork, as well as laser box, and paperwork & original parts the laser replaces, & Bull Dog holster.

I will consider selling the Beretta for $500 without the laser sight.

CBC, 7.62MM X 51MM CALIBER CARTRIDGES

RECALL: It has come to our attention that CBC 7.62mm x 51mm cartridges from lots dated 1975 may pose a serious safety risk. The specific cartridges in question bear the headstamp ""CBC 7.62 75"".

We hereby provide written notice to you that a potential hazard may exist with respect to outdated CBC 7.62mm x 51mm cartridges. There is a reported risk that such cartridges may cause excess pressure upon discharge and could result in serious bodily injury or damage.

Under no circumstances should these cartridges be used, given to anyone, or sold.

There have been isolated reports of rifles bursting as a result of excessive pressure in what appear to be these outdated CBC cartridges. An independent testing lab reports that it detected a peak pressure that they estimated to be in excess of 130,000 CUP in one out of a batch of 20 outdated CBC 7.62mm x 51mm cartridges dated 1975 that it tested.

CBC 7.62mm x 51mm cartridges are manufactured solely for military use in several nations around the world. CBC has not exported or sold any of these cartridges to or in the United States. These particular cartridges are not intended for civilian use under any circumstances.

In addition, a warning is issued for any CBC 7.62mm x 51mm cartridges from any year that bear a label on the packing material with the Spanish word ""reengastada"". That label was not affixed by CBC, and its application to ammunition is not yet clear.

Anyone who has, or believes they have, CBC 7.62mm x 51mm cartridges from lots dated 1975, or CBC 7.62mm x 51mm cartridges from any year with the word ""reengastada"" on the packing label should immediately contact the dealer from whom they bought the rounds, and call the following toll-free phone number:

CBC, 7.62MM X 51MM CALIBER CARTRIDGES

RECALL: It has come to our attention that CBC 7.62mm x 51mm cartridges from lots dated 1975 may pose a serious safety risk. The specific cartridges in question bear the headstamp ""CBC 7.62 75"".

We hereby provide written notice to you that a potential hazard may exist with respect to outdated CBC 7.62mm x 51mm cartridges. There is a reported risk that such cartridges may cause excess pressure upon discharge and could result in serious bodily injury or damage.

Under no circumstances should these cartridges be used, given to anyone, or sold.

There have been isolated reports of rifles bursting as a result of excessive pressure in what appear to be these outdated CBC cartridges. An independent testing lab reports that it detected a peak pressure that they estimated to be in excess of 130,000 CUP in one out of a batch of 20 outdated CBC 7.62mm x 51mm cartridges dated 1975 that it tested.

CBC 7.62mm x 51mm cartridges are manufactured solely for military use in several nations around the world. CBC has not exported or sold any of these cartridges to or in the United States. These particular cartridges are not intended for civilian use under any circumstances.

In addition, a warning is issued for any CBC 7.62mm x 51mm cartridges from any year that bear a label on the packing material with the Spanish word ""reengastada"". That label was not affixed by CBC, and its application to ammunition is not yet clear.

Anyone who has, or believes they have, CBC 7.62mm x 51mm cartridges from lots dated 1975, or CBC 7.62mm x 51mm cartridges from any year with the word ""reengastada"" on the packing label should immediately contact the dealer from whom they bought the rounds, and call the following toll-free phone number:
