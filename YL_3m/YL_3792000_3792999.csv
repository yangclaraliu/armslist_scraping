internal slide rails (like SiG pistols)
linkless cam barrel operation 
bell muzzle (so no bushing)

one (1)  6-round flush-mount magazine included

The pictures are very high res, and show every little possible flaw. This pistol looks even better in person. I have many more detailed pictures I can send on request.

There is a lot of info out on the web about these little pocket pistols. If you are not familiar with them, it is worth taking a little time to read up. They were well-designed and well made, and if there hadn't been a global financial crash in 1997, Star would probably still be making them. They are quite accurate, and +P rated.

Current Minnesota concealed carry permit holders may do a p-t-p private sale; all others and out-of-state buyers will need to go through an FFL for transfer (my local FFL dealer will do this for $25). All federal, state, and local laws will be followed.

-The Cobra derringers at $275 each? Those are about $150 brand new.
-The Cobra 380 for $300. Why buy a new one for $140 when you can buy a used one for more than two times as much?

With all the mod's I've done the Rifle alone is worth almost $2,500 but price is negotiable. The rifle itself has had less than 500 rds but through it. It is worth noting that the bolt is also coated so any carbon transfer is minimal because it is two stage piston driven but any carbon can simply be wiped off. There is also no heat transfer to the BCG during firing which means it does not have to be constantly soaked in CLP to operate properly.  

It has a Magpul Rifle Stock, Magpul AFG2, Magpul MAID pistol grip with CLP storage, Boron Nitride Coated Bolt and Rainier Arms charging handle, as well as RAC flash hider and rails with Magpul heat shields.

The PPQ has a glass fiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools. The internal preset striker 'Quick Defense' trigger of the PPQ is a departure of previous Walther pistols and has been developed for the PPQ. When the trigger is pulled the trigger bar engages a disconnect lever, which props up a sear hook, which releases the fully pre-loaded striker assembly, firing the pistol. Pulling the trigger does not partially load the striker spring as with the Glock and many other striker fired pistol designs. The PPQ trigger pull is entirely due to the trigger and disconnector springs.
The PPQ has a trigger travel of approximately 9 mm (0.4 in) with a relatively short trigger reset of 2.5 mm (0.1 in) and a trigger pull of approximately 25 N (5.6 lb).

The Colt 1991 Series is a direct descendant of the original Colt M1911. A long trigger, flat mainspring housing and original style recoil spring system remain from the original M1911 design. Upgrades from the original include white dot sights and a lowered ejection port for extra reliability. It still remains “the standard” that everyone tries to imitate, but no one duplicates.

This is a Smith and Wesson Model 10-6 revolver chambered in .38 Special and made between 1972 and 1973 based on the serial number. It has four inch heavy barrel. It is in great condition with 85% of the bluing in place. There is a little holster wear at the end of the barrel (as seen in the photos) as well as on the cylinder. There is no rust on this weapon.

When I purchased it, I was told it was probably a police trade-in, but that isn’t verified. The lock up is great. The single action trigger pull matches some of the best rifles I’ve ever used. The double action pull is extremely smooth. I’ve never handled a revolver with a smoother trigger.

Grouped with this amazing American classic are some great accessories:

A Galco Wheelgunner Holster ($48 new) - This holster has modern ergonomics and design allowing this full size revolver to be carried concealed (if you have the required license of course). It allows the holster to ride high on the waist making it easy to conceal with a jacket. And the classic leather looks incredible.

A set of Miculek hardwood grips ($85 new) - These grips (shown attached to the gun) were designed by Jerry Miculek, the world’s fastest revolver shooter. The narrow design allows for the fastest draw and maximum control. The one-piece construction features an open backstrap for a comfortable grip and excellent trigger reach.

A set a Pachmayr “Gripper” grips ($25 new) - These grips are made of soft, grippy rubber that absorb recoil and offer superior traction.

A set of “Fitwell” grips - These are the grips that came on the gun when I purchased it. They have the look of standard Smith and Wesson “magna” grips, but they are made of plastic.

An Uncle Mikes nylon holster ($20 new) - This is a pretty standard nylon holster. It can be adapter for use as an over-the-waistband or inside-the-waistband holster (however, it’s carrying a revolver this size IWB is probably pretty hard).

Two HKS Speedloaders ($6 each new) - These allow you to quickly load six rounds of ammunition in the revolver. HKS speedloaders are a classic brand.

A nylon double speedloader pouch ($20 new) - This allows you to carry two speedloaders in a protected pouch on your belt. The bottom of each section is lined with foam to protect the bullets.

The Electra is the most innovative muzzleloader to ever hit the market. It is the first of its kind to use an electronic ignition, making it the most-reliable, fastest-loading and easiest-to-clean muzzleloader ever made. The patent-pending ARC™ electronic ignition eliminates the need for a primer. The ignition is completely sealed from the elements and requires no flash hole, ensuring superior reliability no other muzzleloader can duplicate. No parts other than the barrel ever have to be cleaned because of fouling. The ignition is instantaneous, and since there is no pressure explosion, as there is with primer ignitions, there is no accuracy-robbing displacement of the charge. This allows a full, consistent burn of the powder charge at the bottom of the barrel. The trigger pull is incredibly clean because the trigger is actually an electronic switch. One 9-volt battery (not included) will reliably fire the rifle at least 500 times, and the battery will last up to 600 continuous hours (25 days). All Electras are equipped with a premium Bergara barrel for tack-driving accuracy. Includes a scope base and a Quake Claw Contour Sling. .50 caliber.

Ruger® SR-Series pistols are perfectly sized to be comfortable and controllable with slim, ergonomic grips and narrow slides. A short reach from the backstrap to the trigger creates a comfort level that will challenge any standard-sized, striker-fired pistol available today. The structurally rigid, recoil-reducing, glass-filled nylon frames and alloy or stainless steel slides combine to create low-maintenance, rugged and reliable handguns.
