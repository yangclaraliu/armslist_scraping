Looking to sell for $120. Works as a fast-attach muzzle device for ALL Surefire quick-detach suppressors. Comes with device and everything else:

1. Crush washers
2. Rock set
3. Instructions

*Description*

SureFire muzzle brakes and flash hiders deliver superior stand-alone performance, and also serve as adapter mounts for rock-solid attachment of our SOCOM Series Fast-Attach® sound suppressors. Precision machined from heat-treated US-mill-certified stainless steel bar stock, they are given an Ionbond DLC coating that provides maximum protection under harsh environmental conditions and facilitates cleaning even after extreme use. 

SureFire 3-prong flash hiders (flash suppressors), which feature robust tines to withstand the rigors of combat, typically result in an impressive 99% overall reduction in muzzle flash compared with a plain muzzle. 

SureFire 5.56 mm and 6.8 mm muzzle brakes provide greatly reduced recoil and feature offset porting that produces straight-back weapon movement. Our larger-caliber muzzle brakes provide greatly reduced recoil and neutral porting that loads bi-pod legs evenly. SureFire muzzle brakes and flash hiders can withstand extreme temperatures and gas/particle erosion from thousands of rounds of ammunition while enhancing the performance — and appearance — of your firearm. They are threaded to mate with the existing threads of many firearm models, or fitted to other firearms by properly threading and/or turning down the barrel."

Also included is a birch stock I cleaned up, which looks really slick with the short barrel. The trigger assembly is GI, with an H&R hammer and SA(NOT SAI) housing.  I have also upgraded the extractor to a USGI part for better reliability, as well as swapping the scout mount and handguard for a fiberglass GI handguard. The replaced parts will be included along with the factory box. 

I am looking for a full-length Standard or Loaded M1A w/ GI parts. Don't need any more ARs. If it doesn't go ""BANG"" and come in .308/7.62x51 I probably won't be interested. This means no body armor, Mini-14s, or pile of cheap guns. Geez, folks... It's not rocket science.

I recently upgraded to a different night vision optic on my coyote gun and no longer need this one.  This is a great optic with great night time visibility, I had no trouble seeing clearly over 100 yards on cloudy nights with this scope, It has a built in IR that helps clearly light up a target. As I said I had this mounted on my predator hunting rifle and recently upgraded, scope is like new no scratches or signs of wear at all, comes with original box, paperwork, lifetime warranty, and plug in rifle mounted remote (remote plugs into scope in order to save battery life scope can be turned on by the push of a button and remote also controls the IR as well)  asking $400 firm"

The Heckler and Koch 416 Pistol is a handgun version of the H&K 416, chambered in .22LR. This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the .22 416 rifle. Like the other .22 LR firearms offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22. The barrel measures 9 inches in length and its rails are machined. The 416’s pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 pistol are the same as the .22LR 416 rifles. They are made of high-strength polymer and designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. The estimated retail price for the 416 pistol is $459.

Operation

A blowback system operates the .22 caliber HK 416 Pistol. The dust cover functions and the bolt remains open when the magazine empties. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation and its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’."

It still has the bayonet lug. I just put a scope mount on it and took it the range, but its not my cup of tea (I'm more of an AR-15 guy). 

Its a beautiful rifle. This rifle has a hammer forged receiver rather than the cast Springfield M1A Receiver. They also have chrome lined barrels. These early Chinese rifles are the closest to USGI M14's. Also, these rifles are desired for builds because of the forged receiver and chrome lined barrel. 

The wooden stock was custom camo painted by the previous owner. The package could come with a sling, magazines, and case depending on the price/deal.

I would be interested in selling or trading for the right deal. I would prefer to sell it to finance another build I have in mind. 

Please let me know if you have any questions, I'll do my best to answer them."

A Pietro Beretta Mod A.300 – Cal.12
This is semiautomatic shotgun in 12ga. The shotgun is used and in good shape. The stock is plastic, receiver made of aluminum and barrel is stainless steel. I am pretty sure that this one was  made by Beretta in the early 1970's, made up into a finished gun by somebody in England (has an English stamp), and later imported to the USA as a used gun by John Appleton of Fairfax, VA (has that stamp too).  Its action is based on one of the most reliable and durable semiautomatic actions ever made. 
Parts for old A300's are available. Most parts from any of the 300 series will fit, including the more common AL-1, AL-2, A301, A302, and A303, as well as Browning B-80.
Shotgun comes with soft carry case in black.
I would like to set the price for this specimen at $330.00.

It has Williams Gun Sight adjustable fiber optic sights. Even though the pistol has had only light range use I had everthing refit to max out the pistols performance. All springs have been replaced in pistol and magazines. Reduced hammer spring to lighten the DA trigger pull, increased recoil spring to tame the felt recoil and limit wear and tear on the frame. and a 5% increase for all the new magazine springs to insure proper feeding. Friction points and feed ramp have been lightly polished. It also has a Houge/Ruger wrap around grip. Only very light scuffing can be found on the fiberglass filled urethane frame, everything else is 100%.

This pistol is very accurate and reliable... While it's a bit bulky it beats out most 1911s. Feeds anything very well, from 180 to 230 FMJ and HP, it seems to have no issues with even the widest mouth hollow points. It has a very smooth DA trigger pull with no creep that runs about 8lbs, the SA trigger breaks at roughly 3.5lbs with very little pre travel. The adjustable Williams Gunsight (of Davidson Mi) fiber optic sights catch just the right amount of light indoors or outdoor.

These SLR-96's are amazing rifles, this is the MB model which has a muzzle brake installed from the factory which cuts flash and felt recoil. Another thing to note is that these milled SLR-95's have a steyr hammer forged chrome lined barrel which makes this rifle easily the most accurate AK I have ever laid my hands on - 1.5in groups are not uncommon with cheap steel cased Wolf or Tula. Also I have installed a trijicon front tritium night sight and a Krebs rear peep sight.

This is the same rugged, reliable, handgun known in Israel as the Jericho 941. And you know the Israelis are serious about their firearms!  It features a polygonal barrel for less bullet deformation and better accuracy, fixed (Combat) sights, and decocking safety that drops the hammer to make firing system safe.

The pistol displays a high level of fit and finish. Barrel to slide fit and slide to frame fit is tight, but the slide functions smoothly.  All surfaces are finished in a subdued satin steel.  I found this Baby Eagle delivers the goods as advertised, offering good comfort and accuracy. There were no malfunctions of any type when firing any of the 4 included magazines.

I'm open to various states of complete-ness, from stripped to complete lower, especially if it has the Sig brace. Must have some sort of documentation that proves it was purchased as a pistol (original receipt).

Probably not going to be very interested in a complete AR pistol, unless you're letting it go for cheap, as I don't intend on making this a 5.56."
