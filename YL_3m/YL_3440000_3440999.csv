From the Remington website:

OVERVIEW:

Remington brought the hunting-rifle prowess, and a leading manufacturer of modular repeating rifles introduced us to the 308 Win platform. What emerged is a masterwork of game-dropping performance and hunt-specific features that will load any camp’s meat pole with unrivaled efficiency – the new Model R-25. An advanced, highly lethal blend of accuracy, fast followups and light recoil chambered for three of today’s most popular short-action hunting cartridges – 243 Win, 7mm-08 Remington and 308 Win. This rifle is everything varmint and predator hunters love about our R-15 in a beefed-up design that easily handles cartridges suitable for big-game hunting.

For peak accuracy, its precision-crafted 20"" ChroMoly barrel is freefloated within the machined aluminum fore-end tube. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block keep weight to a minimum and facilitate rapid heat dissipation. The barrel also features a recessed hunting crown to protect the rifling and aid in more consistent bullet flight. When it’s time to make the shot, the R-25’s ergonomic pistol-grip gives you unmatched control and rock-steady aim. As a whole, this rifle has a balanced, stable design that makes it deadly from the offhand position. True to our hunting market, the traditional two-stage trigger found on AR-platform rifles has been exchanged for a crisp, single-stage version that comes from the factory set at 4 1/2 to 5 lbs.

KEY FEATURES:

Semi-automatic AR-10-style rifle developed in conjunction with an industry leader in the category
Free-floated button-rifled 0.680"" Muzzle OD ChroMoly barrels with recessed hunting crown for superior accuracy
Fluted barrel design reduces weight and promotes rapid barrel cooling
Clean-breaking single-stage hunting trigger (factory set to 4.5-5lbs)
Receiver-length Picatinny rail for adding optics and accessories
Ergonomic pistol grip for rock solid aiming and control
Front and rear sling swivel studs
Includes 4-round magazine
Compatible with aftermarket DPMS 308 Win Magazine Boxes"

Colt Official Police MK III .38 Special revolver, pre-owned and in absolutely beautiful condition.  6"" barrel, 6-shot double/single action, manufactured in 1972.  The finish is deep blue and in excellent shape.  Only defect is a very minor spotting of rust on right side plate (3rd picture).  I'd call the finish 98%. Faint turn ring on cylinder.  Wood grips are pretty much flawless.  Very tight lock up.  Trigger in single action breaks crisply at 4.5 lbs with no overtravel whatsoever. 

Honestly it is a little difficult to price this as there don't seem to be many of the Mk IIIs sold recently.  There are a few out there in similar or worse condition asking in the $650+ area, so for now we're asking $625 OBO.

I have more pictures, let me know if you'd like me to send them to you.  Thanks for looking!

Winchester 534REDACTED Carbine Lever-Action .357 Mag Rifle, 20″ Barrel, Blued Finish, Walnut Stock

The Winchester® Model 1892 has been featured in many Western movies and was the favorite of John Wayne and Chuck Connors. It is considered by many as the smoothest, most compact, handiest and most handsome lever-action ever offered. The Model 1892 is the compact model of the venerable Model 1886. This exquisite rifle features a 20″ round, deeply-blued and polished barrel, receiver and lever. The full-length tubular magazine balances the rifle perfectly. The stock is solid walnut, cut in a straight grip style for fast handling.

Not many firearm models today can boast of having had over one million produced. The Winchester Model 1892, very similar in construction to the Winchester Model 1886, is one of these famous lever-action rifles. It is much like a compact or carbine model of the famous 1886 and has the same dual, vertical locking system for impressive strength. Many of its components have been scaled down and simplified to handle the smaller calibers, and here is where this nostalgic rifle shines. It is famous for its light weight, low recoil and responsive, easy handling. It displays a genius of design that makes it a modern-day treasure. The Winchester Model 1892 features a beautifully finished walnut stock, blued barrel and receiver, finely fit with precision and pride.

As the title states, I have a NIB, unfired Springfield Armory TRP. As you can tell from the pictures, it is the stainless version. The first picture is the Springfield website picture; the second picture is the actual pistol. The TRP comes with factory tritium sights and all the accessories you see in the picture. 

This is about as nice of a 1911 that you can buy anywhere near this price point. Search the internet for reviews; this 1911 is the one you want.

Also included is the ""Loaded"" coupon by which you can order factory Springfield Armory items at reduced rates.

-I am only interested in one trade: $1350 for this pistol. 
-No, I won't ""take $1200 cash today.""
-Not willing to drive very far to sell it.

If you don't know about VZ2008s, they are a copy of VZ58s which is a Czech design with a few differences being its NOT Full Auto and the barrel is slightly longer so its over 16ins. Its a milled receiver with a striker fire design and gas system similar to the SKS. The magazines have a Bolt-Hold Open feature and the bolt stays back once the magazine is empty. VZ58s are completely different from the AK family except for the caliber, 7.62x39. You can also load the magazine via stripper clips since the bolt has a notch which is really neat.

Serial number has it manufactured in 1943-44

I bought this a year ago with every intention of shooting clays and going hunting on a regular basis, but just haven't had the opportunity to do it as much as I'd like, and now I've got some excess medial expenses to pay off, so its gotta go. This gun was built right. Had it worked over by the gunsmith at Bullet Stop after I got it, and he said it was in top condition for its age. I've had it out 2-3 times, and have never had a failure. 

Adjustable spring loaded barrel assembly, holds 4+1. The forearm furniture was cracked when I purchased it, so I used a rubber compound to seal them up. Does not affect the shootability or stability of the gun.

THE LEGEND CONTINUES, the legendary performance and accuracy of the Swiss-built SG 550 tactical rifle is found in every SIG556 Classic. The Classic SWAT is a semi automatic rifle with the silhouette that harkens back to the original military-only 550 model. Featuring a full length gas piston operating system with a 2-position gas valve, the rifle will keep operating even when the environmental conditions deteriorate.

Available in 5.56 NATO, the Classic SWAT features a Swiss-type folding stock, as well as a aluminum quadrail forend that is ideally suited for mounting accessories. The Classic SWAT’s sleek profile and compact length is enhanced by a 16’’ barrel. SIG SAUER shaved a pound off the Classic model by incorporating the redesigned alloy trigger housing, AR style magazine and flash suppressor.

The SIG 556 Classic SWAT is available for law enforcement and responsible citizens. Obtaining a sight picture with the SIG556 SWAT model now takes place using a new rear rotary diopter sight, utilizing aperture calibrations from close quarter ranges out to 100m, 200m, and 300m.

- Adjustable Gas Block
- Original Price $400

Both uppers were used very little. I can count on one hand how many times they've been to the range. They have minor scratches from assembly and moving around in the safe, the top a little more so. 

The top one I'd prefer to sell as a complete unit. The bottom one I would consider parting out for the right price. 

I'm asking for $375 for each given condition and market value."
