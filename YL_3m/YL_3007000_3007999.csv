This house for large dogs was built for 2 Newfoundlands (beautiful dogs but like bulls in a china shop, highly destructive) who definitely put it through the wringer.  The “swinging door” allows only one large dog at a time to pass, and the peep holes allow the resident to snoop without having to go outside.  The house exterior measures 4’ wide x 4’ deep, and could easily sleep three very large occupants.  The fully “vaulted” interior ceiling allows for plenty of headroom.  The roof is rolled asphalt covered.  The floor platform is built on two green-treated 4x4’s with taper-cut ends to allow for “skidding” the house around to different locations, but presently has no hardware mounted for towing.  The 4x4 skid beams protrude out far enough that four men could easily lift the house into the bed of a pick up truck.

I am asking $150 cash for the dog house.  It is definitely well-built and rugged, and will hold up to the roughest of dogs guaranteed."

Noveske stainless barrels are made to fill a precision role while retaining flawless function. Retaining accuracy and reliability is a complicated balance in that the chamber needs to be slightly modified from the NATO to improve bullet hook-up in the throat, while keeping to functional properties of the NATO body dimensions. The result is Noveske proprietary chambering. The steel used is a type of 416r and hardened to about 30 HRC prior to any machining. These barrels are button rifled with Noveske proprietary 7 PT button. This rifling profile differs from that in the chrome lined barrel line in that the lands have a slightly more trapezoidal shape. This design and the type of stainless used helps the lead edge of the rifling from eroding as fast as it might with conventional rifling, and the barrels tend to outlast others.



For use in any precision application, we recommend the stainless barrel for its edge in accuracy and excellent reliability."

Manufacturer: Dan Wesson (CZ-USA)

Model: 715

Caliber: .357 Magnum/.38 Special

Capacity: 6 Round Cylinder

Barrel: 6"" Heavy with Ventilated Rib

These are NEW for 2014 limited run, Pre-Production 715 revolvers from Dan Wesson



Returning to regular production late summer 2014, the 715 is as it was before -- designed and built to be the most accurate, rugged and versatile revolver on the market. Shipped with a 6"" barrel, the new shroud is designated the HV6, a heavy vent shroud profile that tames the .357's recoil very well.

The double action trigger is short and relatively light, while the single action is light and crisp. The target-like SA trigger pull made the Dan Wesson revolver a favorite among competitors and hunters, and the tradition continues in the 715.

Barrel assemblies and grips are easily swapped by the shooter, and the 715 accepts grips and barrel/shroud assemblies from 15-2 model and newer revolver"

Remington is proud to announce the Model 700 SPS (Special Purpose Synthetic) Tactical 300 Blackout rifle. Chambered for the incredibly popular 300 AAC® Blackout®, this new rifle features the time-proven Model 700 action and is designed to impress from the bench or in the field at a very affordable price. A long-time favorite of both military and police units, the Model 700 offers the legendary accuracy and unfailing performance you’ve come to expect.

At the core of the Model 700 SPS Tactical 300 Blackout is the machined solid-steel, cylindrical Model 700 receiver design ensuring uniformity, strength and solid bedding area. Unique to this precision rifle is the 16 ½ -inch, heavy-contour clean barrel threaded to accept AAC and all 5/8 x 24 threaded flash hiders, muzzle breaks and suppressors. The tactical-style carbon steel, hammer-forged barrel is the perfect balance between handling in tight spots and delivering pinpoint accuracy. With a twist rate of one in seven inches, this rifle is optimized for accuracy. These specialty, bolt-action rifles are shipped with a thread protector installed.

The rock-solid barreled action is bedded in a Hogue® OverMolded® Ghillie™ Green pillar bedded, synthetic stock with a semi-beavertail fore-end for added stability. The soft-touch, sure-grip stock is extremely comfortable for extended, long range shooting and assures a positive grip in both stressful situations and inclement weather. The dual point pillar bedding guarantees a solid interface between the action and stock to help insure cold bore accuracy and prevent point-of-impact shifts. Add Remington’s X-Mark Pro® externally adjustable trigger, designed to “break-like-glass” and set at 3 ½ pounds from the factory, and this rifle delivers surgical-like accuracy.

Other key features include a drilled and tapped receiver for the addition of optics; distinctive, laser-engraved “300 AAC Blackout 1:7” roll mark; convenient hinged floorplate magazine with 4-round capacity and a non-reflective, black oxide external metal finish; and sling swivel studs.

The Model 700 SPS Tactical 300 Blackout is the perfect tactical bolt-action rifle and available at a very affordable price. Suggested retail price is $817.31.

Asking $1300.00 or a partial trade, atleast $700.00 cash and maybe rifle, pistol, trap/skeet gun, gear, hay or Something worth at least $700.00 to me. Text is best. 5449639

It was cut down from a longer barreled gun. The barrel is 20-inches and is now a CYL bore.

This gun was indeed born in 1943 (SN 647xx). The important things to look for on old Ithacas like this... the serial number on the barrel and receiver match. There is no pitting in the barrel. Only the slightest crack in the stock at the wrist (its not all busted up), the butt end of the stock is also well intact. The gun has been around for 71-years and has been used, both the wood and the metal show wear. The gun functions flawlessly (slam fires – if that's your thing) and is just a neat old gun. It would make a wonderful and inexpensive addition to someone's WWII collection."

The rifle was built in early Feb., and I cannot find the time to shoot nor maintain another ar15.  Hoping to find a good home for this rifle.
Original intent was to use in 3-gun, but with a recent life-changing event I will not have time for such things.
Rifle details:
manta forged lower
spikes tactical lower kit
magpul grip
magpul stock
magpul ASAP single point sling adapter
magpul sights
troy alpah rails
CBI barrel, 18"" .223 wylde chamber (will handle 5.56)
A2 flash hider
Nickle boron bolt carrier group

This rifle was inspected, headspace checked and test fired by a well known gunsmith in late Feb.  I can provide the receipt for that inspection if requested.

This rifle begs to be shot.  I wish I had the time, but it has not been shot since the inspection in Feb.  All it needs is a sling and some glass.

All top rails are numbered.  I have all the Troy accessories (long and short rails), as well as some small spare parts (extra grip, trigger guard, etc).

Blue loctite has been applied to magpul sight mounting threads.  

I have other goodies I can include to help the sale along.  If you are unfamiliar with the brands and parts, take some time to do some research, all information is available through any search engine.

I would prefer to deal with NC residents, but am willing to sell out of state if buyer covers all shipping + FFL transfer fees associated (all local laws apply).

Other helpful information for helpful for me:
1. Are you a member of the NRA?
2. Do you have a concealed carry permit?
3. Have you read the constitution AND the federalist papers?

Above are not required, but such things can only help expedite the sale.

I am willing to trade for quality products (aimpoint for example), but I need at least 600 in cash to cover other things, so if you have a product with value to cover $600 then add the cash we can see what we can do.

This optic does not use batteries and has no electronics, making it a very good choice for a SHTF rifle, which is essentially why I bought it. Instead of batteries, this optic utilizes advanced fiber optics which only require small amounts of light to produce a very easy to see amber dot. This bad boy is 100% good to go, I've just decided to go in a different direction with my build as I recently came into a very good deal on another rifle that already had a similar optic.

This optic while not BNIB, has been used pretty lightly, it's mostly just sat in my safe on my rifle, besides the occasional trip to the range. It does come with a box and everything that a new one would come with.

I'm looking for cash, but I would like to trade this plus cash for a 5.56 ACOG. I would also consider trading it for a R700, a stainless 1911, a Ruger Blackhawk, a Glock, or I would add cash for a Saiga 12.

The picture is of the same type of optic, but not the actual item. I will try to update the listing with actual pictures tonight. Thanks for looking!

Factory Info:
This is a brand new Primary Weapon Systems AR-15 rifle upper with a high performance .223 Wylde chamber. .223 Wylde is a proprietary rifle cartridge chamber with the same external dimensions and lead angle as found in the the military 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and the 0.2240 inch freeborn diameter as found in the civilian SAAMI .223 Remington cartridge. The .223 Wylde hybrid chamber was designed to exploit the accuracy advantages of the .223 Remington chambering without pressure problems or compromising the functional reliability of semi automatic weapons like the AR-15 family when using 5.56×45mm NATO military ammunition.

The shortest of the non-NFA models with a removable muzzle device, the PWS MK116 Rifle is a crowd favorite. The MK116 is designed for a multitude of uses and retains lethal capability out to 500 meters with varying types of ammunition and boasts a PWS FSC556 muzzle device. The 16"" barrel features a versatile 1:8"" twist rate, offering stabilization of the widest ranges of bullet weights available.

Understanding the importance of an ultra-reliable package that is light as possible, mil-spec forgings are used for the upper and lower receiver.

The MK116 utilizes a proven mid length DI operation system. The operating system with a gas block and free-floated barrel. The handguard features the VLTOR KeyMod System which comes standard with two 2 sections of 1913 rail as well as a continuous 1913 top rail.

Very nice older rifle made by Savage Stevens Springfield  One of an older series often called a ""gill gun"" for the cut-outs on the left side of the receiver.  These guns have a distinctive action, they tell me is not unlike an AR, where the bolt doesn't close until the trigger is released.  It's interesting and neat.  I really like the gun and enjoy shooting it.
