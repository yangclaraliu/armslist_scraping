Original owner. Very few rounds shot. 
My New Years resolution is to sell items that I never use to get items that I will use more often. A model 70 30.06 is the rifle Carlos Hathcock used to make some of his famous shots.
Currently has a 4-16x40 scope on it that holds zero great even though it was not very expensive. For the right price, the scope may be switched out for a Leupold VX-3 3.5-10x.
Comes with the 4-16x scope, bipod, and sling. Also original tag, owner's manual, and paperwork.
May also sell some ammo along with the rifle if you wish to purchase some."

TIS quick -Cuff sling

Starlight double rifle case, with wheels.  Basically new with uncut foam.

 I am second owner of gun, so exact round count is unknown.  I have had it for 6 years or so and used it as occasional plinker and back up (to it's twin brother) deer rifle. I have put less than 200 rounds through it and prior owner claimed less than 100.  It is a sub-MOA gun with factory FGMM 168gr and holds about half inch groups at 100 yards with my favorite mild shooting hunting hand loads (see 3 shot ""GK"" group in last pic). Perfect entry package for serious long range shooting as it will out-shoot 99% of shooters.  Everything in very excellent condition, babied and stored in temp/humidity controlled environment.       

Some folks have asked about splitting package.  Options-

1) keeping the Starlight case if you don't want it

2) maybe selling barreled action, bolt and trigger of gun only ($700 firm) as I can use other parts for other projects.

3) Gun only - $800

4) Gun plus base -$850

5) Gun plus base and Rings - $925

6) Add bipod to options 2 through 5 for $50

$1850 for the package or $1750 without the case. 

FTF Wheaton/Glen Ellyn or where it works for both of us.   

FOID blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada..........

Lots of tire-kickers on this.  To save time- I'm not broke, desperate, unemployed or upside down on my mortgage.  I'm a nice guy but unless you are related to me or a good friend- I'm not giving it away.

Only trade interests I have are-

Quality 1911 in .38 Super, no collectors or commemorative stuff. 

Smith and Wesson 625, 4"" barrel, no lock 

Cash can go either way depending on how much of LTR package you want.

Thanks for looking!"

Love this gun, feels fantastic but I have other projects going and the 5.7x28 just doesn't do it for me. Rifle has had 140rds fired, I know this for certain because I bought 500rds when I got the gun and have 360 left. It is immaculate. Comes with original box and paperwork, (5) 50rd magazines, 360rds of Federal 5.7x28 and Barrel shroud (it's tacticool) And NC Star Laser/red dot. $1600+ in it, asking $1500 OBO, I can break down everything in price if you so desire. I will consider trades but more interested in cash. Located in Cortland. Thanks for looking.

This is nice clean ammo and has been been properly stored in a climatically controlled safe for all those years, appears to have been properly stored since it was manufactured.  Details: 250 rounds of authentic FN factory made brass case, non corrosive Berdan primers, steel core/black tip 164 gr FMJ ammo, it is marked  FN 64 thru 67, and it comes in a plastic bag inside of a USGI 30 cal ammo can with the importer's info label describing the ammo. I bought this ammo in the mid 80s to shoot in my M-1 Garands but I stashed it instead and never shot any of it. This is high quality Milspec ammo made by one of the giants of the arms industry and was made for M1 Garands, BARs, the Browning family of .30 Cal machine guns, and all the other Military guns of the era chambered in .30-06; it is the real deal. It is also rare; I see no other FN made AP/Black Tip ammo like this online; I do see similar surplus black tip ammo online for almost $2 per round, before shipping cost. I am in Southern Maryland and am willing to drive as far north as Upper Marlboro to meet buyer for a FTF cash and carry deal in a public setting during daylight hours; buyer must be a US citizen or active duty military stationed in MD and least 21 years of age and not prohibited from possessing or purchasing ammo or firearms.  I am willing to ship where this ammo is legal but this is heavy, buyer pays shipping. Not interested in trades of any sort. I have not counted each and every round in the can, but the ammo can is clearly labeled 250 rds and the can is full. I have more pictures at my auction at Gunbroker, auction number 464802259."

I paid over 150 for both of these not including shipping. 

My price is $120 I have had these for only one month with very light use. I am only selling them because I bought a full size upper and no longer need this brace.

I just rec'd this this afternoon, but it looks like the fit is going to be a little tight for my intended purpose. I was planning on laying it out to hold a semi-auto, over/under, and subgauge tube set, it looks like i might be able to make it work, but the fit would be very tight with no room for accessories, and would require a complicated layout. Probably easiest to just stick with my Americase for my o/u, and come up with another solution for my auto.

Needs new bottom foam (available from ebay, or most craft stores), top foam is perfect. A couple VERY tiny marks on the exterior. Other than the foam and the couple marks, it is basically brand new.

There are a few superficial scratches on the stock but no dings, dents, divets or anything that couldn't be refinished if one so desired. It comes with a Leupold VX-II 2-7x33mm scope in matte black exterior with Leupold dot crosshairs and Butler Creek flip-up scope covers, all secured by 1"" Weaver mounts.

In 2008 representatives of the Antiques Roadshow visited Daytona Beach and shed some light on this artifact. The sword has a remarkable nickel scabbard signifying it was for a Sir Knight. The black handle, which still has the original chain attached, states the owner wasnt an officer.  No one has been able to shed light or information on the acid etching on the blade which leads me to believe it was an uncommon etching used by Ames in the narrow window of time before being bought by Henderson.

My mother purchased the sword for me 25 years ago at an antique gallery. While it has been extremely well cared for, it does, as to be expected, have a few cosmetic blemishes. The blade has some minor nicks, but the etching is still very vibrant. The scabbards nickel plating is outstanding with only light surface marks. It appears not a single scratch is deep enough to scar the scabbard. To my untrained eye it seems to be as good as it gets for its age! The black wooden handle has the most wear with a shallow chip smaller then a dime as well as some minor general wearing of the black paint, most noticeably on the backside opposite the emblem of the cross. 
Again, I'm no expert but those who judged my sword said it's 100% together. It isn't even missing a screw and has the original chain connecting the knights head to the cross on the hilt. I could describe it all day but I will let the pictures talk and can elaborate more if you have any questions. 
This sword is in superior condition compared to all other examples I came across while researching it. 
Placing it's age within a 10 year window is remarkable. 
I'll be sad to hand it over but really wish it goes to someone who can appreciate it more then I can. No one in my family is a Mason so I'd be super happy if it ends up belonging to someone within the order.

Magazine holds six 2 3/4"" twelve gauge shells and barrel is threaded to accept a variety of screw on chokes for various applications.  There are no screw on chokes included with this gun.

As you know only 180 or so of  these ""evil looking"" shotguns were imported in the 1980s before being banned.  Enough said !



Please be sure this gun is legal to own where you live.  If you buy it and I ship it to your receiving FFL dealer and it is not legal for you to own, your receiving FFL dealer just got a free gun.

I absolutely love this rifle, however the charging handle no longer works. The rifle fired flawlessly and is fun to shoot, the handle just went dead while I was shooting it last. I highly suspect the charging lever support needs to be replaced and the spring that goes in with it. I put this ad on here for grins and giggles to see if someone wanted a project gun. If I repair it I am going to just keep it because of how fun it is shooting a semiauto .308 rifle. Where this rifle has some weight to it, the .308 hardly kicks. The rifle comes with two steel 20rd magazines and 5 aluminum HK G3 20rd magazines as well as 40rds of fmj and a handful of remington corelokt ammo. Must have VA Driver's License and a valid CCW. I have bills of sale for us to fill out as well. Price is absolutely firm at $450cash and the only trade I would be interested in would be a nice AR15 complete upper in 5.56.  Thanks for reading!"

The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward."

Let's face it...when was the last time you saw one of these that was a complete and original set come up for sale?

It's a M2 Flare Pistol Aviators Set consisting of the rather massive and super heavy duty US M2 flare pistol (made by International Flare & Signal Company), carry case that holds the flare pistol and it's ammo supply which are 5 absolutely massive MK1 ""One Minute"" parachute flares. That's right 1 Minute parachutes!! To the best of my knowledge nothing else that is hand held rivals the sheer size and burn duration of these shells. They are monsters and each one weighs over 2 pounds! They are sealed on top and the primers are sealed as well. So while I can't guarantee it - I do think these big boys would fire if you decided to do that. Although you'd certainly need to pick your place well as you might have every emergency responder in the area show up if you don't. 

The flares were made by Kilgore and they are dated 1950. They are consecutively serial numbered so they are an issued matching set. This flare gun outfit might have seen military use or it could have been issued to a commercial flight crew. One thing for sure is that these were in service as the Cold War was heating up.

The pistol, case and the flare cartridges are all in great shape. The carry case has the original nylon carry handle in place, but it is missing the small strap that secures the pistol to the case.

Bottom line is that this is a heck of a find for all those who collect flare guns and related. Give it some consideration as it may be a long time before you'd ever find another.

Thanks for looking.

Price is $575.00 with pickup in the Brandon area or I would consider shipping to the lower 48 where legal at the buyers expense. This set is heavy weighing in at over 20 pounds so shipping could be as much as $30 and possibly a little more depending on your location."

All of this ammo was produced at Novosibirsk Low Voltage Equipment plant (LVE) which is where all of their highest quality ammo is produced. All ammo made at LVE bears the head stamp ""188"" and the year of production. 

LVE is recognized world wide for their superior quality ammunition. Their Match and Sniper ammunition uses special powders, primers and bullets. Plus much more care is taken producing it. The results speak for them self and you'll be shocked by just how much more accurate this high quality ammo really is. 

Some and quite possibly all of this ammo would be hard to get today and I feel sure that you'd spend more by trying to obtain it from different sources even if you could find it.

Included: (2) still sealed 25 round boxes 182 grain Match Ammo from 1965 - head stamp 188-65. This is loaded in beautiful brass cases with match grade powder, bullets, and primers.

(2) 20 round bundles of 7N1 ammo loaded in annealed copper washed steel cases with a special 152 grain boat tail bullet. Bullet has a steel core followed by a dead air space with a lead knocker in the base. When bullet hits it's target the lead knocker shifts forward destabilizing the bullet resulting in a devastating wound. This ammo was specifically designed for Russian Sniper use with the Dragunov, but it's excellent for Mosins too. Head stamp 188-97.

(2) 20 round boxes 182 grain Extra Match (blue box) ammo from 1971. Ammo is loaded in brass cases with match powder and match grade bullets. It's extremely accurate and has won many matches over the years. Head stamp is 188-71.

(2) 20 round boxes LVE 200 grain Extra Match. This is very hard to find and offers superior accuracy - especially at  ranges over 300 meters. With the 200 grain bullet it's also the hardest hitting 54R available. Head stamp is LVE 10. Many consider this particular ammo as the most accurate production ammunition in the world.

All of this ammo has been stored properly and is in excellent condition. It's all sure to fire and is surprisingly accurate. Again it's becoming increasing difficult to find all of this ammo. The supply of many of these has been exhausted or is no longer being imported.

This is a great assortment of the most accurate Russian 7.62x54R ammo ever made and it'll give you an opportunity to see just what your old Mosin is really capable of.

$160.00 picked up in the Brandon area. Buyer must be at least 18 years old."

I have also added a Magpul rail to the forend to hold a light or laser. Also included are 3 ESSTAC velcro sidesaddles, it works waaay better than any hardmounted sidesaddle, and you don't have to take bolts out to dissassemble the gun for cleaning.
