This considered one of if not the best upper receiver on the market. Vltor CNC-Machines the 7075 Aluminum Forging only after it has been fully stress relieved, and then heat- and cryogenically treated. Each upper is finished by hand and all critical dimensions inspected, and finally given a protective Type III, Class 2 Hard Anodized Finish. It is more rigid and stout then a standard forged upper and being forged it is stronger and more durable then billet receivers. This is perfect for a precision build, hard use build, or for anyone who wants the best of the best. Additionally the forward assist being located further forward makes manipulating an ambi charging handle much easier then standard uppers. The upper has slight anodizing wear were the cam pin indexes and were the charging handle meets this upper which occurs on all upper receivers and is merely cosmetic. This was from mounting it on an upper and cycling a bolt by hand when I first received the upper. It's never had a a barrel or rail installed and the only time it has left the box was the above mentioned time.  Retail is $180 I'm selling for $160.

 It is unissued (new) and includes the original factory issue bayonet. This rifle was made in 1955 and released from ROF as surplus sometime in the late 80's or early 90's. Serial number is A19246.

This is a very rare and great example of this model and type. It was manufactured in 1955 and placed in storage its entire life, up until it was imported by Century Arms International, St Albans, VT (C.A.I) .

This rifle was purchased by my next door neighbor in the 90’s and was wrapped in protective arsenal paper and covered in cosmoline for total protection of all metal parts. He unwrapped it not long after purchasing it and cleaned most of it off. I can still see a small amount on the front sight and blade.

 The bore of the 25” barrel is mint, shiny and in as new unfired and excellent condition.

The black finish is just as it was when packed up in 1955 and the rifle is about as nice as you could find considering that it is a Battle Gun and in the manufacturing process was not handled with the care when it was transferred from station to station. Compared to what someone would expect from the handling of a fine precision rifle.

 The stock is of a lighter wood and shows very nicely. Any bumps or scratches can be viewed in the photos provided in the attached link.

 The over all rifle length is 44 ¾”.

The rifle comes complete with the original bayonet and scabbard which is very sharp. (so care should be taken when handling)

 Finally, the serial numbers on the Receiver, Magazine, Bolt and Wood all match A19XXX.

I have two Bulgarian pre ban 30 round magazines for it. The rifle started out as a single stack with a sporter stock. I had Dave Santurri, a gunsmith in North Attleboro, open up the receiver to accept double stack mags, and used the Bulgarian magazines as a template so they fit perfectly with no wobble. The rifle also has a double stack bolt even though it was a single stack gun. That is how it was imported and is a nice bonus.  I put a set of unissued Soviet laminate wood furniture on it, which is almost impossible to find anymore. Since the gun was imported in a sporting configuration it is 100% Bulgarian and is not pieced together from foreign and US parts. I had to replace a few Bulgarian parts with US parts for 922r compliance since it was no longer in a sporting configuration.  I replaced the trigger with a double hook Tapco G2, it has a Tapco slant muzzle brake and is pinned for Mass. compliance, and the magazines have US made followers and floorplates. All the numbers match and it has a chromed barrel and a chromed bolt carrier. It also has the thicker 1.6mm receiver compared to a normal AK which is 1mm.  Between the price of the rifle, the parts, and the gunsmith charge I have over $1000 in this rifle.  The wood furniture by itself is worth $200."

The rear take down pin pocket is already milled which is one of the most difficult areas to mill, this is often called a 95% lower by manufactures. The Jig was purchased new and has been used once and is still completely in spec and comes with three top plates as well as a link to the jig manufactures PDF instructions. One of the top plates has dye on it that was used to ensure the mill didn't make contact with the jig. The jig also has an area milled out to allow the lower to be milled for the teal blue bravo pdq ambi bolt release. The jig features a hardened steel guide pressed in to drill out  the selector switch. Also included is two brand new never used solid carbide extra long shank end mill bits in 1/4"" and 3/8"". The increased shank allows the user to simply butt up against the top plate, so constant measuring and rechecking isn't necessary. I no longer have access to a mill or drill press so I'm letting theses go. This is essentially a turn key kit for finishing an %80 lower all that is needed is standard size drill bits for the trigger pins and selector. This $250 worth of parts I'm asking $180."

The package has been opened but that was just to inspect the coating. This full auto rated, has VDI's life coat coating, and is %20 lighter then mil spec bcg. The reduction in weight decreases the reciprocal mass which in turn reduces felt recoil of the rifle. This is for the complete bcg and everything has been coated with the life coat including the bolt, cam pin, and firing pin. VDI doesn't give specifics about life coat but I can tell you it is very slick which means easier cleaning and less lube. It also has increased corrosion resistance. VDI bcg comes with a lifetime warranty. Retail is $250 but they can be found for $230 so I'm asking for $175."

It is a Pro Series edition with a pinned ramp with night sight, a crowned muzzle, fluted barrel, bead blast finish over stainless steel and I had a custom Apex trigger spring job done to make the trigger a little lighter and smoother.  The gun was purchased for $675 plus tax, and the trigger job cost $60 with parts.  The gun has only 100 rounds thru the pipe.  A 3"" barrel is midway between a 2"" snub nose and a 4"" service revolver, but the ballistics are much closer to the 4"" barrel.  A +P round OSS all you need because 357 magnum from a 3"" barrel barely provides improved ballistics and gives fierce recoil, the +P round gives plenty.  I find it hard to part with this revolver because the 38 chambering is so rare.  My loss is your gain.  No trades or low ball offers."

I don't own any .380 weapons. I simply want to trade this for a box of 9mm. Tulammo would be perfectly fine (or any brand you have). My guns aren't picky at all. You have to be near by to make it worth while trading. I'm off e. union valley rd. in Seymour.

This is a really solid tactical scope, I'm just looking for a bit of a higher end scope.  This would be an excellent scope for any sort of tactical rifle bolt or gas gun.  I had it mounted on my long range AR for awhile and it worked really well.  It has really good glass in it for the price point, I can see hits on steel at 1000 yards easily.  It also tracks really well, overall at this price point this is an excellent scope."

Each rifle has been manufactured using state of the art technology, effectively creating a heavier duty piece that will last through not just a lifetime but for many generations to come. The RPK-style barrels are hammer forged and chrome linedusing techniques that make them four to five times stronger than a standard AK or RPK barrel.

As most know, being a low number rifle, it is not recommended to be shot- I personally have not fired it. It is however a very nice example of a USMC WWII M1903 rebuild, and a nice addition to a WWII collection. The stock was added to the rifle by me, as it was more appropriate than the 03A3 Scant Stock it was in. There is some pitting on the right side below the wood line which the USMC parked over. The butt plate is rougher and well used."
