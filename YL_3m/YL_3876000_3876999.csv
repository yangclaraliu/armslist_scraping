4)  Marksman Model 740 .177 caliber, Torrance.  Cocks, pops, but you have to hold the trigger forward; it will break on its own when you let go.
5)  1960's Daisy 99 Champion cork gun.  I disassembled it to fix the trigger group, but I can't figure out how to make the trigger catch.  It might be missing a spring?  Other than that, it seems to work.  Worth about $80 in parts on eBay.

Gun comes with a Milt Sparks Versa Max 2 and inside the waistband mag carrier. The leather alone was almost $200. The holster looks like it has been worn every day for the last year...because it has.

Makarov pistol is acknowledged to be one of the best 20th century pistols in the world, along side with Browning, Walter, Beretta, and Astra. Mak’s serial production has been going on for over 50 years on mechanical factory in the city of Izhevsk, Russia.

During that time, entire family of weapons were derived from Makarov. They are gas, pneumatic and models made specifically for export. They all have wide spectrum of application that vary from military, law enforcement and secret service down to sporting and casual practice shooting.

Makarov is currently the only pistol in the world that successfully passes so called “combined conditions” testing. That test consists of field trials in dirt, rain, snow. Combination of qualities such as size, weight, magazine capacity, barrel energy, recoil and cost makes Makarov a leader amongst majority of handguns available on the market even today.

Izhevsk factory produces three export caliber flavors: 9x18 Makarov, 9x17 Kurtz, 9x19 Parabellum. All modifications of pistols can have either fixed or adjustable sights. Magazine capacities are 8 or 12 rounds for 9x17 and 9x18, and 8 for 9x19. These models come in two possible finishes - oxidated and nickel-plated. There is also a .380 ACP version of Makarov which is very rare and was supposedly never shipped to the states. 

There is also a .380-ACP version of Makarov that is exclusively sold by ""B-West"" company. 
Mine is a ""B-West"" edition and stamped as such. Also. it has the adjustable sights.

The one I am selling is the .380 ACP oxidated and Blued (made in Russia). It fires both 9x17 and .380 Ammo. It has the larger non-slip rubberized grips and the 19 lb. recoil spring for better accuracy when using 9x17 kurtz ammunition.

I have used up to 115 grain ammunition in this pistol since I put the 19lb. recoil spring in it without any issues, and they make a .380 round that has a 17 inch penetration depth, so if you think that it will not get the job done, you are ""DEAD"" wrong!"

Now for the go kart:
22 year old replica of Neil Bonnett's KFC NASCAR racecar. Sat in a shed for 22 years never started had oil or gas in it until yesterday and started right up. This go kart was won in a KFC give away by my late Grandfather-in-law and to my knowledge is one of a kind. It is super lightweight and has a 3hp 127cc engine on it. A little history on the driver, Neil Bonnett, he died in a wreck during the Daytona 500. He is the 35th all time NASCAR race winner. Now im not sure of the exact value of this kart but ive seen karts of the same size and engine but were valvoline that were NOT one of a kind selling for $2000 but im going to estimate the value of this kart at $1200.

The P227 was purchased in March of 2014. 300-400 Rounds have been through it so it hasn't even been broken in yet.
PRICE : $1,100. Price is firm considering the extras and the taxes you'll be saving.
Will sell only to individuals who have CCW, or to those who pay for a FFL transfer. 
Will Trade For : Walther PPQ. I'm selling this gun for a new/slightly used PPQ M1 or M2, preferably with night sights. You can throw out other trades but I'll most likely say no.

There is also a small amount of surface rust on the barrel right below the scope bell. This could be removed with removal of the scope.

Spikes lower- has the receiver plug with QD sling swivel and a sling I made. It shoots well with the strap. Just push it tight, and rest your cheek on the strap. Since it is a dedicated 22lr, it requires no buffer tube. Obviously, you can install a pistol buffer tube, or even make a rifle in whatever caliber you like. I may even have a buffer assembly and a carbine stock I can include. It includes a CMMG 22 conversion and (6) 25 rd mags. I am not currently interested in splitting it up.

General Info Below:

We just built upon the years of research and improved upon the already great RUC platform. We are so excited to introduce to you our new RUC MOD 2. When we first introduced our original RUC, our focus was to develop a rifle that integrated a lightweight design while using the highest quality components. What we created was a high performance AR15 that took the market by storm. Introduced on the rifle was our ambidextrous charging handle, the Raptor as well as an ambi safety selector set up. The RUC MOD 2 has slimmed down from it's predecessor and now weighs in at 6 lbs and 1 oz. It features our new Rainier Arms Force Rail 15"". We also redesigned our new Rainier Arms Compensator (RAC) which offers enhanced recoil management and almost fully eliminates muzzle rise. We needed a heavy duty barrel and we achieved it. Introducing our Mountain Series barrels. They are CHF Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel 5.56mm Nato barrels - the toughest out there, period. All materials used are of industry-leading standards, each weapon carefully and meticulously assembled with a limited lifetime warranty.

Any emails without name/phone number will be unanswered

This is part of an estate sale. This was unboxed, but never used. It is in brand new condition & includes all on the original box, packing, etc. These are built to last many decades even with continuous daily use.

All the details are below.

THE HW-16.5 HAVE BEEN IN PRODUCTION FOR 30 YEARS.

The HW-16.5 is the standard in affordable record cleaning machines but neither its build quality nor its cleaning power has been compromised. Its high-torque, 18 RPM turntable motor is more than capable of withstanding the pressure of heavy scrubbing during extended cleaning sessions, and its 35-second cleaning cycle per side makes quick work of even the dirtiest records. Now with self aligning vacuum suction tubes for even more accurate cleaning, the HW-16.5's high-powered vacuum ensures quick, deep cleaning. The newly designed vacuum pickup tube automatically adjusts to accommodate records of any thickness. The internal fluid collection system is made of stainless steel to prevent corrosion, and the fully enclosed design prevents splashing. In the VPI tradition, all components are extra heavy-duty and professional grade.

""I have found the HW-16.5 to be an outstanding performer. The record surfaces are microscopically clean and are so pristine they look new!"" -- Bert Whyte, Audio Magazine

Selling my XP. I build varmint rifles out of them, but this one is too nice to break up.  The 223 is pretty rare.  I have fired 5 shots through it to test accuracy and it shoot very well (black hills 50gr Vmax). The cheapest one I have found online was $950 on gunsamerica.com, so I'll beat it by $100. call/text tyler @ REDACTED or email.

ALL Chinese parts have been replaced with US GI parts !!!

It has a 21” after-market National Match (NM) Barrel with a NM front blade sight, a NM hooded aperture (peep) rear sight with ½ minute adjustments. The wooden stock is in good condition and has been modified with fiberglass reinforcing and a “multi-cam” finish, with a modified fore-end fitted with a short section of picatinny rail in front of the stud swivel. 

The stock also features the classic butt stock cleaning kit space (kit not included) with swing-up shoulder plate. There are some slight dings and mars to the camo finish on the stock but it is in good serviceable condition. The bore is clean with no visible corrosion or blemishes, the rifling is shiny and well grooved. 

NOTE:  The Chinese parts inherent in many later Fed Ord models have been replaced with GI gear, with the exception of the bolt only - which was US made anyway.

The action has some machine imperfections and slight wear on the bolt channel but this is standard on many pieces and does not in the least way effect shot precision or function. Overall it is a great and highly accurate shooter with the exceptional trigger break expected from a good condition M1A. I have four (4) 20 rd magazines, two (2) 30 rd magazines and one (1) 5 rd magazine (for hunting). 

I also have a spare modified ""project"" stock and a parts kit containing: (1) connector lock pin, a magazine catch pin, a gas cylinder plug, an Op Rod spring guide, an extractor spring w/plunger, a safety spring, and a gas cylinder lock (milled, USGI).

Barrel is coming off an Arsenal Democracy rifle pictured in the link above. Incredible rifle and barrel, just deciding to go a little longer and selling to fund. Barrel is cerakoted black and has less than 1,500rds down it with the vast majority being 77gr match stuff. That's a drop in the bucket for this barrel's life so don't give me grief about the round count. It's a same hole barrel with premium ammo. It was NEVER pinned and welded as you might assume because of its length and will come bare without gasblock or muzzle device. 

No pictures at this time because the rifle is still assembled and will be until barrel is purchased.

Box with manual and accessories.  The only folding <17"" carbine that accepts glock mags available on the market.  Only weights 4lb and fits in almost any bag.  If you do your part it will hold a 3"" group at 100' and hits with the same energy as a .357 mag at that distance as 9mm has excellent ballistics with longer barrels.

It had an issue with a failure to reset the trigger that kept it from use so it sat on my shelf for years.  Just completed a full teardown and re-assembly with a brand new safety, spring, detent, and o-ring to correct the out of spec safety that came from the factory.  Trigger is now half-decent too after a little oil.  Fully function checked and better than new.

Comes with the KelTec butt extension for much better LOP and a better interface with the shoulder.  Also a polymer cover for the awful stock charging handle which would injure even though gloves.  And a 'tacticool' cheek weld pad for purely comfort reasons as the buffer tube got hot real fast.

Generic 17 (1x) and 33rd (1x) mags included loaded with 115gr ball ammo.

No low-balls price is firm.  Go check gunbroker and then contact me and skip a FFL transfer fee and shipping.  North Phoenix FTF.  Willing to ship through FFL whatever they charge you pay.  If face to face, I will request to see a AZ Drivers License to prove local residence and will look you in the eye and ask if you are a felon or otherwise not allowed to own a weapon.
