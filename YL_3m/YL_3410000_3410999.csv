The PT92 is an improved version of the original 1975 Beretta 92 that Beretta produced in Brazil until 1980, then sold the plant to Taurus. This one has a beautiful  blued finish on the slide, ambidextrous safety/decock levers on the frame, automatic drop safety, reversible mag release. Taurus got a great reputation from these early pistols - fewer locking block problems and better accuracy than the Beretta, plus on slide safety lever to get in the way. This era of PT92 was all forged metal with excellent machining - a lot of folks prefer the old (small cocking slide serations) PT92 to the current Berettas.

I bought 2 of these and decided to keep the one with wood grips. The one I'm selling came as you see it with an extra recoil spring, both Uncle Mikes and Hogue rubber grips, two new 18 round MecGar (the best) magazines and one factory 15 round magazine. I also have a reduced pull mainspring that will lighten the double action trigger pull, holster and a case. This gun has been shot a bit, but has very little finish wear and the bore is perfect. 

The 10 round group you see in the picture was fired in a dark indoor range at 25 yards, resting the pistol on a bench with cheap ammo.

Asking $425 Cash. No trades. I prefer a local FTF sale but will ship inside Oregon only.
You must be 21, have valid photo ID, be legally able to buy a pistol and be willing to sign a simple bill of sale for my records."

79,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3410079,For Sale:  Indian Stalker Compound Bow With Browning Bowfishing reel.,"Berea /Richmond, KY., Lexington, Kentucky",$ 100,"Listed On: Wednesday, August 20, 2014",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I had heart surgery and it has left me with a lot of restrictions. Because of this I'm 
selling a lot of my hunting items / equipment, etc. 

I know you don't really care about my health, but I just wanted everyone to know the reason I'm selling these items.

I have an Indian (Archery) -- Stalker compound bow for sale. This is a right hand bow 
(hold in your left hand and draw the arrow back with your right hand). This bow has an adjustable draw weight of 45, 50 & 55 lbs. (This can be done without a bow press). 

Draw weight is adjusted by turning the limb bolts in or out to align the marks on the 
limb with the marks on the bow. This is what it is a good, solid older bow! 

I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING IT INTO A BOWFISHING BOW, so it has nocking
points and a new roller rest. Also included is a Browning ""tape on ""fishing reel"" (all metal 
no plastic), the line on the reel has never been in water, and there is about half a spool of line left (kind of forgot the poundage on the line, but its ether 100 or 120 lb. test)... 

There is also a pair of leather gloves so you don't get string burn.

Back when I was able to use this, bowfishing was just beginning to gain recognition and equipment was hard to find. As a result I used to make my on fishing arrows from the solid fiberglass rodsLowe's, Home depot, etc. sales as drive way stakes. 

These were available in Orange, Yellow and White (My biddies and I would each get a different color in case an arrow came untied, we'd know who's it was when we found it, and while we did not call it a safety slide we made our own type of slide out of fishing line and swivels). . . 

Anyway, these stakes / shafts are 5/16 in diameter, 48"" long and solid fiberglass with a 5 inch long reflective sticker around one end. There are 5 of these, 

I have cut the shafts down to 32 inches and installed a noc to the ends with the reflective sticker. Two of the arrow have bowfishing tips (all I had left), three of the arrows have 
nocs only. (I usually drill and install a 3/16 roll pin through the bowfishing tip for extra strength / durability, but this has not been done to these two tips). 

Last but not least is a camo soft case made by Kolpin to carry / store the bow and accessories. (The case had been modified by sewing Velcro to hold the arrows and bowfishing reel. 

As stated above no longer able to use this. $100.00 for bow and accessories.

This bow is also on Craigslist if you want to see more pictures.  Thanks for looking."

Because of this I'm selling a lot of my hunting items / equipment, etc. 

I know you don't care about this, I just wanted everyone to know the reason I'm selling these items.

Because of the restrictions mention above I had to sale all my 60 and 70 lb. draw bows 
and get ones capable of 50 lbs. or less. This is a bow I traded for. It is High Country American -- Supreme LT... Compound bow, the bow is right handed (hold in your left hand and draw the arrow back with your right hand), both draw weight (25 to 80lbs) and draw length (23 to 33) is adjustable. I thought ""Good deal""! 

Then I got it home, it is a good looking bow and seem to be a good, solid bow, but once 
I got it home I discovered that the string is missing. Also a couple of small E clips are missing (see photos). Could be other parts missing, but this is the way I bought it and the way I'm selling it... 

The guy at the archery shop said a string would be $60.00 to install a new string! 
Being disabled now, plus not knowing if I'll be able to hunt again or not, I just cannot justify putting that much money into this bow. I thought about buying a Left hand bow (sometimes cheap) but I don't know if I could swap everything over. 

I know I have more in it than I'll get out, but maybe someone out there can fix it or use 
it for parts.... $30.00 and it's yours.

This bow is also on Craigslist if you want to see more pictures.  Thanks for looking"

It's a fact that some AR's need a cheek riser to get proper cheekweld for raised scopes or rifles with raised rails. It's another fact that standard AR charging handles require a lot of travel, making it impossible to charge a rifle without moving a collapsible stock all the way to the rear. The LaRue RISR solves these problems.

Made in Texas, USA, out of glass-reinforced polymer, the RISR is spring-loaded, and travels to the rear as the charging handle is moved to the rear. When the charging handle is released, the RISR snaps forward. Designed to fit the excellent Magpul CTR butt stock without modification, the RISR only takes a few minutes to install with a phillips-head screwdriver. The RISR does not work on commercial sized furniture and only works wtih Mil-Spec stocks.

The RISR comes complete with all mounting hardware.

Originally designed for the OBR, the LaRue POD (Prone Optimization Device) places a 1.75"" section of MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail on the bottom of a Magpul CTR buttstock. This section of rail is the perfect platform for a FUG, raising the stock up to level the rifle when shooting in the prone. The user can pull the FUG into the shoulder for optimum control in stock-seating and can even fine-tune sight picture, by squeezing the grip with the heel of the hand resting on the ground's surface. The section of rail to the bottom also gives additional traction into bench rest bags, when not using an extension.

For sale is a CZ 527 7.62x39 Carbine Bolt Action Rifle. Like new, very little show of wear, if any. It looks like it just came out of the box!

If your familiar with these rifles, you should know just how awesome they are! They have a very light factory trigger that pulls around 4-5 pounds. But you can also set the trigger by pushing forward on it, making the trigger pull extremely light (around 2-3 pounds). This is one of only 2 bolt action rifles chambered in the amazing 7.62x39 round (the same round AKs and SKs fire). I sadly don't have the box or paperwork to go with it, but the rifle functions perfectly and is like new. The bore is also bright and shiny.

490,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3410490,"For Sale/Trade:  MeproLight M21 self powered reflex sight, no batteries required for night or day operation.  BNIB","South Jersey, New Jersey, United States",$ 450,"Listed On: Thursday, August 21, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have a brand new, in the original box, MeproLight M21 reflex sight that I would like to sell or trade.  This sight has never been used, only removed from the box to test fit, placed back in the box for storage and then removed again to take pics tonight.

This sight is completely self contained and functional.  It uses similar tritium technology as night sights on a pistol, to present a bright bold holographic reticle in even NO or low light.  It also has a light gathering function for daytime operation, which brightens the reticle to produce a usable, visible point of aim even in bright sun light.   The reticle is a bullseye design with a basic ring and dot, which appears to be ""projected"" onto the target, however nothing is projected beyond the sight and nothing appears illuminated on the business end.  The objective is 30mm and is anti-glare coated as can be seen in the pics.  The base of the scope has an integrated quick detach picatinny attachment.  There's no need to adjust brightness, change batteries, remember to turn it on or off.  There's a reason that these are the primary optic of the IDF; they are effective, reliable, durable, never go dead and are always ready for action.  

Everything that came from the factory is included in this sale; the box, manual, sight and neoprene sight cover.  MeproLight has a 10 year warranty on their sights which includes the tritium illumination.  This optic was purchased new by me in 2010 for a project that I eventually changed directions with.  It was never used and is still in 100% new condition and is every bit as bright as it was the day I got it.  

Please feel free to contact me if you need more pics or have any questions.  I listed below, the items I'd be interested in trade."

Has been very lightly used and is in almost new condition, less than a year old.  Basically a budget priced glock 23. I'm not 100% sure but I believe it may have had a spring kit installed, trigger is very smooth and lighter than other models I have felt, feels a lot like a Kahr trigger. This is the new model SD40VE, NOT a sigma. Will come with its box, two 14 round magazines, and depending on what you have to trade I can also include a Blackhawk holster and 50 rounds of .40.

I like snub revolvers, so I would like to trade it for a Taurus M85 or Poly Protector in .38. May consider other snub revolvers but must be in .38 special and no Charters. Would also be interested in 4 inch barrel revolvers such as a S&W Model 10.  Might also consider a Taurus PT111 or PT140 Pro G2.  Might consider other 9mm or .40 handguns but prefer subcompacts and .40. Not interested in rifles or shotguns please.

I know money is tight for people so I prefer to trade, but Ill sell everything for $300 if interested in buying instead.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with offers, texts preferred.

This is one of the most iconic firearms ever produced by Colt. A fine condition antique Colt Model 1855 Deluxe Half Stock Sporting Rifle in 36 cal. and a 27 inch round barrel. Scroll trigger guard and 2X walnut checkered wood. Serial number 13XX. Well cared for over the years and evidently not used very much. There were less than 1500 of these made and only a handful are left in this condition. All original with all matching numbers. Even the nipples appear to be original. Wood to metal fit is fantastic with no shrinkage. Stock and forearm are in great condition with only a few handling marks, no gouging or chipping, and retaining 90% of the original finish. There appears to be what may be a very light crack in the right neck of the butt stock near the frame, but there is no separation when I pull down on it and it may be only a scratch (see pic #21). Checkering is very sharp with almost no wear. Metal is rust free with nice sharp edges and only has very minor pitting around nipples, as usual, but none anywhere else. All markings are crisp and clear with the exception of the patent date on the cylinder, which is worn but still very legible (see photo #33). Complete with the original 4 piece cleaning rod stored in the stock under the butt plate. Mechanics are in excellent shape. Action is as tight as it was when it left the Colt factory almost 160 years ago. Bore is clean and shiny. All screws are excellent."

thanks for looking

I have been trying not to get political in my ads as I don't want to fan the fires of paranoia, conspiracy etc. etc.
But if anyone is paying attention to the hillary campaign and she gets in we are screwed.
Every time I hear something it gets worse. We will be begging for the clinton 1994 assault weapons ban which by the way was just going to be a starting point for them.
I really believe the fix is in and the money/power people have decided and the [my] vote doesn't count and she is all but in.
Look at the direction commiefornia is heading. I couldn't live there. Look what happened in Washington [I-594] Look what's happening in Oregon.
If you don't believe in the NRA find some other organization to support in the fight for our rights. To do nothing is going to be to lose.
Support this forum so we can communicate with each other or all we will be doing on here is talking about what is the best 2 round magazine we can use to not shoot our gun.
Stock up now before you can't get it.
I really don't care if you get mine or get it somewhere else because in the grand scheme of things I don't care if I sell any of these or not, I have a day job and I will have mine no matter what. Sell them or shoot them, I win. On top of I'm definately not getting rich off doing this.
I do luv to ""wheel and deal"" a little and I do feel ""richer"" for all the fellow members this has given me a chance to meet and all the information and knowledge I have gained from this interaction.
Part of my motivation for saying all this is remembering all the people I had to turn down during the last shortage. Oh, you mean the one we are still going through. Don't think it's still happening. Try to find 22LR? Try to find powder in the brand and quantity when you want it. It may be better but better than horrible is still crappy. I do not deal in high volumes and back in the end of 2012 into 2013 there sure were a lot of people wishing I did because my little supply got wiped out in a weekend and I sure had to disappoint a lot of people.
Don't get lulled into a false sense of security thinking things are OK.
Get ready for an assault on our rights like we have never seen.

We can help you set up your trust and save money for a smooth transfer. Gun ships right away. Barrett M107 A1 A whole new legend. It may be related to the Model 82A1®/M107®, but the M107A1 is far from a simple evolution. Driven by the demands of combat, every component was re-engineered to be lighter yet stronger. The result? A high-performance rifle that weighs five pounds less than the original M107, but is every bit as tough. Designed to be used with a suppressor, this one-of-a-kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107, but with a rifle weight reduction of 5 pounds. An all new bolt carrier group has been designed and is key to making the rifle suppressor-ready. Its steel four-port cylindrical muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett QDL Suppressor. The lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user's face from extreme heat or cold. Advanced design and manufacturing make the M107A1 more precise than ever. The rear barrel stop and front barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a high strength compound. A titanium barrel key and fully-chrome-lined bore and chamber add to the rifle's durability. Enhanced modularity is also a key feature of the M107A1. The rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The newly designed titanium and polymer monopod is adjustable from either side. The M107A1 rifle's lower receiver includes a new aluminum recoil buffer system that's optimized for use with the Barrett QDL Suppressor. The bolt carrier's components are protected with a mix of ultra-hard coatings and advanced nickel Teflon® plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning. Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference. Scope not includes Check all local laws. All NFA rules apply!.

-6"" barrel, perfect length for hunting or target competition.

-Capable of shooting .38 special loads. Makes target practice cheaper and newer shooters can transition to the more powerful loads.
-Aftermarket Pachmayr grips.
-No cylinder lock. Unlike new models, this 686 does not have a cylinder lock. No worrying about your revolver failing on you when you need it most.
-No MIM parts (metal injection molding), unlike on new 686s.
-Double action and single action.
