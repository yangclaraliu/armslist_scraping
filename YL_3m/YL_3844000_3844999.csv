Double/Single-Action Semiauto

The NATO-certified Beretta Px4 Storm Inox double/single-action semiauto is the culmination Beretta’s experience in engineering pistols for military and law enforcement. Absolute durability, reliability, ergonomics and interchangeability of parts have made it the choice of military and police professionals around the world. Its ease of use, safety of operation and sleek lines are also causing it to be a favorite for self- and home defense as well as for concealed carry. Apart from the winning features of the PX4 line, the Inox offers you an attractive and durable stainless slide contrasting with the black frame.
Super-Durable and Safe

Designed to meet the most stringent military standards of durability, the PX4 has been reported to fire well over 150,000 rounds with zero part breakages. Besides the essential simplicity of its design (fewer parts=fewer and more solid components bearing stress), the proprietary steel we use for this pistol was developed to be impossibly tough. Its safety system is also ultra-reliable, giving you automatic firing pin block as well as a flip-up ambidextous manual safety for extra peace of mind. All this is why a growing number of military and law-enforcement groups around the world are choosing it and using it in every environment imaginable–the PX4 just keeps delivering.
Soft-Shooting, Strong and Easy to Maintain

This pistol features a cold-hammer forged, rotary barrel encased in an ultra-tough slide machined out of solid bar stock. Besides being one of the strongest actions available, the rotary barrel dissipates recoil away from the shooter’s hand and greatly reduces muzzle jump, making it an extremely fast, accurate and pleasant-shooting handgun. After a long day at the range, the disassembly device is designed to allow the pistol to be field stripped very quickly and easily and to avoid casual or involuntary disassembly. Re-assembly is even easier, with the slide locking automatically when it travels past the rear section of the frame.
Perfect for Concealed Carry and Loaded with Features

The lines of the pistol are snag-free and make unholstering and reholstering easy and fluid, while the trigger guard is also rounded to facilitate the correct position of the supporting hand. In front of the trigger guard there is a Picatinny rail integral to the frame, allowing the easy mounting of laser devices, light systems or other types of accessories. The pistol may be adapted to different hand sizes and shooting styles thanks to a modular design with interchangeable backstraps. Also, the ambidextrous and reversible controls offer the possibility of easily training or shooting with either hand.

The P-3AT has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety.

I also have a custom mauser 7mm on a one of a kind (I can't find any evidence anywhere that these were ever produced) hand carved gorgeous wooden bullpup stock
There is also a Marlin 30-30 lever action manufactured in the 1930s and is gorgeous condition. 

I'm not giving anything away, I want actual value of these firearms and will only transfer these legally because though I think 594 sucks I also comply with laws even though I'm working to change them. 
I will send pics, info, and details to anyone serious and time permitting I will meet at a range and let you try before you buy. 

As I said I'm looking for cash and I may have even a few more treasures in the safe but we're getting into the territory of me putting sentimental value on items. Aside from cold hard cash I would be hard pressed to take trades unless it's something rare, valuable, exotic, or I can turn around and easily sell for a profit.

This rifle is in excellent shape, with no scratches or damaging marks. It has the oversize walnut stock and is factory glass bedded.  It is a ""pre-ban"" with the lugged flash suppressor.    It has a 2 stage match trigger which has a ""soft stop"" just at the spot which engages the firing pin.  The sights are national match iron sights w/covers.  i used to successfully shoot targets at 1000yds with these.  It comes with the matching bayonette (US M8A1) that attaches to said lugged flash suppressor.  It also has many mags (five  20 rds and one 5 rd).  It also comes with ~2/3 of a case of military ammo (non-corrosive) and 2 boxes of match grade ammo.  The photos cannot do it justice.  It is amazing to shoot, like a precision machine.  It puts the modern AR- rifles to shame when I'm at the range.  People are always commenting and admiring it.  I have not been using it for the past few years (got family, no time to shoot) and so it is time to sell it.  It lives in a silicone sock (water repelling) in my humidity controlled safe, so no oxidation anywhere.  Really pristine, an amazing piece of history.  Very similar to the M14 sniper rifle developed from the M1 Garand, and used by the miliarty from the Vietnam War onward to today.  Ships via my FFL to your FFL.  If its not legal in your state, then please don't try to buy it.  Please email for more photos or phone/text contact info.

MSRP on it is $670 from Ruger and they are hard to come by. This one will hold its value and no 10/22 collection is complete without one. All factory built with standard 10/22 reliability inside a high quality Nordic Components aluminum chassis. Super accurate rifle, with a true free floated heavy barrel straight from Ruger. This is the better model with the threaded barrel and collapsable stock (not the California legal version). Also has Ruger brand flip-up sights. Never been fired, comes brand new in box with everything, and still in the plastic. Takes all 10/22 mags and even internal upgrades, because it has all standard 10/22 internal components. I hate to let this rifle go, but I will for the right offer. Mainly looking for a high end handgun for it, but I will consider all offers for any other cool/interesting trades that you may have.

905,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3844905,For Sale:  Comp-Tac CTAC kydex holster Taurus PT111 Millenium Pro,"Angola, Fort Wayne, Indiana",$ 50,"Listed On: Wednesday, December 24, 2014",Holsters,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have recently changed carry guns and so I now don't have a gun for this holster.  I have used this holster almost exclusively and love it.  There is still quite a bit of life left for this holster.  The retention is very good and yet the gun is completely available should it be needed.  Check out the Comp-Tac Web site to see their write up and reviews on the CTAC holster.  It comes with 1.5 inch brown C clips.  The C clips are their low visibility option for clips and I think retention of the holster is best with them.  New clips can be ordered from Comp-Tac for $8.00.  This holster is Tuckable and I have carried my taurus like that very easily.  Another nice feature is you can adjust how deeply the gun rides for better concealment or easier access.

Anderson lower parts kit w/stainless trigger and hammer
7in Quad Rail with fast 3 screw removal feature. 
MagPul style pistol grip, MagPul style flip-up sights with Troy A2 front post, ladder rail covers, rail mounted hand grip, 30 Rnd mag, all in Flat Dark Earth
Tactical bungee sling, A2 Flash hider, wide trigger guard
Gas port drilled to .110 to insure reliability with subsonic loads
Don't be confused with others in the $600-$700 price range
The 4150 nitrided barrel and Nickel boron BCG make a big difference in quality plus all the extras. I was at the St. Charles gun show a few months ago and the cheapest there was $900 and didn't have a nitrided barrel or NiB BCG. 
Custom built and shoots great. 
May consider trades but would have to be in my favor to insure fast resell. There's not really anything I'm looking for to keep other than possibly an LCR in .357
Please, no lowballers. This is a quality build and under priced. Not in a hurry to sell."
