If you aren't familiar with the Cougar design it is the precursor to the Beretta PX4 and uses a rotating barrel action to improve accuracy and lower recoil. Identical to the Beretta Cougar aside from the name on the slide; Beretta transferred the tooling and manufacturing equipment to Stoeger, Stoeger being a subdivision of Benelli, which is in turn owned by Beretta. Has the same manual of arms as a Beretta 92/M9, so its a great choice if you're looking for a more compact version for carry.

Has some light holster wear from being carried but overall is in good shape, bought new about two months ago and only has about 200 rounds through it. Will come with two 13 round magazines. Depending on what you have I can also include an extra 15 round magazine (modified Beretta 92 mag) and some 9mm ammo.

Just picked up a different compact carry gun, so I'd like to swap this for a bigger 9mm. Looking for a mid or full sized 9mm. Primarily looking for a polymer framed striker fired 9mm such as a Springfield XD9, Glock 17 or 19, Ruger SR9, or M&P9 but would consider similar 9mm's in this size range. Only looking for 9mm's though, and no Taurus or Kel Tecs please, with the one possible exception being a PT92.  Would be fine with adding cash for a higher value trade, so feel free to let me know what you have.

If not interested in trading I will sell it with the three mags and 50 rounds of 9mm for $350 FIRM.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 if interested, texts preferred.

Comes with the following: 5 12 round mags, original case, 1 Milt Sparks Summer Special 2 holster, 1 Milt Sparks 55BN holster, 1 Comp-Tac Infidel holster and a Comp-Tac magazine carrier. Two detention plates for V1 and V9, and extra magazine base plates. I'll throw in whatever extra ammo I have. I think I have 40-60 rounds around somewhere.

The V1 plate lets the gun function as follows: DA/SA with safety and decocker on the left hand side.

The V9 plate causes the gun to function as follows: DA/SA with safety, but no de-cocker.

These switch out in less than a minute when you field strip the gun to clean it. Just allows the owner to have the choice of having a V1 variant USP or a V9 variant. All about personal preference. V9 functions basically like a 1911.

Gun is excellent, functions flawlessly, very very light wear. I will not part this out. If the buyer would like to sell off the magazines or some of them at the $50-60 they go for, that is fine with me. Same goes with the holsters.

This is the most accurate .45 I've ever fired. Perfectly balanced, great trigger. Buyer is welcome to fire it. These are just as impressive of shooters as they are indestructable weapons. 

$825 or best reasonable offer.  I'd consider trades w/cash on the following: Taurus PT92 AFS, 22lr stainless double/single action revolvers, multiple cheap revolvers or auto Saturday night specials in good shape (everyone always wants a good glovebox, tacklebox, or soon to be ex-insert here gun, lol.)  Also would take 220 swift ammo, as much of it as you can get at fair price.

Currently the gun has failure to extract about every 3 rounds. Before this started happening, the gun ran 100%. I replaced all the springs in December with new Wolf springs, but this didn’t help.  I called SW and they told me the gun needs a new extractor. I don’t want to work on this it any more; my loss is your gain.

Like new all stock, 100rds through. Not even broken in yet.
If you are not familiar with G21SF design, it actually fits 99.9% of the people better then the original G21. Glock solved the indexing problems original jumbo G21 frame gave to many people (self included). G21SF allows for better second shot control, faster site acquisition, etc. At least for me and many many other 45 fans. I think G21SF just works better then G21 for most hand sizes. Try it."

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

I am thinking of selling my pet project I built this to shoot up to and past 3500 meters but life happens so here is your chance to take up where I have left off. This rifle has only been test fired with one round, this is a new rifle.
I do not have any optics for this rifle.

Thank you for looking
GOD Bless 

I can keep the ammo and dies etc and sell the rifle alone for $4500 or with everything $5500

Less than 100 rounds down the pipe - I love the gun but I'm tight on money and need to say goodbye.  The only thing I have replaced is the trigger guard (its now Magpul - far more comfortable)  Does offer a mag and bolt release on the left hand side of the firearm.

Magpul furniture throughout, flip up sights, really the rifle speaks for its self - with a manufacture like Sig you cant go wrong.  This is a combat proven arm with a piston operating system your not going to be able to stop the rifle from going boom."

In the upcoming July 2014 issue of GUNS & WEAPONS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT, author Robert Jordan test-fires one and delivers his results.

Jordan writes, “The heart of the 1301 Tactical is the Blink rotating-bolt gas operating system. There are two main types of semi-auto shotguns: gas operated and inertia driven. Gas-operated shotguns typically have less felt recoil than inertia-driven models, and definitely less than pump actions. The trick has been to set up a gas system that can take the devastating 1-ounce lead slugs and 00 buckshot that typically comprise law enforcement’s arsenal and still function with light loads like the reduced-recoil 00 buckshot and slugs that are used by many law enforcement agencies. Beretta advertises that the Blink gas system is more than one-third faster than any other shotgun. I have no way to measure that, but I can tell you it cycles faster than I can pull the trigger and keep rounds on target.

“The most obvious feature of the Blink system is its rotating bolt head. Like an AR rifle, the bolt turns and unlocks as it comes out of battery. It then ejects the spent hull, grabs a new shell from the carrier and rotates again as it locks into battery. Also, the gas system is self-cleaning. An elastic sealing gasket scrapes the piston each time it cycles to prevent carbon buildup. This means it will shoot reliably for a long period of time between cleanings.

A second feature that sets the 1301 Tactical apart is the metal used in the barrel. Steelium is a proprietary blend of nickel, chromium and molybdenum. Hammer forged and vacuum distended to relieve stress points, the barrel will almost certainly outlast you and I on this earth. The barrel is 18.5 inches long with a fixed choke. I feel not having removable chokes is important on tactical shotguns."" Added Zoom dot Reflex sighting system 1moa to 10 moa with windage and elavation adjustments $350.  Gun cost $1079.00 plus tax total invested $1536.00. First $1000.00 cash takes it. no trades

On January 15, at 9:00 am, there will be a legislative rally against I-594 on the front steps of the Washington State Capitol building in Olympia. NRA-ILA Senior State Liaison Brian Judy will be speaking about how to get involved in the growing grassroots effort to reverse I-594 and its negative effects. Following the speakers, attendees will have the opportunity to go inside the Capitol and speak directly with their lawmakers.

We cannot afford to wait and suffer under the negative consequences of I-594.  We must act now! As you know, I-594 is erroneously described as a “universal background check” measure.  It is not “universal”, however, because criminals will never comply with the requirements.  Rather,   I-594 is universal handgun registration. Under I-594, every time a handgun is transferred, the person receiving the handgun will have their name added to the government database maintained by the state Department of Licensing.

Despite its passage on the November ballot, the fight against I-594 isn’t over and this rally is an opportunity to show politicians in Olympia how serious we are about protecting our Second Amendment rights. We cannot afford to wait and suffer under the negative consequences of I-594.  We must act now! 

Please be sure to attend this rally on January 15, at 9:00 am, on the Capitol steps in Olympia.  If you can't attend, please contact your legislators in Olympia and urge them to support our efforts to overturn I-594.  Please also encourage your family and friends to attend.

Again, here are the details for the rally:

When: Thursday January 15, 9:00 am

Where: Capitol Steps in Olympia

What: Join fellow NRA supporters at the Capitol to protest Initiative 594 and to speak with your lawmakers about what they can do to overturn it!

Spot On Optimized
Introducing the all-new BDC SuperSub Reticle
Designed for the ballistic profiles of the .300 AAC Blackout cartridge in both supersonic and subsonic loads, the P-300 BLK is completely optimized for use with Spot On™ Ballistic Match Technology, which allows shooters to discover all of the exact aiming points on the BDC SuperSub reticle at different yardages for any ammunition and load.

Spring-Loaded Zero-Reset Turrets
To simplify field adjustments, Nikon has integrated Spring-Loaded Zero-Reset Turrets into the P-300 BLK. Just sight in at 100 yards as usual, then lift the adjustment knob, rotate to your “zero”, and re-engage.

Fully Multicoated Optical System
High Resolution From Dawn to Dusk
Nikon engineered the entire optical system in the P-300 BLK to provide the shooter with maximum brightness and maximum light transmission.  The result is an extraordinarily clear sight picture.

Hand-turn 1/4 MOA Adjustments
Reticle adjustments are made in 1/4 MOA click-stop moves you can both feel and hear, and with no backlash to make your shot creep off target. Positive click reticle adjustments get you zeroed in quicker and maintain your setting—even with repeated recoil and under rugged conditions.

Quick Focus Eyepiece
Allows the shooter to instantly bring the reticle into sharp focus.

This one is the newest Special Forces model from Ed Brown, and features their new Gen 4 coating, in two tone with the lower portion being Stealth Gray. The grips are Carbon Fiber. 

Of course as with any very high end 1911, the fit and finish is incredible. Slide and frame were intentionally made too large and then are hand lapped down to size, creating a fit that is absolutely perfect. You will not find a smother and better fit 1911, I dont care how much money you shell out. 

Has the chainlink grip serrations cut in the front and back for outstanding grip without being too overbearing like on the Springfield TRP. Has 3 dot night sights with white outlines. Serial Number is... drumroll.... 11911 

Less than 100 rounds through it, couple range trips and then cleaned up and stowed away. No noticeable wear, little bit on front left near muzzle.. Cant even see in photos. Remainder of gun is 100%, like new. If it looks like a blemish in the pictures, its not, just dust or something.

Does the gun come with box and all papers?   Yes
How many mags? FOUR extended mags, 15+1
Will you consider a trade?  NO
What is your best price?  The prices listed
When can I get the gun?  After all Illinois laws are followed for in-state transfer. 72 hours, etc.
What do you need from me to buy?  A copy of your FOID, so I can run the ISP check & prepare a bill of sale
How does the rail light work?  You have three options and can either flip the light on steadily or just hold it on with your finger (when you let go, it shuts off).  You have a choice of flashlight only, laser only or both on at the same time (I leave it with both coming on).
Will you respond to dumb questions (e.g. lower price or do a trade)?   NO :-)"

This new 30-30 load was designed as the single 30-30 load for all big game hunting. The Barnes TSX opens fast enough to be brutal on deer sized critters, yet penetrates like TSX bullets normally do, so it gives ample penetration for larger species such as elk. While we feel the 30-30 is marginal for big bull elk, this is the load to use if you choose to pursue elk with a 30-30 and then use the same load to hunt deer, so you don’t have to readjust your sights for differing loads. This is the perfect load to hunt black bear of all sizes with as the bullet will expand fast enough to deliver terminal devastation on smallish bear, but will penetrate deeply enough for 500+ lb bear.



The below velocities were shot from my personal rifles. We believe the industry wide use of extra long laboratory test barrels gives unrealistic high velocities that you’ll never realize in hunting rifles. So, we give you real world velocities from real world rifles, so you know what to expect in the real world, where it matters.

100% Success rate. Guaranteed to be accepted by the ATF or your money back. Period. No questions asked.

What this Trust does: It allows you to obtain an NFA item easily and without CLEO approval, fingerprints, etc. Also, my Trust is designed to keep your Schedule A confidential unless required by the BATF by using an Assignment of Property.

As a Texas lawyer, I cannot stress how critical it is that your NFA Trust is legal, proper, and air-tight. I created this NFA Trust so that you will have all the documents you will need. Did you know that if a person is NOT listed as a Trustee and handles/uses your NFA item, you could be charged with a serious Felony crime? I include easy to fill out Assignment and Affidavit of Trustee. Simply have your friend or family member fill one out and they can use the NFA item instantly! No waiting, no need to file with the Court. Then, they can resign as Trustee if you prefer to not keep them listed on your trust at ANY TIME!

This can be a complex process and I am here to help. Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. I specialize in Estate Planning and Probate Law and I am a serious gun-enthusiast! Let me put my knowledge and talents to work for you. That includes drafting the entire Trust with your specifics, answering your questions, and customizing each document to your needs.

I have never received a single call or email from a client that said the ATF rejected their NFA Trust or their Forms prepared by me. I will walk you through every step of the process and answer all your questions so that this unnecessarily complex process is easy and painless.

Did you know you can also put regular firearms and items into this Trust? By getting an NFA Trust, you can obtain Title II weapons/items along with properly establishing good Estate Planning for all your firearms.


What the Trust includes:

- The NFA Revocable Trust with a Schedule A (14 pages)
- Certification of Trust (7 pages, this is the version you send in to the BATF with the required Forms)
- Appointment of Trustee (1 Page)
- Trustee resignation (1 Page)

I look forward to helping you obtain your own NFA items and protecting your property while keeping your information and collection as private as possible.

Call anytime. Free consultation: ***Attention: Due to the announcement from the White House that they are actively pursuing to close the ""loophole"" and possibly end the benefits of a Trust (the privacy, the security, and even requiring the beneficiaries to obtain fingerprints, background checks, and CLEO approval) though it is speculative, I believe time is of the essence and if you have been thinking about a Trust, please do not wait to contact my office for information***"

(I took this from Wikipedia) :

The Smith & Wesson Model 4506 is a third-generation semi-automatic pistol from Smith & Wesson's 4500 series of handguns. The 4506 is chambered for the .45 ACP cartridge and, with the purchase of special springs, the stronger .45 Super. It is constructed almost entirely from stainless steel and is thus extremely resistant to harsh weather conditions. The 4506 is a traditional double-action/single-action pistol. The first shot is fired in double action mode. Each subsequent shot is fired single action mode. It features one-piece Xenoy wrap-around grips with either a curved or straight back strap. The 4506 was produced from 1988 to 1999.

Like most 3rd generation Smith and Wesson semi automatic pistols, the 4506 features a combination safety lever and decocker mounted on the slide, a plunger type firing pin safety, a magazine disconnect and a pin mounted, pivoting spring actuated external extractor.

I don't have to sell my rifle but if it can go to someone who would appreciate it the way I do
and a fair price is agreed upon, I will let it go. 

These are getting harder to find and I have seen them go for more than my asking price. 

This rifle has a low round count as most large calibers do and has the factory skeletonized synthetic stock that is no longer being made. 

It has a banner optic with caps mounted with the factory stainless steel rings. 

Her action is smooth, locks up tight and the trigger breaks crisp IMHO. 

I also have about 100 rounds of custom ammo that can go with the rifle for the right deal."

I purchased this rifle brand new right before Obama was elected the first time. It has a fairly low round count. I would say it is between 900-1200 rounds. I have made a few modifications on this rifle. First off I changed out the factory trigger for a Geissele SSA trigger. I also swapped out the factory hand guard for the Free floating Daniel Defense M4 Rail 9.5 FSP. Next, the factory A2 flash hider was swapped for a Battlecomp 2.0. I also liked the feel of the Magpul STR stock with the enhanced butt pad, the Magpul Miad grip, Magpul trigger guard and a Magpul B.A.D. Lever. It still has the factory Magpul MBUS rear sight. Lastly I swapped out the end plate for the for a Noveske QD end plate. It has been a great rifle, but I am moving on to a different set up. I am asking $1500 as it is equipped. I would take $1100 for the rifle with a Milspec trigger installed and an A2 Flash hider.I have the original box it came in and it will come with a PMag or two depending on the deal made.

Trades I would consider would be a nice .308 bolt rifle with a threaded barrel (Remington 700, Savage Trophy Hunter, etc.) or a BCM MK12 upper.
