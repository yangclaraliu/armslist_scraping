On it I have a magpul acs stock, magpul rubberized pistol grip w/storage, magpul bad lever, gmg quad rail with ladder covers, fab defense mag well grip, utg quick detach scope mounts, and a Bushnell ar optics scope. 
I have in the neighborhood of $1700 invested in the gun and have documented the price of the few used parts I bought, and have the boxes and receipts for the others including the gun itself. Comes with all listed, and all factory parts. Also comes with a box or 2 of ammo, whatever I have left, 2 30rd tapco mags, 1 30rd p-mag, 1 42rd pro mag, and a 10 rd p-mag. 

I'm not really looking to trade, mainly wanting the cash, but if you have something interesting just ask. Mainly looking for a hunting rifle or 16ga pump, auto, or over and under.
I'm asking $1400 obo, well over that invested, but I know how the market is so don't be afraid to offer, won't hurt my feelings.

I just got this pretty sweet shooting thing and have only test fired less than a box (50 Rounds) through it. The ONLY and I repeat ONLY reason I am selling this is because I’ll be moving soon for a new job and need the money to help move and fund some other bills. There is nothing wrong with this gun, it is extremely reliable and accurate. Comes with (3) 20 Round Magazines and (3) 10 Round Magazines. Also comes with just over 100 rounds of American Eagle 40 Grain Full Metal Jacket, and 3 loaded magazines (60 Rounds) of Hornady 40 Grain VMAX Blue tip rounds. Lastly, it comes with a brand new custom kydex paddle holster from COM (Center of Mass) Holsters that is extremely comfortable. You cant even tell you are wearing it. These are extremely sought after right now and VERY difficult to get, unless you want to pay almost $1600-2000 for one on gun broker. The gun is in brand new condition and has been thoroughly cleaned, well maintained and babied since I bought it. It is only a few months old. Asking a reasonable $1300 for the entire package. Must be able to legally own and will do a bill of sale. Located in Idaho Falls. ABSOLUTELY NO TRADES. I need the cash. Feel free to text or call Dennis at REDACTED if you have any questions and/or are interested. Thanks for looking."

Beautiful black laminate stock, 16"" stainless barrel with Ruger flash hider, 10 round magazine, picatinny rail & ghost ring sights. This rifle has never been loaded or fired, handled minimally. The only reason it has been removed from the box was so I could secure it in the safe. Also included in this sale are the box, manuals, ruger padlock, weaver style scope rings, 3/16ths allen key and length-of-pull spacers.

The only reason I am selling this is that I found another M77 w/ an 18"" barrel and I prefer the longer barrel over the 16"". I originally paid $949 (+Wa Sales Tax) for this rifle, I am selling it for $850.  I prefer cash but trades may be welcomed.  Washington ID & CPL required.  I am located in Everett, Wa but will meet up anywhere in Snohomish County.

These rifles shoot straight and accurate. The one I own has a pretty crisp trigger, balances nicely and shoots very accurately. I recommend around 150 rounds to really break in the action. This rifle was designed after Col Coopers Ideals of the perfect SCOUT rifle, ""If you could own only one"". A great all around rifle in the powerful and available .308 (7.62x51)

The gun has Rugers target grey finish, while the rings are bright stainless and the scope is brush stainless. The scope is a Nikon monarch with x2 power. Have 60 brass and a speed loader (not shown) as well. If your not too recoil shy this thing is too much fun! Recoil is even softer with the scope, and you'll be able to hit 50 yard targets with ease. Or take the scope off for critter defense in the woods. Carries more easily than a shotgun or rifle and still packs enough horsepower that you won't feel uncomfortable if you need to use it. This was the main reason I bought this piece 
Looking to downgrade because something came up and had to use my rent money for something else, however I'm not desperate for cash, so this may only be up for a limited time (2 weeks?)The owner is aware of the situation and is ok with waiting till my next payday. I'd rather not keep him waiting though.
I'd rather down trade for mid / upper mid level automatics with cash than sell outright but cash dose talk. Price is firm, no O.B.O must meet either in woodland park or west side Colorado Springs  will not ship."

 Description from SIG website:
 With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.
 With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.
 Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line a polished Nitron two-tone slide is paired with a black hard coat anodized frame. Tru-Glo® front and SIGLITE rear sights and Hogue black Diamondwood grips complete this package.

I believe my end result is a fair price. I have an AR-15 chambered in 5.45x39 and a little over 3K rounds of corrosive spam can ammo. Upper Huldra Arms Mark IV upper that's had 200 rounds through it (on a different lower) $639 new...my price $400. I took off a dollar a round, and keep in mind i have a magpul MOE hand guard with three rails ($40 and $10 per rail) as opposed to the standard hand guard. Lower is brand new ($270) CMMG with magpul MOE stock ($60) and rubber over mold grip ($21). Three steel mags (one still in plastic) one would have come with the upper so $40, and a Wolff extra power srping for the lower that I have not installed. Here's the tricky part...ammo. Different prices float out there for basic surplus ammo in this caliber, but i believe it's around .25 cents a round, but let's say it's .15 cents a round for the sake of a median. $450 worth of ammo. All that equals $1311. Since some out there might think I should shave it back a dollar or two I will arrive at my sale/ trade price of $1100 even. The upper has some slight wear and I tried to remove the flash hider to no avail so that's another reason i have to take some off the top. i would be willing to trade for a nice .45 and cash or a nice .357 (at least 4"" barrel) and cash...but feel free to shoot me whatever, but please don't undervalue my rifle as I have carefully laid everything out. Pick up in Bossier/Shreveport only."

I've put about 200rds down range with no hiccups. I'm looking for either a quality AR15/AR10, multiple handgun trades (Walthers, Double stack Glocks, AR pistols, Keltec KSG, and other tactical firearms.  Quality AK 47 & 74's are also something I'm looking for. Just let me know what you have and we can go from there.  The only hunting rifles I will consider are quality setups in 25-06, .260 and .270. I may also consider a nice O/U shotgun. If you have any questions or something else that might grab my attention please let me know. You can text 903-272-05one4 or respond to the ad. I also have 320rds of .45 ammo that I can add for the right deal. Thanks for looking.

Similar to Nighthawk Custom’s Talon line of 1911s, the Predator II is a Commander sized gun built for self-defense but suitable for almost any purposes.

Built with Nighthawk Custom’s own one piece 416d stainless steel barrel, you’ll enjoy the decreased recoil and be able to follow up quickly on shots. The Nighthawk Custom Predator II also features: • .45 ACP caliber • Relieved slide • 40 lpi checkering on the rear of the slide • Slide top serrations . Black slide with dark gray frame (SHARP!!) This handgun has been truly a ""safe queen"", and has less than 150 rounds through its barrel!! Performs flawlessly and is extremely accurate right from the box. No FTF,s or FTE,s. The Predator II comes complete with the original carry bag, owner's manual, and one (1) Wilson Combat 8 round Stainless Steel Magazine.

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealedWith dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size .Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round magazine included. Holster. Extreme: Following in the footsteps of other Extreme models, this P938 has a Nitron-coated stainless slide and black anodized frame. Hogue G-10 Piranha grips in black and grey provide maximum grip and a distinctive look."

The barrel and the receiver are ornately engraved. There is a slight single discoloration in the bluing on the top of the barrel roughly halfway between the end of the stock and the end of the barrel. The beautiful curly maple free style thumb hole stock is near perfect, with the only notable flaw being a knot in the wood on the left hand side directly under the receiver. Included with this rifle are the front and rear Redfield Olympic model sights. This rifle has an adjustable buttstock. It comes with the forward hand stop, however the T-nut that anchors it to the lower rail is missing. The action is tight and the trigger is crisp. This rifle barely shows signs of use. 
The Model 52 was a bolt-action .22-caliber target rifle introduced by Winchester Repeating Arms in 1920 and is known as the “King of the .22's.” Field & Stream has called the Model 52 one of “the 50 best guns ever made.” The Model 52 was finally discontinued in 1980, but it remains as the Winchester historian, Herbert Houze, called it, “perfection in design.” The International Match version of the 52 is truly a work of art, and approximately only 300 were made. This is one of the models said to have been used in the Japanese Olympics. 
This rifle is in excellent condition and has been fired very little. It has spent most of its life in storage. This is truly a wonderful rifle for anyone's collection! Don't miss out on owning this magnificent King of the .22's! Please be sure to contact me with any questions you may have.

That unfortunately has not happened, and I realized it just isn't something I plan on using/carrying. I haven't even holstered it. One could argue that it was sort of an impulse buy. I don't really need the cash, but if there isn't a trade, I'm asking 400 or best offer, which does not mean $250, so save yourself the time if that's all you plan to offer.

This stock gives the shooter the benefits of a free floated barrel, adjustable stock, comfort oriented grip, and a threaded rod in the stock to adjust rear elevation for steady shot placement. 

This weapon will come ready to stack them on top of one another if the shooter is capable. 

Optics: Currently there is a Barska Varmit scope w/ mil dot resting on the weapon. Great optics for the money and especially in the 100-400 yard range. 

This weapon was professionally adjusted to a crisp 1lb pull and breaks like glass. And was the baby of a ranger friend of mine so she got painted up via the old fashion way.....Krylon. Although a rattle can paint job the weapon really looks cool in my opinion and really encompasses that sniper look. 

Included in the trade/Sale value is a hard case to carry this tack driver around (you may need a caddie because she is a hefty girl with the bull barrel). 20 Rounds of BTHP rolled for her specifically and finally the weapon and optics. Will not separate package. 


Trade Value $700   Sale Price: $650


I travel a lot for work so please be patient with responses to Private Messages, all emails will be answered. The picture of the target was taken approx three weeks ago and shows 5 rounds stacked on top of one another from a distance of 100 yards. She is deadly accurate.

This is a Hammer Forged, Chrome Lined, 16"" Barrel w/ Mid-length Gas System Upper

Has exactly 314 rounds of Factory, New, Brass Cased Ammo thru it. Runs Flawlessly, and Sub-MOA accurate too. Very Soft, Low Recoil, Low Muzzle Jump.... quite Amazing to shoot actually. Why am I selling? Because I want to try the Exact Same Upper but in the Lighter Weight Barrel Profile Version. That's the ONLY Reason.... I'm probably a fool for even contemplating letting this thing go. By far my Favorite Upper, and I've had KAC, Colt, LMT, and this BCM.

Does NOT come with BCG or Charging Handle, nor Sights, Light, Rail Panels, or any of the other Accessories shown in the Photo Below. Comes just like it would if you bought it from Rainier Arms or G&R Tactical or BCM.
