This pistol is accurate.  I can keep my 100 yard groups at around 2 inches with quality ammo using unmagnified optics.  I haven't put a scope on it to see if i can get tighter.   About 500 rounds through the barrel.

This pistol is also designed to remain effective with 55gr ammo.  5.56 xm193 shoot about 2750 fps out of the barrel.  Sufficient to reliably tumble and fragment out to about 35-40 yards.  7.5"" barrels cannot match this performance, they are too short.

- accurate and fun.  Some work done to improve feeding reliability. It could use some buffing out still. I can consistently group under 3/4 of an inch or tighter at 25 yards with this upper using only some crappy iron sights i had on it.  I achieved my goal of shooting under 4 MOA with Irons and so now it is time to move on.

Colts Description::

Introduced in 1873, no Colt revolver has earned greater fame than the Single Action Army®, The Peacemaker®. In design and performance, in line and form, no more sculptural and practical Colt has ever been created. Movies serve as constant reminders of the role this equalizer played in winning the West.

Large numbers of knock-offs and look-alikes have never been able to replace the real Colt. Records on the SAA Revolver are a Who's Who of action-oriented Americans of the late 19th and early 20th centuries including Buffalo Bill Cody, Theodore Roosevelt, Judge Roy Bean, Pawnee Bill Lilly, Captain Jack Crawford, Pat Garrett and General George Patton."

The M78 was made by Radom Arsenal as evidenced by the Circle 11 stamp on top of the barrel. It is a licensed copy of the HK P2A1. 

I've laid this pistol next to a P2A1 that I own and they appear identical except for the stampings on the frame and barrel. Although I haven't tried it appears that many if not all parts would interchange.

I can only describe this pistol as excellent with 98% of it's original finish. Mechanical function is perfect and bore looks new. I don't think that this pistol has been fired. It comes with a  green rope lanyard, a Polish issue carry bag/holster with shoulder strap that is in very good shape that's made of a extra heavy green canvas with leather trim. Case holds pistol and a supply of flare ammo. 

Also included is an adapter that allows you to fire any .22LR, Long or Short ammunition turning this pistol into an excellent emergency self defense/survival tool for your ""bug out"" bag.

Finally there is a complete cleaning kit that has a stiff nylon brush for normal cleaning. A brass bristle brush for really heavy duty cleaning and a felt tipped rod that fits the bore snuggly eliminating the need for cleaning patches.

Price is $225 with pickup in the Brandon area. Buyer must be at least 21 to purchase. I can ship this to anywhere it's legal in the lower 48 for $15.

I've put maybe 1000 rounds through it and its a great gun. When I got it it had this horrible mismatched plastic furniture on it which I tolerated for about a month before I switched it out for some bringback furniture. I personally think that AK's should have wooden furniture, and this stuff is great. 
Couple notations about the gun: 
1-It is a bit magazine picky when it comes to steel surplus ones. I had 5 that I ended up giving away with my old WASR (I sold that after I got this) because they wouldn't fit it. Tapco polymer mags seem to fit just fine (I have one steel that fits and to tapcos). 
2-It has a chrome lined RPK barrel, RPK rear sight (adjustable for windage), and the reciever is made from RPK tooling and specs (its 1.5mm thick metal instead of 1mm like standard AK's). This means its more durable, accurate, and a bit heavier than your standard AK.  
3-From what the previous owner told me (I never messed with it) the muzzle threads are AR15/10 threads, so you can use AR-10 muzzle devices on it. I don't know if you would want to change the brake, but if you do thats some info you probably would want. 

The gun comes with 3 mags, 60 rounds of ammo, sling, a whole spare set of bringback furniture (butt stock, foregrip handguards, 2 handgrips), and a magpul handgrip (its what came on the gun and I like it so I kept it on there)

I've shot quite a few AK's and owned a WASR before this and this one is by far my favorite. Its very accurate, fun to shoot, and the little extra weight really helps to soften the recoil in the best way. Its a great gun and I would love to keep it, but I really really need a handgun.

She's a great shooter, but I haven't had the time to do any of the competition shooting I bought it for, and probably won't for a long time, so I'd rather get something new to play around with and let this go to someone else.

Gun is like new except for some slight damage on the rear sight from drifting it off to install the APEX kit. Doesn't affect function at all. I tried to get a good picture of it.

Comes with:
M&P9 Pro Series 5"" with everything from the factory
3 Extra Factory 9mm 17rd Magazines (5 total)
APEX Competition AEK Trigger kit completely installed
When installing the Apex kit, I also took the time to polish the feed ramp, sear, trigger bar, and striker block.

Never had any malfunctions, and it's a damn good shooter. I'll be sad to see her go.
Gun was purchased new by me, 1 owner. Probably about 750-1000 rounds through it, all factory ammunition.

Have about $750 into the gun, so:

Bought it in August from Murdochs, it has a few hundred shells through it and has been very well maintained. Selling because I don’t shoot it as much as I once did, but also because I want something I would get a lot more use out of. I have the original box and paper work the gun came with. I have added a Magpul MOE Fore end and a Remington Super Cell Recoil Pad. I have the originals of both and will include them. There is Velcro on the side of the receiver, which allows one to mount a detachable side saddle, which is a very effective and reliable system. The Velcro is easy to remove if desired and does an excellent job of holding on to the two Velcro side saddles, which are included. One is a 7 round SKD Tac and the other is a 6 round SOE Gear shotgun card. Also included with the gun are some shotgun shells: approx.. 40 rounds of target loads, 10 rounds of Fiocchi 1oz slugs, 5 Federal 3” 1.25oz slugs, 5 rounds of 00 Buck, and 14 S&B #4 Buck buckshot shells. 
Montana residents only, and would like the buyer to fill out a simple bill of sale for my records only. Would like to get $425 for it all, but am open to offers, but I know what all of this is worth, so please don’t lowball me. 
Ideally I would like to trade it for one of the Gen 3 Glocks listed bellow, but will of course take cash. I can throw in a little cash or possibly ammunition if you have something really cool or I really want.
Fell free to contact me for more pictures, information, or anything!"

Muzzle device is a 'type 89' dual chamber brake, same as used by the Japanese special forces by repute.  Standard PSA carpenter steel BCG and milspec charging handle.  Very light 15"" keymod rail with BCM ergo hand stop, includes 1 long and 1 short aluminum rail sections.  Adjustable gas block includes 20-cycle hi-temp anti-seize and is tuned to eject in a neat pile at 4o'clock with a standard carbine buffer and spring. 

Optic is a Primary Arms 2moa dot.  Super clear dot even in bright AZ sun, and NV compatible.  Comparable to a trs-25 or similar entry level red dot; however the PA units have a much tighter dot and this one in particular has none of that 'galaxy' effect you find on budget units.  Magpul PTS BUIS included, spend $100+ on real ones if you feel strongly about it, irons are a very personal choice.

Lower is forged milspec all around with a PSA kit.  Trigger is actually surprisingly good for stock milspec. MFT BattleLink 6oz stock has great feel in pocket and no shake.

This is my personal rifle, built for self defense and hunting with a clear goal of light weight to facilitate extended carry/hiking.  Complete with optic this 20"" AR weighs only 6.7lbs, which is less than most carbine barreled flat top rifles.  With the full length barrel, standard milsurp ammo retains enough energy to fragment out to 190+ yards.  It has around 150 rounds through it and operates flawlessly.

Includes 2 aluminum GI mags and 60 rounds of SS109 ammunition.  Also included are hex and star wrenches along with the gas block adjusting wrench.

Selling to fund a motorcycle purchase.  Price is 'obo' but firm as this is an uncommon and high quality rifle.  *EDIT* I've updated the optic to a more familiar model and changed the price to better reflect other nice rifles on GunBroker and Armslist.

Would happily direct trade for a good running motorcycle.  Ideally an e-start capable dual sport 400cc+ but shoot me an offer, a clean road bike would be fun too."
