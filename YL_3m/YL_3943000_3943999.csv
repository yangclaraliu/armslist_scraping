If the deal is right I will include the bipod, original scope, this is the rarer higher magnification scope, and possibly a Sightmark Triple Duty scope as well. The rifle also comes with the cleaning rod, test target from the factory. This is a very clean all numbers matching rifle."

Will potentially trade for unfired high end 1911 or .308, willing to add cash if necessary.  Email me for additional info. See below for info:

The Leupold Mark 4® CQ/T™ 1-3x14mm is a revolutionary optical sight for tactical firearms such as the AR15 and M16, combining the strengths of a red dot sight and a variable-power riflescope. Only the Mark 4® CQ/T™ is ready and able to handle the variety of situations most common to both law enforcement and the military.
The Mark 4 CQ/T also has range-estimating capabilities. Aside from the standard dot, this has an outer circle. This is the key for range estimation. A 6' target will fit snug inside the circle at 100 yards. At 200 yards the 6 ft. target will fit in-between the center dot and the circle. Even I couldn't mess that up!
The Circle Dot reticle of the Mark 4 CQ/T is designed to offer fast target acquisition in any environment. Dot Size: 3 MOA at 3x, 9 MOA at 1x. Circle Size: Edge to edge, the subtension of the circle is 18 inches at 25 yards, or 6 feet at 100 yards when set on 3x. From the center of the dot to the edge of the circle, the subtension is 6 feet at 200 yards when set on 3x. Circle Line: The width of the line creating the circle is large enough to be easily visible, but thin enough so as not to obliterate an 18-inch object at 500 yards when set on 3x. Range Estimating -Place the target inside the circle of the CQ/T reticle. At 3x the diameter equates to 6 feet in height at 100 yards. At 200 yards, 6 feet is measured from the dot to the edge of the circle.

Features:

- Common AA batteries power the CQ/T for more than 600 hours at medium setting.
- The true 1x setting allows you to shoot with both eyes for fast target acquisition and reactive shooting.
- 2x or 3x settings give you the power to accurately engage targets at medium ranges.
- Many competitive shooters are coming to rely on the versatile magnification and unique capabilities of the CQ/T.
- The integrated MIL-STD-1913 rail mount cross slots allow you to easily attach a variety of accessories to your CQ/T.
- Our Mark 4 CQ/T A.R.M.S.® Throw Lever Mount (available separately) offers dependable, repeatable accuracy.
- The Leupold Circle Dot reticle offers a bold aiming point with built-in range estimating capability.
- The reticle is illuminated in red. When turned off, or without batteries, it remains visible, reverting to black.
- Flip-open lens covers are standard issue with the CQ/T.
- Windage and elevation dials in ½-MOA coin-click adjustments.
- Extremely rugged and 100 percent waterproof.
- Sale of the Mark 4 CQ/T is limited or restricted outside of the United States.
- The CQ/T riflescope, parts, and accessories fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of State. Unless required State Department license is obtained, this product is for sale in the U.S.A. only.
- Our all-new, third-generation illumination will keep you on target like never before. We’ve boosted performance with a 15 percent brighter reticle, and a redesigned, user-friendly interface."

	I have up for trade/sale a used but good condition Ipad Air 1st gen 16GB with Verizon 4G LTE  Data service. It is in good shape with normal wear a dent or two on the back. Nothing that makes it “too ugly” just what you would normally see after using one for a while.

This also will come with a factory wall charger, factory cable, and a set of unused EarPods. Also included is the original box and a red Smart Cover as well. 
	As far as trades are concerned, I would entertain certain offers on firearms, “maybe” partial trades of car audio set ups, and thats probably about it. Mainly looking for cash on this one. Need to be able to meet up around norman due to my schedule. Please shoot any questions or offers to REDACTED and we can go from there.

I have purchased several guns from a friend of mines estate and I have most of them listed on Armslist. Some of these guns have never been fired and are in the factory boxes. Some have been fired once or twice just see how they shot. Since I don't know which ones have and have not been fired I am listing them all as having been fired. I am not interested in any trades, cash only, and the purchaser must provide proper identification. I prefer dealing with people who have a CWP. I don't need any help selling them."

This is not the new $600 FN police shotgun.  Please do not get this confused.  This is the older discontinued model Tactical police/swat pump 12 gauge.  I have the CMORE red dot sight and the shurefire pump flashlight. This gun is being sold USED at Colelctors fire arms for $1,250.   Mine was purchased 8-9 years ago and has NEVER been fired.  It has been take out of the safe, cleaned, oiled, and put back up often, but NEVER fired.  C more goes for $229, sure fire goes for $335, and I added the FN side saddle which cost me $60.  Again, gun and accessories have never even been used.  I have all original boxes, parts, for all accessories.  I will also throw in a FN case that was ordered just to house this beast.

This is the ULTIMATE home protection or Zombie gun.  When i purchse a firearm I look for reliability.  This is more reliable than a Saiga or Vepr.  This is the gun you want to protect your family from home intruders with.

I included 3 links below so you know I am not blowing smoke up your @$$ on the costs of the accessories or the gun.  

$1,500 cash or trade.  Trade value will be a little higher.

Remington .40 S&W Golden Saber 180 Grain Brass JHP - a - 25 Rounds Per Box

Golden Saber is a favorite of police forces around the country and one of the most trusted self-defense rounds available today. With Golden Saber high performance jacket (HPJ) handgun ammo, the driving band makes the difference bullet diameter directly ahead of the driving band is reduced from groove to bore diameter, so the bullet is precisely aligned before the driving band engages the rifling. The result: match grade accuracy and reduced barrel friction. The driving band locks the jacket and core together for maximum weight retention and core/jacket integrity.

Black Teflon Finish Black Stock 8 Round

Compact and lightweight. Breaks down into three pieces. No tools needed. Stock holds and comes with two eight round magazines. Steel barrel. Adjustable rear and blade front sights. Barrels and receiver coated with teflon. Grooved receiver. Length: 35 inches assembled. 16.5 inches when stowed.  U.S. Survival AR-7. Don't Leave Civilization Without One.

Since 1959, the venerable AR-7 survival rifle has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on for survival should they have to punch out over a remote area. Over the years, the AR-7's reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world as well. Today, it's a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that's easy to carry but has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.

Like the original Henry US Survival Rifle, our latest take on this innovative, semi-automatic rifle is lightweight (just 2.5 lbs) and highly portable. At just 16 ½"" long (when all the components are stowed), it fits easily into the cargo area of a plane or boat or in a backpack. And because it's chambered in .22LR you can carry a large quantity of ammunition, without adding much weight to your gear.  The Henry Survival Rifle’s waterproof stock enables it to float if dropped into water. It can be easily retrieved and will still function. When disassembled, the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, waterproof stock, which will float should it take a trip overboard. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel and screwing on the barrel nut. In just a few seconds, without the need for any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action.

The Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic and then coated with Teflon for complete protection against corrosion. Plus, it's engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

Like the barrel, the receiver is also coated with a layer of waterproof Teflon for superior weatherproofing, waterproof protection, even in harsh salt water environments. Plus, the updated receiver is grooved making it easy to top it off with your favorite optics.  All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight."

Comparable in size to a smartphone, the Beretta 3032 Tomcat is tiny while offering the power of the .32 ACP cartridge. As such, this double/single-action autopistol it is perfect for deep concealment or used as a backup second handgun. Its tip-up barrel design makes it easy to load, operate and maintain, while its traditional looks give it the allure of a true classic.


Easy to Operate

The controls of the 3032 Tomcat are designed to be simple and to provide safety and peace of mind while carrying. The two-position safety engages crisply and positively, and locks the slide while also preventing the pistol from firing. The magazine release is located to the left of the grip, making it easy to locate and operate even with one hand.

Convenient Tip-Up Barrel Design

The 3032 features a tip-up barrel design typical of the classic Beretta small-frame pistols. Thanks to this design, you never need to rack the slide and you can load that first round directly into the chamber. This is especially convenient in cold weather, or for people with weaker hands. Another advantage is that the barrel may be easily cleaned without taking the pistol apart, making it convenient to give the pistol a quick wipe after a session at the range.

Easy to Conceal and Shoot  

Right from their inception, Beretta small frame pistols such as the 3032 Tomcat were designed to be carried concealed. Therefore, the lines of the Tomcat are snag-free, with the sights being engineered to easily slide in and out of a holster or belly-band without catching on anything. The rear sight is adjustable for windage, so that you can easily experiment shooting different loads while keeping your sights on target. All these features have made Beretta small frames like the 3032 a favorite for concealed carry and self-defense.

 This is a Beretta Tom Cat in .32 caliber in stainless steel. This one is in like new condition with the box and all paperwork. This is an outstanding concealed carry gun featuring Beretta quality, stainless steel durability with a caliber that packs enough punch to make a difference in a life and death situation.

This is more of a reaching out to meet up with like minded individuals for training or just some fun recreational shooting.

About myself: I am an avid shooter in my late 20's. I have formal training as well as a comprehensive self taught approach via instructional videos and such. Aside from having my CHL since 2009, I am also a certified NRA pistol instructor, and have also dabbled in USPSA competition. I enjoy shooting pistols, carbines, and precision rifles. 

Other than bringing my girlfriend or father along when I can, I often go to the range alone as most of my local firearm friends are just casual shooters that may go a couple times a year. Firearms are not just a hobby of mine, but also a passion. I understand that firearm skills are very perishable, even more so than many sports, so I value my time on the range and often try to take an approach to better my skills and not just do mag dumps into the dirt like I see many doing. 

I made this ad just to reach out to fellow shooters who may feel the same way and would like to meet other like minded individuals to share our knowledge, hardware, experiences, and shoot together to improve our skills, and have fun while doing it. If anyone is interested and wants to meet up sometime at the range shoot me an email. My go to public range is Briar Rabbit in Zanesville, and although a bit further, Rayners Range in Blue Rock. On the very cold days or just to get some evening trigger time I may go to Ohio Valley indoor range in Lancaster."

525,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3943525,"For Sale:  PSA Premium 5.56mm M4A1 Upper w/ BCG, BCM Charging Handle+ Magpul Pro","Beaverton, Portland, Oregon",$ 380,"Listed On: Wednesday, January 21, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale is a gently used 5.56 AR-15 Complete Upper with rear sight, ready to pin in your complete lower and fire. I've probably put about 500-600 rounds through this upper, which most people know is barely the tip of the iceberg for an upper of this performance! Part of a project that I never really finished, I tested it out on my other completed lower, and she runs like a champ and is ready for duty. I am selling this upper because I already have a different AR-15 and I have decided I don't really need to have two, need money for a hunting rifle. I bought this as a completed barreled upper assembly straight from Palmetto State Armory for 269 dollars. The bolt carrier group (standard mil-spec) was also purchased from Palmetto for 99 dollars. I'll go through the various quality upgrades I invested: 
-Bravo Company Gunfighter Charging Handle MOD 4 (Medium sized latch) ($45)
-Magpul MBUS Pro (All steel) folding rear sight ($89)
-Magpul MOE Hand Guard w/ MVG Vertical grip ($45)
So total I have about $550 into this upper. 
It really is a quality upper, and more about that: The upper was manufactured/ assembled by Palmetto State Armory, the best feature in my opinion being the FN-Manufactured Chrome-lined, Chrome-Moly Vanadium 16'' barrel with a 1/7 twist. It also has the very beefy M4A1 thick barrel profile. It can be hard to find this in stock. The upper is marked Palmetto State and everything is mil-spec. If you have any questions please let me know, I'll throw in the Midway USA rifle case you see and basic sling. Asking $380, I really think that this is a fair price considering all the upgrades this has, and also considering it is gently used I can take the $170 hit/discount. I have plenty of more pictures if you would like to see those as well. Cash, face to face in Portland area. Prefer Beaverton/Tigard. Thanks for looking."
