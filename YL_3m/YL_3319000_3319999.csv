The SS192 ""Green Ammo"" is the predecessor to the current SS195LF which uses the same 27gr HP aluminum core bullet but with a lead free primer, hence the LF designation. The SS192 “green ammo” or environmentally friendly ammo was SS195LF ammo before they changed the name and box. The manufacture (FN Herstal) relates the labeling as a way to visibly mark the packaging so that there is a lower chance for this to be mixed up with SS192 ammunition that contains lead primer."

It was built from scratch with only top of the line components. After I built it, I sent it in to Wilson Combat for an Armor Tuff finish.

The rifle has 200rds. through it for function and accuracy testing. There were no malfunctions of any kind during the testing. Anyway, let me list all the features of this rifle.

The sale is for the whole thing. rifle, scope, and scope mount exactly as seen in the pictures I know the asking price is high, but you are getting a top of the line rifle with top of the line components, that is reliable and highly accurate. In the testing I have been doing, I'm getting around 3/4moa at 100yds. This is accomplished with SSA 77gr OTM 5.56 rounds. Federal GMM would probably produce better groups. A better shooter would too. I will accept cash, checks, or M.O. for payment. Postal M.O.'s will get immediate shipping. All other forms of payment will have to clear before I ship. Shipping is $25 to the lower 48. Alaska and Hawaii will be on a case by case basis.  In case of a face to face transactions that is paid for with a personal check, the check will have to clear before you take delivery of the rifle.  Postal M.O. or cash can take delivery after the state mandated 24hr. waiting period.  IL. residents will have to present their FOID and go through the state mandated computer backgound check before the transaction is complete.  Gotta love IL.!!!!!  

Comes with 2 NIP 30rd Magpul gen 3 magazines and 2 NIP 20rd. Magpul gen 3 magazines.

Asking $3800.00, but will consider reasonable offers.  This rifle was put together with new parts.  Nothing was used before assembly.  The Scope was new too.

I'm asking a whopping $12 (5%) more for powder you can have now. And if you want to buy just a pound or two, I'm selling it a lot cheaper than you can buy it anywhere that I'm aware of.

If you want less than the entire jug, I can do that for an extra $5 (I will weigh on scale, tare the container, take pics). E.g., for 3 lbs, figure $95 ($30/lb * 3 + $5). 1lb minimum.

669,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3319669,For Sale:  6.5 Swedish Mauser Ammo - Military M41 Tracer & Ball,"Brandon, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida",$ 130,"Listed On: Saturday, July 26, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Here is 120 total rounds of real Swedish military manufactured ammo. You just don't see this much anymore which is a shame since it's some of the very best ammo you can feed your old Swedish Mausers or your AG42b.

Both the tracer and the ball ammo in this auction carry the M41 designation which means it was produced for their M41b sniper rifle. So it's of highest quality and it's very accurate. It's also none corrosive. 

There are two 20 round boxes of FMJ ball ammo which is brass case with a 139 grain FMJ bullet. This ammo is 1987 manufacture and it's exceptionally clean with bright shiny brass cases.

Then there are three 20 round boxes of the same thing except it is the M41 long range red tracer variety with white painted bullet tips. The tracer compound ignites about 100 meters down range and continues for another 800 meters or more. In other words it traces for a long way. It's brass case and there is some tarnish showing, but nothing that will affect it's function. I shot a bunch of this ammo and 100% of the tracers ignited.

Finally there is one 20 round box of brass case ammo with red wooden bullets. This ammo was intended to be BLANK ammo and functions as such with a special blank firing adapter that screws on to the muzzle of Swedish Mausers. This adapter is meant to shred the wooden bullet, however this ammo would be dangerous if not lethal at close range without the adapter. So you must treat this as you would with any other real live ammo.

Asking $130 for the lot with pickup in the Brandon area. Buyer must be at least 18 years old. I can ship this ammo via UPS ground at the buyers expense.

In the tight confines of flooded timber or hunting in similar cover, a balanced, fast swinging, reliable shotgun that can handle the most severe conditions is a must, and the Super X3 All-Purpose Field 3 1/2"" is your gun. The gas-operated Active Valve System cycles a wide variety of loads, and reduces felt recoil vastly better than inertia-operated systems.

Of course the big difference is that the entire shotgun is fully concealed in new Mossy Oak® Break-Up® Infinity camo -- and then given a Dura-Touch® Armor Coating for superb grip, feel and protection. Take a look inside: the locking bolt is plated with electroless nickel for reduced friction and added corrosion resistance, while the fast swinging barrel features the Invector-Plus™ choke tube system and .742"" Back-Bored Technology for optimal patterning. Three choke tubes (Full, Modified and Improved Cylinder), two length of pull stock spacers, drop and cast adjustment shims and sling swivel studs are included.

It's completely stainless including the trigger guard, magazine well and magazine and 22"" barrel.  It makes for a great hunting rifle as you don't have to worry about beating the synthetic stock up or the barrel rusting on those wet rainy days in the tree stand.   The fore end has been aluminum pillar bedded for precision accuracy when shooting off of a bipod or any position that increases upward pressure on the fore end of the stock on the free floated barrel. 

The bolt and trigger have also had the tooling marks polished off, the action feels sweet-WAY BETTER THAN ANY SAVAGE AXIS!! The bolt pull is probably the smoothest I've ever felt on a savage. The accutrigger is crisp and smooth as well.  Was measured at a little over 2.3 pounds of break. 

As stated earlier it is based on the long action receiver meaning all it takes is a new barrel to re-chamber to .300 win mag/.338 Federal/.338WM..etc.-remove the barrel nut, install the new barrel, head-space the new barrel and viola! 

The synthetic stock and scope have been painted and cured in a gator skin theme that really looks great, definitely one of a kind. 

It is coupled with a Bushnell 3-9x40 with a sun shade and butler creek flip ups siting on a stainless scope base. 

It was over $700 new with taxes. The first $550 takes it home.  Less than 30 shots though the new setup.  No I don't want your beat up 870's, 500's etc..

Pictures don't do it justice, it is really a head turner in person."
