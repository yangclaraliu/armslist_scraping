These guns are very unique and were developed in a full-auto open-bolt variant for riot control in prisons if I remember right.  This one is semi-auto and fires from a closed bolt.  

It is designed to be taken apart very easily, there is a button to release the stock portion and a knurled thumbwheel to remove the barrel.  The soft case has separate compartments for all of the different components and 3 pockets for drums.  Included are 3 drums in the 3 different capacities: 165 round, 220 round, and 275 round.  Each drum has the stainless steel base plate upgrade from Tactical Innovations.  There are 2 removable winders that provide the rotational force for the drum mags included that I believe are un-geared type, a soft case and an instruction manual.  Each drum comes loaded with 22LR ammo, 650 rounds total in 3 drums.  I also have the pica-tinney rail kit for it, I just never installed it.  I am the original owner.  Would prefer to see CPL and Drivers License for my own records only.  I prefer texting to emailing,  Text me! 2-5-three-sics-5-won-six-owe-6-oh.  Offered at a loss at $1,100.

Friends of NRA Edition, never fired.

BACKGROUND
I won this beautiful rifle at a Friends Of NRA banquet, and although this would be an fine addition to my current collection, it's not a firearm I particularly need or desire to keep at the moment. I'm selling this outstanding firearm to fund the purchase of a particular pistol I've had my eye on. Feel free to contact me with any questions.

RIFLE DESCRIPTION
An all weather rifle, it has a 100% Matte Stainless Steel barreled action. The XWR is set free floated in a Bell and Carlson Carbon Fiber Stock with a full length aluminum bedding block. It has a built in cheek piece and 1"" Pachmayr® Decelerator® recoil pad.

Weighing in at just 7lbs 6oz, it is made from the design specifications developed from the imprint of a Model 70 Winchester and a Mauser 98. It has a claw extractor and controlled round feed. It is equipped with a 3-position safety which is considered by most to be the safest of all safeties in the gun industry.

It also comes in it's own hard-shell case.

MODEL 1999 ACTIONS
The Model 1999 Montana action takes features from many of the best designs and incorporates them into an action that is safe, functional, cosmetically appealing and affordable. Custom gunsmiths and rifle builders now have an action with features not found on any military surplus action or current production rifles.

* Anti-bind feature which utilizes a dovetailed lug and raceway which provides precise retention of the bolt within the receiver bore.
* The bolt sleeve incorporates a Mauser style flange to gases issuing along the bolt-lug raceway, and away from the shooters face. Retains the 3-position safety found on the Winchester Model 70.
* This is one of the most popular safeties today, and by far the safest.
* Retains the claw extractor and controlled round feed capabilities.
* Push button bolt release system that is cast integral with the action offering easy to use one hand operation.
* Trigger and sear assemblies are manufactured using a EDM process that maintains design geometry to within .00003""
* The trigger assembly maintains the Model 70 geometry and is fully adjustable. It also gives the end user the option of installing an aftermarket trigger assembly meant for the Model 70.
* The action has been designed to incorporate the Mauser 98 style inner collar ring that includes an extractor cut. • • • This feature not only increases the overall strength of the action but also allows for the elimination of extractor cuts and cone breeching within the barrel.
* We've maintained the Model 70 receiver ring geometry allowing customers to use any scope base meant for the Model 70 without modification.
* The receiver incorporates gas ports on both sides of the front receiver ring for superior safety in case of catastrophic failure.
* All actions include one piece bottom metal.

STOCK
Bell and Carlson stocks are reliable over a temperature range of -50ºF to + 140ºF and all stocks are covered by a limited lifetime warranty.

Superior Design
Because Bell and Carlson stocks have been designed and tested by hunters, every shooter can benefit from the innovative features built into every stock. All Bell and Carlson stocks are designed to reduce recoil and withstand temperature extremes, moisture and hard use. The stock pitch design increases contact with the shoulder for better recoil distribution, while the increased angle of comb allows the cheek to fall away from the stock. Both of these design features reduce felt recoil, which reduces flinch and increases accuracy. Bell and Carlson stocks also have an increased pistol grip or wrist arch which gives the hand a more natural and comfortable position on the rifle stock.

Accuracy, Strength, Feel
The solid throughout Bell and Carlson composite stock withstands more abuse than a wood or hollow plastic stock and is unaffected by atmospheric conditions. With a Bell and Carlson stock, the gun stays on target! Besides being impervious to weather, having the benefits of strength, and the reduction of felt recoil, Bell and Carlson stocks are built to look and feel like a wood stock with which all shooters are familiar.

Fit and Finish
Prior to finishing, an action is mounted to all Bell and Carlson stocks to ensure a proper fit. Any stock that does not precisely fit the factory barreled action is rejected.

Pachmayr® Decelerator® Recoil Pad
These unique Pachmayr Decelerator® recoil pads provide superior recoil control and great looks. These pads enhance the look and feel of the gun, improve your shooting performance to help you shoot tighter groups, bag more game or break more clay."

313,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3617313,For Sale/Trade:  Mosin Nagant Bannerman 30.06 conversion New England Westinghouse/Remington,"South San Jose, CA, San Francisco, California",$ 300,"Listed On: Saturday, October 18, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Mosin Nagant New England Westinghouse/Remington Bannerman 30.06 conversion rifle. Rare and collectable. 300$

Following the contract to continue production of the Mosin Nagant Model 1891 at Remington Arms and New England Westingouse, the U.S. Government sold a number of the rifles to the military surplus arms company founded by Francis Bannerman VI. Following Bannerman's death in 1918, his sons retained the business and began remarketing strategies for the M91 during the 1920's.

 Many of these guns were converted to cal. 30-06 to cater to the U.S. sporting arms market. For this conversion, the chamber end of the barrel was cut back by approximately .75 inch, and a new chamber was reamed. The original serial number was thus eliminated from the barrel. The barrel shroud was also stamped ""cal. 30.'06"". The magazine was also expanded in width by flattening the side ribs of the housing, thus exposing a gap when viewing at the floorplate.

 Most of the sporters had the barrel cut to about 21.5 inches, the stock cut at the front shoulder, and the bolt handle turned down. The bolt head was machined to accept the rimless cartridge with an altered extractor, and a black finish was applied to the head. A new front sight needed to be incorporated, but the rear sight remained original, with no alteration of the graduations. A general concurrence among collectors is that the Bannerman conversion should not be fired with full pressure loads, but many do shoot them with a lighter powder load."

This belt is nice and stiff so your gun doesn't flop around when you have it holstered. It is made of horse hide leather, which is much stiffer than cowhide. It has nice silver hardware and the overall belt is extremely well made and ready to take abuse. I bought it and forgot about it and then got fat, so it doesn't fit. I need to order a new one. Swing by his website under the same name and take a look at the pricing, they aren't cheap. I'll sell this one at a discount and no wait time. The belt measures different than a normal belt, from  the front of the buckle to the closest hole to the buckle it is 38.5"". It is an additional 4.5 inches to the last hole. CHECK YOUR WAIST WITH A PIECE OF STRING AND MEASURE WITH A MEASURING TAPE. Again, the label is not normal belt sizing. This is what I measured. There is then an additional 3.5"" open room after the last hole to punch a couple more if need be. The belt is also 1.5"" wide. Thank you for looking!"

The revolver comes with papers and the blue fabricated "".44 Magnum"" box (including cleaning tools) which has been relined and which may or may not be original.

Very impressive gun. Shoots very well. I have only ran 50 rounds down the barrel. I have the factory mag and a 20 round Pmag.  I also added a rail and removed the factory plastic hand guards. It also has a Hogue grip.

I am trading the 308 because ammo is too expensive. I have 5000 5.56 rounds. But I only have a couple of boxes of 308 rounds. So I figure I will sell or trade it and get a 2nd AR.

In the picture you will see a Leupold 4x12x40. This is a $300 scope, and it's new. It's been on the gun since day one, so 50 rounds for the scope also. 

The bare bones gun is $1000 new. Since mine has a Hogue grip and a rail and a pmag it exceeds $1000 in value. I will trade the 308 without scope straight up for a Colt LE6920. Must be in great cosmetic shape.
I plan to keep the Leupold, but will consider throwing it in for the right deal. With scope the package is worth at least $1300. But I am flexible.

I will travel as far as 45 min away for anyone who is serious about buying, I will not sell to Illinois residence, Missouri residence only! if your not serious please do not call and waste my time and yours, not willing to trade, cash only. This rifle is used but in excellent condition approx. 200 rounds put through it, The barrel is 16"" Lightweight 4140 Chromemoly Forged 1:9 twist  7075 T6 A3 Flattop, Railed gas block A2 Birdcage flash hider, M4 feed ramps, enhanced and upgraded (New) M16 full auto Nickel boron BCG coated and features a carpenter 158 shot peened bolt. The gas key is hardened and secured with grade 8 fasteners, and is staked per Mil-Spec, also it comes with the original M16 Full auto BCG. I'm throwing in 100 rounds of American eagle .223 55grn.

The hydraulic buffer reduces 75% of felt recoil allowing quicker follow up shots and a quicker cycling rate with less wear and tear on the optics. Everything that comes with this rifle on the low end adds up to $2,415 also I haven't added up the full price of everything including the tax or the shipping and handling cost and fees of the extras that come with it, that would add another $250 to $300 or more.

This one has 570 rounds through it, and functions flawlessly. It is an excellent shooter, but I'm switching things up.

 Trade options: pistols in 9mm or .45ACP, I would prefer something compact/sub-compact, but I will consider full-size as well. 

 Transaction must go through an FFL to comply with all laws. I'd like to meet at ARK Tactical, but I'm open to suggestions, and I would like to keep in the Denver Metro area - I would travel for the right trade though. We each pay our own fees, unless something is worked out with the fees being paid by one party to cover a difference in trade values.

Serial number shows this 24-3 left the factory in 1984. Most production 24-3s are either 4” or 6 ½”, but special runs of the 24-3 were offered with 3” barrels. This is not a Lew Horton gun.

This 24-3 is in good condition with solid lock-up, a good bore, a nice trigger pull and it retains most of it’s original finish. There is some light holster wear on the muzzle and sharp edges. You will note 2 small rust freckles on the side plate, I believe they will be easy to clean up or you could replace the side plat. I have tried to be very detailed in the photos below, I have many more photos available.

Much debate and confusion surround the grip frame of the 3” 24-3, in an early advertisement Lew Horton promoted their gun as a N-frame with K-frame round butt grips.  This 24-3 wears Altamont bonded ivory N-frame grips that required some fitting. Upon inspection you will notice where I have sanded the grips to attain a comfortable fit. The Tyler T pictured is also included in the gun. I will also include a set of Pachmayr K-frame grips that fit perfectly.

I didn't realize until after I took the photos that my back drop was the same color as the front sight insert, be confident that the insert is there...."

I am a dealer, so you must fill out a 4473 and do a background check.
YES I WILL SHIP! Shipping is a flat $30 If I ship, these must go to an FFL.. NO EXCEPTIONS.

1. Century CETME rifle in .308. This rifle is in overall good condition, the bore is in excellent shape. This one is picky about its ammo, I had great results at 300 yards with winchester but it hated the cheap tula ammo. Comes with 5 magazines. $550

2. MSAR AUG in 5.56. This is the second one I have owned, never got around to shooting it but a couple magazines. Accurate and a neat rifle. Someone has custom durakoted it or painted it a camo color that can be sandblasted off(only the stock, not the actual metal is painted). Bore is excellent mirror. There are some cuts in side of stock where the brass has ejected hard. I paid $1600, I am asking $1000 which is the cheapest you will ever see one of these with a scope go for.(scope is in excellent condition). Comes with 1 magazine. $1000

3. Bushmaster ACR, again someone has custom camo'd this one. Overall the rifle is in excellent condition, very accurate and very reliable. I am only selling to make room in the safe. Comes with one magazine, $1400

4. 900-1000 rounds of .308 commercial ammo. This is a mix of .308 ammo, 90% of it is commercial brass cased reloadable ammo, winchester, federal and eagle. The other 10% is Pakistani .308. Comes mixed in a can with about half of it in boxes. This is $900+ worth of ammunition. $550 gets it all or $450 if you purchase it with the Cetme.

I am firm on the prices. Why? Because you wont find this stuff cheaper anywhere else.

The factory sights are included as are the factory sling and scope mount, 20 rounds of Winchester 150 grain Power-Point as well as 46 rounds of Remington 170 grain Core-Lokt ammunition.

Bushmaster Carbon 15 AR15 pistol. This is registered as a pistol and must be transfered as such. It accepts 20, 30, 100 round Beta C AND ALL AR 15/M16 mags! It is chambered in 5.56 and also fires .223. I have fired 40 rounds through to test it for function and accuracy and it passed. This thing is really fun to shoot and the function was flawless. I then cleaned it and kept it in my safe. I planned on carrying in the car since its legal as a pistol. But I have not carried it and want to sell to buy or trade to something my wife wants more. I like the Bushmaster because it is EXTREMLY light( hence the name Carbon) when compared to the other brand AR and AK 47 pistols on the market. The muzzle blast is significantly less than my Draco. Great self defense gun. This is unbeliveably light and accurate. I do not have the box and manual but they can be obtained from Bushmaster. Overall length is only 20 inches!

Up for sale is one of the niftiest AR-15 products to come out this year is a hybrid metal/polymer receiver from American Tactical Imports called the Omni Hybrid. Like all of the best polymer firearm technology, the Omni relies on a metal-to-metal fit at the major stress points. The ATI approach is a full zinc alloy core to the mostly polymer receiver that includes the buttstock threads and rear takedown pin. The metal part has a dual purpose. It adds rigidity and strength to the overall rifle, unlike the not-ready-for-primetime full polymer receivers. Below are the spec's on this fantastic AR-15 Pistol.

Otherwise would be willing to sell for $600 FIRM. I have just over $700 into this pistol with the grips and extra mag, and I will throw in some hollow points to fill both mags.

It is the compact version of the Sig 226 and is about the same size as a Glock 19. It is hammer fired conventional DA/SA with decocker and three dot contrast sights. It has the classic looks of the pre-rail model with very comfortable old style two piece Sig grips (not E2). Comes in factory box with two 12 rd mags, lock, and papers. Also included are a new Gould and Goodrich duty holster and 100 rds of FMJ. I picked this gun up in a trade so I do not know the history. It appears to have been sold under the Sig certified pre-owned program as evidenced by the red box. All parts are near pristine except for some slight scuffing on the barrel bonnet.
