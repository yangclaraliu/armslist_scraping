As far as the gun goes, I've fired about 75 rounds down the barrel, so it's fantastically close to new. I've also got the original hard case and a leather holster that is immaculate--never been used & IWB holster. 
Here's a little about the pistol from Chiappa's site:
Defense revolver, offers great concealability thanks to a very unusual profile. The flat cylinder grants maximum comfort. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to prepare to fire.

If you've got any questions, feel free to call/text or email--- (248) 790 sixty nine hundred. Have a great day! FYI, the price is negotiable."

The Shadow platform has been known for accuracy and the new Accu-Shadow takes it to the next level. The Accu-Bushing system holds the barrel with much more precision, enabling us to cut group sizes nearly in half. In testing, the pistols returned groups substantially less than 3″ at 50 yards (using Fiocci 124 JHP). Add to that a full complement of custom work including competition hammer, lighter springs (11 lb. recoil, 13 lb. main), thin black aluminum grips, stainless steel guide rod and polished internals.

A short-reset disconnector is used to greatly reduce trigger reset between shots, making this SA/DA trigger reset like a nicely-tuned single-action only trigger. The Accu-Shadow is topped with a fiber optic front and HAJO serrated target rear (adjustable for height, also drift adjustable for windage).

Short of a full custom pistol, it’d be difficult to find greater out-of-the-box accuracy than the Accu-Shadow can deliver.

PHP (Prvi Hrvatski Pistolj - first Croatian pistol) is a weapon which was developed in Croatia during its war for independence in early 1990s. Production and quality of this pistol (which was produced in at least two versions, short-barreled PHP MV 9 and long-barreled PHP VM 17) was sporadic, and it was soon replaced in production and use by the HS 2000 pistol. 

By design, this pistol represents a mix between Beretta 92 and Walther P38 pistols. The basic short-recoil operated action with vertically tilting locking piece is similar to both pistols, the general appearance of the open-top slide is close to the Walther but the single return spring below the barrel is apparently an Italian influence. Trigger is of traditional double action type, and the safety consists of a manual decocking lever, located on the left side of the grip frame. Magazines are double-stack and hold 15 cartridges (1 mag total with each pistol).

This Croatian weapon is relatively rare, since production ceased after a short run and did not pick up again until after the breakup of the former Yugoslavia was well underway. The weapon is essentially a version of the Walther P-38; though it looks very different externally, the breech locking, trigger, and decocking system are the same. The only real improvement is the high-capacity magazine and the protection for the barrel. In good condition"

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.



The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.



The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Mounted on a rifle, rifle was sighted in and then it was taken off.

This muzzle brake fits all M1A and M-14 7.62mm/.308 cal. rifles with the original, standard front sight assembly including those with full length barrels or shortened barrels such as the Scout Model. This muzzle brake includes the dovetail base for a front sight, but does not include the front sight itself. It has proven to be very effective at reducing recoil and muzzle climb even for full-auto weapons. It was adopted by the U.S. Coast Guard for use on their M-14 rifles after passing their tortuous endurance testing requirements; this muzzle brake is designed for rapid follow-up shots with the hard-hitting 7.62mm NATO caliber M-14 service rifle. It provides 40-50% decrease in felt recoil and nearly 100% decrease in muzzle climb over US GI issue flash suppressor. This time-proven design, with its 14 gas ports is precision machined from heat treated 8620 and 4140 chrome-moly steels and provided in a manganese phosphate finish (Parkerized) per MIL SPEC. It installs with the issue castle nut that comes with the standard issue flash suppressor. Castle nut is not included. Diameter 0.860 inches, Overall Length 3.400 in., Weight 0.31 lbs.

All Buffalo Bore Heavy 40 S&W +P loads use flash suppressed powders that give high velocities at low pressures. Since over 90% of all human shootings in the USA happen in low light, we believe that flash suppressed powders are a potentially life saving advantage - you don't want to be blind after you fire one shot in a life threatening, high stress situation.

There is such a variety of 40 S&W pistols in public use that we will not determine what pistols are compatible with which 40 S&W +P loads - this is your responsibility! We will add that this ammo is safe in pistols that use a fully supported chamber. Please read the safety notices below. The first one is taken form the Speer #13 loading manual. The second is taken from Hodgdons #27 loading manual.

SAFETY NOTICE

""Some pistols chambered for the 40 S&W cartridge may not provide complete support of the case head. If this condition exists, normal pressure loads such as those shown here can cause the case wall to bulge or rupture at the unsupported point. Contact your firearm manufacturer to determine if your pistol completely supports the case head, or ask a gunsmith to inspect your pistol before using it with ANY ammunition. It is the gun owners responsibility to know his firearm and its capabilities and limitations.""

40 S&W WARNING

""This data is intended for use in firearms which fully support the cartridge in the chamber. Use of this data in firearms which do not fully support the cartridge may result in bulged cases, ruptured cases, case head separation, or other conditions which may result in damage to the firearm and/or result in injury or death of the shooter or bystanders.""

Glock happens to chamber their 40 S&W pistols without a fully supported chamber and both of those above safety notices are likely aimed at Glock. I know of no other 40 S&W handguns being sold in the US that don't have fully supported chambers. If you really want to shoot our 40S&W ammo in your Glock, have an after market barrel that uses a supported chamber, dropped into it. This is a fairly common practice and will give you the safety margin needed to fire our ammo in your Glock. It will also likely give you more velocity that the factory Glock barrel. I personally own two Glock Model 23's. Both of mine are going to get after market barrels dropped in so that I can use this excellent ammo in them.

Check out the velocities below that I shot with these loads in several modern pistols that I own. We don't believe that test barrels are a very real way of determining real life velocities out of real life guns that you will be using. So, as with all of our ammo, we use real firearms to determine real velocities.

Perfect for tight cover grouse woods and has been used on doves and pheasants. It recently had a matte blue finish applied and the maple stock and forend were stripped of their varnish and a natural oil finish was applied. Everything looks factory new and was all done by a professional gunsmith. The checkering was also redone. I don't know the exact weight but it feels like it is a 6 lb gun. It does not kick hard for a light over under.

I am selling the upper and lower as separate entities. I am trusting YOU to be responsible and have the barrel properly pinned BEFORE assembly as not to create an unregistered SBR. If you want both I will take $900 cash or trades. Otherwise I am asking $300 for the lower and $600 for the upper.
I'm interested in lots of trades so check out that list...

Specs on build: 
-Rainier Arms upper
-Voo-Doo 14.5 government barrel (no flashhider has been installed or pinned yet. More on this later.) 
-Adams Arms mid length piston conversion with railed gas block (also have Adams Arms low pro gasblock available.

The lower is Aero Precision.
Adams Arms BCG is Nickle Boron coated.
PSA lower parts kit.
PSA milspec buffer assembly 7075 aluminum
Magpul grip and trigger guard.

Once again, I am selling these as separate pieces due to the fact that the barrel has yet to be pinned it would be an SBR if I sold it as a complete rifle. I honestly just haven't gotten around to picking out a muzzle device yet. This means you can pick one of your choosing and not be stuck with whatever is on there.. This also means that the Adams conversion kit can be removed if the piston conversion isn't your taste.

It's a 2002 Kawasaki kz1000 police that I was converting into a bagger but I'm too busy to Finnish unfortunately. The bagger has 50,xxx and is a former police bike, so it was regularly maintained. The bike has Harley hard bags and Harley handle bars which are pretty awesome! The pipes are custom and wrapped for that rugged look. The bike does need a new clutch cable and new throttle cable to run so it will need to be towed. One unfortunate thing to deal with is the title you will need to put in for an abandoned vehicle. Which still means it will be a clean title! The price is 1200 or best offer so just throw a number out and I'll see what I can do. I would like to trade for a firearm offer anything!"

And also 4 pretty good size bags of ammo (few hundred rounds?) I have $1k in the gun alone, not including all the extras. Asking $1300 not only because I feel its all worth it, including all extras, and the gun is in very good shape, but also because I have some bills that need to be paid pretty soon, within the next 3-4 weeks or things are going to get bad for my family :/ (wife and 3 kids)

I have 2 people in the area offering $1100 for the gun right now, but I really seriously need the $200 more, I have some serious bills to pay asap :/ This is a good gun, fires dead on every shot. 30 round Yugoslavian metal clip on it right now. Its clean, been taken care of, stored in case, NEVER dropped, NEVER had dirt or grass in it (im very picky with these things), NEVER jams, and just all around great gun. Fun as hell to shoot though shot very little. Has recoil buffer installed, folding stock, aftermarket SAW style handle with secret storage compartment in handle, adjustable flash suppressor, the works. Was intentionally bought as a hog busting weapon, but never really used for that afterwards. Shot it about 6 times in the 3 years ive owned it, and you can tell when you look at it especially in person. Great shape.

“The Omni-Hybrid lower has gone through all the pressure and weight-baring testing of a traditional aluminum lower with flawless results,” says Joe Calabro, Director of Marketing for American Tactical. “We feel like this new manufacturing technique will help set the standard for AR lower manufacturing.”

Taurus Millennium series pistols are manufactured with injection molded polymer frames, and blued carbon steel, stainless steel, or titanium slides. Available cartridge chamberings include .32 ACP, .380 ACP, 9mm Parabellum, .40 Smith & Wesson, and .45 ACP. Magazine capacities vary between 6, 10, and 12 rounds depending on model and caliber. The Millennium line includes several innovative safety features including a positive firing pin block as well as the ""Taurus Safety Latch"", a transfer bar safety which prevents firing of the pistol unless the trigger is pulled. Together these safeties assure that the pistol will not fire if it is accidentally dropped; selected models have been certified as satisfying the California Drop safety requirement. All Millennium models also include a frame-mounted safety lever.

This rifle was a vet bring back, but he unfortunately sporterized it for deer hunting.  It has NOT  been drilled and tapped, or modified other than the original stock being cut down.  I have since put it back into a laminated stock from a Yugo 98k rework, and added bands, cleaning rod, fsc and sling. (Sling is post war German manufacture, dated 1955, looks like WW2 sling).  These are a nearly impossible rifle to find, described as ""rare"" in Law's book.  Yes, it is a mismatch, but find another with this proof, non import marked.  With a little looking and some correct parts this rifle could be the pride of any collection.  Only ever found one other, in similar condition sold for $1200.00 at auction.  Feel free to contact me with regards to making an offer.   REDACTED, any reasonable offer considered."
