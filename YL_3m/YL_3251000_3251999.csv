I have several boxes of ammo for it, all match grade and one box missing the 4 rounds fired thru it.

* Square butt wooden grips
* 2"" snubnose barrel
* A set of aftermarket rubber grips are included. They fit snugly and give the revolver a smaller overall length which I find is better for front pocket carry.

* A bag of 125 grain JHP Speer self defense rounds are included. (QTY 45)

 It could use some cosmetic touches if you are into that stuff. I clean & wipe down all my guns after use. This one functions at 100%

242,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3251242,"For Sale:  WARNING, SCAM: Schmidt & Bender Short Dot 1.1-4x20 NIB!","Downtown, Phoenix, Arizona",FREE,"Listed On: Sunday, July 6, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a continuing scam by a criminal trying to fraudulently sell this non-existent scope. This scam has been posted many times and flagged and shut down many times. Ask the supposed ""seller"" to provide a picture of the serial # on the scope and their original proof of purchase to prove ownership-they won't because they have neither as they stole the picture from another website and they cannot take a picture of something they do not actually have.

The criminal is using the e-mail address ""REDACTED"" and their user name is ""Dan Dupre"", but judging from their numerous spelling errors and syntax mistakes, they are not a native English speaker. For example, he asked me for a copy of my FFL to buy the scope...uhm, you don't need an FFL for a scope. He also balked when I requested a picture of the serial number on the scope itself and his proof of orginal purchase. He could not provide either because - wait for it- he does not actually have the scope.

Ask them for their residence mailing address, e-mail address and phone number and ensure they all match and are consistent with one another. You can file a local criminal case with the police if they scam you and have the police subpoena the phone company and the internet provider to determine their exact physical location (i.e. their residence) which will lead to their actual identity for prosecution.

Also, ask them for their paypal account for a money transfer as paypal protects you against fraud and acts as an escrow service. Or, use safefunds.com, an established third party escrow service which protects both the seller and the buyer. But let me guess, the ""seller"" will insist on using a money order (don't ever do it) or wire transfer to a bank account (don't do it). However, do post whatever information they give you here on Armslist to help prevent further criminal activity which undermines the purpose of this website and the mainly honest patrons who use it."

Now tell me douche bag, how much did you pay for the .22 you are selling for twice the WalMart price. Scalpers are douche bags and whats sad is, the only people who will pay .10 a round for .22LR are people who need it. Like dads shooting with their kids on the weekends, boy scouts, etc. Most of us have a hoard of .22 and feel bad for people getting ripped off on the cheap ammo they like to plink with becase some douche bag wants to make .04 a round on people and probably doesn't need the money but has the aforementioned illness that makes them want to buy up ammo and resell it for .04 profit on honest people who don't get up at 7AM to run to WalMart or Atlas Sports. I can tell many stories about douche bags like you that were passed onto me by managers at DICKS and WalMart. So stow it and I hope everyone continues to flag douche bag scalpers as overpriced.

I could do a 'two for one' if your trade interests me. I received both of these guns used in trades and just do not use them. 
The Hi-Point has had its feed ramp polished and will come with three magazines ( one 8 round and two new 10 round magazines that have never been in the gun. )I also have 175 rounds of fmj ammo that can come with the gun. I have fired around 120 rounds through it and have had no failures of any kind. 
The Rg-14 is a 6 shot 22 lr 'saturday night special'. This gun's claim to fame is that it is the same model of gun that President Reagan was shot with in 1981. I have only shot 24 rounds through this one, but it worked perfectly for those. From what I was told when I got it and the amount of wear on the gun, I believe this gun has fired less than 100 rounds total in its life. I can add a couple of hundred rounds of 22lr if needed too sweeten the deal.
Mainly looking for trades right now. Not for sale.
Value of the guns together is between $275 and $325 depending on how much ammo I include with them.

Im just finally tired of people telling me you just have to be 18 & have a bill of sale to buy a handgun on here. Here is what nc law says..... North Carolina Requirements
North Carolina’s pistol permitting and concealed carry permit laws qualify as an alternative to the requirements of the Brady Law. Therefore, when a person desires to purchase a handgun from a federally licensed dealer, the person needs to comply solely with North Carolina’s pistol permit laws, and present a valid permit to purchase a handgun or valid North Carolina issued a concealed carry permit. (Please note: Even if a NICS inquiry by a federally licensed dealer was done in this circumstance, it does not do away with the necessity for a pistol purchase permit.) As always, any other transfer between private individuals is also governed by North Carolina’s pistol permit laws.
Under North Carolina law, it is unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to sell, give away, transfer, purchase, or receive, at any place in the state, any pistol, unless the purchaser or receiver has first obtained a license or permit to receive such a pistol by the sheriff of the county where the purchaser or receiver resides, or the purchaser or receiver possesses a valid North Carolina issued concealed carry permit. This requirement to obtain a permit prior to the transfer of a pistol applies not only to a commercial transaction typically at a sporting goods store but also between private individuals or companies throughout North Carolina. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-
402(a).
In addition, this State law has been interpreted to require that a pistol permit be obtained by the receiver of a handgun when such person inherits a pistol as a result of the death of another person. The permit should be given to and retained by the seller or donor of the handgun. In such a case, the permit should be given to the executor or receiver of the estate of the deceased person. If the purchaser or receiver uses a North Carolina issued concealed carry permit for the transfer, the seller should reference such permit on a bill of sale.
Further, it is unlawful for any person to receive from any postmaster, postal clerk, employee in the parcel post department, rural mail carrier, express agent or employee, or railroad agent or employee, within the State of North Carolina, any pistol without having in his or her possession, such a pistol purchase permit or North Carolina concealed carry permit.
A violation of this pistol permit law is a Class 2 Misdemeanor under North Carolina law. Specifically exempted from the provisions of this permit requirement are the transfer of antique firearms or historic-edged weapons. An “antique firearm” is one that was manufactured on or before 1898 and includes any firearm with a matchlock, flintlock, percussion cap, or similar ignition system. It also includes a replica thereof if the replica is not designed or redesigned for using rimfire or conventional centerfire fixed ammunition. It also includes any muzzle loading rifle, muzzle loading shotgun, or muzzle loading pistol, which is designed to use black powder substitute, and which cannot use fixed ammunition. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-409(a). However, the
term “antique firearm” shall not include any weapon which incorporates a firearm frame or receiver; is converted into a muzzle loading weapon; or is a muzzle loading weapon that can be readily convened to fire fixed ammunition by replacing the barrel, bolt, breechlock, or any combination thereof. A “historic-edged weapon” is defined to be a bayonet, trench knife, sword, or dagger manufactured during or prior to World War II, but no later than January 1, 1946. N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-409.12. The requirement of obtaining a permit prior to the receipt of a handgun
does not apply to the purchase and receipt of “long guns,” such as shotguns and rifles."

Built around Beretta's latest PX4 modular technology, the Beretta PX4 Storm Sub-Compact Pistol delivers concealed carry handling with large frame firepower. The Px4 Storm Sub-Compact utilizes Beretta's reliable locked breech and tilt barrel system for a more compact and lighter package.  Direct barrel-slide locking system design delivers a low barrel axis that reduces felt recoil and minimizes muzzle rise. Its stainless steel barrel resists corrosion and requires less maintenance, a great choice for a concealed gun kept close to active, perspiring bodies. The PX4 Storm's durable frame includes an integral Picatinny rail for rapid attachment of tactical lights and laser aiming devices. Ambidextrous manual safety lever is positioned on both sides of the slide for easy access by all shooters. Bruniton™ non-reflective black coating provides superior corrosion and wear resistant finish. White 3-dot sights provide quick acquisition of the target."

Midway has them new for $112. I am asking $60 shipped. 

This free float set of handguards incorporates all the right features. Anti-rotation screws make sure the handguards stay in place and the four, full length mounting rails allow for maximum flexibility when it comes to mounting your favorite accessories. This set of handguards is a free float model, meaning they are attached to the upper receiver only and do not make contact at any point on the barrel. This reduces the chance of accuracy-reducing pressure on the barrel, allowing it to flex naturally and in a repeatable manner when fired. YHM has taken the lightweight concept to the limit with these handguards, as excess aluminum has been machined away in a visually striking pattern to create the lightest weight handguard possible while still retaining structural integrity and strength.

Previously Sig Sauer made some P226 Equinoxes in 9mm because 9mm Equinox slides were built by accident and they finished the guns instead of destroying the slides. Those guns were never available again after that run. We are not sure if the same mistake happened with P229 slides and the factory finished the guns or if this is a limited short-term run of this configuration
