 Up for sale is a Mauser 3000L.  You are seeing these less and less, and this is a great collector rifle! This was one of the only commercially produced left handed rifles by Mauser,  As seen in the pictures the ""L"" designating left handed was added by hand. Do your own research,  these are a sought after rare rifle. I thought I would put this out there to see if there is any interest in it. I will not be letting this go for a low ball offer, so don't waste our time. It is one of the smoothest actions I have felt, and I have often been tempted to rebarrel to a heavy barrel to better fit my needs, but do not want to destroy any collector value.  I haven't shot it a lot but from what I have, it is a track driver.  The scope shown will NOT be included in any sale or trade.  Feel free to shoot me a offer, worst I can say is ""no thanks ""
BTW....if the adds up, The  guns available.... I won't respond to this question. I have also talked to other people who say they have responded to my adds, but I never got their emails...I respond to all emails unless there are flat out insulting, so if I never got back to you please try again.

This weapon is intended for civilian and security use, and mimics the famous M16 rifle in its layout and placement of most controls. It is remarkably light for its caliber and size, because of extensive use of modern, high strength plastics.

Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes conventional gas-operated action with annual (ring-type) gas piston, which is located around the support tube that runs below the barrel. Return spring is also located around the same tube, which is concealed by enlarged polymer handguards. Barrel is quick-removable from upper receiver, barrel locking is achieved by tilting locking piece inside the bolt, which engages the barrel extension. Charging handle is attached to the bolt and projects on the right side of the receiver. The upper receiver is manufactured from aluminum alloy; lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic shotgun utilizes detachable box magazines, each holding 5 rounds; an M16-style bolt stop and bolt release button are incorporated into the lower receiver. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style, being located on the left side of the receiver, above the pistol grip. Standard sights include front post, installed on the M16-style removable base, and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight.

If you could marry a competition rifle with a military rifle – the CSR-1516 would probably be its offspring! Introducing the CSR-1516. A sporting rifle that your friends are going to drool over.

This rifle has all the features and appointments that a competition rifle has… only it’s a sporting rifle. Really? You bet! How about a 13 slot Picatinny Rail on a slick side flat top receiver, or an integrally-forged enlarged trigger guard. Don’t forget other high-end features like a Nickel-Teflon coated Colt match-target trigger, or 16” 4140 Chrome-Moly steel air-gaged match-quality barrel and even a low profile gas block. And we didn’t forget that people don’t come “one size fits all”. Which is why we made sure that this little Colt has a six-position adjustable carbine stock in an improved M4 style. It may look like a cross between a military and competitive rifle, but we assure you – it’s a sporting rifle!

RAND CLP is the best eco-friendly All-In-One: Cleaner, Lubricant and Protectant. RAND CLP enhances firearm performance and reliability using a rare vegetable oil base and a proprietary blend of nanoparticles to create a uniquely smooth and durable surface. RAND CLP is nontoxic, odorless, safe on all metals, polymers and woods and provides faster & easier cleaning after the initial pretreatment.

RAND CLP helps with:
• Carbon build-up/fouling removal
• Rust prevention
• Jamming/malfunctions
• Water displacement 
• Dirt, lint, dust - does not attach to the metal 
• More functional, accurate, durable firearm
• Smoother slide, action and trigger pull

The state of the art nanotechnology we use allows our nano-particles to work their way into the metal in your firearm and form a protective shield against rust, carbon and dirt. The vegetable oil acts as a scavenger, “lifting” the carbon/fouling from the metal, allowing it to be wiped away easily during cleaning.

Description:
Stainless Steel Finish, solid precision machined construction. The AR muzzle brake will reduce recoil & climb which will improve shooting and control. This design reduces recoil, muzzle blast and concussion from the shooters position. Large, flat interior baffle surfaces allow the bullet to pass through while redirecting the rapidly expanding gas to the sides and slightly forward through the Delta and square cut side vents to create forward thrust that counteracts bullet recoil. The higher the pressure, the more counteracting force the comp actually provides. In addition, three tuned ports on top minimize muzzle rise, further helping the shooter keep the sights on target. Solid bottom prevents kicking up a dust signature when shooting prone. The AR Titan PRO competition muzzle brake redirects propellant gasses and reduces recoil and muzzle flip/rise dramatically when indexed properly.

(Contact for pics. They won't load properly) I want something smaller but don't have money to justify buyimg an additional gun at this moment, just so I can have something smaller. But regardless, this gun does have minor holster wear that can actually probably be buffed out. Haven't been too worried about it honestly, it's not like the blueing is coming off. I'd say about 500 rounds through it. I shot steel out of it one time just to see if it would eat it....and it did.  Haven't found an ammo it won't take. Deadly accurate. Shot a few mini steel plate comps at the NRA range when I was in Virginia. 
Included with this gun is 1 safari land iwb leather holster, black kydex iwb,  and 1 coyote kydex owb holster. Hogue black wrap around grips and original walnut grips. 2 factory 7 round mags, 1 eight rd mag (believe it's chip mccormack) and a 10 rd promag. Upgraded combat wilson recoil spring and shok-buffs added. All the internals of this gun have been sanded and buffed for super smooth functioning and cycling. Super light trigger weight. I don't have a scale to measure but I'd be willing to say a hair under 3lbs.    Roughly 20 rounds of horndady 185gr critical defense hollow points.   And between 250-300 rounds of 230 fmj.

I am literally open to ANY offer. I love guns and will not be upset if you offer something besides a cc pistol. If you have a low or mid end gun I would be willing to do any type of trade (I.e. If you have two inexpensive guns I would trade mine for those.     Or if you wanted to do a gun plus cash). Please send me an offer and hopefully we can work something out. If you havw any questions about Gun or work also please feel free.

Everything is there making this a collector. Case is very clean. Other than dust particles, gun is perfect.

This gun has been looked at by two different gunsmiths who both agreed this gun is ready to get a deer this season.  The bore is clean and smooth and the firing pin works.  The butt stock cover plate is missing it was removed to allow a recoil pad to fit on.  I found you can order a replacement online but i wanted to keep this as original as possible.

I waited for the weekend and took it to the range. I shot it and I got to give it to my pals. They were right about hitting what I want and where I want. 

Listen, I am a traditional archer. I hunt with traditional archery equipment. Why? It is because I like the challenge. If I really want to shoot something with a scope, I would just shoot a rifle. So now I am feeling guilty about a purchase that I will never really use. So now I’m selling it. It is in perfect condition. Shot only one day at the range. Got to admit it is a tack driver, but not my style of shooting or hunting. 

It comes with three bolts and quiver. This item is also being sold with string cocker and high quality case. I even upgraded the bolts to high carbon fast flight. Why? Because I'm OCD and a perfectionist and only use the best of the best. Now that pushes it way above the $800 mark.

For those who like to haggle, please don't embarrass yourself. Do the math. Well over $800 with all the accessories and after taxes. $400 FIRM. Local pickup only.

The only trade I will consider is with Rossi 45LC Lever Action 16 inch barrel, Rossi Circuit Judge Rifle, Taurus 992 with both 22LR and 22WMR cylinders, or Kel Tec KSG.
