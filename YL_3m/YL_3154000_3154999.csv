$75 firm per brick. Two brick minimum. I won't ship. Cash only. FOID card required or non-resident State ID.

Chuck Hawk's website says the following about this ammo:

""The Lapua Standard Club is supplied in a 500 round pop-top can and has been called the ""best value in .22 rimfire ammo today."" I really can't disagree. It has done well in every rifle tested, and it makes a lot of common rimfire fodder look sad by comparison. The standard velocity 40 grain round makes little noise and is the most economical ammo Lapua offers. It averages around 1040 fps, is supplied fairly oily, and makes 1 inch ten shot groups at 50 yards child's play with all three test rifles. I've not had any failures to extract or feed; there has been the occasional flyer that turns a half-inch group into a one inch 50 yard group. The Lapua Standard Club also is supplied in 50 round boxes if you'd like to give it a test drive before bulking up."""

Century International Arms VZ2008 7.62x39 caliber semi-automatic Rifles. Originally issued to the Czech army in 1958, the VZ58 is still in use by both the Czech and Slovak armies, their police and customs agents. Though similar to the other rifles of this style in appearance, the VZ58 uses a completely different bolt and fire control system. Even with a machined receiver, the VZ2008 is lighter than most similarly styled firearms with a sheet metal receiver. Features a U.S. made receiver machined out of a bar of premium steel and a quality U.S. made barrel. All metal parts are bead blasted and coated with a non reflective finish. Includes 5-30rd magazines, Magazine Pouch, Bayonet & Scabbard and Sling. Leather mag pouch, mags and accessories will vary in color and condition!

majoity of fragments < 1 % of the bullet weight
fragments loose their energy very quickly and aren't dangerous after a short distance

This model is the green crosshair reticle type and has super clean glass and comes with many extras.  Instead of the typical ARMS QD mount that comes with BCO's, this one comes with a Larue QD mount which I have found to be far better.  The sight comes with a Tenebraex Killflash ordered from the Browe website which will come installed.  Overall, this is one of the most advanced combat sights currently made.

Also included is a custom CNC machined mount to attach and mini red dot sight that has the Fastfire, Doctor, MRDS attachment pattern to it.  I personally used an MRDS on the sight.  Currently, there is only the front lense mount for mini red dots available for the BCO so I had one made to fit on the eyepiece as you often see with issued ACOG sights.  It uses standard cr123 batteries which will come included.

What makes the BCO so special and sets it apart from other top quality sights like the ACOG is its ability to sense the darkness of your target (and not your surroundings) and adjust the brightness of your reticle automatically.  It is a phenomenal technology and works as advertised.  The sight also has manual settings to adjust brightness as well.  With glass a step up in quality from the ACOG, what's not to love?

Parents owned it since new, it had one of Kohler's single cylinder engines in it (well known for issues, feel free to google search it). Long story short the engine blew and I bought it as a little project.

I put a brand new Kohler 26hp Twin Cylinder engine in it. I still haven't ran it long enough to change the original break in oil yet. As you can imagine the boost in power is very nice, especially for thicker grass. The engines both spin at the same RPM, so it doesn't put any additional stress on components, just offers more torque for higher demand. Motor swap was pretty much a direct swap, but did require modification of the exhaust system, plastic motor cover under the metal orange one, and some longer throttle cables.

The SW990 features an internal striker, as opposed to the classical external hammer. I understood the SW990 rendition of the popular Walther P99 was a joint collaboration between Smith & Wesson and Walther . The modified receiver used in the SW990 is supplied by Walther and is manufactured in Germany. Smith & Wesson manufactures the slide and barrel of the SW990 in the United States. The SW990 is double action only and has no manual safety.  

This Smith & Wesson SW990 pistol fires the .40 S&W round. It has a 4"" barrel with an overall matte black finish. It has night sights, fixed rear sights, ambidextrous mag. release, and an under barrel rail. It has been well cared for and rarely shot, which is why I'm looking to sell it.  Got this back when 9mm ammo was hard to find thinking I would change out.  Hasn't been used much so looking to turn it over to someone else who will.  Comes with a generic polymer case and two 12 round mags (I've misplaced the third. If I find it I will include it as well)"

Some history on the HK45c:
Bought and had a Gray Guns trigger job done on it, combined with converting it from original SA/DA to LEM. I've since pulled the Gray Guns worked trigger parts out to install on another gun, so I installed the original SA/DA parts back in. However, the hammer strut and sear axle were polished by Gray Guns who also installed a lighter hammer mainspring, so those 3 items have been left in this HK45c. Gray Guns also polished the original disconnector, control latch, and catch and did some slight modifications on them, so those had to go with the other Gray Guns trigger parts - thus, this HK45c has stock factory disconnector, control latch, and catch from an HK45."

NO NYC. This listing is for THREE magazines. Hit Buy It Once, and you’re buying 3, not 1. Hit Buy It 3 times, and you’re buying 9, and so on. Buyers can take any number of extras we have available at the same per-mag price and no additional shipping charges. From a decade of service with the officers of the Roanoke County Virginia Police, comes these well maintained factory magazines to fit the HK USP 45 Compact Pistols. Manufacturer is Heckler & Koch gmbh of Oberndorf, Germany. Importer is HK USA of Trussville, AL. Construction is serrated side blue steel magazine body, with distinctive German Dovetailed back closure. Spring is single coil steel, and with polymer inner and outer floorplates, and polymer cartridge follower. Each magazine holds 8 rounds of .45 ACP caliber ammunition. These magazines will only fit specimens of the Heckler & Koch USP, Universal Service Pistol, in that series’s Compact variants that are chambered in .45 ACP caliber. They will not fit a full sized USP 45. They will not fit a .40 S&W Compact. They will not fit the feed belt on a Fokker-Flugzeugwerke DR-1 Triplane. They will only fit a Heckler & Koch model USP Compact pistol that is chambered in .45 ACP. Surface detractions are moderate, with contact whitening streaks from insertion and ejection, and from magazine case contact. We rate these magazines as Very Good condition, 80 percent vicinity by our estimate, but photos ought to suffice for our distinguished shoppers to check our grading. Buyers will receive magazines from the same batch as the photo specimens. These magazines carry a retail price in the vicinity of $80 apiece in our area, and they’re not easy to find. Our single mag price is $43.00. We’re offering these genuine HK 8 round mags for the USP 45 Compact, however, in lots of 3 or more at only $36 each. Own 3 for only $ 108.00.

Everything you need to start carrying today!!

Used Kimber Custom TLE II in 45ACP with extra Kimber cocobolo USAF grips/stocks.  Similar to the LAPD SWAT weapons.  Night sights, front and back strap checkering, all the extras.  Outstanding trigger!  Purchased new and now only approximately 800-900 rounds of factory ammo fired (no reloads) without malfunctions. Some slight cosmetic-only holster wear on slide.  This was my carry gun for three years until replaced with a custom 1911.  All original box, stocks, papers, bushing wrench, even gun oil etc., included.  

The holster set is from HBE Leatherworks.  Cordovan IWB DC Tuckable with black alligator trim and one-of-a-kind IWB dual mag holster to match.  I'll include an extra 7rd mag, as Kimber only ships them new with one.  

Check comparable weapons and holsters for yourself.  This is a $1400 value and you would wait months for the holster.  The whole package is yours today for only $900 obo.  

I will entertain selling the holster set separate from the gun.

This arrangement gives the user several carry options. The OSS retains the loaded chamber indicator of the other 24/7 models, and additionally allows visual verification that the pistol is ready to fire as the red end of the striker can be seen when the pistol is cocked.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a single BRAND NEW, factory fresh Bushmaster A3 Gas Piston-Operated AR-15 Rifle, model 90294.  This rifle features a gas piston operating system, which results in drastically cleaner and cooler operation.  


I have just one in stock, and have it SALE PRICED for just $1,299.00 (cash price).


The Bushmaster gas piston system rifles bring new levels of reliability to the AR-15 type rifle platform by eliminating carbon build up, gas leaks and heat within the upper receiver. The gas piston system operates by tapping gas pressure off the barrel, much like the systems found on the AK-47 and FAL.

Functions with a wider range of ammunition – less gas pressure – lower cyclic rate.
Offers improved reliability and control, with cleaner operation and reduced recoil.
Keeps carbon build up and powder residue from reaching and fouling the upper receiver and bolt carrier.

A detented plug in the gas block allows easy cleaning of the system’s hard chrome plated piston. Shipped with operation and safety manual, 30 round magazine and black web sling. One year Bushmaster warranty.

This is a Tac-47 conversion. they did all the work except for the hydrodipping.
This has their proprietary SRT trigger, Autoplug, and Tac-47 Magwell.

This trigger is basically a Geissele trigger for the Saiga 12, it is not the regular tapco trigger everyone uses.

The magwell functions like an AR magwell so you can release the mag with one hand using your index finger. It’s nothing like the magwell on the VEPRs.

It comes with 5 mags (one 12-rounder, four 10 rounders) but any Saiga 12 mag can be modified to fit the magwell.

This is for someone that wants a Saiga 12 converted by one of the best (if not the best) AK customization places in the US, knows the level effort they put into their conversions, and doesn’t want to wait 12 months for it.

The stock grip has been modified slightly to allow for faster reloading, and a Hogue Big Butt Grip is also included. The front sight is a green HiViz Over-molded fiber optic, and the rear is a XS Systems sight. Other important accessories include 6 Safariland Comp 3 speedloaders, 3 IDPA legal North Mountain speed loader holders, and an awesome kydex leather lined Safariland holster. Another accessory is a BMT Moon Clip Reloader. This is a must have tool for reloading moon clips. You just drop in the rounds and give it a twist. Oh, and speaking of moon clips, I have 8 TK Custom stainless steel 6 round clips. Slide your 6 Brownells moon clip holders onto your 5:11 tactical 42in belt and go shooting. Oh, and it all comes in a Competitive Edge Dynamics Professional range bag which has a pistol sleeve and a brass bag included in it. That was a lot to list, but I want you the prospective buyer to fully understand what it is that you are bidding on, and what to expect. I built this kit up over the past 3 years, and I used the gun to shoot IDPA, USPSA, Steel League, and Bullseye. I have shot 3 IDPA matches in which I was down ZERO total points. The gun is very accurate and a pleasure to shoot. I hope that it will go to a good home. Thanks for looking! If you want any more pictures, please let me know."
