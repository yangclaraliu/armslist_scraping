I used the wide type Weaver scope rings to mount the 3X-9X Bushnell Sportview scope so you can use the iron sights while it's in place for maximum versatility. I never did dial in the scope, but as you see this gun's in pristine condition, the action works smoothly and the trigger's crisp. It is CLEAN- I've taken care of this gun just as I do all of my things...but since I can't use it, it needs a new home.

63,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3285063,For Sale:  HEAVY 30-30 WINCHESTER AMMO - 190 GR. JFN @ 2100 FPS (1860 FT.LBS.) - 20 ROUND BOX,"azusa, California, United States",$ 54,"Listed On: Wednesday, July 16, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"https://www.extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=222

Buffalo Bore is introducing a truly Heavy 30-30 Winchester loading. This new load utilizes a 190gr. custom Hawk bullet and gives the venerable 30-30 here-to-for unrealized power and is designed so that the person who owns a 30-30 can now reliably kill elk or moose sized game. The 30-30 can now be carried as a defensive tool in grizzly country and will be much more effective in stopping a grizzly attack than any other 30-30 ammunition in the world. This heavy 30-30 load is not designed for deer, although it will kill deer and if you line them up right, it will kill three or four deer with one shot……….

The custom 190gr. hawk bullet is designed with a harder core and thicker than normal jacket, so the expansion is minimal, thus insuring very deep penetration which is needed to break large bones and destroy organs deep inside large game animals. This load generates an unreal 2100 fps from normal 20 inch carbines—this is the type of velocity that the ordinary 170gr. 30-30 loads generate, but again, we are using a 190gr. bullet. The product SKU# for this load is 28A/20
Check the below real world velocities from my personal stock, over-the-counter firearms—truly amazing.
2071 fps -- Marlin Model 336 20 inch saddle ring carbine circa 1950’s
2061 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2075 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1953
2116 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1963
2172 fps -- Marlin model 336A 24 inch carbine circa 1940’s
2146 fps -- Win. Model 94 20 inch carbine circa 1980’s
2020 fps -- Win. Model 94AE 16 inch Trapper carbine circa 1992
1983 fps -- Savage 99 26 inch rifle circa 1917 - Not a Typo
Note that the longest barrel gave the slowest velocity and even the short 16 inch Winchester trapper model gives faster speeds than the 26 inch Savage 99 rifle, which shows that barrel length is not always the sole indicator of velocities a firearm will generate.
Buffalo Bore always uses stock over-the-counter- firearms that give real world velocities. Other ammunition companies normally use laboratory test barrels which give much higher velocities than stock firearms. We at Buffalo Bore see this long established practice as misleading to the consumer.

This 30-30 loading (Item 28A/20) is safe to use in ANY/ALL 30-30 chambered firearms that are in normal operating condition—no exceptions, no need to “double check” with us."

The Rock Island Armory 1911 series consists of a product line of single-action recoil operated semi-automatic pistols. They are designed and manufactured by Armscor in Marikina City, Philippines, and distributed in the United States by Armscor USA, located in Pahrump, Nevada.

RIA (Rock Island Armory) 1911s are clones of the US Military G.I. M1911-A1, the standard issue US Service pistol from 1911 to 1985. Most RIA models are targeted for the low-end price point of the 1911 pistol market and are basic entry level MIL-SPEC versions of the 1911, however, the RIA Tactical, Compact, and Match models offer additional semi-custom high end features. The Compact model features a skeletonized hammer and beavertail grip safety while the Tactical model also adds a target-grade hammer and trigger as well as an ambidextrous safety, and enhanced contrast combat sights. Armscor is an ISO 9001 certified-compliant company which manufactures Rock Island pistols using CNC (Computer Numerical Control) equipment. RIA 1911 series pistols are constructed of 4140 chromoly steel with a cast frame, and are available in .45 ACP, .38 Super, 9mm Luger, and .22 TCM chamberings.

Its all new in the box never fired FNH FN15 with a very low serial # first production run gun with a new Trijicon Tri Power sitting on top of a new LaRue LT150 QR Tactical mount. The weapon light is a Elzetta c Charlie 333 900 lumens light. This is the brightest light you have ever seen mounted to a weapon. Its sitting in a new Elzetta ZSM mount with optional side rail. Here is the best part it has a new AIMSHOT LS8300 green laser. These are only sold to SOCOM and other SOF around the world they are no longer even sold to LE Agency's. This one came fro Afghanistan by a close friend of mine who is a SFO.  This is the brightest laser you have ever seen bar none. At night it looks like something from STAR WARS and is even bright during the day. You can follow the beam plain as day at night and the dot is the brightest you have ever seen. Comes with 2 tail caps one click and one pressure and zero tool. The only other one of these I have ever seen sold on GB about a month ago for 859$ and it didn't even have the factory mount like this one does! Thanks so much for looking.

Now's your chance to do it in style with a high quality example of solid Russian engineering, all steel and built to last!

This was my first carry sidearm in the 90s but I need to streamline my collection, so I present this fine gun for your consideration. If there's any question, I am the original purchaser of the pistol in 1995, so you can be assured it's been well cared for and never abused or mistreated.

You'll be getting a proven, dependable pistol in this one. I confess I was a bit concerned by its small ejection port when I first purchased it, but I've put a variety of .380s through this Makarov, from inexpensive FMJ range ammo through fancy defensive hollowpoints like Cor-Bon and Remington Golden Saber and I can tell you it's been totally reliable.

No surprise that the pistol's interior is typical Russian: rough as a cob...but everything works beautifully. Adjustable sights and a decocking safety are nice additions that make this gun a pleasure to shoot, as you'll find. The chromed barrel's easy to clean and spotless with no problems, as is its feed ramp.

The IJ70-17A comes complete with its original factory box, spare 8 round magazine, manual and tools. About the only visible clue that the pistol saw use is that being left-handed, I cut off the lanyard loop, smoothed the stubs and blued them for protection and aesthetics. If you're a stickler for absolute authenticity, you can find original black grips with the loop, Russian made and marked as this is with 'Baikal' on eBay all day long.

Please be prepared to present your TN driver's license or handgun carry permit to assure me you're legally able to purchase this firearm, and be willing to sign a bill of sale.

I have no ability to ship this, local FTF only."

The reason it is considered ideal is due to its completely unique safety system, namely the ""squeezecocker"" control surface built into the front of the grip. When the operator picks up the firearm, the main shooting hand instinctually squeezes the panel rearward, and this action cocks the striker rearward while unlocking the sear for use. The panel is spring-loaded, which means when pressure is reduced, it snaps forward, decocking the striker and locking the trigger. This system is also designed to release the slide when it is locked rearward. This design eliminates the need for a decocker, external safety lever OR slide stop lever, making the sides of the firearm completely flush and reducing overall width. The barrel is fixed (does not cant upwards) which means despite the firearm's compact size, it is capable of printing groups of 2 inches or less at 25 yards. This accuracy is easily comparable to many high-end automatic pistols in production. According to H&K the M8 version is rated for +P ammunition. It has classic three white-dot sights dovetailed into the slide, and comes with one 8 round capacity magazine. I purchased it as ""slightly used"" and have fired approximately 150 rounds through it without a single jam."

Power Pistol smokeless powder is fast burning, consistent, economical and extremely accurate, making this powder an excellent choice for high performance semi-automatic pistols like the 9mm Luger, 40 S&W and 10mm Auto. 


Hodgdon LONGSHOT spherical powder is the most versatile shotshell heavy field propellant Hodgdon has ever produced. Great loads in 10 ga., 12 ga., 16 ga., 20 ga., and 28 ga. are shown in Hodgdon’s Reloading Data. This propellant provides true magnum velocities with superb patterns. In addition, LONGSHOT is the best choice for those competitors shooting games such as ""Buddy"", ""Annie Oakleys"" and more. LONGSHOT is the high velocity pistol choice in 38 Super, 40 S&W, and 357 SIG at lower than usual operating pressures.

The concept was to build a rifle that shoots very cheap ammo with modern ergonomics. So even though the base cost of building the rifle was similar to the price of a brand new .308 or 30-06, the cheaper 7.62x54r bullets would save me more money over the long term. This is what I accomplished before I lost interest in the project.

- ATI Stock with cheek riser - for a better cheek weld when aiming with scope
- Removed Iron Sights (A lot harder than you think!)
- NC Star Long Eye Relief 2-7x Scope (in order to clear the straight bolt handle)
- Aluminum pillar bedded 
- Barrel cut down to 24 inches and re-crowned at Oregon Timberwolf Custom Gunsmith
- Threaded barrel for Muzzle Brake

To complete the project the rifle would ideally need a bent bolt handle and receiver mount for a scope. Add a nice scope on it and you have an accurate shooting rifle with modern ergonomics that shoots ammo at the fraction of the price of a .308 or 30-06.

The base rifle is a Mosin Nagant M91/30. It was produced from the Izhevsk Arsenal in 1939. It has a round receiver and is a common rifle so it does not have much worth as a collectible (so no, I do not feel bad ruining a piece of history!), but it does have value as a functional rifle with modern ergonomics that shoots better than its original configuration.

The rifle comes with everything you see in the pictures:

- Ultimate Arms Gear Muzzle Brake
- NC Star Long Eye Relief Scope 2-7x Zoom - Illuminated Sights
- 98x Rounds of Bulgarian Surplus Ammo - Silver Tip 147 grn FMJ
- 35x Rounds of Wolf Performance Ammos - Steel Cased 174 grn FMJ
- 35x Rounds of PPU - Brass 182 grn FMJ (The best ammo I've tested so far)
- 15x Steel Stripper Clips - for quick reloading
- 30 inch cleaning rod
- Firing Pin Gauge / Disassembly Tool
- Okie Head Space Gauge (Not Pictured)

I don't have the original wood stock or accessories other than the firing pin tool. You could probably buy that from someone else for cheap if you are feeling nostalgic for 1941.

If you don't like the price then make me an offer, I just might take it!"

Hey all,
I got a really good deal on a big lot of defense and target ammo, so instead of putting up separate listings for each caliber, I decided to put them into one listing. All of the prices are listed and they are for pickup in Norman. I would also consider trades towards a nice PF9, Full size 357 mag or 38spl +P rated revolver or possibly lever gun, or even potentially a 7.62 Tokarev pistol/carbine. Aside from that I would consider most any gun trades so long as fair on both sides. Just be reasonable on your gun values, i know what guns actually sell for versus what people ask for them. Here is what I have available as of now (I only have the listed items on hand, not everything in picture):

9mm (9x19)
-3X 50rd boxes of Federal Hi-Shok 115gr JHP- $27 each
-7X 20rd boxes of Federal Personal Defense 115gr JHP- $14 each

-7X 20rd boxes of Federal Personal Defense JHP- $15 each

P938 Equinox

Brand New!! NO credit card fees!!
With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

A polished Nitron two-tone slide is paired with a black hard coat anodized frame. Tru-Glo® front and SIGLITE rear sights and Hogue black Diamondwood grips complete this package.

All it needs to be shootable again is.....
1) New charging handle (previous one is chewed up at the handle)
2) Buffer tube that is Professional Ordinance specific, I dont think Bushmaster buffer tubes will fit (the previous has been blown out in the back due to weak construction from repeated firing)
3) Buttstock locking lever needs to be taken out as its broken and replaced to secure buttstock over the buffer tube.

It will come with everything else: Upper & Lower Reciever, Bolt, Firing Pin, Firing Pin Spring, Cam Pin, Recoil Spring and Adaptor. I'll throw in a Master Molder 20 rnd Magazine and a Rifle Case as these werent originally included with the rifle. I dont know how but Im sure someone can make-shift repair or replace the buffer tube and locking lever by someone with the right tools. I am to understand that original parts from Professional Ordinance are hard to find given that they went out of business and was bought out by Bushmaster in the early 2000's.

Like I said, its been given to me so I dont know the round count and I will include more pics upon request. $100 will do and I just would like to take a quick glance at your ID and CPL (if possible) during meet up, Thanks for looking."

I bought it from a customer who told me he took it off of a dead Russian soldier. the serial number on the frame match the cylinder and I am trying to chack the frame plate to make sure they all match. The gun is at about 80% condition most of it is wear and the wear looks mainly from being carried in the holster there is no pitting on the outside of the pistol and the bore looks great for a gun made in 1939. it could be reblued doing a cold blue process? I have 3 boxes of 14rd ammo to go with it. Since it is a gas sealing revolver it is the only one that can truly be silenced. This one is a war relic and I am looking to pass it on to someone who would appreciate it more, Included is 32 rds of ammo and the holster it came with.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of brand new, factory fresh and hard to find CZ 75 SP-01 9mm pistols.  These awesome pistols feature a steel frame with tactical rail, night sights, 2 18-round magazines, and much more!

I only have two in stock, and have them priced to sell for just $609.00 each.

CZ 91152 75 SP-01 9mm Semi-Auto Pistol, Tritium Night Sights, Two 18-round Mags
The CZ 75 SP-01 is the first full size handgun (4.72 bbl) from CZ to feature the improved manufacturing technology and ergonomics of the NATO-approved CZ 75 Compact P-01 model. Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the latest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform.
The SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.
The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The CZ 75 SP-01 model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005 s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

At the same time he decided he also wanted 28 and 410 ga bbls to go with the set so he had original Perazzi barrels custom fit to this reciever and the barrels are re-serial numbered to this gun thus the extra set of stamped serial numbers on the barrels.The 410 barrels are choked Skeet and IC and the 28 ga bbls were Briley choked to add hunting versitility to the 28ga,five tubes come with the 28ga bbls AND THE 28ga BARRELS ARE MID-VENT STYLE.The 12 and 20 ga bbls are choked IC and Imp.Mod I believe, the Perazzi choke code is 4 circles on bottom barrels and 2 circles on top barrels.The condition of all the barrels is excellent,i would rate the barrels at 99% and all lock up to the reciever very tight. My friend who was the original owner hunted with the gun very little and he is not a skeet shooter so the gun has been shot very seldom,and has spent most of the time in hs gun room.I would rate this gun overall at 98%on the wood and 99% on the barrels.The stock and forearms on this gun are outstanding wood and match very well,the stock and forearms do have a few scratches but nothing major no cracks or splits anywhere and nothing that really detracts from the overall look of the gun.The stock also has a very nicely fit old english pad."
