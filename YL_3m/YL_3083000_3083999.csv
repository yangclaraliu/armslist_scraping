With a J-Hook or C-Hook, the holster can tilt and dive; and while a pair of loops on either side or a single wide loop around the belt can provide stability, they can also advertise ""Gun!"" to observers across the room. The solution is the Galco Y-Hook (Patent Pending) premiered on our SkyOps holster. The Y-Hook grips as securely as a full loop, yet disappears to all but the most trained eye when worn on a black belt. The SkyOps Inside The Pants Holster will not win the competition for easy on-and-off nor for quick draw and reholstering. But when it's all about stealth, and wearing a jacket is not an option, the Galco SkyOps Inside The Pants Holster sets the standard against which all others will be measured. Made for semiautomatic pistols, the SkyOps is ambidextrous and available in black finish. Galco's Y-Hook. Concealability without wearing a jacket. Premium saddle leather. The SkyOps fits belts of 1"" and 1 1/4"" width. eCop! Thanks you for your business. MFG MPN: GAL-SKY266B UPC: REDACTED45 MPN: SKY266B

Restrictions apply on ammunition orders, please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for TEN Boxes, a total of 500 cartridges rounds; winning buyer, however, may take any number of additional 10 box lots we have on hand at the same per-box price and with no extra shipping. Here are specimens in the photos from only a few cases we came across of the Russian made Brown Bear ammunition for the 9mm Makarov Pistols that have been so abundant in the past 20 years. It is 9x18 caliber; not .380, not standard 9mm, but for pistols chambered in this caliber only, mostly of Eastern European and Russian provenance. Cases are polymer coated steel, and bullets are 94 grain Full Metal Case Lead Core, effective enough for protection and cheap enough for training, qualification, and range work. Barnaul factory specs show 1001 feet per second muzzle velocity, and 216 foot-pounds of muzzle energy from a CZ83, 3 1/2 inch barreled pistol. Replacement pricing on similar loads from Remington, Winchester, and Federal is $40 per box or more. We’re offering this excellent ammunition, however, at only $13.90 per box in 10 box 500 round lots. Own 500 rounds for only $ 139.00.

175,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3083175,For Sale:  Huntertown Guardian .22 Suppressor New Improved Design for 2014,"Ellisville, Hattiesburg, Mississippi",$ 200,"Listed On: Wednesday, May 16, 2018",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"New for 2014, we've improved the best in class price / performance to implement changes you've asked for. The new Guardian 22 is shorter, stronger, and quieter. And we didn't change the price.

The entire serialized registered part (not just a thread insert, like a few of our competitors) is now made of heat treated 17-4 precipitation hardened stainless steel, protecting your investment in case of a catastrophic failure of your silencer.
A 316 stainless steel tube to handle your most abusive use.
All baffles are encased K baffles, providing a ""tube within a tube"" for ease of cleaning and durability.
The first baffle is stainless steel, with all other baffles constructed from aircraft grade 7075 Aluminum for strength and durability.
Length and outside diameter have been reduced.
Sound level reduction is improved over the earlier Guardian 22 model.
Retail price unchanged at $199.
You could spend hundreds more for another .22 suppressor, but ask your self one question - why? Whether you are looking for outstanding suppression, safety, upgradability, weight, length, longevity, or price, the Guardian 22 has it all.

Suppression

The Guardian 22 compares favorably to silencers costing two to three times as much on the market today, demonstrating our commitment to provide the best sound suppression possible. The Guardian 22 utilizes encased K baffle technology, a tried and true baffle technology used in the quietest silencers available.

Maintenance

Just because you can take a silencer apart when it's clean doesn't make it user serviceable. How many manufacturers claim to have user serviceable silencers, but when you use it you find out their claims are just that - claims. Their special tools break, don't work, or you didn't buy them because they wanted extra money, on top of the price they charge. Or worse yet, you lose or misplace them.

Even if the tool worked, you can't get the silencer apart to clean it yourself, after as few as a couple hundred rounds fired.

As with all Huntertown Arms silencers, all it takes to disassemble your Guardian 22 is a standard, box end, or crescent wrench, a bench vise, pair of pliers, good strong set of jaws, or any other tool that can grab a standard socket. No special tools are required. Ever.

Guardian 22 baffles are fully encased for superior strength and to prevent lead and carbon buildup between the core and the tube, even after thousands of rounds fired. This provides for quick and easy removal of your Guardian 22 core, without the hassle or need of pushers or other devices to remove it.

With the Guardian 22 full user servicability is a reality. We are so confident you will be able to service the Guardian 22 yourself we offer the only clean silencer guarantee in the industry. If your Guardian 22 gets so dirty you can't clean it yourself, send it back to us and we'll clean it for free. Yes, free. Who else makes such a guarantee? No one. How can we do this? Absolute faith in our product.

Upgradability

Your Guardian 22 can be upgraded at any time to the Guardian 22 SS or Guardian 22 Ti, giving you a path to to most capable rimfire silencer we offer.

It has the Polished Alloy  receiver which are very hard to find and it has a couple of very minor handling marks on the stock (safe dings). Includes everything from the factory, Box, Paperwork, and 5 choke tubes.

The CZ 912 is built with a high gloss finish and has a very sleek look with attractive lines both on the alloy receiver and on the walnut stock. The modern style recoil pad provides for not only a significant reduction in perceived recoil, but is snag free as well. A long recoil spring is located in the butt of the stock that simplifies assembly and allows it to cycle a wide variety of loads across the power spectrum both 2 3/4"" and 3"".

I do have the manual on it still, but not the box it came in.

Only put about 120 rounds total through it, over 3 separate occasions. Cleaned it very thoroughly after each session. There are no issues with it whatsoever, no scratches either, only scuff marks by the ejection port from the brass, but it buffs right off. It shoots like you would expect from an FNH firearm, like a dream. Never got around to sighting in the irons, as I threw the scope on the day I got it and went to the range. 

This rifle is practically new still. You can get everything I listed above WITH the gun, for   almost the same price as buying a SCAR-L! It is definitely a powerhouse and lives up to its reputation. It works pretty well for impressing your friends too. 

I am asking $2,400 for it. I will meet you at any gun store of your choosing that is East of I-25, as far south as the Lone Tree Cabela's, and as far north as Sportsman's Warehouse off 25 and 84th in Thornton. If you are out of state, you will pay for any shipping charges, and an escrow service WILL be used for payment.

Restrictions apply on ammunition orders, please read this entire ad carefully before bidding or offering to buy. This listing is for TWENTY Boxes, a total of 100 shotshells or rounds; winning buyer, however, may take any number of additional five box lots at the same per-box price and no extra shipping. Here is our personal favorite buckshot load, Winchester’s 3 inch magnum #1 Buck. It will, our McNairy County neighbors assert, roll a running coyote up into a ball. Our Tishomingo County Mississippi neighbors swear by it on feral hogs, and even during deer season, where the Mississippi Game & Fish Commission rightly recognizes its effectiveness on white tail deer. Manufacturer, of course, is Olin Corp’s Winchester branches of Alton Illinois and Oxford Mississippi. Construction is one piece high brass red polymer heat sealed shell body, loaded with 24 pellets of buffered lead #1 Buckshot. Factory specs are 12 gauge, 3 inch magnum, High Velocity 4 dram equivalent; velocity 1040 fps from a 28 inch barrel. For defensive purposes, it’s somewhat like a 24 round burst from a VZ61, .32 automatic machine pistol, all in one shot. The velocity is the same, only each #1 Buck shot weighs about 45 grains. These shotshells come from the factory in five round boxes, 50 boxes to the case. We’re offering them in 20 box lots of 100 rounds at $6.45 per box. Own 10 boxes for only $ 129.00.

I am a licensed dealer in Waverly IA.  I am looking to offer fair prices for antique or vintage guns.  Although I will buy almost anything, (In the last couple years Ive sold anything from an 1820's musket to Gen 4 Glocks), I really like to deal in guns from mid/late 1800's thru 1960's.  I legally sell most of my guns through internet sources, places where I know I can command a higher price. This means I can offer you more than if I only sold locally.  Some guns have a broader appeal on a national level. I have an FFL, and work in cash.  I do consignments also, especially if you have a rare high dollar item.  Contact me and we can talk shop.

It will still accept a standard AR style upper so you can switch to .223, 300 Black or whatever AR caliber you prefer.

Great for shooting clays, home defense, and WOWing everyone at the range! 

Rock River lower, built with standard military style sights, and Olive Drab Green (OD) Magpul carbine length forearm, Magpul collapsible stock, Magpul trigger guard, and Magpul grip .

Safir Arms flat top railed upper receiver, custom 410 gauge bolt, and smooth bore 410 gauge 18"" threaded barrel. It also includes three 10 round Lancer magazines that have been custom modified for the 410 shell. It has been ""tuned"" and checked out by a leading Gunsmith/Armorer and shoots great! The bolt will still accept the impossible to get Safir 410 magazine. I can make more modified Lancer magazines if you want them at $65 a piece.

Included is a manual and a list of the 410 shells that work best with this setup.

I'm asking $1800 or best offer, local sales prefer but with ship to FFL at your cost.

Handles and shoots like an AR-15, uses standard AR parts, way cooler than a Saiga, and is extremely unique and rare. The semi-auto operation is done through an ingenious hybrid gas piston ring blowback/recoil operated system, that is very reliable and keeps the chamber extremely clean. Only 50 rounds through the rifle for ""tuning"" and testing.

I bought four of these parts kits in a package from the importer and wanted to build them so others could enjoy them as much as I enjoy the two that I'm keeping.

Will trade for USC, SL8-6, ACR, Tavor 18"", SCAR 308, KZ-9mm, FNX-45, P227

PS: I have had a lot of requests to do more conversion's of Safir rifles to use Lancer Magazines. Because of the costs of the custom parts and time involved I will not be doing any more of these conversions until this rifle has sold.

Like the original Henry U.S. Survival Rifle, this innovative, semi-automatic model is lightweight (3.5 lbs.) and highly portable. At just 16.5″ long, when all the components are stowed, it easily fits into the cargo area of a plane, boat or in a backpack. It’s chambered in .22 LR so you can carry a large quantity of ammunition without adding much weight to your gear.

When disassembled the pieces fit inside the impact-resistant, water resistant stock. Assembly is as easy as attaching the receiver to the stock, inserting the barrel, and screwing on the nut. In a few seconds, without any tools, the Henry U.S. Survival AR-7 is ready for action. It comes standard with a sturdy steel barrel covered in tough ABS plastic that’s coated with Teflon™ for complete protection against corrosion. It’s engineered for perfect balance and the ability to maintain its tack-driving accuracy, even after thousands of rounds.

The receiver is also coated with Teflon™ for superior weatherproofing and waterproof protection, even in harsh saltwater environments. The updated receiver is grooved, making it easy to top off with your favorite optics.

All models are equipped with an adjustable rear sight and a blade front sight.

 This pistol has a great single action trigger with a clean break, and the trigger reset is phenomenal, one of the best you'll ever feel.

This pistol features the rotating barrel action, which is inherently recoil-reducing, as well as lowering the bore axis, again serving to lower felt recoil. This is a very soft shooter.

Hey everyone, 
this listing is for a used but in great condition Mossberg 702 Plinkster 22lr rifle. It is a 10rd magazine fed semi-auto rifle in synthetic. It has the ability to take up to a 25 round magazine (like the 715T) and features a last round hold open (a lot of 22lr rifles don’t have this). I bought this new and have had zero problems with this rifle. I wouldn’t sell this, but I got another semi auto 22lr and don’t need two of them. So I decided to sell this one so someone else could get all the pleasure out of her! This will come with the original box and paperwork and will need a Bill of Sale. This rifle has given me no problems and only needs a good cleaning! Would also trade for Derringer pistols or most other kinds of guns (no shotguns unless its a pump 12 gauge). Would also trade for a good amount of 45, 380, or 9mm ammo. 
Thanks and happy hunting!"

The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster."

The gun is in good condition and only shows minor wear. This gun has night sights installed but they have dimmed somewhat from time. Included with the gun is a hard carry case, two 12 round magazines, lock, and all factory literature. 

The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Year is 1986, chambered in .357 Magnum, Full underlug

Gun is in excellent condition, cleaned after every outing. Recently sent to S&W for recall work. They replaced the firing pin and a bushing. Lockup is perfect, shoots without a hitch. I absolutely love this gun, and will not sell it for less than $800 or trade it for anything besides what I am looking for.
