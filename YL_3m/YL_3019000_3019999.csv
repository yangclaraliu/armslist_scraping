Excellent gun for bird hunting. The Nitro Mag is chambered for 2 3/4"", 3"" and 3 1/2"" shells. The entire receiver and barrel have an ArmorLokt coating to prevent rust, scratching or abrasions. This gun has seen light duty use only but I would not hesitate to use this in the harshest of conditions. With the action based off the world famous 870, this is a gun you can depend on. This gun also has a patened SuperCell recoil pad that reduces the felt recoil by 54%. That makes a heavy mag load feel like you are shooting a light field load. Call, text or Email for more information or additional pics. I will post some actual photos soon. This gun is in perfect condition. This gun retails for just over $500 new. Priced for quick sale. 871-4786."

With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

 With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
 accuracy in a pistol its size.

 Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
 ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters.

.357SIG Traditional DA/SA triggers, and 9mm options will be available in the future.

most subcompacts.
New P224™ Subcompact a Classic SIG SAUER®, with One Small Change An ideal concealed carry or back-up gun, the P224 is an especially good choice for those familiar with the SIG SAUER manual of arms. From the full-sized P226® to the P229 to the P224, the controls and operation all remain the same.
The P224 accepts newer P229 magazines, allowing users to carry a full-size spare magazine as a backup to the flush-fit P224 magazine. Law enforcement officers will appreciate not having to carry separate magazines solely for their backup guns."
