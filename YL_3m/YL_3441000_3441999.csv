The Beretta CX4 Storm is a semi-automatic rifle chambered in 9mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP. The gun is the civilian version of the Beretta Mx4 Storm and is one of two rifles offered by Beretta. Beretta recommends the gun for sporting and personal defense.

The CX4 Storm features a blowback operating system, so the expanding gases that push a round through the barrel also push back onto the bolt to cycle the action. 

Features include an ambidextrous controls. The CX4 Storm utilizes a front sight adjustable for windage and elevation with a rear sight that includes long and short range apertures of 50 and 100 meters. And both sights can fold down. However, the carbine is also equipped with a Picatinny rail, which allows for easy mounting of optics and accessories.

Beretta is the oldest active firearms manufacturer in the world. It produces shotguns, hunting rifles, assault rifles, submachine guns, revolvers, and pistols. Beretta is based in Italy."

ENDO Tactical Glock Stock Adapter ( Threaded for an AR15 buffer tube) fits FULL SIZE Glock pistols only. Slips in the back of the grip frame and is secured through the lanyard hole.

KAK Industries ""Ultimate SB15"" Pistol buffer tube (will not accept collapsible or fixed stocks, made specifically for the Sig Tac SB15 arm brace)

Before anyone bashes me, these are parts only! SB15 ARM BRACE NOT INCLUDED. If you read the ATF letter that comes with SB15 brace you will see that the addition of the brace to a pistol does not change it's classification, and since the ATF has ruled there's no illegal way to fire a pistol: i.e. shouldering the SB15 arm brace. All you need to do is snag up said arm brace, install it, and you have a Glock Personal Defense Weapon you can make 100 yard hits with all day long! I will ship on your dime, payment required before shipping."

This Base Carbine upper comes equipped with a 16"" melonite-finished barrel, A2 flash hider, ion-bonded bolt carrier group, charging handle assembly, picatinny rail gas block, 30-round magazine, delta ring assembly and a set of polymer M4-style handguards. Additional features include a forged A3 flat-top configuration that's ready to accept the shooter's choice of optic and/or rear iron sight, M4 feed ramps to help ensure reliable feeding and functioning during rapid strings of fire, and a carbine length gas system. Also includes a Wolff extra power hammer spring to ensure proper ignition of foreign military surplus ammunition with hard primers. 

The upper's barrel has been finished inside and out with Adams Arms' proprietary QPQ Melonite treatment that bonds with the metal on a molecular level. Also referred to as salt bath nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, extending a barrel's service life by reducing the friction produced inside the bore upon firing for a net decrease in bore surface wear over time. Nitriding converts the barrel steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. The end result is a barrel that's capable of producing accuracy on par with a match stainless steel tube, while also exhibiting the longevity and resilience of a chrome lined, mil-spec barrel. The QPQ Melonite finish protecting the barrel, piston components and flash hider is so corrosion resistant and durable that it is not adversely affected by prolonged exposure to the corrosive primer residue that's often left behind after firing military surplus 5.45x39mm ammo. While immediate cleaning of all steel parts after shooting corrosive ammunition is still recommended, it is not necessary. 

All Adams Arms uppers feature a short stroke gas piston operating system, which prevents hot gas and debris from being directed back into the action upon firing. The result is a rifle that runs cooler, cleaner and more reliably than those utilizing a standard direct gas impingement system of operation. To ensure that damage doesn't occur to the buffer tube from carrier tilt, the bolt carrier is equipped with enlarged ""skis"" to help guide it into the receiver extension. The bolt carrier's solid steel, 1-piece construction incorporates an integral piston strike face to guarantee integrity over time, while the bolt assembly is spring loaded for proper lock-up and to help reduce bolt bounce and cam pin wear. All piston components are finished in QPQ Melonite for corrosion resistance and easy cleaning/maintenance.

Limited Warranty Terms and Conditions
Davidson's, Inc. warrants to you that if any gun sold by Davidson's ever becomes defective, Davidson's will replace the gun at no charge, subject to the following conditions. This warranty applies only if Davidson's Supply Company sold the gun to the retailer from which you purchased it and extends only to the original purchaser from the retailer. In order to be eligible for warranty coverage, the original purchaser must complete the warranty registration online or return the warranty registration card to Davidson's, Inc., at the address shown below, within 30 days from date of purchase. If no replacement is available, we will repair the original or offer you a similar model (to be determined at our discretion) free of charge. This warranty extends to any and all parts of the gun as originally sold by us, but does not extend to guns altered or rebuilt after their original purchase, or guns used other than for their legal intended purposes. DAVIDSON'S LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO REPLACING OR REPAIRING THE NONPERFORMING OR DEFECTIVE GOODS (TO BE DETERMINED AT OUR DISCRETION). WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, EITHER DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. To obtain performance under this warranty, you must return the product to the retailer from which you purchased the product and pay the cost of shipping the product to Davidson's. If the retailer is no longer in business, you may contact another Retailer Near You or us directly at Davidson's, Inc., 6100 Wilkinson Drive, Prescott, Arizona 86301, REDACTED.

Handguns are shipped out for next day delivery while long guns are typically received by your dealer within 3-4 days of shipping. If we do not have a replacement or you elect to get the same repaired firearm back, your firearm will be sent to the factory or an authorized warranty station for repair. If your firearm is repaired, the time frame until we return your firearm will be longer.

756,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3441756,For Sale/Trade:  1/2 MOA accurate DMR style AR,"NE Knoxville, Knoxville, Tennessee",$ 775,"Listed On: Friday, August 29, 2014",Rifles,no type,no type,no type,Rifle,"DMR style AR with a 16"" SS barrel built on a brand new billet lower. Trigger is brand new and breaks at a clean 4 pounds. Magpul Furniture. Free float tube. 

Actual round count on this matched barrel/bolt is probably under 300 rounds. The gun has ALWAYS been stored in a climate controlled area.

The barrel is a match chambered SS 9 twist barrel with a carbine length gas system for reliability. Has a forward assist and dust cover. The barrel sits inside a brand new knurled free float tube. It has a charging handle with a steel extended handle to clear optics when charging the rifle. The SS barrel has been painted. A 9 twist barrel will easily stabilize anything up to 75 grains. 

The barrel is extremely accurate. The group in the pictures below was last time this barrel was shot. It has proven to be extremely accurate with several different bullet weights. That is a .372"" CTC group at 100 yards, how many AR's do you know that can do that?

Since that group was shot I installed a brand new free float tube as well as installed the upper on a brand new Valley Ordinance Works billet lower with all brand new internal parts. The lower was assembled as a pistol first and I can write a affidavit declaring such as well as provide a picture as proof it was.

The trigger was professionally done, breaks cleanly at 4 pounds and is 100% reliable. It has a Magpul rifle stock with a QD point and plenty of storage in the back. It has a heavy buffer carbine buffer to ensure reliability with a spacer installed to be able to use a rifle length buffer tube. By using a carbine buffer means you can swap out various buffer weights and not be stuck with a single weight like when you have a rifle buffer. It has a marksman style pistol grip that is adjustable for hand size. All parts on this billet lower are brand new.

The upper receiver was squared to ensure the rifle is consistently accurate. This is the same thing that is done by all the high end AR builders when ultimate accuracy is the priority. Here are pictures of the process.

http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v446/Adyth/7d7c8d15_zps84131b7a.jpg

All work was done by a professional. This is an extremely accurate rifle without the weight normally associated with ARs as accurate as this. This would be an excellent hunting rifle because it does not weigh a ton and is easily carried in the field. Would be a great gun for hunting coyotes, deer or pigs.

It has a B.E. Meyers flash hider and is considered one of the best money can buy, a $100 value.
http://www.weaponoutfitters.com/be-meyers-flash-hider-for-5-56mm-weapons-1.html
I have tested it at night and it eliminates the flash.

There are some minor marks on the upper from the scope being mounted but nothing too bad.

I will include either a 20 round Lancer magazine or a 30 round Magpul magazine.

Will take partial trade of M92 AK pistol. Will require $200 plus the M92 AK pistol. If you have the 75 round drum magazine I will only need $100 on top.

If you are in the Knoxville area I can meet you at a public range to shoot the gun."

The Heckler and Koch 416 Pistol is a handgun version of the H&K 416, chambered in .22LR. This 17.5 inch pistol is made with the same metal upper and lower receivers as the .22 416 rifle. Like the other .22 LR firearms offered by Umarex, the 416 is a dedicated .22. The barrel measures 9 inches in length and its rails are machined. The 416’s pistol grip has a storage compartment for small tools or batteries and the sights can be removed to make room for a pistol optic.

The magazines for the .22 caliber 416 pistol are the same as the .22LR 416 rifles. They are made of high-strength polymer and designed to make loading simple and efficient. They’re available in either a 20- or 10-round version. The estimated retail price for the 416 pistol is $459.

Operation

A blowback system operates the .22 caliber HK 416 Pistol. The dust cover functions and the bolt remains open when the magazine empties. The rear sight is adjustable for windage and elevation and its safety selector rotates 90 degrees from ‘On Safe’ to ‘Fire’."

896,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3441896,For Sale:  1800's Smith Double Barrel 12 Gauge Damascus - Restored,"Bothell, Seattle, Washington",$ 450,"Listed On: Monday, October 20, 2014",Muzzle,no type,no type,no type,Muzzle Loader,"This is a beauty.  If you're reading this...you're interested, so go ahead and make me an offer.  I completely restored this shotgun, from the inside out.
The Stock:  The patina from a 200-year-old piece of wood was maintained, in terms of dark stains etc.  The checkering was freshened up, all cracks repaired, sealed and coated with over 20 coats of Tru-Oil before I buffed it out with Rottenstone and applied the final stock wax!  Simply perfect, and beautiful.  Contact me for more pictures, I couldn't upload that many.

The Hardware:  All steel Hardware was rust-blued and turned out fantastic without compromising the etching.  The Locks were completely disassembled, polished, and the back side of each lock was jeweled.  

The Barrel:  The rib was completely removed as it was loose.  The resolder job is perfect, the barrel rings like a bell when you give it that test.  I then reblued the barrel using the old-school rust blue with Ferric Cloride Acid bath to etch the Damascus barrel appropriately.  

The only part of this that was not touched, was the inside of the barrels.  They do show their age, but are clean.  I didn't want to invest in the back-boring hardware to pull that job off.  

I know you'll enjoy this beauty!  I'm not a shotgun guy, but did enjoy the restoration.  Time to sell it and move on to the next project.  Contact me if you're interested.  I have many pictures both before, during and after the project was completed.

I have a DPMS AR-15 for sale. It is a flat-top rail that has a Bushnell Trophy Red/Green Dot Sight on it.  The sight has 4 different optics (small and large dot, cross hairs, and the famous dot within the circle).  It is also waterproof/fog-proof, has a light filter for low light situations (it is NOT night vision). 

The weapon itself is practically brand new for being a little over a year old (bought it new at cabelas last year).  It has had less than 150 rounds (I would probably say less than a 100 honestly but I am not 100% sure). other than it sat in my safe (I have two currently) and it got oiled (lightly not excessively oiled) about once every two months so she is really clean).  I do not have it sighted in very well though most of it was just pot shots being taken at the time and I never got around to sighting it in. It has the adjustable buttstock, dust-cover, and forward assist, and has the 16 in barrel.

I am asking 800 OBO the Bushnell was a little over $100 and I got it on sale at that. 

I know I am long winded on here but I try to be as detailed as possible that way I don't waste your time or mine.  I have a few more pictures if needed.   My phone number is REDACTED you can either call me or just respond to this posting. Thank you for reading it; Dustin.

I am not new to this game, I have bought and sold guns before. I have done alot of research about this gun. The gun must have all the factory goodies, extra stuff is nice too. I am offering 430 for LNIB, and 380 for used condition with slight scratches and a few round count. I am offering this much because I know that I can get it brand new for 500, plus extra mags and mag holster. 

I have a few items to trade too if you are interested:
•Yoshimura Exhaust
•Honda EZ90 Cub
•Wheels and Tires (225/70R15 5x5.5 Bolt Pattern)

And 1,760 rounds ( yes, one thousand seven hundred sixty ) of federal lake city 149 grain 7.62x51 new factory ammo; purchased in January of this year i store in ammo cans; 
I have all original boxes for EVERYTHING; this gun was professionally cleaned by a local gunsmith with 29 years experience when it came out of the box, and again after the one and only range session I had getting optic sighted in. It had 240 rounds of the ammo listed above thru it; along with a box of 20  Winchester 180 grain super ammo; I don't recall the exact name of the ammo, I just remember it being 40.00 a box. I am not a good shot, but it's almost boring hitting the gong at 700 yards. Deadly accurate, FLAWLESS condition, and just the most complete set up one could wish for. But , a ramjet 502 engine into my 66 chevelle is more important. I priced everything almost to the penny, with shipping, it would be right at the 5200.00 mark with shipping.  I don't  HAVE to sell this, I want to. I think 3500.00 or best offer is massively reasonable. The sigs are on gunbroker for around 1800.00; the optic with a no questions asked lifetime warranty lists at 549.00; the mags totaled 558.00; the bipod was 186.00; the foregrip was 70.00; the mount was 90.00; the 50 round drum was 280.00; and the ammo at the moment is 344.00 per 500 rounds, plus shipping, that's about 1350.00 with shipping,  cheapest I could currently locate online. The vortex scope level and the ammo cans are a other 100.00. Any one serious is more than welcome to speak to my gunsmith ; he will attest to the rifles condition.
