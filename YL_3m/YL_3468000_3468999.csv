I had purchased this with the intent to use it for hunting, however my free time has been slashed and I will not be able to properly mount/anchor/zero/hunt/maintain in the near future.  Looking for a good home that can make use of this, i just don't like having it sit around.  This was mounted for ring placement and eye relief, but no rifle was fired nor was any loctite applied to any threads in the scope rings.  It is in like new condition.  I have the box and all the papers.  It's decent glass, I just don't have time for long range shooting right now.
i'll throw in some 1"" scope rings with the sale.  I can throw in some other goodies here and there to help the sale along.

Savage made some transition models which had both safeties in 1960 when it transitioned from the lever safety to the tang safety.  However, this one is well before that.  There's not a lot of information out there on this gun as there's not that many out there with this configuration, but the best guess is that Savage may have offered a retrofit where the tang safety could be added to the earlier guns with the lever safety.

Rainier offers a large selection of swaged lead core copper plated bullets that are low in cost but substantially high in accuracy. Rainier swages their bullets twice with lead wire in an effort to ensure the tightest uniformity as well as prevention of premature wearing of barrels. While Rainier doesn't publish their own reloading information, they recommended using lead bullet load data when loading their bullets as well as a slight taper crimp. Rainier recommends a maximum velocity of 1,500 fps. 

These bullets feature a lead core that is completely covered by copper plating. They are resized after being plated with approximately 0.004"" of copper plating. This unique design makes them suitable for most indoor ranges, which often require the use of bullets with no exposed lead. The base is slightly concave to maximize the bullet to bore seal."

It features a blued steel 1 7/8-inch barrel chambered in .38 Special +P and an attractive and seldom-seen case-hardened frame. It comes in its blue plastic factory case numbered to the gun along with all paperwork plus fired casing (dated October 2007) and internal lock keys.

      Up for trade is my mint Schecter Stiletto Elite 5 string bass.  This is a high end, neck through bass, with active EMG pickups, and rare black headstock.  I own many instruments, and basses, and bought this some years back, because I fell in love with the finish, look, and feel...and thought I'd need a five string.  Instead, I have stuck to playing all of my four strings...on the rare occasion I'm playing bass (I'm a guitar player).  

Needless to say, this thing has literally been played, a handful of times, and it's in pristine, showroom condition.  There is no wear on this bass guitar.  I've got nearly $900.00 in this bass, but would be interested in a straight across trade, as I don't use it.

562,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3468562,For Sale:  Leupold Mark 4 LR/T Illuminated TMR 4.5-14x50mm,"Vancouver,WA, Portland, Oregon",FREE,"Listed On: Saturday, September 6, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hi Im selling my Leupold Mark 4 illuminated TMR reticle 4.5-14x50mm (30mm main tube). I had this scope for a little over a month (still have box). Reason Im selling is that I was planning on doing more long range shooting than I actually have time for (or the money). This scope was going to be used as duel use for long range shooting and (long range) hunting. The fact that it is illuminated helps with the first and last minutes of hunting when it is still dark outside. Each level of illumination has an off between each level of brightness (which is much better than Nightforce scopes that have a preset level of brightness which cant be changed quickly). The glass on this scope is as clear as you will ever see. This is almost the best scope that I have owned, but when you get into such high-end quality scopes, the difference in quality is hard to tell. I need the money right now for another project and because I am not using this scope to its fullest potential. 

The scope is in like brand new condition. It is currently held by Burris extreme tactical rings (low), that have been lapped. Lapping reduces any pressure points the rings can put on the scope from any manufacture imperfections on the rings. This translates into a better secured scope and equal pressure all around the body of the scope. 

The anti-cant is a Holland Signature Series. I believe this is the best anti cant as it is very clear and strong yet not bulky. 

The rail is an EGW 20 MOA rail for a Remington 700 Long Action. A small part of the rail was cut off (by a gun smith) on the front end so the scope would not be so close to the end of the rail. 

I paid:
Scope $1400
Rings $63
Anti cant $65
Rail $45
----------------------------
Total $1573

Asking $1425 for all (will sell without rail so itll be minus $45 from asking price)
This is a package deal of a minimum of the scope, rings, and anti-cant. My loss is your gain!

You are more than welcome to check out the scope but only serious inquiries. 
Scope will remain on rifle until I have cash in hand. I have no other scopes for my rifle so for the time being I need this one on it. 

Will only trade for Smith and Wesson M&P 40 C.O.R.E. Long Slide (5” barrel) or Glock 40 S&W or 10mm that have a Leupold Deltapoint or Trijicon RMR on it or can accept it (by that I mean the slide is already drilled and tapped) or an FNP-40 that accepts red dots.

They will look nice on a dark colored 1911.



DLP Tactical laser grips for 1911 pistols.

Color is FDE / Tan

Fits most all single stack full sized 1911 based pistols.
 (Does NOT fit compact/ officer models, or pistols with ambidextrous safety or extended slide stop, sorry).

Installs in seconds, no modification to pistol needed.

Compatible with most all standard holsters due to unique grip mounting system.

Adjustable windage and elevation.

Powered by 2 CR2032 batteries (included)

Battery life approximately four hours continuous run time.

""Instant on"" front strap pressure pad activation with secondary master on/off switch for storage.

5 MW Peak, 1/2"" at 75feet,  650NM output.

Originally marketed for airsoft use but don't let that dissuade you, these are rugged enough for real steel.  They have torture tested another pair for over 50,000 rounds and they still hold zero just as well as the first day we installed them.


Note: This laser grip fits 99.9% of manufactured full sized 1911 pistols, however due to the great number of different 1911 manufacturers and dimensional differences between them, there are a small number of pistols these grips may not fit. For example, very slim frames may require a shim between the frame and pressure switch to properly activate it, while very fat frames may create a point of aim for the laser that is outside of the range of the windage and elevation adjustment screws to correct for.
Very similar to Crimson Trace grips."

This is the original m1,not the second run. It has Smith and wesson stamped on the side . 

I will not ship this gun nor will I sell out of state.

If my listing is up then its still available.

Thanks!"

I've installed a tapco slide stock because an AK47 with standard wood furniture is just to short to shoot comfortably, I've installed a sweet UTG PRO rail, a very nice tapco muzzle break, a tapco g2 trigger, a kick ass multiple setting red/green reflex sight, a comfortable 2 point bungee sling, a magpul grip with well in handle to store extra oil or bullets as well as a swampfox front grip that also holds spare ammo.  This rifle comes with 3 steel 30rd mags, 1 tapco polymer 30rd mag and about 250rds of steel core ammo. This Wasr has straight sights and no mag wobble. She has some marks and wear but any well used AK47 does. 
This rifle is worth $725.00 in trade. Due to sanctions, these ak47s will be hard to find in a few months. FIREARM TRADES ONLY. LOWBALL OFFERS WILL BE IQNORED."

Impossible to ignore, this limited edition Golden Boy is enhanced with a stunningly embellished receiver marking the 200th Anniversary of the Star-Spangled Banner in 2014 and celebrating the bicentennial of the War of 1812. Designs created with engraving and 24K gold plating on nickel pay tribute to Fort McHenry and the Star-Spangled Banner. On the right side an image of Fort McHenry is accompanied by the banner text “O’er the Land of the Free,” and the left side bears, the 15-star American flag and the banner text “Star Spangled Banner.” Known as the Great Garrison Flag or Star-Spangled Banner, a flag bearing the 15-star design flew over Fort McHenry through 25 hours of bombardment by the British on the night of September 13-14, 1814. In the morning the flag still flew above the ramparts and signaled that Fort McHenry remained in American hands, a triumphant revelation famously captured by the Francis Scott Key poem later put to music, retiled “The Star-Spangled Banner” and adopted as the United States Anthem.

....that make GLOCK firearms famous!

The new Gen4 has several new features designed to satisfy the most demanding consumers. It is based on a full size frame with a reduced short frame trigger mechanism housing. The multiple back strap system allows the user to change the circumference of the grip to fit their individual hand size.

The grip has three options; a short frame version, medium frame or large frame that are easily changed and secured with a single pin.

The grip angle of the GLOCK ""Safe Action"" Pistol is not changed by back strap modifications. This ensures that the shooter does not shoot high or low when modifying the back strap or when shooting with a different GLOCK Pistol.

The new Rough Textured Frame (Gen4 RTF) surface designed to enhance grip traction and is present on the frame as well as the interchangeable back straps.

Stock is really pretty - it's not showing the typical ""Beaver Chewing"" you are probably used to seeing.   It may have been refinished before I bought it - it looks like someone tried to fill a ding on the forestock with some wood filler.  I left it there, though.

The butt end of the stock shows some beautiful tiger striping.  The stock looks like walnut to me - but it is very light walnut.  Definitely not the typical Beech.

Shoots very well. Plug was removed so it takes 5 shells. I still have the plug. Comes in original Box, cokes, choke tool and youth/adult stocks. The adult stock is on it now.
