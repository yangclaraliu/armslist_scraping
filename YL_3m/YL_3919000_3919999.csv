Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). 


The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

Important Final Notes:
This rifle has some blemishes. On the gas block, under side of the upper(near forward assist), and on the lower(on top of the buffer from the charging handle). If you want me to cover them up with Aluminum Black before sending/meeting you-free of charge- but understand that minor aesthetic damage has zero affect on the proper operation of the rifle, and the oly failures I have had in 1080 rounds through it were FTEs when I put a brass catcher on it, and have had NO FTFs.
This rifle does not come with iron sights.
This Rifle comes with extra parts(no charge) listed above as part of the deal in order to ensure you can go straight from the deal/FFL transfer to the range, and perform proper maintenance on the rifle or change out required parts.
I AM willing to ship this to you, state regulations allowing, but you must cover the cost of shipping yourself.
No picture of the Spam Can, sorry, Armslist only let me post so much in the way of data, but will send pictures of spam Can, optic, or anything else requested.

Other info: 
I am selling this rifle to make room for other projects.
This rifle is 127 years old and 98% original. I found it last year, and decided it needed to be returned to its former glory. During the restoration, I could not find an original Cartridge Lifter Lever, so it has a modern manufactured to original specs installed (made of modern steel). Also, there is a very small screw (Key Retaining Screw) that is not matching (numbered 27), but is period original and correct for this rifle. I did a total disassembly, and all other parts and pieces are present, matching and in working order.

The stock was repaired in one spot prior to my acquiring the rifle. 

It has a Unit Mark, but years of rust have made it almost unreadable. The buttplate is pitted, but all rust has been removed.

Bore is bright and looks beautiful, sharp lands and grooves.

I have not fired it, but it should function just fine.

Bore is good, wood is good. Has 4 leather ammo pouches, some kind of canvas bag, oil can, shoulder strap. It has a triangle with an arrow. Not the star with an arrow so it is not a Tula. It was manufactured in 1942 in Izhevsk Soviet Union. I believe they had three manufacturing periods. Has a round chamber. Numbers all match except the pig sticker. Number is very low considering how many they produced. Having a serial number that is 5000 or so would mean that this is one of the first series of rifles produced at that plant's manufacturing period.  It does not necessarily change the value of the rifle, but since they produced in the millions it is an interesting discussion item. The re-tooled action parts are marked clearly with a star symbol.

It has been outfitted with a Pierce beaver tail extension for those of us who have huge hands and do not particularly care to have a semi automatic pistol slide rake across the webbing between our thumbs and pointer finger every time we fire a shot-because that gets very old very fast.

It has been ""stippled""-see picture. This stipple job resembles the butt-side of a retarded octopus on pretty much the entire grip surface of the pistol. While aesthetically appalling, this surface texture provides a very superior grip...wet sweaty hands, or gloved hands are not going to be any problem.

This pistol has been carried quite a bit, and as such the finish on the metal has worn, particularly on the muzzle end of the slide. It has standard, non-night sights and all internal parts are stock.

On the plus side, this thing will eat pretty much any ammunition you feed it and spit out lead, regardless of make or manufacturer-I've yet to find a round it wont cycle. It will run dirty without any issues-as Glocks are famous for.

It won't win you a date or a beauty pageant, but it will shoot flawlessly, every time.

Lead - sold out - figure $18 a box - http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/43067
box of mixed ammo: see below - figure $30 due to all the personal defense ammo
33 hollow points - some double tap (+p), some federal (+P), some winchester.
17 lead head bullets - 1 round is winchester, rest are stamped RP.

That comes out to around $100 in ammo then you would have to add shipping, or buy it at the store for about $140.

Also comes with a holster.  Holster is either IWB left handed or OWB and small of back for right hand.  Figured around $20 (probably worth more based on the leather) for the holster

So new with the ammo you are looking at $581 to $621.

For that reason I figured around $480 would be a good deal.

Will need to check PTP or PTC and match it with your drivers license.

Can send more pics of pistol and ammo via text or email.

I am selling it because I need the cash for moving and i haven't really had the time for shooting lately.

I have only owned this gun for about 6 months and have put just under 500 rounds through it. It has been cleaned and oiled every time it goes back into the safe and is still in great condition. 

This model is the 5in barrel optics ready model so the top of the slide is already milled from factory to take micro red dot sights, like the Trijicon RMR, or Burris Fastfire series. This stock iron sights are also taller so it can co-witness with the red dot sight. 
The only modification I have added to the gun is an Apex Tactical Competition trigger kit, so it has a nice light crisp trigger pull. This kit was installed from Calibers shortly after i purchased the pistol.

This pistol comes with
- 3 Magazines ( Pistol came with 2 so you get and extra 17rd mag)
- All of the Original hardware , all of the different size back straps and factory case (The large back strap has been half stippled.
- Uncle Mikes Retention carry holster
- Safariland Open top concealment holster Model 5198

**** You must be 21 and must show a valid New Mexico State ID. I will also require that a bill of sale is filled out. If you cannot legally own this handgun please do not contact me!****

If I have to ship, I will get you a quote for Priority Mail shipping with insurance, tracking and adult signature confirmation direct from my FFL to yours.

Selling my FNP 40, in flat dark earth. This is the USG variant with a safety/decocker that can be carried cocked-and-locked like a 1911. I've had this for several years now and have yet to fire it. Finish is 99.999%. The slide and barrel are nitrided stainless steel using the Melonite QPQ process and other steel parts are also made from nitrided stainless steel as well. Standard 3-dot sights and reversible magazine catch. Three 14-round stainless steel magazines. Will come with the ammo loaded in the magazines, which is 180gr Winchester Ranger T-Series. This gun has been kept clean, babied and is immaculate. Note: I am also giving you 700 rounds of mixed ammo, consisting of 50 round boxes of Winchester Q4369 180gr JHP, Federal Tactical HST and Winchester Ranger T-Series.

I insist upon selling this gun as as package deal. It will come with a Galco Concealable open-top pancake holster which is in like-new condition and has seen little to no use except testing for fit. Holster was around $90 new. It is right-handed with a FBI-style cant, sized for a 1.5"" gun belt. The gun also comes with an EFK Firedragon National Match stainless steel barrel, which is EDM machined and button-rifled, affording full chamber support and the use of cast lead and other types of non-jacketed bullets with no ill effect. This barrel was over $150 new and will come with the gun.

See above about the included 700 rounds of quality .40 S&W JHP.

Again, I insist upon selling this as a package and I insist upon a FTF transaction for cash. If you are within a reasonable distance of Lower Bucks County, Modern Munitions only charges $25 for transfers and the PICS fee is included but I am willing to travel up to 30-45 minutes. Transfer fee is all on you. This is a fantastic gun with everything you need to get started for range use or lawful concealed carry.

I repeat: The only way I will split this up is if you buy the FNP in the original box, the three 14-round magazines, (you get the ammo in them) the EFK Firedragon barrel and the Galco holster for $675 cash FTF. If I have to ship, I will get you a quote for Priority Mail shipping with insurance, tracking and adult signature confirmation direct from my FFL to yours."

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.

It's the original XD series with a 4"" barrel on a stainless steel slide. I have owned this gun for years and I've only put a few thousand rounds in it at most on a college kid's budget. It has plenty of service life left as you can see from the pictures. Speaking of which, I apologize for the glare and blurriness on some of them - I am no Stickman.

It comes with 3 - 16 round magazines and the original case and accessories. I also have printed the manual for it as well for you. The XD comes with a mag loader, a double mag belt pouch, and a right handed belt holster. All of which are good quality and the mag loader actually attaches to the picatinny sections of the pouch/holster which is nice. All in all this is a GREAT whole package for anyone who needs a more complete kit from a single purchase.

I am firm on $375 dollars for this. Cash ONLY, no trades or other forms of payment will be accepted. Please read this ad carefully as I will completely disregard any offers otherwise. 

Upon meeting me at sale I will require that I see your Nevada Driver's License. This is to establish that you the buyer are: 1) A resident of this state and 2) 18 + years of age. Both of which are necessary for me to legally sell this to you. I will also have you sign 2 copies of Bills of Sale. You will print and sign your name twice, 1 copy for me and 1 copy for you. No other information will be recorded/needed besides your signature.

History

Just a little history behind this. The owner is a Polish immigrant. He has had for around 30 + years. He takes out occasionally puts a few rounds through it then cleans it and let's it sit another year. He was a child in concentrations camps before coming to America. So it has historical meaning to him. Before he got it the previous owner supposedly assembled it out of a barrel with other Luger's that were disassembled when the Germans were beng disarmed after the war.

The owner is a bit of AMERICAN history behind him. He was the designer and hand craftsman for all the ornate woodwork at Disney World when it was built. He's also the designer and craftsman for all the woodwork at Church Street Station in Orlando.On top of this he is the person who built mini scale 60 foot replica of the White House that has been on display in the Truman Library & Museum.

The modern SIG SAUER® pistol story began with the P220®. In 1976 the .45 ACP P220 was introduced and quickly became recognized as one of ""the most accurate 45s right out of the box."" Since that time the P220 has earned an enviable record in hot spots around the world. The P220 features a stainless steel slide machined from barstock and coated with a durable, wear-resistant Nitron® finish, light-weight alloy frame with integral accessory rail, and the SIG SAUER® four-point safety system of decocking lever, patented automatic firing pin safety block, safety intercept notch, and trigger bar disconnector.

Love this gun, feels fantastic but I have other projects going and the 5.7x28 just doesn't do it for me. Rifle has had 140rds fired, I know this for certain because I bought 500rds when I got the gun and have 360 left. It is immaculate. Comes with original box and paperwork, (5) magazines, 360rds of Federal 5.7x28 and Barrel shroud (it's tacticool) And NC Star Laser/red dot. $1600+ in it, asking $1500 OBO, I can break down everything in price if you so desire.

The G42 is a slimline subcompact pistol engineered with the GLOCK Perfection promise and able to withstand the rigors of routine training.

Years of requests across market groups for a super-concealable, reliable .380GLOCK pistol prompted extensive research and development to bring the GLOCK customer the G42.

One rifle has original stock and NO scape.

Other rifle has a new stock (black) and comes with a basic Bushnell scope.  Original stock is available, but has a slight crack in it.

Both rifles have fired between 25-50 rounds.  The rifles shoot nice and straight, but I have had problems with the shells ejecting.  Sometimes they eject fine, sometimes they don't.  Also, the firing pin seems to need an adjustment, as occasionally the shells are struck but do not fire.

I know very little about firearms, so I am afraid to open these guns up and start playing with the firing pin and ejection mechanism.  I am guessing that if someone knew a little bit about firing pins and shell ejection, they can probably easily toggle the rifles to get them to work properly all the time."

If you aren't familiar with the Cougar design it is the precursor to the Beretta PX4 and uses a rotating barrel action to improve accuracy and lower recoil. Identical to the Beretta Cougar aside from the name on the slide; Beretta transferred the tooling and manufacturing equipment to Stoeger, Stoeger being a subdivision of Benelli, which is in turn owned by Beretta. Has the same manual of arms as a Beretta 92/M9, so its a great choice if you're looking for a more compact version for carry.

Has some light holster wear from being carried but overall is in good shape, bought new about two months ago and only has about 200 rounds through it. Will come with two 13 round magazines. Depending on what you have I can also include an extra 15 round magazine (modified Beretta 92 mag) and some 9mm ammo.

Just picked up a different compact carry gun, so I'd like to swap this for a bigger 9mm. Looking for a mid or full sized 9mm. Primarily looking for a polymer framed striker fired 9mm such as a Springfield XD9, Glock 17 or 19, Ruger SR9, or M&P9 but would consider similar 9mm's in this size range. Only looking for 9mm's though, and no Taurus or Kel Tecs please, with the one possible exception being a PT92.  Would be fine with adding cash for a higher value trade, so feel free to let me know what you have.

If not interested in trading I will sell it with the three mags and 50 rounds of 9mm for $350 FIRM.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 if interested, texts preferred.

Thanks!"

Extension tube and buffer are from Palmetto State Armory, the rest of the lower parts are from an FN lower receiver kit with the exception of the pistol grip.  Will include Troy folding front sight and your choice of Matech or KAC rear sight.  Also has Troy QR sling mount and BCM gunfighter charging handle.  Rifle currently has Magpul rail section attached to bottom side of handguard.

Upper receiver was assembled and checked for headspacing at Southwest Tactical Customs.  Shoots like a dream, very accurate (sub MOA with aimpoint and standard 55gr ammunition)  The KAC brake is rather loud but really helps keep the muzzle flip down, and has the added benefit of being compatible with surefire suppressors, if you're into that.  The trigger breaks like glass every time.

Please no crazy low ball offers.  I know what it cost me to build this rifle and that its worth slightly less, but I ain't gonna give it away.  May be willing to do partial trade for full-frame pistols from HK or FN.  Not interested in ammo or other rifles.

Would be willing to trade if you have an O/U... 20 gauge prefered but I'm open to listen.  I would rather trade up than down and would be willing to add $ to make a deal work.  Worst I can say is no.  1911's always spark my interest as well.  Being a lefty, I would listen to any offer involving a left handed gun as well.

Like New in original packaging. Only one range session - about 100 rounds. Bought as house defense and range pistol, but received CZ-75 clone as gift (also a nice pistol and do not like to 'discard' a gift), so no longer need the Cougar.

Originally manufactured by Beretta, the Cougar was turned over to Beretta's subsidiary, Stoeger, when Beretta replaced it with the polymer framed PX4 Storm. Stoeger manufactures the pistols in Turkey to keep production costs down, which produces an excellent quality pistol at a very reasonable cost. The rotating-locking system means the barrel stays straight and spirals to unlock as the slide pulls back. According to American Rifleman, “as opposed to a tilt-locking pistol, the Cougar’s rotary barrel locking system maintains the barrel in one plane while cycling, theoretically increasing accuracy. Additional benefits include reduction in felt recoil and muzzle flip.”

Features:
