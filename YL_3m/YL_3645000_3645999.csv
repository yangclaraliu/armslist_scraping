614*208*5444 



The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.



The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.



The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Best option because if the batteries die, you still have the black reticle like a normal scope. 2 standard mags and the factory carrying case, which is an excellent hard plastic case. 2 stock extentions for people with longer arms. 

TRIGGER. ....as everyone knows, they are crap from the factory. Unbelievable for the $$$. A large reason is they stamp the parts and never clean up the backside of the pressed steel. ""fluff and buff+++"" is the best description, not only have all the trigger group parts been sanded smooth, they have also been treated with smooth Kote & bp2000. First a liquid graphite, then a powdered graphite (ps, it make your 1911 a dream to shoot"". We've been able to shoot soda cans at 100yrds. Imagine the power of 230gr with that accuracy. 

Approx $560 in upgrades or custom parts from Sierra Pappa. Best thing is you dont have to wait. I think I waited 6 months before the mags were available. This carbine does it all, home defense....230gr hollow points at approx 1150 fps...doesnt get any better. If you had to hunt hogs in an emergency,  this one will shine. The accuracy allows for amazing versatility. I haven't clocked my +P 180gr golden sabers, but with this accuracy,  I doubt any deer would still be standing. Not ideal, but one caliber that will defend your life, feed you and fill your sidearm. Check out how big 45 hollow points open up to. This caliber was a beast when only fmj was available, with today's hollow points opening to 3/4""++........plus you're getting 9mm speeds at a minimum, depending on the ammo its 9mm+P or +P+ velocities.

All three fit great in it, it is a horizontal carry holster, and you can get different holsters to go on the rig for various pistols.  

This model does not have belt tie downs, though you can buy them for it.  I never found the need, when loaded everything lays pretty flat against the body and I had no trouble concealing comfortable a full size Sig P226 under a sweater with this.  

It's a very nice classy brown leather, the shoulder straps are thin but wide and supportive.  I was actually surprised at how well it all fit and was very comfortable, but I no longer need it.

It is a right hand model.

I got mine from Optics Planet for about $110 brand new, and I've worn it probably a dozen times, always on top of other shirts.

I'll sell for $50, plus $5 if you want me to ship it.  The photo included is stock, no matter what I did I couldn't get a good photo of mine, but it's in like new condition with only a little gun oil on the inside of the holster, as it should be.

I'm in Millbury, so I can meet anywhere fairly nearby, Worcester, Auburn, etc.

I'd also take a comparable quality leather holster for a full size 1911 in trade, brown or black doesn't matter, right hand.

CASH or POSTAL MONEY ORDER (if shipping) ONLY please. I will NOT accept Paypal.  I'm selling this very fine holster at far below it's new purchase price and I'm not driving all over the state to unload it.  I'm perfectly happy shipping it, but no, I'm not going to come meet you on the Cape or in the Berkshires so you can look at it.  I'll send you as many pictures as you want, but, no.  Thanks."

I also have a matching stripped Noveske Gen 1 forged lower receiver for sale. This receiver is currently registered as ""Other"", therefore it is not a pistol or rifle receiver, yet. You can build this receiver into a pistol and use the Noveske upper OR build receiver and follow proper NFA steps to register as SBR. 

I bought both the upper and lower together with hopes of building the lower into a pistol and using the 300 Blackout to hunt deer this year. My wife and I just had our first child and the extra cash could definitely help. I will do a Face to Face sale in or around the Bloomington area or I would be willing to ship the Upper.

Up for sale is a 1968 Remmington 870 Wingmaster pump in 12 gauge with aftermarket engraving.  This is not some run of the mill express...it's a wing master and has the chrome carrier on the bottom that many people consider to be a much higher quality gun that what is made today due to the quality of finishing and quality of metal used in the build during that era.   The engraving is on both sides and top of the receiver, as well as the trigger guard and the original barrel.  It has the very sought after 870 trap wood with an 11 inch forearm (standard is 8 1/2) and high cheek buttstock with amazing figuring throughout as you can see.  The gun comes in a Zeigel Aluminum case with a later model Rem Choke 28"" Vent Rib VR dual bead barrel and 8 chokes.  The chokes range from modified all the way to super full trap for those sharpshooters out there.  Althought it's not a 100 point gun, it's definitely in the high 90's and is by far the best looking 870 I've seen in person, and would make a great Christmas present, wedding present, or even something for that recent Grad.  



Factory engraved guns of this era go for $3-$8K if you can find them, and it will take you a good while to find another 870 that is as nice as this one, so I won't entertain lowballers or trades.  



Contact me for close up images of the engraving and wood, as well as a list of  the chokes included, and with any other questions.  I'm in the Denton area."

So of course I still have everything with it Oringal box, paperwork, lock, hex key lock, soft padded ruger case, 2-10 round mags, has a scope mount attached now with a nice new firefield reflex sight. Also have oringal fill screws and the sights are still on gun so reflex can be removed to use iron sights as well
Will toss in  500 rounds as well to get you started
 This gun has the most perfect weight ive ever felt in a handgun. As it has a sleeve barrel liner with a threaded barrel for your 1/2x28 muzzlebrakes, compensators or supressors. Also has the abilitly to interchange the grips as the 22/45 was supose to resemble a 1911 by putting the mag drop and safety in the same spots with same grip feel. I love it and is very accurate and functions extremly flawless. This is the new one so it needs to go to help fund the truck fund.
Pick up in Martinsburg or Utica only as I can not travel for awhile till I get the money. Priced to move quick

When it comes to personal defense, the snubnose revolver is so handy, lightweight, easy to manipulate and simple to operate, it is widely used. Even those who carry a heavier firearm as a matter of course often deploy the snubnose as a backup or hideout. The backup gun may be a lifesaver in the case of a malfunction of the primary. The snubnose handgun must be used by a skilled shooter (meaning someone willing to practice).


The Taurus 85 is an excellent, all around .38 Special revolver.

The best grip and application of the proper technique is vital for proper application of the snubnose revolver. Since most gun battles occur at short range, the speed into action of the handgun may count for more than absolute accuracy. There is nothing faster into action than a snubnose revolver carried in a properly designed holster.

This is not your typical consumer grade M4/AR15 platform or accessories. It meets Military specifications all the way around, using only high end parts and components as you are about to see.

I present to you the Daniel Defense DDM4 V5 M4 Carbine Mil-Spec Rifle. Below is a link giving the specifics of this same rifle for sale (except the stock). The rifle is 100% factory installed, not a ""parts gun"". Daniel Defense is widely considered the premier MIL SPEC AR15/M4 platforms being made. It is one sexy and effective piece of art...

https://danieldefense.com/firearms/mid-length/daniel-defense-m4-carbine-v5.html

I purchased and added on to this rifle after doing many months of research on creating the ""perfect weapon system"" for any defensive/offensive situation in virtually any scenario that would come up. ONLY reason I am selling is because I am saving up for a full auto, so my baby has to go...

As part of building this weapon system, I chose the:

-Daniel Defense M4 Carbine because it kept popping up in list after list of the ""best of the best"" because of its durability, attention to detail/quality, and adherence to Military Specifications/tolerances. Watch this video on YouTube and you'll see why the DDM4 is the best M4/AR15 on the market from a durability standpoint http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kX0nCEh5E

-Burris MTAC Ballistic CQ/LR (Close Quarter/Long Range) tactical optic because it offers both Close Quarters and Medium/Long Range capabilities in the same platform and the same time. Using ""true 1x"" it allows for both eyes open use (just like a red dot...AimPoint for example), and up to 4x magnification with built in 5.56 BDC reticles for effective engagements up to 600 yards. Just zero for 100 yards (which it already is) and your ready to go out to 600 yards using the built in BDC dots. It is extremely clear, has illuminated reticle (which work even if the battery dies), weather and shock proof, with a lifetime warranty. It is just like having both a Red Dot and a Tactical magnified scope in one, giving you the best of both worlds in one small, lightweight package.

-5.11 LED Tactical Lightweight High Output Weapons light because of it's superior performance inside of an extremely light frame. It is weather/shock proof with high, low, and strobe capabilities. Mounts perfect along side the foregrip for easy of use in any conditions.

-45 degree backup sight for obvious reasons; just in case something were to happen the MTAC optic this rifle can still be effective at close and medium/long ranges.

-Viking VTAC battle sling after much research in the best sling for all situations. Check out how awesome this sling is here: 
http://www.vikingtactics.com/product-p/vtac-mk2.htm

-Quick detach Harris bipod. Small and compact, but adjustable and sturdy. Can be added/removed to the M4 very quickly if the situation requires it. Quickly turns this M4 from a close quarters machine into a medium/long tactical precision weapon. 

Comes with everything listed above, plus:

Hard Carrying case, (4) 30 round mags, 90 rounds of ammo, scope lenses covers, and original boxes for most accessories.

I have well over $2500 invested in this barely used and meticulously cleaned package. Cash only price is $2100 OBO. This is extremely fair for everything included...you will NOT regret taking this beauty home. Plus, there is nothing left to do to make it perfect...

No trades please. FTF only, no shipping. Must be 18 with an OHIO ID. CCW preferred (I'll show you mine as well). 

I have extra mags and ammo for purchase to buyer ONLY."

This is not your typical consumer grade M4/AR15 platform or accessories. It meets Military specifications all the way around, using only high end parts and components as you are about to see.

I present to you the Daniel Defense DDM4 V5 M4 Carbine Mil-Spec Rifle. Below is a link giving the specifics of this same rifle for sale (except the stock). The rifle is 100% factory installed, not a ""parts gun"". Daniel Defense is widely considered the premier MIL SPEC AR15/M4 platforms being made. It is one sexy and effective piece of art...

https://danieldefense.com/firearms/mid-length/daniel-defense-m4-carbine-v5.html

I purchased and added on to this rifle after doing many months of research on creating the ""perfect weapon system"" for any defensive/offensive situation in virtually any scenario that would come up. ONLY reason I am selling is because I am saving up for a full auto, so my baby has to go...

As part of building this weapon system, I chose the:

-Daniel Defense M4 Carbine because it kept popping up in list after list of the ""best of the best"" because of its durability, attention to detail/quality, and adherence to Military Specifications/tolerances. Watch this video on YouTube and you'll see why the DDM4 is the best M4/AR15 on the market from a durability standpoint http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1kX0nCEh5E

-Burris MTAC Ballistic CQ/LR (Close Quarter/Long Range) tactical optic because it offers both Close Quarters and Medium/Long Range capabilities in the same platform and the same time. Using ""true 1x"" it allows for both eyes open use (just like a red dot...AimPoint for example), and up to 4x magnification with built in 5.56 BDC reticles for effective engagements up to 600 yards. Just zero for 100 yards (which it already is) and your ready to go out to 600 yards using the built in BDC dots. It is extremely clear, has illuminated reticle (which work even if the battery dies), weather and shock proof, with a lifetime warranty. It is just like having both a Red Dot and a Tactical magnified scope in one, giving you the best of both worlds in one small, lightweight package.

-5.11 LED Tactical Lightweight High Output Weapons light because of it's superior performance inside of an extremely light frame. It is weather/shock proof with high, low, and strobe capabilities. Mounts perfect along side the foregrip for easy of use in any conditions.

-45 degree backup sight for obvious reasons; just in case something were to happen the MTAC optic this rifle can still be effective at close and medium/long ranges.

-Viking VTAC battle sling after much research in the best sling for all situations. Check out how awesome this sling is here: 
http://www.vikingtactics.com/product-p/vtac-mk2.htm

-Quick detach Harris bipod. Small and compact, but adjustable and sturdy. Can be added/removed to the M4 very quickly if the situation requires it. Quickly turns this M4 from a close quarters machine into a medium/long tactical precision weapon. 

Comes with everything listed above, plus:

Hard Carrying case, (4) 30 round mags, 90 rounds of ammo, scope lenses covers, and original boxes for most accessories.

I have well over $2500 invested in this barely used and meticulously cleaned package. Cash only price is $2100 OBO. This is extremely fair for everything included...you will NOT regret taking this beauty home. Plus, there is nothing left to do to make it perfect...

No trades please. FTF only, no shipping. Must be 18 with an OHIO ID. CCW preferred (I'll show you mine as well). 

I have extra mags and ammo for purchase to buyer ONLY."

The Receiver is in pretty good shape, but the stock is a little older and beat up (came off of a different gun).  You could easily add a barrel and have a nice reliable shooter for dove or quail season, or even for personal home defense.  This isn't some Mossberg 500 or ithaca junk, it's the top of the line Remington 870 Wingmaster which was the basis for their police, trap, and other higher end shotguns.  The fit and finish as well as materials used for these guns are far superior to a standard Express.

Perfect for camping, hunting, or any season. Much more than just an ice chest replacement. Keep your drinks and food cold for camping then switch it to freeze mode once you are headed home with your deer. 

Buy it now before the deer hunting rush!

It can keep your drinks at just the right temperature overnight too by preventing them from freezing when the temperature drops too low.

This would be great for an expedition vehicle, trailer, or when/if there is a TEOTWAWKI event. Never buy ice again! Roughly comparable in capacity to a 60qt ice chest. This was over $8,000 to the US Government.

This unit works and will provide constant cooling or keep your necessities frozen in harsh climates/conditions. I have only used it to test it and keep a few adult beverages cold over a weekend. It comes with all of the paperwork and power cord. It has been tested/charged before I owned it and appears to have never been used other then the PM schedule. The Hardigg case on the outside has several scuffs from moving this around but on the inside it appears to have never been used.

Different versions of the SUB-2000 will accept most modern handgun magazines; see below for a complete list. The SUB-2000 has a greatly enhanced accuracy and extended range compared to a handgun. The superior precision is also very useful against small or partially covered targets at shorter range. The amount of training to master the SUB-2000 is only a fraction of that required for a handgun. The SUB-2000 has been developed from our highly successful SUB-9 rifle. Although retaining some features of the old rifle, the SUB-2000 is a completely new design. Emphasis has been put on consumer safety, but without impeding the performance. Polymers are used to a large extent, resulting in increased durability and reduced price. The SUB-2000 is available in 9 mm Luger or .40 S&W calibers.

The bolt can be locked in the rear position by the operating handle. The main safety is of protected push bolt type disconnecting the trigger bar and interlocking the hammer and sear. By rotating the barrel upwards and back, the SUB-2000 can be reduced to a size of 16"" x 7"" to facilitate secure storage and utilize the internal deployment lock which is operated by a proprietary key. The rear sight is of aperture type and the fluorescent front sight can be adjusted for windage and elevation. The SUB-2000 can easily be disassembled for cleaning or inspection without tools.

The .40 SUB-2000 can be configured in the following magazine types: GLK22, GLK23, BERETTA96, S&W4006, SIG226.

AK-47, 7.62 x 39, Zapap003676, Yugo, purchased from Century Int Arms
about 6/8 months ago.  When I received the rifle it had a canted front sight which has been repaired (not the best job).  I have replaced the rear sight to an adjustable one.  But I still cannot get a good sight picture.  I might suggest that the new owner go with a scope or a red/green dot.  I’m done fooling around with this rifle and I’ve lost interest so my loss is your gain. Rifle is in great shape, functions well and looks good, no scratches or dings. Comes with two 30 round and two 10 round magazines.  I’ve only put about 20 rounds thru it to make sure it functions properly, which it did.  Local pickup or a short meet only.  Will need to see current Washington Driver’s License and CPL."

(also have extra + 15 rnd mags at additional cost....).  This is a rad little pistol caliber carbine that really tames the .40 caliber round into an accurate package to compliment your other .40 handguns, (at least that's why I bought it).  It also is great for indoor range use that otherwise disallow rifle calibers.  Utilizes the same mags as the Beretta 96 pistols, and can be converted by a simple grip sleeve to accept the Beretta storm pistol series mags in .40 caliber 

The rifle is clean in very good shape and has never seen reloads, High low estimate round count is probably 400-600, but she mostly lives in the safe collecting dust since I prefer 9mm anyway.  I am the original owner.
