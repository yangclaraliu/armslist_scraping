One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces. Recoil operated with locked breech and tilting barrel. Grips made of glass fibre reinforced polymer with corrosion proof metal inserts. Ambidextrous safety with separate de-cocking lever for the hammer. Steel magazine with 12 round capacity. Integrated support rail for aiming units. Open square notch rear sight with contrast points. The HK Mark 23 Caliber .45 ACP pistol gives shooters match grade accuracy equal to that of the finest custom made handguns - yet exceeds the most stringent operational requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. The Mark 23 provides this accuracy without the need for hand-fitted parts common in custom-built match pistols costing thousands of dollars more. One of the most thoroughly tested handguns in history, the MK23/Mark 23 project originated in 1991 when HK began development for the U.S. Special Operations Command, the organization that directs the activities of America's most elite military units, including the Navy SEALs and the Army Special Forces. On May 1, 1996, the first HK MK 23 pistols were delivered to the U.S. Special Operations Command for operational deployment, making the MK 23 the first caliber .45 ACP pistol to enter American military service since the venerable Government Model 1911A1. During testing, MK 23 pistols met the most stringent operational and accuracy requirements ever demanded of a combat handgun. Endurance testing demonstrated a service life of over 30,000 rounds of +P ammunition. To meet the reliability requirement, the pistol had to demonstrate a minimum of 2,000 mean rounds between stoppages (MRBS) with both M1911 ball and +P ammunition. All pistols exceeded the 2000 MRBS with an average of 6000 MRBS. In more than 450 accuracy test firings from a precision firing fixture at 25 meters, MK 23 pistols far exceeded the government requirement, averaging 1.44 inches, with 65 groups of less than one inch.

The ""C"" in 17c designates a factory compensated barrel with cut-outs in the slide for reduced recoil and I have to say, it is noticeable,  even with the 9mm round. Installed are Truglo green/green tritium night sights with a half-life of 20 years. Also included are 2 factory 20 round magazines and an Insight Technology weaponlight. The light is not the LED version, it has an incandescent bulb but is very bright at about 200 lumens I believe. I have fired this pistol on 3 occasions (200 rds each time) and kept a log of every shot fired which I can provide if interested. Never a malfunction,  stovepipe,  failure to feed or jam. Installed stainless steel guide rod and upgraded spring. This pistol is basically new, not even broken in yet, as you can see in the pics the barrel doesnt show ANY wear as well as the exterior of the pistol. This gun is in pristine condition which the pictures cannot show. If interested I can text/email better pics. Not looking for trades unless offering high end collectible folding knives and cash. This pistol is a steal at $600 and won't last long at this price. Retail on all items listed is over $950! By the way, Magpul Industries announced this week that they now have Glock 17 mags for $15.99, amazing!

Exterior dimensions consistent with Mil-specs for mounting BFA or flash hider mounted suppressors. 
Tuned slots and interior cone offer maximum in recoil mitigations, compensation of muzzle-rise, and flash reduction. 
Designed to have much less side blast and noise associated with typical compensators.

Threaded 1/2 x 28 for 5.56mm platforms.
Please note:
The combustion gasses exiting the muzzle of a rifle are extremely hot, traveling at extreme velocity, and contains not only burning gasses but solid particles of unburnt powder as well as metals from the projectile. Due to the inherent nature of steel, it is nearly impossible to survive unaffected in this environment when directly exposed. The high temperatures begin to make the steel more malleable, which allows solid particles and pressure waves to deform and erode surfaces upon exit.

Due to the new and unique design of the BCM compensators, the user may notice small pits on the interior surfaces of the compensator. This is normal. Most designs do not impede the exit flow very much, while the BCM approach is exactly opposite. These surfaces are specifically designed to operate within the environment found at the muzzle, and are intended to allow significant amounts of deterioration before any loss of performance is seen/felt. These compensators have been tested through many thousands of rounds, and while the wear surfaces may give pause to some users, trust when we say that it's normal."

The Pistol Stabilizing Brace uses the operator’s forearm to provide stable support, thereby minimizing accuracy-robbing spin and shift. A flexible cuff with two adjustable nylon straps allows the SB15 to be custom fit to any user.

Fits all pistols equipped with a buffer tube 1.0"" - 1.2"" in diameter.

I have fallen in love with the weapon, but whom it was for has not.  The shield has only been shot 115 rounds and of high quality brass and ammunition. This Shield has the full APEX Trigger and Sear kit setup installed, polished, and fit by a gunsmith as well as TRIJICON HD Night sights with orange front installed by same smith.  It does has a talon rubberized grip installed on frame, two 7rd mags and 1 6rd mag.  This trigger pull is smooth, consistent, and completely predictable.  Perfect for personal protection.  Can be converted to a 9mm by purchasing a 9mm barrel ($75) and a 9mm Magazine (not a much 40 works).    I will also open your eyes to another amazing product the Alien Gear Hybrid Holster IWB. Very comfy and very adjustable (doesn't print either)

If you become interested and we meet you will be in complete and utter amazement that this trigger is in a S&W.  It doesn't feel grainy, sandy, rough, etc.  everything you hear about S&W triggers.  This is smooth, quiet, and that of oiled glass up until the point of break.  A must whiteness for yourself.  Comes with lock, box, manual and everything as when I purchased new."

Due to the high volume of guns we sell every week, we only provide stock photos of new guns.  This allows us to ensure our customers consistently receive a factory fresh product that has only been opened by us to be inspected prior to shipment; not dry fired and handled by countless “window shoppers”.  We apologize if this makes your purchase more challenging but we believe you’ll ultimately be a happier customer knowing the product you receive has been handled by you alone.  We do, however, take pictures of used guns and those can be found on our sales sites.  Thank you for using GunPro Armory for all of your firearm needs.

Due to the high volume of guns we sell every week, we only provide stock photos of new guns.  This allows us to ensure our customers consistently receive a factory fresh product that has only been opened by us to be inspected prior to shipment; not dry fired and handled by countless “window shoppers”.  We apologize if this makes your purchase more challenging but we believe you’ll ultimately be a happier customer knowing the product you receive has been handled by you alone.

2. I am also looking for the Polytech stamped receiver with the pig sticker underfolder front end.  Preferrably in the box with all accessories as well, but I would consider a very clean one by itself.

What I am not interested in is the underfolder stock type of any kind, but I might consider an interesting side folder (Galil - somewhat triangle stock type, or the red bakelite), but neither are really a strong interest of mine right now, so just letting you know.

For sale is a bulgarian matching parts kit built on a Nodak Spud receiver by WaffenWerks. This rifle has only been lightly used (less than 250 rounds), and cleaned immediately after use. The condition of the rifle is used- very good. Additionally, the gun was looked over and profesionally cleaned/inspected by a federally licensed gunsmith to ensure proper fit and function of all parts to the end buyer. 

Additional detailed images are available here: http://imgur.com/a/bUb3C

The rifle comes with 5 tapco 30 round magazines, 750 rounds of surplus 7n6 ammunition that is no longer being imported to the U.S. due to ATF regulations, as well as an authentic russian cleaning kit that stows in the buttstock. Additionally, the rifle has highly desirable original synthetic plum stock and forend furniture. While the rifle will ship with a hogue grip, I will also include the oem plum grip. 

The manufacturer description is as follows: 

""These are some of the nicest AK74's to come down the pipe in a long time.

The combination of high quality, all matching,  Bulgarian made surplus rifle parts sets, 
and brand new U.S. parts including barrel and receiver combined with top grade professional assembly makes for a fantastic rifle. 

Each of the rifles begins as an all stamped matching Bulgarian AK-74 parts set. 

Parts are then professionally assembled by Waffen Werks.   Waffen Werks is one of the premiere builders in the U.S. and their quality is very top level. 
U.S. Parts include new U.S. made chrome lined barrel,  new Waffen Werks premium grade receiver, 3 piece G-2 No Slap Trigger set by Tapco, and U.S. made pistol grip.

Rifle also features the highly effective and original Bulgarian AK-74 compensator.  These things are too cool.

Rifles all feature an integrated side rail for scope mounts or other accessories.

All metal parts on the rifles are like new in condition and are all professionally finished with the Famous KG Gun Kote Finish. This is the slickest, most durable and highly sought after finishes going and we are proud to be able to offer it on these rifles. """

ATF approved pistol variant of KRISS SBR/SO.
Standard 5.5” barrel with custom lengths available.
Not available in all States or municipalities. The first major breakthrough in weapons operating systems in more than 120 years! The patented KSVS actually works with the operator by helping deliver more rounds on-target, more of the time. By reducing felt recoil by as much as 60% and barrel elevation by 95%, the KSVS stays where you aim it and drastically reduces the need to re-acquire sight picture. Unlike any other firearm ever invented, instead of having all the recoil force slam back into the shooter, causing massive amounts of felt recoil and resultant muzzle climb, the KRISS System absorbs and redirects these forces downward and away from the operator thus enabling him to better control and keep the KRISS firearm on-target. More control equals more rounds on-target, more of the time"

RCA uses a proprietary thermal process

All of the gunsmithing and bedding was performed by tpryder of PNW lore. His work is outstanding.

The receiver has had the bolt raceway trued, bolt lugs lapped and faced, threads trued, and the bolt was threaded for a Badger Ordnance Tac knob. The Krieger #10 contour 24"" long 11.25 twist barrel was cut to length, chambered, crowned and then fitted to the receiver and stock in front of a Badger Ordnance stainless Heavy Recoil Lug. A Timney trigger was added and set to 2lbs (adjustable 1.5lbs - 4lbs)

It sits in a McMillan A5 stock, w/intergral adjustable cheek piece and LOP. It has been bedded for a PTG stealth detachable bottom metal system that accepts AI magazines and includes 1x5rd and 1x10 magazine. On top sits a Warne scope base to guarantee a rock solid mount.

Has seen only light range use, 160rds fired. Included is a 5-shot 100y group with 168gr Hornady BTHP. This rifle has shot exceptional with 155/168/175. I haven't pushed the larger bullets, but my actual tighest group was with plain Hornady 150gr SP. Thsi rig shot several .2s with a standard Varget load. The next load that proved exceptional used Hornadyd 168s... that grouped under 3/4"" for a five shot at 200y (range limit). *Full disclosure, the bolt handle was turned down to accept the badger knob and still has some machine marks. I was planning on Cerakoating the rifle in FDE (the Cerakoat would cover the markings) but never got a round to it.

Vortex Viper is now sold, but I do have several 3-15, 5-22 NF scopes available at an additional cost if interested.
