Very clean and well taken care of. Comes with a 35 round mag, a 15 round mag, and a case.
 This is a relic from the Ban- and Pre-Ban period of the 1990s. This is an AA Arms Pistol, model AP-9, manufactured from 1991 until 2001 in Indian Trail, North Carolina. It is a direct descendant and copy of the notorious Intratecs KG-9 from the late 1970s. This was, to the best of our knowledge, the final clone of the KG-9. The KG-9 stirred up some action and warnings from the BATF. The KG-9 and this pistol, the AP-9, will release the sear from a bolt position that is only about halfway open. While the Intratecs had aluminum alloy lower frames, this one has a rough textured polymer lower frame. It is more ornage than its predecessor, with larger sights and a grooved muzzle barrel instead of a threaded barrel. Weight empty is about 3 1/2 pounds. Barrel length is 5 inches.

So, here’s the story: back when I was able to use these bowfishing was just beginning to gain recognition, and bowfishing equipment was hard to find. As a result I used to make my own fishing arrows from the solid fiberglass rods that Lowe's, Home depot, etc. sales as drive way stakes.

After cutting them down to 32 inches for my fishing arrow, I had these 20 inches pieces left. I guess they could be used for about anything, but I was thinking crossbow fishing bolts! Or practice bolts.

A couple of the pictures shows a fishing tip on one shaft and it setting on my crossbow, the tip and crossbow are not for sale.

5 Shafts are blunt on both ends, 5 Shafts have one tapered end. I was getting them ready for broad heads, but my crossbow is older and only has a 150 lb. draw weight and I thought they would be too heavy for target shooting.

This is the factory barrel that came on my 1984 Remington 1100 and is chambered for 12 gauge 2 3/4"" shells. The barrel’s bore is in immaculate condition and the front brass sight has been polished. It seems that the barrel has a low round count and was taken care of through the years (I’ve only owned it for about 1 year and have only put about 50 light target loads through it). There is slight pitting from rust on the bottom edge of the rear sight, but is barely noticeable. I would rate the finish on the barrel a solid 90%. I purchased the gun with the sole intent to put a skeet barrel on it, which I did, so I don’t have much of a use for this barrel, so I’m selling it to fund another project. It would make a great barrel for hunting or home defense. Please let me know if you have any questions, and I will get back with you asap.

This was the top pick of 40 rifles when I purchased 2 crates of Mosin Nagants a few years ago. I sold all the rest and kept this one until now when bills necessitate selling some of my guns. 

All numbers match - including the bayonet. It comes with the original oil bottle and cleaning supplies. The bolt is also unique because 2 of the pieces are made by Remington and marked with the circle R. The bore on this rifle is excellent and bright, the bluing is dark, and the trigger has a Finnish sear so it's very smooth and breaks cleanly(original sear included). The action has been bedded to the stock which is a war time stock with brass caps on the handguard. The barrel has been free floated and I have shot several 5 shot groups that were <1.5""  at 100 yards using hand loaded Sierra 174gr Match King ammo. The stock has an antique oil finish and it is beautiful with no arsenal repairs. Correct sling is also included.

Please don't email to tell me this is a $130 rifle. I have bought and sold over 40 Mosin Nagants and I know what the $130 rifles look like - this is not that rifle.

The Beretta 692 - The new legend in clay shooting

Steelium Plus Barrels

Inspired by the Steelium Pro barrels of the DT11 and thanks to a conical profile 5.5 times longer than the 682 Gold, the new Steelium Plus barrels give outstanding pattern quality and precision, improved recoil reduction and reduced muzzle raise. The much longer forcing cone is the key to the improvement in the barrel’s overall performance. At the beginning of the Steelium era, all of the competition barrels had a similar conic profile of approximately 2.6” on a 30” barrel. With the development of the new Beretta 692, Steelium Plus defines a new standard for competition shotgun barrels by lengthening the forcing cone to ~14” on a 30” barrel. What are the benefits of a longer forcing cone? Better patterns, less muzzle raise, and faster target acquisition on follow-up for when you have to make the shot.

Wider Receiver

The new Beretta 692 features a 1.3mm (1/2”) wider receiver than the 682 Gold, improving handling and control. This wider receiver adds a small amount of weight for better balance, providing more stability and better handling before and after each shot.

Design

The wider receiver is also adorned in a technical yet elegant design. Polished metal surfaces pair with matte finish and “black gold” engraving highlight the unmistakable lines of a Beretta Over / Under with an attractive new design. The selectable safety features a two dot selector showing which barrel is ready to fire first, while the ergonomic over molded opening lever combines form and function. The stock and fore end come in selected oil-finished walnut.

Adjustable trigger

The single trigger is adjustable for length of pull

While many firearms owners have become skilled shooters, the truth is that a high degree of confusion remains as to when the use of deadly force is legally justifiable. With so many myths surrounding the subject and the complexity of the laws as they pertain to concealed carry, there is little wonder why both police officers and otherwise law-abiding concealed-carry citizens find themselves being prosecuted for actions they believed were both prudent and justified. Laws by their very nature are ambiguous, confusing, and often left to the interpretation of those who do not practice law and who may not even understand the law. To ensure you possess a comprehensive understanding of the law you could hire an attorney and pay hundreds of dollars for the consultation. If you are ever in a situation where you have no alternative but to use deadly force, a good criminal defense attorney's retainer fee can start at $30,000.

I'm clearing out the safe again and I'm offering these two fine Ruger pistols, an SR9 and SR9c. They make a great package as the SR9c can also use the SR9 mags with a spacer. My SR9 is nearly brand new, with only 100 rounds through it and cleaned after use. It has never even been in a holster (I am the second owner but the original never took it out of the box). It is in excellent shape. Comes with original plastic box and two factory 10 round magazines. Great fun for the range or as I had it with a light on the rail in my nightstand safe. Very nice to shoot, excellent trigger!

The SR9c has been my carry gun for months and as such, it shows appropriate holster wear in a few places on the slide as well as the magazines. Though it was carried every day, it was cleaned after every trip to the range and has approximately 400 rounds through it, and I am the original owner. Comes with the original box and papers but I do not have the Ruger mega stupid useless padlock, and FOUR ten round magazines with pinky extensions and flat extensions. The magazine safety disconnect has been removed but will be included. This is a very nice shooter, excellent trigger, little recoil, compact but big enough to be accurate and fun on the range.

Both the SR9 and SR9c have upgraded, stainless steel guide rods and springs from Galloway Precision, making recoil in both of these handguns nearly non existent and very easy to control. Follow up shots are a dream. 

I am including with this package 1000 rounds of factory load target ammo. Yes, 1000 rounds of 9mm! Most is Federal but there may be some others including a box or two of Tulammo and Wolf. I'm narrowing down my 9mm in favor of some of my other calibers and so am selling this as a package. I will not split this package up, thank you. I need all of this gone for other projects and space.

Bike runs great, brand new tires, brand new oil change, and brand new K&N air filter. Starts first kick every time and runs great, gobs of power. I always mix 32:1, so did the owner before me. There are three small things wrong with the bike. The shifter pedal/lever is stripped on the inside and wont tighten up good to the shifter shaft. It will spin when you try to shift. It works good enough to test ride, but will need to be fixed before any prolonged rides. The second problem is the rear brake lever. There is a tab on it that held it in the right spot that broke off. I bought a new lever, it just needs installed. The third problem. All of the start/stop, light, and horn controls are there. As is the headlight, speedo, and tach. The tachometer works, but nothing else does. The bike still starts and runs and i just kill it by letting out on the clutch. I would say it just needs re-wired. This would make a great bike for anyone just to ride, someone that just loves vintage stuff, or an EXCELLENT restore project, wouldnt take much at all, just tear it down and paint and throw it back together, its all there.

This is the pistol that Larry Vickers has called ""the best out of the box striker fired pistol on the market today"". Here is his review: http://youtu.be/We0NRmtKXeQ

Here is the write up from HK:
In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.

The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.

VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law.

The HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail $719

The ammunition is boxer primed with military crimp, brass case, and it may be corrosive, so treat it as corrosive primed.
