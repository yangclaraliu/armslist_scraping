Unless you can afford to buy and shoot .50 BMG / .338 Lapua / ChyTac / Etc. then this is the way to go!
Absolute killing power to at-least 1000 meters, heavy barrel, nice over-mold stock bedded, twin sling posts on the front so you can have a sling and bipod and yet still portable enough to go shoot elk and mountain goat. Whether its for punching long range paper affordably or sniping man size targets from way out this is a hard setup to beat.  
Then there is the sniper glass... I have nearly $1600 in this bad boy so my loss is your gain, really hate to have to sell it but such is life. Full price offer this weekend and I will sweeten the deal with sling, case and some ammo.   

Very nice/NEW, lots of ammo available at a very fair (but additional) price. 

I am primarily seeking cash at this time--- baby on the way and momma says its time to make room… But open to hearing trades offers also especially if they are for cash plus a battle rifle or mostly a reliable vehicle.

***Note I have several guns listed so Please See Other Adds too– I am all for a combo package deal, shoot me an offer for all or just what you wanting.

In order to reveal the content of the letter I have added two photos to this auction (see photos #32 & 33). **************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************** Fully Engraved 1861 Colt Navy presentation Revolver 36 caliber, very early serial number 9765. I am selling this gun on consignment. It is out of an old Indian Trading Post from Gallup, New Mexico where it has been stored in a vault for over 25 years. This gun is in superb (museum quality) condition. The gun is silver plated and fully engraved by Gustave Young who was Colt's premier engraver from the 1850s through the 1870s. He is often referred to as the Picasso of engravers. His ""signature"" mark is the dog/wolf head show here in photo #24. The gun's grips are ivory and it has all matching serial numbers. This gun was obviously a custom order gun made as a presentation piece. The back of the back strap was left blank where a persons name would have been engraved (see photo #29). I have been told the Confederacy ordered a small number of these Navy models at the beginning of the civil war to be used as presentation pieces. Because the serial number fits in that same time period it has been suggested that this could very well be one of those pieces? While we know very little about the history of this gun we do know it is extremely rare to find a silver plated Gustave Young engraved presentation gun for sale in this kind of condition. The gun is being offered with an on site inspection and approval by the buyer. It can be shipped registered mail but only after the sellers approval and payment has been made.

Everything below can be confirmed through sig sauer and you can call them yourself with the serial #.

This comes with a Hard Case, 2 different kinds of rail covers, safety lock, manual, papers from factory, and an authentic sig 30rd mag.  

I can throw in a gen3 windowed Pmag (sealed new), and some brass FMJ ammo to sweeten the deal for the right offer.

This 556 is the swat version w/ Swiss internals.  If you are unaware - sig no longer imports the Swiss parts to make these rifles.  The internals are NOT the same on the new rifles, that's why the prices dropped.

The following parts are SWISS not cheaper parts made here.  Sig stopped importing these parts from Switzerland to reduce costs and become more market competitive here in the US.

Swiss parts in the rifle are as follows:
Complete bolt carrier assembly.
Complete gas system assembly.
Gas block.
Lower FCG.
Rear trunnion
And a tougher outer barrel polish
Telescoping foldable stock

I am asking $2000,the price includes the $350 waterproof combat scout light with blackout from surefire.

CALL SIG SAUER in New Hampshire yourself and ask them about this rifle (I'll give you full seriel #) they don't make them like this anymore, literally.  I am open to trades, but need some cash out of the deal.

I am looking for a .380 caliber or larger, including 9mm and .40 S&W, so no big-framed guns, as these would not be appropriate for concealed carry.

Please contact me with manufacturer, model, caliber, and other relevant details around the item you have for sale. I am not a dealer, so I will most likely ask a few questions. My background is with using rifles, not handguns, so I appreciate your patience in answering basic questions about the item you have for sale.

I will purchase from private sellers located in Delaware only, not Dealers trying to price gouge me because of my inexperience with handguns. I am in the Middletown/Townsend area of Delaware, and travel for a good deal is not a problem.

Transfers: I have a CCDW/Concealed Carry permit to ensure purchases are in accordance with Delaware state law. I will not use or pay for FFL transfers since I have a CCDW, which makes transaction easier for both buyer and seller, and satisfies Delaware laws.

Payment: I will use the payment method that is easiest for you, including cash, money order, personal check, and PayPal. Just like any transaction, I understand that I have to wait for funds to clear before I take possession if you prefer a personal check.

Delaware Law: Any sale must be in accordance with Delaware law, no exceptions: http://smartgunlaws.org/private-sales-in-delaware/#identifier_13_2813."

This is arguably best 3 Gun and all around scope on the market. It combines a red dot non magnified CQB optic with a medium range variable power scope in a mil retical. Go with Red Dot 1x Power for close targets and zoom out from 1-6.5x power to hit targets out to 400+ yards with precision. [I]This is a perfect match for today’s flattop AR’s and for the .223/5.56 round or .308 battle rifles such as the SCAR, or AR-10.

Bought it with Larue SPR 1.5 mount Directly from Larue Tactical. Used it 3 times on my LMT Carbine and simply loved it. Supper versatile optic, if I had to have one AR optic this would be the one as it excels up close and at medium ranges where red dots fall short.

Condition: Like New 9.5 out of 10

Includes: Bushnell SMRS Elite 1-6.5x Scope ($1399) Bushnell Box/Papers, Butler Creek Flip Up Lens Covers ($35), and Larue SPR 1.5 Mount ($200). Paid $1634 plus shipping for the package.

Total Package Priced to Sell:  $1300. Don’t be fooled by the less expensive second focal plane versions, they are several hundred less.

It was attached to my BCM 20"" upper but sold that to a friend who wanted to put his Leupold Mk 4 on it (I dont blame him).

The scope has seen minimal range trips, mainly to get sighted in and than to go ring steel no more than a handful of times. I cant speak to the 308 turret (which comes with the scope) but the 556 turret was spot on with the BDC markings. I was never able to test it out to 500yds, but at 400yds it was spot on hitting 12"" ringers.

I am including the Leupold Mk2 IMS 1"" one-piece mount (with packaging) since everything has been leveled and torqued down (had the scope installed by a gunsmith). I took it on and off the 20"" upper a couple times to see if it would hold zero with the mount and as far as I could tell (shooting out to 200yds) it did a great job as long as you got it back on the correct rail slots.

Hope to hear back from you soon, and dont hesitate to ask questions.
Thanks.

I have assembled a Adams Arms C.O.R. With this rifle I utilized the new Adams Arms XLP adjustable gas block. This allows the piston block to fit under most standard free float rails. The standard C.O.R utilizes the standard Samson Evolution EX rail with cut out for the standard Piston/Gas block. With this rifle I used the Samson 15"" Keymod rail.

The VDI Ultra-Lite Barrel runs extremely light and accurate. Our New Low Mass Carrier and Rifle Length System significantly reduces felt recoil, and the VDI Jet Comp virtually eliminates muzzle rise for follow up shots.""

Serious inquires only please. Again I am not competing with your off the shelf M&P-15, DPMS, Bushmasters out in the market place. 

I assemble these as a hobby, I do not do this to flip and make money, this is priced as if you were to purchase all the components yourself (without tax)

Please contact John REDACTED I appreciate you considering this gun. I hope it goes to a good home (preferably a fellow 3 gunner)

This rifle comes as you see it here and will ship in its original Springfield Armory factory box.
Specifications:
- This is a Springfield Armory ""Loaded"" model M1A
- It comes with 2 stocks:  A USGI walnut stock and a USGI Fiberglass stock.
- 2-stage match grade trigger.
- National Match front sight blade.
- Match Grade rear aperture with 1/2 MOA windage adjustments.  Bore and barrel are in excellent condition.
- Stainless steel 22"" National Match barrel (labeled ""NM .308 SS"")
- It has an upgraded GI extractor and spring
- 12x 20-round magazines, blued (New manufacture, Like new condition) ($240 value)
- 1x 10-round factory magazine with parkerized finish
- Magazine pouch for the buttstock ($20 value)
- Cleaning kit inside buttstock ($20 value)
- M14 GI sling, nylon

The first owner of this rifle bought it to hunt with. He soon realized that a Battle Rifle is not necessarily an ideal deer rifle. :-) That is when he sold it to me. He had very few rounds through it. I have had this rifle for almost 7 years. I have put approximately 800 rounds through it. I added the GI extractor, mag pouch, and cleaning kit. I also painted in the numbers on dials of the rear sight so you can read the elevation and windage markings clearly.

Someone asked me how far out I have shot it.
I have shot it out to 500 yards. When I am doing my part, it shoots 2-3 moa with NATO mil-surp ammo. It will do better with Hornady 165gr SST or Federal Gold Match 168gr ammo.  With South African Nato 7.62x51 ammo, the rifle is dead-balls-on at 200, 300, 400, and 500 yards. You just gotta dial it in and do your part... and it hits where it should. 

The elevation knob does go to 1000 as I recall. It would be really cool to take it up to Camp Butner and see what she will do out to 1000 yards. It might be a lot to ask of a 147 grain mil-spec projectile... but the 168 Federal Gold Match round was made with the M1A in mind and it will get it done.

NOTE:
Only serious inquiries, please.
All local, state, & federal laws apply. That means that I will not sell to your brother to give to you so please do not even ask for a strawman purchase.
Thank you for understanding."

733,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3370733,For Sale:  DAN WESSON ECO,"Terre Haute, Terre Haute, Indiana",$ 1,"Listed On: Thursday, August 14, 2014",Handguns,Dan Wesson                                                                                ,45 ACP                                                                                ,Double / Single Action                                                                                ,Pistol,"Presenting the ECO, a true single stack officer size 1911 weighing in at only 25 oz. For years the officer 1911 has been criticized for reliability. We have taken care of that by using some of the latest technology as well as our background in doing what others say can’t be done. This gun has all the latest and greatest we have to offer.

The ECO wears tritium night sights with our tactical ledge sight on the rear of our lightweight 3.5” slide. The barrel is a flush-cut ramped bull barrel with target crown rather than the traditional barrel and barrel bushing. This makes the gun slightly more compact and easier to disassemble. The recoil system is quite unique for this style of 1911 as we use a solid, one piece guide rod and a flat recoil spring that is rated for 15,000 rounds in .45 ACP. That is 15,000 rounds! Not 500 rounds like most 1911 dual recoil systems are rated for. This is unheard of in a production 1911! This recoil system also gives the benefit of a smooth slide for easier operation and less felt recoil.

Trigger pull, like all of our 1911s, is short and crisp at around 4 lbs. This helps achieve the accuracy you’ve come to expect from a Dan Wesson.  The frame is anodized aluminum and features an undercut trigger guard and 25 LPI checkering. The mainspring housing is also aluminum with 25 LPI checkering and a rounded bottom corner for concealability and shooting comfort. These features coupled with the Ed Brown high ride grip safety and our new slim line DW carry G10 grips really help you hold onto the gun for faster follow-up shots and recoil control. Just like our Guardian, the ECO slide and small parts are treated with our Duty finish.  Stopping power is not a concern!

If you’re looking for a compact, lightweight and reliable 1911 that beats the competition, look no further than our ECO. We are confident you won’t be disappointed.

*****This is one of the BEST everyday carry 1911's made. The ECO alone was $1600 out the door.  It comes stock with custom VZ Dan Wesson black/white slim grips, and Trijicon night sights, 2 mags, and the original hard case & paperwork. The grips installed currently are Limited Edition VZ Special Forces ""Death Card"" grips ($90) with a separate Pierce rubber inserts ($10).  I also have a Crossbreed IWB custom Horsehide leather Holster with lifetime warranty ($85).  Crossbreed is the best leather IWB holster made currently.
Another JT Hume leather OWB holster ($30) will be included. EVERYTHING listed goes with this package.  Look up the specs on this 1911, its the real deal.  I have fired 215 rounds down range.  CZ USA recommended 200 rounds to properly break in the gun so thats what I did with not one misfire or jam.  Its a great carry gun, just am not a fan of the 1911 platform personally.  Only looking to sell, no trades please.  I am no rush to sell just looking into new guns. Have just over $1800 into the package.  No issues at all and is in great condition.

The barrel is nitrided with a 1:7 twist and includes an AAC 51T Blackout flash suppressor. The Knight's Armament URX II rail is one of the best available with an internal heat guard.
This upper was purchased new last year and has approx 150 rds through it, including a successful test with an attached AAC silencer. It has functioned flawlessly on 3 different AR-15 lower receivers with 4 different types of 300 BLK ammo. Tired of the same old .223/5.56mm AR-15 or need some extra punch for hog or deer hunting? Give 300 BLK a try...it uses the same AR-15 components to include the BCG and mags. Just buy some 300 BLK ammo, toss this AAC upper on your favorite lower, and have fun!
Price is $900. Since AAC is not an option here for manufacturer, I selected Noveske since they use a lot of AAC components in their rifles. Prefer face to face cash in Columbus, but will ship to you for an additional $25 once funds clear.

I'm selling this rifle as a non functioning group of parts. Happy to send more pics if interested. It's a perfect gun if you want to practice gun smithing or restoring.  It is a .22 short only caliber. The stock is obviously broken and I believe it's beyond help as far as repair. The feed tube appears complete and functioning. The bolt action works and will ready the firing pin. The trigger will drop the firing pin. I assume if you were to feed one round in by hand at a time it will work. I haven't tried it. The problem is that it appears there may be a part missing that assists the feeding of the next round from the tube to the chamber. I'm not familiar with these guns so I can't be sure. Prefer FTF and cash. I can ship for cost of shipping after I receive a USPS money order or paypal. See below for trades.

This is a surplus model rather than a commercial one. Is blued rather than the bake-on paint you see on the 82's. Used but not abused, shows wear but nothing that would make you turn your nose up at it. Does have the beginning of a crack in one grip panel- may have to be replaced in the future.
Also comes with 4 mags. One is actual CZ, the other are from Keep Shooting. The two I opened and tried functioned fine with the pistol- I've never had a jam or malfunction with them. The third is still in the plastic, can't vouch for it. There's also a mag pouch that works well with them.
An N82 holster is included- I forget which version it is, but it fits the 83 like a glove. I'm not just trying to talk up this ad when I say N82's are probably the most comfortable holster you'll ever own.
Ammo included is 25 rounds Federal fmj, 13 rounds Blazer fmj, 87 rounds of Winchester fmj.

A fun plinking rifle with a battle proven history, and the best part? You don't have to clean out the nasty cosmoline, because I've done it for you.  I've taken good care of this gun, and cleaned it thoroughly after shooting corrosive surplus. 

The rifle is in good shape for being 85 years old and being issued if not used in combat, and was clearly refinished some prior to being packed away for decades.  Matching numbers on all of the major parts, and came out of the box shooting close to point of aim at 100 yards with 147/150 grain ammo.  I am pretty sure this is an ex-dragoon. This is indeed a hex receiver, the picture indicating the 1929 date doesn't show the hexagonal portion. This specimen is not counterbored, although the rifling at the muzzle does have some wear.  The rifling, like most Mosins, is dark and frosted but solid.  There is minor surface wear on the wood from the barrel bands, and there is bluing wear along where the bayonet attaches.  I have used this gun to plink and deer hunt, and am selling because I recently bought a 308 Savage.

Also included:
Ammo: 682 Rounds of 1975mfg silver tipped Russian surplus ammo (corrosive), and 43 brass PPU 150 grain softpoints (+17 brass cases.)  Comes with wooden crate, can opener (1 spam can still sealed.)
Accessories: Dog collar sling, bayonet, oil bottle, tool kit, cleaning rod, 2 faux leather ammo pouches.
