The ""Assaulter's"" Ghillie / Never been used, Tan, MSRP= $200ish

Whether you’re an assaulter or sniper the benefit of suppressing your visual presence to the enemy is extremely important. Tactical Concealment's Viper is a new high-speed garment designed not just for snipers but for any operator who can benefit from having a tactical edge toward visual based camouflage/concealment. Specific to this type of operator is that the Viper is designed to be worn in conjunction and work in unison with combat loadout equipment including tactical vests, armored plate carriers, assault vests and any size backpack. Any tactical operator can now achieve the camouflage/concealment effectiveness of a sniper and his ghillie suit but scaled into a package that is practical and suited toward the working needs and working requirements of an assaulter.

The TAVOR® is a perfect fusion of an ordnance grade steel receiver coupled to a Mil-Spec cold hammer forged barrel and encased into a high-impact strength polymer uni-body with exceptional situational ergonomics. The ultra-compact form factor allows for easy transitions in close quarter situations…or even in your favorite deer blind. The bullpup design moves the center of gravity of the rifle closer to the users’ body allowing for more instinctive aiming and improved acquisition time to target."

This was kind of a dual purpose gun, I used it to hunt and target shoot with the scope set-up and then had the Slide Fire for having FUN... If you have ever shot one of these with the Slide Fire you know what I mean.  The Slide Fire basically turns it into full auto and it's easy to change it out.  Easy to shoot with very little recoil or barrel climb.  Gun is currently set up with the scope and bipod.  Scope is a Redfield Revolution 4-12 with the accu-range reticle.  Very nice scope.  When in the Slide fire mode, I swap the hand guard out with the one you see with the fore grip.  This package also includes a Bulldog soft case which is really nice because it has backpack style straps on it for those long walks from the truck to the range or into the woods.  Also included in this sale is a little over 800 rounds of Herters .223 ammo.  I used these when shooting with the Slide fire...no reason for nice ammo when the mag dumps in about 3 seconds :)

This is by far one of my favorite .22lr guns, but sadly I have to part ways with it to afford a new handgun. I can attest that it is a very accurate little rifle. The included scope mount and Bushnell 4x scope make range time very enjoyable. The gun has an internal tubular magazine which makes reloading kind of fun and ejects spent shells downward. There is a video on the manufacturer's link below that demonstrates this. It has some minor nicks in the stock but the blueing is in great shape and has some neat ornate factory designs on it. Overall a great gun that needs a good home. Please contact me with any questions.

It has a threaded barrel, and has fully adjustable sights. I have the manual, and padded case, factory shell casings, along with the lock, and both magazines. The rail has been installed, but it can easily be removed, and I still have the factory screws to fill the holes if you choose to do so.

I have installed the magazine disconnect safety disable, and the magazines drop freely now, and the firearm can be fired without a magazine in it. This makes the gun much easier to clean, and field strip, as pulling the trigger is part of the process to take it down, and put it back together.

I will also include the four reticle red dot sight that has multiple brightness settings and dots that can be used, this makes the firearm a real joy to shoot, and is great because you can see right over a suppressor if you mount one on the threaded barrel. I will even include the allen key needed for adjusting the red dot!

I will also include a box of .22lr ammunition if you purchase the firearm, so you can get right out to the range and start shooting.

The firearm costs $419 plus tax retail, which is over $450, and I have included several extras which would bring the total cost new to over $500. I am willing to sell this setup for $420, which means I am eating the tax and the extras I am including, not to mention trouble of the installation of the disconnect bypass, or the cost to have it done. I am open to trades, just let me know what you have. I have a bit of everything, and I will take a look at anything. The worst I can do is say no.

It has been sitting up for 3 or more years and needs a battery and an alternator. It is black with grey leather interior. Needs painting. Has 4 new tires (again they have been parked for several years but look to be in good condition still.) The engine and trans have been rebuilt but then it sat for 3 years so this jeep definitely needs some TLC and therefore is sold as is. 
KBB values this vehicle at $2,418 in  FAIR Condition.  
Kelly Blue book describes FAIR condition as:
Has some cosmetic defects that require repairing and/or replacing
	Requires some mechanical repairs
		The paint and bodywork may require refinishing and body repair
		The engine compartment has leaks and may require repairs
		May have some repairable rust damage
		The body has dents, chips, and/or scratches
		The interior has substantial wear, and may have small tears
		Wheels may be warped or bent, have major scratches, scrapes, or pitting and require replacement
		The tires may not match and need replacing
		Needs servicing, but is still in reasonable running condition with a clean title history
		A few service records are available
The AC doesn't work but it could be the fan or fuse to the fan. Feel free to ask me any questions or specifics. When I Blue booked it I entered 199,999 for mileage but engine and transmission were rebuilt before it was parked.
Since the Jeep needs some work I am willing to let go for a ridiculous offer. I am interested in Guns or Guns and Cash. (Rifles, Shotguns, Handguns, ETC anything make an offer)


I am avail to show Jeep mosts days and some weekends.

Constructed from Mil-Spec hard-anodized aluminum, they feed smoothly and reliably due to optimal geometry, non-binding coil springs, and ingenious nesting polymer followers. The long-lasting springs are cadmium coated for low friction and excellent corrosion resistance. Magazines require no lubricants and can be easily disassembled without tools for cleaning. 

SureFire High-Capacity magazines provide distinct tactical advantages: increased initial firepower in ambush situations; fewer reloads overall, which means less downtime and target distraction in a firefight; fast and easy magazine insertion, even with a closed bolt; less bulk compared to drum mags, enabling a normal weapon grip. The 60-round magazine—slightly thinner than two 30-round magazines clipped together and about the same overall length—fits in most dual magazine pouches, eliminating special carry pouches required for drum magazines.

Gun is in fantastic condition.  Bluing is excellent along with all mechanical aspects of the gun.  In my personal opinion, this is the finest bolt action rifle made during the WWII era, the best part is, they never saw actual combat.  I have only shot 40 rounds through this gun, and let me say its extremely accurate.  Im not a slouch with irons, but bench shooting from a front rest 1 1/2"" groups are easy.  I put this gun on a sled and could get 3 shot groups under 1"".  The triggers on these are super smooth and light, very precise, as all swiss made products are. 

I'm including 440 rounds of the surplus GP11 ammo.  Its berdan primed, brass cased and  NON CORROSIVE!  Aside from a VERY solid handload, it doesn't get any better than this.

I love this rifle, but I have my eye on other things, and since I rarely shoot it, I figure someone else might enjoy it more.  These guns and ammo are getting hard to come by, especially in this condition, don't miss out on a great package deal.

Plenty of mods done. Frame has gussets installed and suspension has been widened. Has aftermarket ac bumper, fmf fatty exhaust, ac nerfs, rims and tires, tusk handlebars and tusk fuel cap. Larger capacity fuel tank with aftermarket petcock. Jetted carb. Twist throttle. 450r front brake conversion for better stopping. Swingarm is off newer honda so it's a little longer than the stock 250r is what I was told but not 100% sure. Race plastics. New plug installed. Fresh fuel runs off 110 octane and that's all that's ever entered the tank along with super M 2 stroke oil. Its a blast to ride. I'm sure I'm leaving lots of stuff out. Only minor things are plastics are faded and has light rust here and there on nuts bolts etc from previous owner leaving it out in the weather but I have garaged it since I've owned it. Petcock seeps fuel on a full tank may fix when I get time just a bad oring. Back grab bar has a little road rash from doing wheelies to far back on asphalt new ones are fairly cheap. Return spring on kickstart just quit but it's a simple fix for me or the right person it still works fine and kickstarts no problem u jus have to pull the kickstart back up by hand and new one has been ordered should be here this week. I'm looking to trade it for other toys or a decent streetbike or car or a truck v8 cars or a v8 s10 or c10 or a 4x4 toyota. I like a variety of things so let me no what you got. I'm not really looking to sell it but feel free to make an offer. Would like it to go to a good home with someone who appreciates the older 250r's! I've posted it several times b4 and have had all kinda trade offers and cash offers but it'll take something special in trade to take it off my hands because I love the atv but I've got kids and I've only put less than 3 tanks of fuel thru it since I've owned it. Please don't waste my time or yours by sending silly offers I will ignore them. Will include helmet with Mohawk and Scott goggles and a little bit of gear etc! Feel free to email me or call or text. If I don't respond I will get back to you when I can. Please send pics info of what you may have to trade. Thanks for looking and have a great day."

18"" Light contour fluted (factory upgrade) SS barrel, lightweight Carbon Arms carbon fiber handguard with Magpul MOE polymer rails (holes drilled by Carbon Arms), ACE lightweight Skeleton Stock with 2 recoil pads and sling attach point, 2 stage trigger, Smith Enterprises Vortex flash hider (because the muzzle break that came with it was way too LOUD) that can accept a Gemtech suppressor, and Hogue pistol grip.

All mods geared toward making this a lightweight rifle that is fun to shoot and could go deer hunting too. For those that are wondering . . . WITH the optic this gun weighed 10 lbs 5 oz - pretty good for an AR-10!! Actually SR-25 would be more correct, FYI these do accept SR-25 magazines. 

Includes 19 round magazine and 5 round magazine (both pictured). Also have original firearm box and factory hard case. 

This rifle looks sharp and is a blast to shoot as well. Like new condition. Has been babied. About 600 rounds through it. Functions flawlessly.  

Serious inquiries only. Have invested over $2000 in upgrading the rifle. Upgrades were professionally installed. Asking $1650, will not include optic or sling/sling mount.

Thanks and God Bless!"

THE AR PLATFORM REDEFINED. The SR-556® offers Ruger's legendary rugged reliability, and comes factory standard with a host of accessories that today's shooters demand. Employing a patent-pending, chrome-plated, two-stage piston driven operating system that provides the user with a cleaner, cooler running, reliable firearm that is truly state-of-the-art.

The chrome-lined gas block and chrome-plated piston and regulator work together to provide a smooth power delivery stroke to the bolt carrier. The by-products of the gas system are vented out the bottom of the gas block, away from the bolt carrier, keeping the action clean and free from contaminants. The end result is significantly improved performance over gas driven rifles.
