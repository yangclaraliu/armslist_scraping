PRICE FOR ROLLER IS $2200 MINUS Tach, ULTRALIGHT GAUGES, NEW TIRES NOT MOUNTED.  If the trade is right or for extra I can add parts. The trunk is cut out and aluminum replaced stock trunk floor. (not completely finished but can used as is, set up for fuel cell. Interior not great but not horrible. Headliner sucks. Most parts have 30 min run time, Chassis and drive train parts have under 500 miles on them.
MOTOR:468 BBC, Speed pro skirted pistons .230 dome, Iron heads oval port closed chamber 98cc, Comp double springs and hardware, 7/16"" screw in studs and guide plates, Scat Pro stock I Beam 4340 rods, Proform 1:7 roller rockers, Comp HI-Tech push rods, Schill 1000 cfm (converted Holley 850) Carb, RPM Air Gap split plane intake..to much to list. Here is what motor needs to be rebuilt. I have contacted the engine builder Big mikes machine and WRH about the heads. approx 360$ to work over heads and 4 new valves in the two bad cylinders (does not look like it needs work but better to put together once and be done. $250 to have the two cylinders sleeved and 80$ for two new pistons. Im not 100% if both cylinders need sleeved. Cam and lifters are good but going to have springs tested and possibly replace with a flat tappet. With rings and bearings and gaskets for under 1g motor will be ready to roll. Im planning to build much more power. So if you want the motor cheaper you can make me an offer as is. I will have pistons/crank etc down to bare block this weekend. If i rebuilt the motor with build sheet from machine shops price is going up. It will have all new rings, bearings, gaskets etc. Fresh motor, possibly new forged pistons, bigger cam and porting the heads and intake. As for the tranny it is a built TH350 with 4500 converter. Not sure if i wanna sell it but if trade is right or cash then ill sell my cats."

Fine line checkering. High lustre blued metal. 26"" barrel. Factory Weatherby butt pad. Leupold Vari-X III 2.5 X 8 Gold Ring scope. Leupold mount. Leather sling believed to be factory. Scope was put on when the rifle was new. Weatherby's during this time period were made in Japan. This was considered to be first-rate equipment when my dad bought it new. Serial number indicates the rifle was made in 1989.

This rifle has been sitting in my dad's closet for quite some time. He is getting on in years and recently decided to thin the herd. He did shoot one elk with this rifle in the early 1990's. He is the only owner. He purchased it new in Southern Oregon from the now defunct Seiber's Sporting Goods. 

Rifle is in very good condition. No rust. No stock dings. But it has been sitting for years and will need to be thoroughly cleaned before use. Don't know when the last time it was fired. My dad doesn't think this rifle has had more than one box of shells (20 rounds) put through it in the last 20 years. If you are looking for a .340 Mag, then you already know about the power and energy at long range this caliber produces. 

In the April 2015 issue of Guns & Ammo, professional hunter Craig Boddington says of this rifle: ""The longest shot I ever made on a grizzly was a bit over 250 yards with a .340 Weatherby Magnum; the bear never knew what hit it.""

Compare my price and condition with others out there. If you were to buy this same package today, you would spend around $2400 for the rifle alone. And another $600 for the scope and mounts. Look at the gun auction websites and you will see that my rifle is hundreds of dollars less than any others.

Give me a call if you would like to talk. I have more photos that are too large for Armslist. Will gladly ship to your FFL. The rifle will be professionally packaged in bubble wrap and shipped UPS Ground. I have eleven rounds of factory Weatherby ammo that I will include with the rifle ($55 value).

Bought new 2 months ago. 

Only two rounds put through it. 
Comes in the original box.  A hogue rubber grip was bought and installed at 
CI shooting range .  (only $9 value.)
The grip is easily removed if desired, leaving no marks behind:  Gun will look brand new stock.  Comes with one magazine. 

Kept in the case and was barely ever handled..  my FFL lightly oiled the slide the day it got shipped in.  Other than that, there has been no buffing, no polishing, no filing or anything strange.  
Just sat in the case until last week, I took it down to a creek and shot it twice before my ears couldn't take it anymore.  
(I didn't have ear protection in my truck and I just about blew out my eardrums)

I love it.  It is highly regarded in reviews by those who actually own it. 
I would love to keep it but you know... money.  lol

Only 2 rounds through it but... 
A used gun is a used gun. period. 

I'm asking typical used price. No special treatment due to only light amount of usage.

Will entertain the idea of trades for a cheap shotgun or rifle + cash offer. 

Will trade straight up for a Ruger 10/22 takedown.  That's an unequal deal in value, I know. 
All depends on how attached someone is to their 10/22 or if they could see it gone without missing it. 

Leaving for a backpacking trip in Canada is why I'd entertain the trade +cash.  They won't let me in with a handgun, only a shotgun or rifle.  

Now that you've read an essay about the thing... 
Consider helping me out.  I don't want to get mauled by a bull moose while I'm out there. 
I'm 25, it will be my first time out in the wild with Moose and Bear!

I will try to give as much info as I can, but I may not be able to answer all of your questions.

Its a newer model Coyote Widetrack LE complete chassis with a Briggs Animal motor. The motor is just bolted down and will need hooked up (fuel line, carb, exhaust, throttle cable etc). Kart chassis is in excellent shape as well as the body panels. The kart has a Mychron3 gauge in the steering wheel. Everything suspension wise is fully adjustable. It has 4 brand new wheels on it. This is the real deal race kart. 

Spare parts include:
-Digiton DT32 gauge
-Aluminum Kart stand and Brand new kart cover.
-3 spare rear axles
-5 spare engines.. not sure what kind they are, some can only be used for parts.
-2 different seats

Don't bother wasting my time trying to set up an appointment then backing out on the last minute. I am tired of these idiots who would say that ""they are interested, they have the money, and that they will buy it"", but will say no 15 mins before the meeting time. I have put alot of money into this, I hate to see it go but I need the money.

And also please understand that we have to go through FFL. That means that the transaction has to happen through an FFL holder, usually a gun shop. My preffered gun shop is West Coast Armory. Either the one in Everett or Bellevue. So don't ask me to drive to Bellingham or Tacoma. An also please understand that an FFL transaction means you have to pay an FFL transfer fee, which is $50, and that you have to pay tax.

I will not have to explain everything that I said above when you contact me. And when you contact me, I only want to talk about the price, and meeting time and place.

The PPQ M2 is a true breakthrough in ergonomics for self-defense handguns. The sculpted grip meshes smoothly into the hand. The trigger is the finest ever on a polymer, striker-fired handgun. The styling is elegant and trim. What’s more, PPQ M2 has been updated for 2013 with a new traditional reversible mag release button. The leading edge just took another step forward."

I am selling my Glock 19 Generation 4 pistol chambered in 9mm. I have owned this gun for a little over 2 years and bought it brand new (paid $580). I am choosing to sell it because I am wanting a full sized pistol instead. I have only put around 100 rounds through it (take a look at the photos showing the barrel). I simply don't have the time and/or places to shoot it. I installed a set of Truglo TFO tritium night/fiber optic sights ($90) on it last December so they have plenty of life left in them. It comes with all the original box materials and accessories. Also note that I used a white crayon to paint the Glock indentions white. This can be removed with a little bit of effort if so desired. The only issue (which is purely cosmetic and only visible using no backstops) is a small portion of the grip is a little married because of my portable gun safe (see photo). It does not affect the feel of the gun whatsoever and like I said is BARELY visible. Almost perfect condition with very little signs of use. If you have any questions please feel free to email me and ask. PRICED TO SELL!
