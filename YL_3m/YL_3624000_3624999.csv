Is it possible for a pistol small enough to carry every day to have all the features and capacity that you’d expect in a larger pistol? If that pistol is the XD-S® from Springfield Armory®, the answer is yes. The XD-S® 3.3? Single Stack 9mm offers so much that you’ll be astonished that it all fits in the small, concealable profile. 

 The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Use your XD-S® Single Stack with an X-Tension™ magazine and you’ll find that your carry pistol has grown into something that will astonish and delight you on the range. Use a flush-fitting magazine when you carry it, and it shrinks such that you’ll forget it’s there. 

 If you’re looking for the most available capacity in the most concealable package, you should pick up an XD-S® 3.3? Single Stack in 9mm. You don’t have to settle for a larger gun to gain shooting comfort. Nor do you have to sacrifice size for capacity. Hold an XD-S® 3.3? Single Stack today, and you’ll want to shoot it. Put it in your holster, and you’ll find that it’s Noticeably Unnoticeable™.

Please Note:
You can buy a Colt Competition CSR-1516, which is an AR15 style Sporting Rifle (no forward assist), on Cheaper than Dirt for $749. If you are looking for a sporting rifle than that's a great deal and you should go for it! However my gun is not a Sporting Rifle. It's a real M4 Colt and currently on Cheaper than Dirt would cost you over $1250, and that before $350+ in furniture upgrades."

Overall, the rifle is in nice condition with a few hundred rounds, if that, down the pipe.  The only issue is on top of the dust cover there is a dent, shown in pic, obviously it does not affect the function one bit.  If the buyer wants, I have an extra dust cover I can replace it with, it is not a Saiga dust cover, but will work just fine, of course.

$1,000 firm in cash or better in trade value.

If wanting to trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.  Not in need or looking for anything on trades, but I will consider trading if the deal makes sense on my end, otherwise, I prefer cash at this time.

Below are trades I might consider, many of these would serve as back-ups, but I like having multiples that use the same mags and parts.  I will consider other trade offers of course, just let me know the deal.

FN SCAR 16 and 17 or nice AR uppers in 5.56, .450 Bushmaster, maybe .50 Beowulf

Beretta CX4 9mm 92FS mag model preferred, but I can do the mag conversion pretty cheap, so will consider the PX4 model also, maybe the .45ACP model too.  

Semi-auto rifles, AK-47, SKS(Norinco & Russian, maybe Yugo) Saiga rifles and shotguns(converted or not), PSL, FAL, AR-10, AR-15 and variants.

Semi-auto pistols and revolvers.

May consider shotguns and bolt-actions, depending.

Quality higher power range scopes, quality red dots and magnifiers maybe.

Ammo in the popular calibers to help make a deal happen, but I have plenty already 308/7.62x51, 7.62x39, 7.62x54, 5.45x39 (7n6), .223/5.56, 9mm, .45ACP, .357 Sig, .357 Mag, .44 Mag and .22lr.

The predecessor to the Tec-9. The KG-99 is less common than the Tec-9 and generally more sought after due to their higher build quality. For example, the KG-99 sights are actually milled compared to the Tec-9s bent piece of scrap that is normally mis-aligned. This very clean, rust free, nick free example comes with the original 30 rd mag, original box (that's right, get your collectors boner up), and metal Tec-9 end cap. I was going to have the rear of the receiver threaded for the metal cap but never got around to it. Like 98% of tec-9s/kg-99s and 100% of DC-9s it will be really picky about ammo. I've had good luck with 115gr while 147gr turns it into a jam factory. All in all I haven't really shot the gun much as in once and it is taking up too much room in the safe.
This is great for the Keltec collector as it was designed by George Kellgren, Keltec came to be after Interdynamic went the way of the do-do

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

That's right it can shoot three different calibers. That is a pretty sweet gun to have around. Guess what else? It has a Wolff 30oz trigger spring which gives a dick tingling 2 lb trigger pull. I have the original trigger spring which I will include because what the hell am I going to do with it after you buy this pistol from me? With that long sight radius this is freaking shooter in 38spl/357 mag. I can easily tackle targets at 25 and 50 yrds. 9mm does have a bit more spread (a 9mm bullet is .355 so it isn't as tight a fit but sub 25yrds it doesn't matter and the cost savings will make anyone happy). This makes a great backpacking/hiking/camping companion. It does have cylinder tracks and some minor wear/scratches.

This rifle is rare in and of itself but this rifle was sent to Spain for use in the Spanish Civil War. There are two indications of this fact. The wire sling hangers and the 5 dot dice mark on the left side of the barrel are indications widely associated with SCW rifles. This rifle includes the upper handgaurd and the cleaning rod which can be rare for M91s in general. This rifle is not import marked indicating it was imported into the US prior to import marks being required. The rifle has a nice worn patina common among SCW rifles. This rifle is all non serial matching which is also common on SCW rifles. I have tested the head space and fireing pin protrusion on this rifle and all passed. The bore on this rifle is pitted but it has very strong rifling and it is not counter bored. The stock is very dark and it is unknown if it is the original Remington stock but it is assumed it is not. This rifle must be shipped to an 01 or 03 FFL.

We are including in this not just the barrel but also a pound of leach solution which is valued at $500 it's self. A diffuser and pump as well. Everything except the shovel, truck and ore haha!

1 55 gallon barrel with a holes for hoes a fabricated false bottom chamber.

3 hot water hoses and fittings

1 pump 

1 diffuser for creating oxygenated water

1lb of leach solution

1 package of PH stips to get your PH right before adding leach solution

The Gen4 recoil management is a dream. Glock uses their new design to the dual recoil spring assemblies on its Gen4 pistols. Couple that easy recoil with multiple back strap options for a perfect fit to your hand and the Gen4 SF (short frame) grip for easy concealability, and you can understand why FBI and CIA agents carry these under their suit jackets. Large enough for a service/duty weapon, small enough for conceal carry. Buyer pays all transfer fees.

The XD-S® Single Stack from Springfield Armory® has forever changed what you can expect out of your daily carry pistol. Now all the features and power you’re used to in the XD® and XD(M)® lines can be had in the shockingly slim XD-S® Single Stack – a pistol that packs so easily you’ll forget it’s there.

The XD-S® is the first and only single-stack XD® from Springfield Armory®. In addition to the inherently slim nature of the design, the frame is a short sub-compact style, and the barrel is just 3.3 or 4.0 inches. The XD-S® Single Stack seems to disappear when you carry it, and pretty soon you’ll forget it’s even there.

The XD-S® Single Stack consistently astonishes and delights shooters on the range. Its comfortable ergonomics – complete with two interchangeable backstraps – allow it to work without punishing your hands. The fiber optic front sight and white-dot rear sight align quickly and provide a clear sight picture for accurate shooting. The trigger on the XD-S® Single Stack feels more like it belongs on a target pistol than a carry piece. Shooters who are used to difficult, heavy triggers on deep concealment pistols will be astounded at the smooth, crisp XD-S® Single Stack trigger."

Specifically, the left side of the slide is stamped “1920” above the standard Mauser markings on the left side of the slide. Also, the WWI Military unit marks have been peened off the front grip strap, and it has been re-stamped “S.G. II. 79” – this indicates the gun was re-issued to Rrussian Schutzpolezi – Gambinen District (gun # 79) – this was a Protection Police unit…….which may have been incorporated into the SD and under the auspicies of the SS during WWII – making it a very cool collectible handgun, indeed!"

During its development the most important requirements were flexibility, functionality and safety. Ergonomics of the grip have been improved by interchangeable back straps and side panel inserts. In combination with the ambidextrous operating controls, this pistol can be individually adapted to almost any user. No compromises have been made regarding safety. The P30 V3 has a traditional double action/single action trigger system with a decocking button at the rear of the slide and a firing pin block safety that eliminate the need for a manual safety. Its advanced loaded chamber indicator, which is easily seen and felt, positively indicates a loaded chamber. Another feature is the SuperLuminova 3-dot sights with non-tritium luminous dots, allowing an exact target acquisition even under poor lighting conditions.

I have never shot this rifle so it is BRAND NEW and it is in PRISTINE condition!!!!!!!
I also have the pistol five-seven (5.7) that I will be listing at an incredible price also - so ask me or look for it here on Armslist.

This gun retails for around $1449.00 if you find them. And if you find it for less it is probably used or on mega BACKORDER!!!!!!!  Plus I am including a Burris solar optic that retails for over $200.00 - not one of those crappy NC star ones....

Priced for a quick sale (fixing my Vette) - 1st $1200.00 takes it. Yes, 1st $1200.00 takes this beauty.

I price my firearms to sell so please don't ask what the price is because I just listed it and it is more than fair. If you don't agree, move on and don't waste either of our time haggling...

I had a lot to list so if I missed something please contact me. All firearm sales will be in accordance to local State and Federal laws so please make sure you know what yours are. All firearms that are shipped will be shipped to a licensed FFL of your choice. I pay shipping; this will include packaging, insurance and tracking. No dreamers, no holding guns for a week or two, no loans or payment plans, no trades (Lord knows I have plenty more). Cash in person, CC through PayPal (contact me FIRST), checks ok, but the funds need to clear MY bank prior to shipping or picking up, and USPS money order.

If not otherwise stated all my firearms are in pristine, new condition – I collect, don’t shoot. Almost 90% of my collection is not even broken in – under 200 rounds fired per firearm. I clean the guns every 3 months, and they are stored in a climate controlled indoor gun safe. You are more than welcome to inspect the guns at my gun range in Cornelius, NC but do not ask to meet anywhere else because the answer will be no.

I provided a picture of the gun so you can view the actual piece but for more detailed information please go to the manufacturer’s website 1st then if more information is needed send me an email. I do work but check my emails regularly.

Please search out my other items as I am parting out a large selection from my personal collection including; S&W Air weight, Para 14-45 competition 1911, FNX 45, FN Hi Power, Henry Golden boy, MP5, Mossberg 930, CZ 455, Webley 455, and a Remington 710"

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.



The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.



The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

At this writing, we are unaware of any more of these revolvers for sale or auction anywhere. These double-action revolvers were made by FN for the European Police market between the years 1974-1989, and only a few made it to the USA. All the guns had 3” barrels. This revolver has a factory blue finish, and factory checkered wooden grips. It has import marks on the bottom of the ejector shroud. The pistol was, at one time, a “working gun,” and it has some holster wear and finish wear on the barrel, and the grips show heavy wear. There is a dollop of white paint on the front sight blade. DA trigger pull is very smooth and the bore is shiny with good rifling. We do not have the box or any accessories for this revolver. ***Please contact us with specific questions BEFORE bidding on an item***

Great pocket pistol..., no one will know you're carrying it and uses the awesome 22LR round. Seven round magazine.

As a benefit, most of the guns I have for sale are old enough that they are basically untraceable: or at the very least only traceable with significant money and manpower thrown at it.

So it’s time to arm up because as we know this latest law is just another step towards a statewide registration…., with the ultimate goal being confiscation!

Seriously people.  Been on this site for quite a while and dont get why everyone is trying to screw everyone else over.  You buy a gun, get tired of it, and want something new, that is fine, but at least be reasonable when you are trying to swap or sell on here.  We are a select few among a vast majority who can responsibly behave when it comes to our sport.  If we wanted to pay what you payed for it, we would go to  Gander Mountain, or Dicks. Or the other chain stores that rip you off.  Im not saying to just give your firearms away.  But have some respect and show some decorum for the people that enjoy the same pastime.
