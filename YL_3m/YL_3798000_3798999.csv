The SpecterDR™ Dual Fields-of-View (DFOV) sight provides both close quarter and precision fire ranged capability in a single package. Whether utilizing the Red Dot in 1x or 1.5x magnification or the ranging reticle in 4x or 6x mode, the SpecterDR™ DFOV sight provides ultra-wide viewing angles for optimal situational awareness and unmatched low-light performance. The SpecterDR™ DFOV sight allows the user to safely and effectively transition in and out of building for close quarter or extended range without changing sights. The 1x or 1.5x FOV provides a generous viewing angle (24° in the 1-4x and 16° in the 1.5-6x version) and an extremely fast, ""both eyes open"" target acquisition capability. The second FOV provides 4x or 6x magnified sight (FOV 6° & 4° respectively), a range compensating reticle, long-range target identification and precision marksmanship capability. The two unique fields-of-view are easily and quickly interchanged by means of the patent-pending, locking lever mechanism on the side of the optical housing. Features

A unique CZ50 with a plum colored slide. Caliber is .32acp. Stamped NB50 on the front strap of the grip. This indicates this pistol was accepted into use by Czech State Security in 1950. The explanation for the plum slide, as has been told to me by others, is that sometimes at the factory the blueing agent would get old or get impurities in it. Small enough for conceal carry. It likes the hotter European ammo, like S&B, Fiocchi, Gecco, PrivPatisan. Most internal springs have been updated. $215. Macalla, Helena area. Text me at REDACTED."

This revolver comes with the original Magna Wood Grips which are in excellent conditon.  Also 2 Pachmayr grips are included.  One is similar to the original but a bit bigger and better for recoil and a bigger one which tames this tiger.  All are shown.
Also included are three holsters.  One is the original S&W holster, one is an IWB Uncle Mikes holster and the last one is a rough out pocket holster.  
Two speed loaders are included as well.
This is being sold by me for the original owners mother.  He passed away several years ago and the gun sat in the closet until a few months ago.  I took it to the range to fire it and fired a box of ammo including a few +p hollow points for self defense,  with most being standard vel. lead bullets.  It shot very well and it is unusually tight with little if any cylinder play.  It does have some rust with pitting on the back strap from not being oiled after the owner passed away.  It is not bad but it is obvious.  The rest of the gun has no pitting and has almost no holster wear altho there is a spot on both sides of the barrel.  Bluing is shiny and not dull.  
This will make a good carry gun and shooter as it is not of investment quality and I did look up the serial number and I think it is late 1980's or early 1990's origin.  I will send you the number if your interested.
No internal lock.
Sold as a package deal only.  I have some self defense rounds from Buffalo and lead rounds also if you are interested for a good price.  The Buffalo comes 20 rounds to a box and I have 3 or 4 boxes, all slightly different.
Must have a FL license and CWP to buy and be willing to sign a bill of sale.  Also must be picked up in the kindall area.
Will consider offers.
Trade for a glock 26 gen 4 if you are interested plus cash if you are interested.  I prefer a cash sale however."

This is your chance to buy ""The Original"" UZI carbine, a pristine example of one of the rarest US Import UZI variants. 

All accessories shown are 100% unused either new in the box or as new condition. 

The Uzi carbine is similar in appearance to the Uzi submachine gun. The Uzi carbine is fitted with a 16"" barrel to meet the minimum rifle barrel length requirement for civilian sales in the United States. It fires from a closed-bolt position in semi-automatic mode only and uses a floating firing pin as opposed to a fixed firing pin. The FS-style selector switch has two positions ""F"" for ""fire"" and ""S"" for ""safe"". 

The Uzi is a family of Israeli open-bolt, blowback-operated submachine guns. Smaller variants are considered to be machine pistols. The Uzi was one of the first weapons to use a telescoping bolt design which allows the magazine to be housed in the pistol grip for a shorter weapon. 

The first Uzi submachine gun was designed by Major Uziel Gal in the late 1940s. The prototype was finished in 1950. First introduced to IDF special forces in 1954, the weapon was placed into general issue two years later. The Uzi has found use as a personal defense weapon by rear-echelon troops, officers, artillery troops and tankers, as well as a frontline weapon by elite light infantry assault forces. 

The Uzi has been exported to over 90 countries, over its service lifetime, it has been manufactured by Israel Military Industries, FN Herstal, and other manufacturers. From the 1960s through the 1980s, Uzi submachine guns were sold to more military, law enforcement and security markets than any other submachine gun ever made.

The Armasight Cipher Digital Night Vision Clip-On System is a digital night vision device that can be attached to a rifle scope or other optic and is designed to assist in low-light/night observing. This Armasight Cipher allows you to convert your existing day scope to night vision and provides excellent target acquisition and aiming capabilities. It can be used as a stand-alone night vision device as well while offering the ability to connect it to spotting scopes, binoculars, or monoculars.

Using a high rate, near-IR, hypersensitive dual-output high resolution Sony CCD array, the Armasight Cipher, when attached to a rifle scope, eliminates the requirement of removing your existing day scope from your rifle, to replace it with a dedicated night vision sight (which would also involve re-zeroing). The Cipher simply mounts in front of your own standard day optical sight and is factory bore-sighted to tolerances of less than 1 MOA. This Cipher allows the user to maintain consistent eye relief and shooting position.

A wireless remote control unit can be placed anywhere on the user’s weapon, allowing activation of the Cipher. The Armasight Cipher is equipped with a quick-disconnect mounting system which provides the user with an easy and quick way to attach or detach the Cipher.

The Cipher is recommended for use with day systems of 6x-7x.

I have since put another 200 rounds through it. It shoots as an SKS should. The spike bayonet is included but the previous owner managed to loose the screw. These are available online and are cheap. I have been meaning to order one but simply have not yet. There are a couple of funky spots in the bluing on the dust cover and the magazine - looks like it came that way from the factory.

The rifle will come with the ATI stock it was in when I got it. The previous owner painted the upper hand guard black to go with the ATI stock so he didn’t have to change it out. I think I can put my hands on the plastic upper hand guard and will include it if I do. The rifle will also come with a 30 round magazine (never tried it, so I don’t know if it works or not), a railed dust cover (never tried it either) and the green sling.

Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of semi-auto rifles, is proud to offer to American shooters the Bulgarian-made SAM7SF. This 7.62x39 caliber rifle combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. From its unique right-side folding tubular buttstock to its 24x1.5mm muzzle threads with muzzle brake, every component of the SAM7SF is engineered to provide decades of dependable and accurate service. The SAM7SF rifle is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7SF receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Pistol is in excellent condition and has not seen that much range time. Comes with 1 magazine plus all boxing and original documentation.

I've made 2 minor modifications:

    Magazine Extension - Added small extension to bottom of mag and changed the follower. Supposed to be able to hold 12 rounds with the extension but I've only ever been able to fit 11. You can see from the 1st picture the extension, by default the magazine is flush with the base of the firearm.
    Magazine Disconnect - By default the firearm has a magazine disconnect safety to where if the magazine is not in the firearm it will not fire. Since this gun already has a grip safety and a manual safety I thought the magazine disconnect was a little redundant. I've kept the parts and this is something I can easily revert back to normal if requested.

I won this gun at a sportsmen's banquet a two years back, left it in the box for a year, and have shot it about 25 times since taking it out of the box. It has sat in my safe since coming out of the box, and I've cleaned and oiled it as appropriate. I'm selling it because I replaced it with a 10/22 and don't need another .22 in the old safe.
In Eau Claire. Meet in person or I'm willing to accept a credit card and ship directly to another Wisconsin Resident over 18 who is legal to own a gun. Shipping is $20 via insured trackable means. I will ONLY ship to the address on a valid WI driver's license as faxed/emailed to me. I am willing to ship out of state to your FFL that fee is $25, and you will have to pay any FFL fees on your end.

Please note, I prefer to sell in person, but following all applicable laws I am willing to ship.

Am open to trades, but only if I clearly get the better end of the deal. I am looking to get money out of this gun, not turn it into something else I have to then sell, that has the same value as the price I'm asking.

It features the Spike's Nickel Boron BCG and MagPul Moe hand guard (you can buy the rails that work with the MOE for around $5ea.) and comes with 2 new 30rd. AR Stoner mags.  Only selling this upper because I want to slim down on calibers and already have much more in 5.56.  Ballistically, this round is very similar to .223/5.56 when fired from the same length barrels.  Many say it is a flatter shooting round and more accurate as well, depending of course on the platform being used, AK vs. AR and the round itself.  This round is also much cheaper to shoot and available everywhere.

Price Drop to $700 firm or higher in trades.  I have tins of the banned 7n6 ammo if someone has a multi-gun trade or wants to trade something of higher value.

I prefer cash as I do not need anything in trades, but will consider trading as long as the deal makes sense and the value is there, otherwise, I'll take cash.  

If wanting to do some type of trade, please state what you have and exactly what you want to do on the deal, straight trade, trade +/- cash, other firearms, ammo, optics, etc. either way, so I know the deal.

I like semi-auto rifles, AR-15 variants, AR-10, AK-47 variants, pistols and revolvers in .357 mag and .44 mag.  Less interested in bolt-actions, lever guns and shotguns, but I will consider them, depending on the deal and values.  May consider quality optics as well.

introBanner

It takes the concept of a modular rifle to futuristic levels, while maintaining an absolutely simple operation that make it ultra-reliable. With ambidextrous controls, easily-replaceable barrel and virtually endless possibilities for customization and accessorization, the ARX100 is adaptable to any firing scenario and is perfect for today’s most demanding tactical shooter.

Ultimate-Reliability-and-Ease-of-MaintenanceUltimate Reliability and Ease of Maintenance

The ARX100 features a constant contact/short-stroke gas piston system that makes it feed and fire under the most unforgiving conditions. The lightweight technopolymer receiver allows for reliable operation with virtually no lubricants. To make maintenance easy and trouble-free, this rifle has no pins and can be completely disassembled in a matter of seconds with no tools at all.





Ultimate VersatilityUltimate-Versatility

This rifle was designed to be completely ambidextrous, and all the critical controls on it may be operated right- or left-handed. These include the 2-position safety, the magazine release, the bolt release and charging handle and the case-ejection selector, which determines whether spent brass is ejected to the right or left. The flip-up backup sights that come standard on the ARX100 are also versatile, offering an easily-adjustable diopter system ranged from 100 to 800 yards. The barrel is also easily replaceable in seconds, making is possible to use different lengths and calibers without any tools required. Lastly, the folding stock is adjustable for length of pull at the touch of a button, using a simple and rugged telescopic construction.

Ultimate-AccessorizationUltimate Accessorization

The possibilities for accessorization on the ARX100 are limited only by the user’s imagination. It comes out of the box with a full-length Picatinny rail on top, which is perfect for attaching a variety of optics and other sighting systems. It also has Picatinny rails on both sides of and under the fore-end, which offer countless possibilities for easily adding lighting systems and other tactical devices."

All of Slip 2000 products are 100% made in the USA. Slip 2000 is also a veteran owned small business   

Overview:

Slip 2000 Extreme Weapons Lubricant (EWL) was designed for use on rapid fire guns. It contains a proprietary Anti-wear agent that reduces friction and wear by 90-95%. Slip 2000 EWL is formulated to provide maximum performance in larger guns that may have issues with friction and heat while providing all the benefits of our regular lubricant.

Slip 2000 EWL is a specially formulated synthetic liquid lubricant. Formulated without the use of mineral oil or petroleum distillates Slip 2000 EWL has extremely high penetrating and (EP) antiwear properties. It also combines three essential functions in a single product. Specifically; Cleaning, Lubrication, and Preservation of handheld weapons, and weapons systems of both large and small caliber. This product will not separate, become sticky or dry out and leave any tacky residue behind. It will not attract and hold firing residue, dust or dirt particles like petroleum products.

Lubrication:

Slip 2000 EWL has incorporated advanced technology additives to enhance film strength and anti-wear properties. Penetrating the pores and bonding its self to the surface of the metal through physical absorption reducing surface tension thereby reducing friction between moving parts and minimizing wear and the build-up of wear related debris.

Slip 2000 EWL will not dry out or attract dust or dirt particles like petroleum products. Even when surface is wiped dry to the touch Slip 2000 EWL is still present and lubricating the metal parts from within the pores of the weapon. This product does not require a liquid carrier to be present for protection. Slip 2000 EWL does not evaporate off because there are no carriers needed for continued protection.

Cleaning:

Slip 2000 EWL provides additional protection through additives that in addition to the ability to penetrate between metal surfaces, it will also aid in the effective removal of built up dirt, lead, copper, carbon, corrosion particles and firing residues that can buildup and become abrasive to both recoil and gas operated mechanisms.

Preservation:

After cleaning, a micro thin film of our enhanced preservative immediately bonds itself and forms a barrier film on the surface that displaces water and provides a corrosion resistant barrier against rust and dirt. It is designed to give protection against hydrogen sulfide (H2S), mild mineral acids, carbon dioxide (CO2), saltwater and brackish environments, musky water, chlorine and similar adverse environments and has passed the Salt Spray Corrosion (ASTM B-117) 150 Hour test. Additionally a barrier of protection is formed to protect against all other fouling of lead, carbon, copper and plastic wad.

Applications:

Slip 2000 EWL is formulated to meet the complete requirements of cleaning, lubricating, and preserving both small and large caliber weapons in virtually all climate conditions. Apply to weapons metal surface liberally on first application. Allow to penetrate surface on first application approximately 5 to 10 min. Wipe excess lubricant from surface to leave a dry surface to the touch. This will also help when it comes to dirt not sticking to a dry weapon. As weapons are used and heat up the Slip 2000 will penetrate even deeper into the pores of the metal. On second cleaning these pores will fill in with additional Lubricant and a new protective barrier will be formed making the second cleaning much easier and faster.

Specifications:

Slip 2000 EWL meets most and exceeds requirements of MIL SPEC: MIL-PRF-63460D (6)
Kinematics Viscosity (ASTM D445) -59° F...Pass
Falex Load Carrying Capacity (ASTM D3233) +4500 lbs...Pass

I have a Rock River Arms LAR-15 rifle chambered in .223 Remington / 5.56 NATO. If you’re not familiar with this particular AR platform, Rock River has the BEST trigger available from any manufacturer. It breaks more cleanly and has less reset than any but the best after-market match grade triggers- that alone sold me on this rifle. For the more technical folks, the 20” barrel has a 1 in 9 twist and is chrome lined. Due to its length and twist characteristics, it will stabilize standard 55 grain ball ammunition as well as the more potent 72 grain/77 grain match grade stuff. I’ve had consistent 2-4” grouping out at 550-600 yds. with the heavier match grade stuff and an ACOG (not included). The rifle has a variety of accessories to improve both the functionality as well as looks listed below with their retail prices. 
-	Rifle: RRA LAR-15 NM A2. Paid $1000 in 2012 http://www.rockriverarms.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&category_id=226&CFID=455697875&CFTOKEN=94908663

-	Midwest Industries Gen 2 SS Series 1 piece hand guard/ barrel free float/ quad rail. $189 for the 15” version http://www.midwestindustriesinc.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=category.display&category_ID=450

-	MagPull MBUS front/ rear foldable sights. $100 for both. See bottom of page http://store.magpul.com/category/MBUS

-	Magpull CTR stock (not installed). Better all-around stock than then UTG. Never got around to installing it. $60 http://store.magpul.com/product/MAG310/180

-	UTG 6 position stock (installed) $50 http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/16-RBU6BM

-	Magpull B.A.D Lever (not installed). Allows bolt to be release with your trigger finger and allows for much faster reloads. $30 http://store.magpul.com/product/MAG980/misc

-	Magpull Angled foregrip $35. http://store.magpul.com/product/MAG411/rails

-	Spikes Tactical Dynacomp Muzzlebreak. One of the BEST breaks you can buy. Also dramatically reduces muzzle flash in low light conditions. $100 
http://www.amazon.com/Spikes-Tactical-Dynacomp-Extreme-556NATO/dp/B007TR78LG

-	Ergonomic super comfortable rubberized pistol grip. I forget the brand, but it’s a dramatic improvement over the standard hard plastic. $30

All told I’ve got about $1600 into this rifle not including the price of shipping, tax,  or the cost to have the all of the parts currently on the gun installed by a professional gun smith. The rifle has functioned flawlessly for all of the 2-3K rds I’ve had through it. It has eaten anything I’ve attempted to feed it without complaint and was cleaned and oiled between each outing. I’m looking to get about $1300 out of it, but am open to the best offer as well. I’d love to meet at the gun show this weekend in Reno (on 12/14) to sell the rifle, but am willing to meet just about any time for the right price. Please don’t hesitate to contact me with any questions or reasonable offers. Not interested in any trades other than a Gen 4 Glock 20 or a KelTec SU-16CA. Please note that the case pictured is NOT included in the sale.

Cheers!

Advanced Armament Corporation complete MPW rifles are available in 16”, 12.5” and 9” barrels chambered for 300 AAC BLACKOUT. (*All NFA rules apply)

A 30 caliber rifle the size of an AR15 5.56mm caliber rifle - without a reduction in magazine capacity. The AAC MPW in 300 AAC Blackout uses ordinary 223/5.56mm  magazines for a full 30 round capacity, and is available in 9, 12.5, and 16 inch barrels.*

Components are of premium quality. The 1:7 twist barrel is nitrided to provide extreme corrosion resistance and high hardness for a long life - outperforming chrome-lined barrels for longevity without the potential impediments to accuracy. The muzzle is threaded 5/8-24 and includes an AAC 51-tooth BLACKOUT™ flash suppressor with the complete upper. A Knight’s Armament free-floating URX III helps maintain accuracy while providing for the mounting of accessories. The bolt carrier group’s nickel boron (Ni-B) UCT EXO coating has a very high hardness and lower friction than either chrome or nickel teflon. There is also a base layer of high-phosphorous electroless nickel that ensures the extreme corrosion protection that is absent from other Nickel Boron carriers that use a single, thinner layer. The bolt itself is Carpenter 158® phosphated shot-peened steel to ensure precise dimensions with no concerns for hydrogen embrittlement in the critical lug area. A special green o-ring that is tested to not bind even at -40 degrees F is standard. The extractor spring is made from premium ultra-strong wire and is a low fatigue design to ensure the longest possible life. The extractor pin made from 300 ksi S2 tool steel - not the much lower strength S7 more commonly used. 

Finally, a properly-staked carrier-key with Permatex® gasket-seal compound ensures no gas leakage. The trigger is a Geissele for great feel and reliability, and the stock and pistol grip by MagPul Industries. One magazine is included. Optics, mounts, and silencer are not included.

The recommended optional sound suppressor is the AAC 762-SDN-6™, which provides an average of 39.3 dB reduction with subsonic ammunition."

All original paperwork, manuals, and test cartridge. Kit includes the SA OWB holser, cable lock, allen wrench (for holster adjustment) and a cleaning brush (never used). Also including a Fox kydex IWB holster.

Test cartridge is from Dec '04 and I picked up the gun in early '05. It has less than 1000 rounds over that time, but hard to pinpoint the exact number because I got to shoot so infrequently.

I never carried on my person until the last 6 months, and only about 10 times once I got the IWB Fox holster. Prior to that I had it with me in the glove box but not habitually. There are some blems on the slide to be expected from carry, but nothing glaring. This gun spent most of it's time in a drawer by the bed.

It shoots well. Additional pictures can be available for serious inquiries. Buyer would need to be willing to do a bill of sale and bring voter ID or CCW to prove they are not a felon.

Asking $400 for all of it with reasonable offers entertained. Also interested in an FDE Glock 17 Gen4."

Anyway... it's ""as new in box"" condition having only test fired half a mag.  A female friend of mine got it for critters and possibly hunting (good for hunting to 100 yds!) and then moved away from the woods where she was living and decided against having it.  I'm selling it for her.

Seriously, don't contact me even if you're a Special Forces Ranger Ninja SEAL who can't pick it up and you want your brother to write me a cashier's check and ship it to you for twice the price.  Save your breath! lol

You can shoot 22LR, 22 long, and 22 short out of it. First $220 cash/firm takes it.

Description: 
The Micro Might handgun is a five shot, fixed cylinder mini-revolver. It is designed around an historical and simple single action mechanism. By ""fixed cylinder"" means that the cylinder does not swing out of the frame for loading and unloading. Removal of the cylinder is accomplished by removing the cylinder base pin and taking the cylinder completely out of the frame. By ""single action"" means that the trigger performs only one function: it releases the hammer.
 Ammunition Warning
 Micro Might Inc. produces and sells Micro Might handguns designed and chambered for two different calibers. The intended caliber is noted both on the shipping and storage box and on the barrel of the Micro Might handgun itself. If your revolver is chambered for 22LR, any good quality factory made 22 caliber ammunition in long rifle, long or short may be safely used in the revolver. The revolver will also safely handle high velocity 22 ammunition.
 If your revolver is chambered for 22WMRF ammunition, ONLY USE 22WMRF cartridges. This designation stands for 22 caliber Winchester Magnum Rimfire ammunition. Use of standard 22 caliber ammunition in the 22WMRF revolvers can result in malfunctions and serious injuries.

Separately, another add of mine says:  $600 USD for the following.

I have a very nice Remington 11-87 Magnum Mossy Oak Turkey Gun with the Remington Factory Super Full Extended Choke Tube.  It has a brand new complete Trigger Control Group installed, all new springs, updated piston/seal ring, firing pin, etc.  All paperwork, Original Factory Box/Plug/Owners Manual.

These guns work great, I hate to part with them.  I injured my neck in a skiing accident, had surgery with neck implant and can no longer shoot heavy recoil anything, so I am thinning my gun safe of them."

I have the 1970 Marlin Brace Set of a Thousand for sale.  The rifles are 1970 new unfired and never had a round chambered. THIS IS A COLLECTOR SET! Therefore, I will NOT be breaking these apart under any circumstance. 

-These rifles are in the original case released in 1970 to commemorate 100 years of the Marlin company.  

-The original leather presentation case is included but like all the original cases, the foam interior had to be removed due to corrosion. The foam of choice in 1970 was not very good.  

-Both rifles have matching set serial numbers 

-Yes, they are both the thick, heavy, octagon barrels

-1st rifle is the Golden 39 22 LR.

-2nd rifle is the 336 30-30

-Both rifles are custom gold inlaid and engraved 

I feel that my asking price is fair and so please research before making an offer. Offensively low offers will be ignored.  

Thanks for lookin,
