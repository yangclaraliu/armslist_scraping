Wiley Clapp edition offers Novak sights with brass bead front, ""de-horned"" melted edges on all corners, rosewood/rubber custom Lett grips, and overall beautiful fit and finish.
Gun is in excellent shape. Comes with original Ruger box, one custom leather OWB pancake holster, one nylon holster, and all associated paperwork.

Like new condition.

Built in recoil pad, doesnt kick more than a 12 gauge with slugs. 

Has scope that came with it, not sure what the magnification is but will update when I get home later. 

Comes with 70-73 rounds! 20 or so are reduced recoil and the other 50 are full power. 
150-180 grain. All spent brass included as well (7 rounds or so). 

Only shot once and it worked great, only selling because I am wanting a new car and need to save up a down payment. 

Will come with box, manuals and gun lock as well. Just purchased right after black Friday. 

I can ship anywhere in North Carolina directly to your house, you just pay shipping ($25). Ammo has to ship separate though so be aware of that ($10). 

I do not live in Asheville and do not desire to drive there. My car gets terrible MPG's and requires premium gas so the furthest I am willing to go is Sylva, maybe Waynesville. But I would strongly prefer it if you drove to me in Franklin, NC.

So, I'm selling this beautiful 40 cal Sig P229. I bought it less than a year ago Certified Pre-owned, so it had been completely overhauled by the factory. It's a DA/SA with a decocker and no manual safety. It's got less than 300 rounds down the pipe since I purchased it. Included with the Sig are 4 Sig 12 round magazines and a Short Reset Trigger kit (which has not been installed and sells for $50). Because this is a certified pre-owned, it does not come with the plastic case, but does come with the Sig cardboard box that it came packaged in when I purchased it. 

The package is in excellent, nearly new condition. Pictures are available on request. 

I'm asking $625 or best reasonable offer. Buyer pays FFL. I prefer a FTF transaction in my area, but will ship to your FFL if you prepay via PayPal gift and pay for shipping."

The gun hasn't shot any rounds through, accept factory test fired once and the shell case is in the yellow envelope. 

If you can find any signs saying this Glock isn't new but used, I'll pay you $20 for your gas and time. Honesty is best policy in my book. I'm not cheating anyone paying for a used gun same as new like people doing on this site. 

This is Austrian Glock, not American made like they're right now. Some people preferred a genuine made Glock, from original country and this is it. 
A brand new Glock is going to cost you $499 at least plus tax (7.35% for KS resident) or S&H fee plus transfer fee if you buy online. So, you are looking to spend $540-550 for this but I just asking $500, saved you some money for ammo, folks.

Fiber-optic front sight, ""ghost ring"" rear sight. I've made no modifications to this shotgun. Probably has about 250 rounds through it total. I bought it less than a year ago, so it is a newer gun. Has a few light scuff marks on the barrel and receiver. It has been incredibly reliable with all buckshot/slugs, and eats remington/federal birdshot all day long (as long as it is 1 1/8th oz or greater). Very soft shooter, considering I grew up with pump action shotguns. I bought it on a whim and don't really have a use for it, I only really shoot skeet. Price is $520 firm. No trades please.

I have a brand new Motoped Pro 155cc.  This bike has only been on a paved test drive to ensure proper functionality.

We could talk about 165mm square tapered aluminum crank arms, or max torque of 1.70 foot-lbs @ 5500 RPM.  But most probably all you really want to know is, “How will this bike change my experience?”

If you’re reading this, you’re not the kind of person who experiences life from a couch.  You appreciate life as a limited time offer…not to be squandered.

The high-performance, solid components on this bike make a tough, light, fast and fun machine.  But a Motoped is not just a motorized downhill mountain bike; it’s also a way to enhance your riding and outdoors experience.  It may serve as a pressure relief valve, a social venue, a way to enjoy alone time communing with natural beauty, an adrenaline delivery device, a way to sneak out to the blind, or simply a tool to reduce your commute costs and put a stress-eating grin on your face.

Where can we start?  Live in San Francisco?  Go hit the ATM for $50 in cash…that will buy you a cup of coffee and enough gas to get you to New York City.  Yes…really.

It’s not just a road trip…it’s a quest.  These bikes are a conversation piece.  Each time you stop, a crowd gathers and you make a friend.  People ask where you’re going, how fast does your bike go, what kind of mileage you get, why do you like it, if you’re single, and so on.

Like a good bird dog or a trail horse, you’ll develop a personal relationship with your Motoped (you may even give it a name).  Why?  Because a Motoped is more than a solid, motorized downhill bike…it’s an important element of an adventurous lifestyle.

But don’t take my word for it.  Let’s hear what others had to say…

IT'S A BICYCLE. IT'S A DIRT BIKE. IT'S A MOPED. IT'S FAST. IT DOES WHEELIES. IT DOESN'T NEED TAGS OR A LICENSE. DO WE REALLY NEED TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE?

Manufactured as the P9M, it was imported to this country as the PJK-9HP. In contrast to other widely available FEG pistols (the P9R and GKK are both based on S&W designs, with just a vague cosmetic resemblance to the Hi-Power), it is the company's only true BHP clone. As such, its parts (magazine, controls, trigger, grips, etc.) can be directly swapped with BHP parts. You can find a fuller discussion here: http://world.guns.ru/handguns/hg/hu/feg-p9r-e.html

The basic M4 bayonet design became the basis for subsequent U.S. M5, M5A1, M6, and M7 bayonets, until superseded by the M9 in 1986. 

The M4 through M7 series bayonets were used with the M1 Carbine, M1 Garand rifle, M14 selective-fire rifle, and the M16 assault rifle. Many countries produced variants of the M4 Series or copied the M4 blade design for use on bayonets

Your representatives can be found here:

http://app.leg.wa.gov/DistrictFinder/

The letter I wrote is as follows:

I am writing to express my concern with the passing of I-594 as I believe it places an unfair burden on law abiding firearm owners.  I believe the law to be poorly written and misguided as its express purpose is to close a ""gun show loophole"".  As a law abiding firearm enthusiast I can assure you that no such ""loophole"" exists (ie: Vehicle laws apply at car shows just as gun laws apply at gun shows).  Furthermore several studies by the U.S. Department of Justice show just between 0.6 and 0.8 percent of state prison inmates incarcerated for gun crimes obtained guns at gun shows. (Bureau of Justice Statistics, Guns Used in Crime, July 1995; Firearms Use by Offenders, November 2001; and Firearm Violence, 1993-2011, May 2013.)  Shows sponsored by the ""Washington Arms Collectors"" (a venue I frequent regularly) require ALL attendants pass a background check for ALL sales.

In short:  I ask that we all be reasonable.  Criminals don't follow laws, please stop the persecution of those who do.

My letter and citations were modeled after this article:  http://www.kirklandviews.com/blog/2014/10/19/f5nb1b0kix1cacgb4kjkczbv8j1eol

2/13/2105 update:

I received my first reply from a representative yesterday.

Senator Jeannie Darneille said:

""... I have consistently supported stronger gun laws and I will continue to vote for legislation that restricts the ability to put guns in the hands of criminals, those with the capacity to be dangerous to themselves or others, and minors. I believe that this type of legislation is important for the safety of communities all across Washington...""

The P239® Tactical is the same pistol that was developed in response to demands from law enforcement and federal agents for a compact back-up pistol ideal for off duty concealed carry. Only this one comes with a threaded barrel, front cocking serrations on the slide, and the SRT Trigger System. The SRT (Short Reset Trigger) is designed to provide you the same great safety and smooth action of the SIG DA/SA with a comfortable reset that is 60% shorter for faster trigger return and surgical control during high speed shooting. The slim profile of this single-stack pistol provides easy concealment without sacrificing handling. The excellent characteristics of the P239 are the result of “performance engineering” and it’s one of the keys to all SIG SAUER® pistols.

It is in excellent shape and would possibly pass for new. Looks like it was never issued. Only shot once at the range and it did great. Not a single problem to report. Felt recoil is very low and the gun is accurate. 

Two magazines are included with the gun and the box it was shipped in.

The trigger pull is very smooth. There is no magazine block meaning that the hammer can be dropped with the mag out of the gun. These guns fire 8 round single stack magazines with 1 in the chamber for a total of 9 shots fully loaded.

I am only selling because I am saving up for a new car. Otherwise I would keep it. 

If buying locally I will include a full box of 50 rounds.

If you have a C&R license I can ship directly to you but it will probably cost a large amount since UPS will demand next day delivery. 

Otherwise we have to meet in person. 

In order to buy this you need ONE of the following: 

1. Concealed Carry License 
2. Pistol Purchase permit
3. C&R license 

I do not live in Asheville but rather, over an hour away. Google my location and see what you think. I can meet in Sylva if you prefer since its closer. 

I have a little bit of wiggle room for negotiation.

The  Dueling Tree has six reactive paddles for interactive training and competitive fun. Designed to swing from one side to the other when hit, the paddles challenge shooters’ target location and speed under the pressure of head-to-head competition. Because it’s made of 3/8” AR500 armor steel,  Dueling Tree is designed for RIFLE and handgun ammunition . Whether it’s intensive training you’re looking for or just a way to have fun on the weekends, the  Dueling Tree has exactly what you need.  Great for taking on your buddies with your AR15 and see who is the best.   For lighter Handgun rounds if the do not swing around just place a small board or something so angle is not so steep

The Dueling Tree consists of a forward leaning center stand which allows gravity to do the work as the six reactive armor steel paddles swing from one side to the other when shot. Because the target is gravity reset and does not rely on springs or mechanisms, the  Dueling Tree gives you reliable results every time. A deceptively simple design also makes it easy to assemble and disassemble. Each target paddle slides into two rings on the back of the stand that hold it securely in place but still allow for unrestricted movement and easy assembly and dis assembly.

NOTE: The center stand and feet are made of mild steel and are not intended to withstand the force of a bullet. Shooting the stand and feet may result in damage. They are at an angle so not much damage Can happen and does not affect its performance.  This will last for years and years.  This is just about the best dueling tree you will find and it for sure is the best price you will find similar models are $750 and up plus ship cost.  

Specifications:
- Paddles: 6” diameter
- Steel Grade: 3/8” AR500




Is the center stand made of armor steel?: The center stand is made of mild steel but is angled to deflect errant shots.  rounds should not cause damage to the center stand if it is accidentally shot. The rings on the back of the center stand, however, are made of AR500 armor steel to withstand the wear and tear from the swinging paddles.

Why does the target lean forward?: The  Dueling Tree leans forward to direct splatter toward the ground and to use gravity in the movement of the plates."

Recommend individuals organize weapons, supplies and Zombie hunting task force before opening box, your life might possibly depend on it. If you fail to destroy enclosed Zombie, call for backup before returning to the scene.

We understand that there are many aspects of training that encompass various complimentary disciplines which go into emergency/disaster/conflict preparedness.  That’s why all our ZMB Industries’ training dummies also provide a training platform for Medical First Responders.  Marksmanship is a critical skill in today’s encounters for both Military & Law Enforcement personnel; and our training dummies provide numerous skill acquisition benefits for forward operators.  But we take training a step further by providing a universal aid that also address the aftermath.  That’s right, our 3D training dummies provide a realistic aid for teaching various emergency treatment procedures such as dealing with ballistic trauma, administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), aspiration, defibrillation, intubation and infusion.  We believe that providing the most realistic training dummies produces better trained professionals.  That’s why at ZMB Industries we are committed to creating innovative training dummies that address emergency situations both during and after horrific events."

When your Zombie Industries’ package arrives, proceed with extreme caution and carefully drag the box to a secluded area. Be careful of contents, as the Zombie is not dead, only dormant. Recommend individuals organize weapons, supplies and Zombie hunting task force before opening box, your life might possibly depend on it. If you fail to destroy enclosed Zombie, call for backup before returning to the scene. Use our Zombie Targets in the same cautionary manner as you would a paper target and remember, always use common sense around live munitions. When you aim, point directly at the figure but be warned, pieces of simulated flesh and body parts will detach upon impact.

We understand that there are many aspects of training that encompass various complimentary disciplines which go into emergency/disaster/conflict preparedness.  That’s why all our ZMB Industries’ training dummies also provide a training platform for Medical First Responders.  Marksmanship is a critical skill in today’s encounters for both Military & Law Enforcement personnel; and our training dummies provide numerous skill acquisition benefits for forward operators.  But we take training a step further by providing a universal aid that also address the aftermath.  That’s right, our 3D training dummies provide a realistic aid for teaching various emergency treatment procedures such as dealing with ballistic trauma, administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), aspiration, defibrillation, intubation and infusion.  We believe that providing the most realistic training dummies produces better trained professionals.  That’s why at ZMB Industries we are committed to creating innovative training dummies that address emergency situations both during and after horrific events."

The car still need a fair amount of work. Has a  sb350 and two speed powerglide transmission rebuilt in 2003 with a 2500 stall converter and shift kit. I would estimate 1000-1500 miles on the motor and Trans since they were installed.  I have owned this car since high school and just don't have the time anymore with a growing family.  This is originally a arizona car that I brought with to Missouri so rust is only surface from faded paint. Has all original floor and trunk pans rust free. Front power disc brake kit from ss396.com installed in 2011 along with all new front cotrol arm bushings and a thumper cam.  The only thing keeping it from driving is new brake lines for the new brake kit.  She starts and runs by will not drive as it has no brakes. Has dyno max mufflers connected to headman headers. The car needs a full paint job and interior.  It has the original front bench seat but need to be replaced or repaired. Dash is cracked and brittle due to the hot Arizona sun. Its a really great starting point for a nice restoration that won't require cutting out and replacing rust damage. Rusted out rollers are selling for $2500 so I think my price is fair for the cars condition.  Asking $5000. Would entertain partial trades for quality firearms.  Serious inquiries only please. Include a contact # with email and I will get back to you asap. Thanks
