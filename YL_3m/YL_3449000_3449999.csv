Don't mistake a 22 Magnum for a 22LR for the magnum is twice as long and has a lot higher velocity than the 22 LR.   Oh! did I mention it has very little recoil but does make a lot of noise when fired.  I love mine and you will love yours too.  You can carry it no matter how you are dressed, you do have to be dressed.  Come by and take a look at this little weapon.

SAVAGE 110BA Rifle
Brand new Savage Arms 110 BA bolt-action long-range tactical rifle chambered in .338 Lapua Magnum.  The 110 is part of Savage’s Law Enforcement series and is equipped with the patented AccuStock and AccuTrigger. The AccuStock uses a fiberglass lining within the stock, which wedges the action in the stock (on top of screwing it in) rendering it immobile ensuring the rifle will shoot straight. The barrel is free-floated, so the stock doesn’t interfere with its action. The actual trigger of the 110 requires a very short pull, which is great for a precision rifle, but since it is a tactical rifle, light triggers pose a safety hazard because of accidental discharges. So Savage implemented the AccuTrigger, which is basically a trigger on a trigger. The AccuTrigger prevents accidental discharges by using an internal lever that must be lifted before the firing pin can punch forward. Also, shooters don’t have to switch the safety off after sighting in. The rifle features a 5 round detachable box magazine, aluminum stock and frame, 26” fluted carbon steel barrel with factory muzzle break, and a 3 position picatinny rail system with a 20 MOA scope rail.  The entire rifle is finished in matte black.

Nightforce NXS Riflescope
Mounted to the rifle is a brand new Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x50 ZeroStop Mil Dot C205 riflescope mounted with Nightforce A268 Ultralite 30mm 6 screw rings.  Originally developed for the U.S. military’s extreme long range shooting and hard target interdiction, the Nightforce NXS™ models provide a broad magnification range, four inches of eye relief and 100 MOA of elevation travel. These characteristics, combined with the extreme ruggedness and reliability of every Nightforce riflescope, make them ideal for even the largest calibers. The slim profile of the 5.5-22 x 50 NXS™ makes it easily adaptable to a wide range of mounting systems. Its superb resolution at high magnification opens an entirely new world of extended range shooting for the accomplished marksman; Nightforce shooters are now accurately reaching to 2000 yards and beyond.  Regarding the riflescope mounting rings, when a tough, reliable mounting system is required without adding substantial weight, Nightforce Ultralite rings are the answer. They feature CNC machined 7075- T6 hard anodized aluminum bodies and titanium beta series cross bolts and jaws. This unique construction provides exceptional strength, normally not found in lightweight rings. Testing has proven that this combination is actually stronger than steel.

SKB Weapons Case
Included is a brand new SKB R Series Weapons Case molded in desert tan.  The R Series Weapons Case is roto-molded of HDPE polyethylene for strength and durability. Convenient convoluted bunk bed style foam interior.  Molded in valance with gasketed seal and pressure equalization valve to comply with Military Standards making the case watertight and dust proof. Roller blade style wheels for easy deployment. Injection molded oversized carrying handle and tow handle. Black powder coated stainless steel twist latches with locking hasps that will accommodate customer supplied locks or SKB's new 1SKB-PDL TSA Combination Padlock. Interlocking stacking ribs on the top and bottom for stability when stacked.  It comes with SKB's Dual Protection - the Million Mile Lifetime Guaranty as well as the $1500 Content Coverage if your firearm is damaged by commercial airline travel.

Miscellaneous
Also included is a heavy duty pivoting, height-adjustable (6-9”) bipod and all original paperwork and accessories for both the rifle and the riflescope.  All items are brand new, never used.

I have shot about 100 rounds through it, the barrel was polished along with the feed ramp being polished also, great shooting little gun and never failed to feed or eject, I have 3 magazines with it, 1 p10, and 2 p12 magazines, the p12 mags stick out a bit, I believe they are pinned at 10 rounds,  they have never been used and I just put one of the floor plates on the p10 magazine when I installed a +10% wolf spring in the p10 mag

Now the bad. The reason I said it was a project gun, someone had tried to grind a small finger relief on the right side of the gun before I got it, it does not affect the gun shooting in any way and they probably only did it because it has a wide grip, I have since then feathered that ground spot into the handle and it looks fine just isn't the same color has the rest of the gun, I haven't had time to dissasemble it and duracoat the gun yet, if you did that it would look great. The magazine release is plastic in this gun and has a chip out of it on the right side, you can see it in the picture,  that being said they are available at brownells for about $20 in steel but this one still functions fine.

The gun will come with a cheap holster and the magazines and about 50rds of brass .45acp.

Please send all interested offers to REDACTED via text, I can meet any day before 5 through the week and anytime on weekend.
I am asking $425 OBO on the firearm, they are fairly rare now-days, I feel like it's worth that after looking them up and seeing them go for 650-900 on sites like armslist and gunbroker. 

The only thing I am interested in trading for would be an ar15 upper receiver that is complete without the bcg and charging handle and s little cash, or a glock 17 (I'll add cash) or a beretta m9 or m92 or a taurus pt92/99 Thank you for looking

This is PSA rifle, never fired. It has a 16"" FN barrel, Carbine length gas system, a flip up front sight/gas block, and a 1:7 twist rate.  The upper includes a nickel boron bolt carrier group with a tactical charging handle. The rear sight is a MAGPUL Backup Sight and the EOTECH is a 517, which has side mounted controls so if you wish to add a magnifier the device is easier to work. The pistol grip, fore grip, and butt stock are Magpul and comes with 4 Magpul pmags.  I am not interested in trades at this time, however if you have a Kriss V SBR or SDP or a Benelli m4 or m3 I may be interested.  This is a solid rifle and it is a fair price, especially considering you will not be paying taxes.  Please don’t send low ball offers.  I am not desperate to get rid of this gun but I do want to thin my collection a bit.  If you are interested contact me and we can make some arrangements."

Barrel is clean and I could not see any scoring, put about 50-100 rounds through it and fired flawlessly. I bought this gun because it was unique, the choke is attached to the end of the gun and is adjustable. I have been told this was common way back but I had never seen one. If you would like more pictures let me know, no promises but I could text you some more. Gun has lots of dings and scratches but I thought it gave the gun character and pick it over a cleaner one.

This is not a CMP build 308.  This gun was assembled by myself.

The rifle is all USGI parts, most of the later 65 or 77 series parts, with the exception of the barrel.  The barrel is a Criterion M1 Garand contour barrel with a 1:10 twist which should allow you to shoot any ammo from surplus to match with excellent accuracy.  It is NOT chrome lined.  I have been able to consistently paper 1 ¼ in groups and I am quite sure it is capable of shooting better than I can.

All USGI parts were hand selected and are either new old stock or newer parts well within acceptable tolerance.  The stock is in excellent shape, again a USGI item with a nice DAS stamp.  The rifle has fired for me without a single problem.

It has National Match front and rear sights and is an excellent shooting rifle.  The trigger group has been tuned and polished to National Match standards by Master Gunsmith Jeff Shapiro.  It also features an adjustable gas plug which will allow you to adjust gas blow back for any round you may be shooting.  The receiver and op rod have been nicely laser engraved with the words “NATO 7.62 mm”

I am in Marysville and would prefer a face to face and I am willing to split driving if in a reasonable distance.  If you adopt to do it by mail I will need a money order or bank check plus an FFL to send to.  It is C&R eligible.  SHIPPING COST WOULD NEED TO BE DETERMINED. 

Email or send text message to REDACTED.  I work night shift so if possible include a time which would be best to respond.  Also, considering the night shift I may not be able to respond immediately but I will respond.

 I have a 2000 Gulf Stream Ultra Class C Motorhome for trade. It has been setting in storage for the past year and a half. The last time I took it out I hit a stump leaving the camp grounds and you can see the damage behind the driver's side door. Due to sitting for so long, it sprang a leak in the roof and you can see from the pictures that the body has distorted. 

 Below are some of the features of this RV:
 -V10 Triton Motor
 -41,640 Miles
 - Read out of Battery, Grey Water, Black Water, and Fresh water tank levels. 
 -Build in Generator
 - Build in LP gas tank
 -Refrigerator that runs off of shore power, generator, or LP gas
 - Sink
 - Microwave Oven (in the cabinet above the sink)
 - LP Gas stove
 - Central AC and heat
 - Slide out kitchenette and sofa
 - Queen size bed with storage under it
 - Toilet and separate shower

 The RV is going to need some remodeling to bring it back to great working order. The generator works great, but the starter solenoid when out. I have a new solenoid and once replaced you will be able to start and stop the generator from inside of the RV. This will be a great opportunity for someone to fix it up into your perfect mobile home. Today (31 August 2014) I replaced the battery and it started right up. You will need a second battery that runs the internal operations in the RV. The second batter is located under the steps.

 The RV runs great and I have not had any mechanical issues. I drove this RV on several 1,000+ mile trips and the only problem I had was a flat tire. 

 Also, I have a clean NC title in hand.

This would make a great opportunity for a prepper. You could rebuild it how it stands or start from scratch with a great chassis and working components."

There are several types with most be the traditional woven rope style. Most of these rope style lanyards are in excellent to like new condition and some (CZ52 & VZ 61) are still in their original packaging. Price on any of the woven rope style is $5 each, two for $8, or three for $10 which includes shipping in a first class envelope via the post office directly to your door.

There are also several leather strap lanyards that are Russian and were intended for the TT33 & Makarov pistols, but they look historically accurate on most pistols of the same era. These are all original pieces that were issued so they do show that wear. I'd consider all of them to be in good condition with soft leather and no rips or tears. These are $7 each postage paid.

Next I have two real and original Russian lanyards for the 7.62x38 Nagant revolver. They are in excellent issued condition. You can find modern reproductions on eBay and other sites but it's difficult to find an original anymore. $15 each including postage.

Finally I have several rare Swedish made leather rope lanyards in unissued condition. They were originally produced for the Swedish LAHTI pistols, but I've used them on other pistols of the same general time period and they look great. They also pair up very nicely with many of the WWI & WWII flare pistols out there today. Price is $10 each including postage.

Each of our Precision Benchrest models feature 56mm multi-coated lenses, providing the superior resolution necessary to distinguish fine detail at extremely long ranges. An adjustable objective allows extra-fine focus to adjust parallax from 25 yards to infinity. Target turrets are calibrated in true .125 M.O.A. (1/8 click) values and can be re-indexed to zero after sighting in. Both Precision Benchrest riflescopes are equipped with a coil spring plunger return system to maximize tracking accuracy. The eyepiece provides fast reticle focusing, and a glass-etched illuminated reticle provides optimum image/reticle contrast under virtually any lighting conditions. You have two choices of magnification ranges. But only one choice in the ultimate benchrest riflescopes.

I bought this shotgun brand new 4 months ago, never fired it, just sits in the safe so I guess I don't need it. This is Mossberg's top of the line pump action slug gun and comes with 2 different height elevated interchangeable cheek pieces, recoil pad, sling studs, fully rifled slug barrel with cantilevered scope mount and ventilated porting at the muzzle, and its all in matching factory camo. Comes in it's original factory box with extra cheek piece, Allen wrench, cable lock and owner's manual. This shotgun is Made In America. I have found 20 slug guns have much lighter recoil than 12 ga slugs and the 20 ga slug kills deer just as dead, and the ammo is a little cheaper too. This shotgun will also accept any standard Mossberg pump action 20 ga sporting shotgun barrel as well. Will meet buyer in Southern Maryland from Upper Marlboro south for a FTF cash and carry deal during daylight hours in a public setting, buyer must be legal Maryland resident and not prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms; active duty Military stationed in Maryland ok. Great gun for wild boar and black bear as well as deer, home defense too. Price is firm but I will include 3 boxes of Hornady SST sabot slugs for free, that's a $45 vaule. There is no sales tax on this type of sale."

I am looking to purchase two SKS rifles if available but offers of just a single rifle are more then welcome. I will consider all manufacturers, as they seemingly all had their good and bad production runs, and the individual rifle quality is much more important to me then the average of that production year. I will not consider rifles of what I consider extensive historic value (Extremely low serial numbers, those with ""trench art"", extensive stamps and markings suggesting a long service history, etc) because, while I do intend on adding it to a well maintained collection, I intend to shoot this rifle without fear that I am hurting a special piece. 

Moderate to strong rifling is a MUST and I will prefer those with chrome bores. The rifle does not have to function but I will consider these offers on an individual basis with great scrutiny. Ideally the rifle will still have it's wood stock and bayonet. I will consider offers of rifles that have been modified ONLY if the parts to restore the weapon to its original layout are included. Having said that, the wood stock can be extensively damaged (for example: cracked in half is OK). Honestly, any modifications will not add much value to the weapon for me as they will more then likely be undone. The serial numbers do not have to match, though this is preferred. 

I am willing to pay a fair price, but please understand that the more money you ask for, the more pictures and information about the gun I will ask for. 

Feel free to call or text anytime, 252 three one two 73 seven eight. Please include your name, make, and year of the rifle.

The reason I am selling is because I just don't enjoy it as much as I thought I would and I don't think I'm going to be able to afford the ammo for a while.

Everything looks and works fine, there is slight cosmetic damage on the sides where there are a few short scratches I did on accident while cleaning and a little bit of blemishing on the muzzle brake from when the barrel got hot I had to lean it against my car barrel down otherwise it would have burnt the paint.
It's nothing super obvious however, you'd only notice it if you're actually looking for it.
The only real damage is on the furniture and that's because it's surplus.

I can ship everything to your local FFL at cost of the buyer, as long as it's not restricted in your state obviously.
If magazines or ammo are restricted and can't be sent I can lower the price.

Open to offers.

The rifle comes with:
