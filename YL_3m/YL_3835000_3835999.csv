Also has Magpul BAD lever, ASAP sling plate and an MBUS 2 flip up rear sight. Rifle is all Mil-Spec. I'll include 3 pmags at the price listed.

I've also got an EOTech 512.A65 in excellent condition that I would sell for $375 separately, or included with the rifle for $1150.

Rifle has only been to the range a few times with zero issues. Only selling because I don't get to shoot it as much as I'd like. I've got close to $1,000 into this build, but am only asking $850 OBO

I'm willing to take off some accessories (bad lever, sling plate, mbus, Mapgul handguard, Magpul pistol grip etc.) and replace with 'stock' items to work on the price if requested.

Face to face, cash only, TXDL required, CHL preferred.

Fits in pocket, extra small gun.

The P-32 is a semi-automatic, locked breech pistol, chambered for the .32 Auto cartridge.The firing mechanism is double action only. The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters.

The P-32 has five main component groups: barrel, slide, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 ordnance steel, heat treated to 48 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. After firing, the hammer block holds the hammer away from the firing pin, providing a mechanical safety."

(From Beretta) This superb auto-loading shotgun was designed and built to reliably function with 2-3/4"" 1 oz., 3-1/4"" dram equivalent through brutal 3-1/2"" magnum loads, interchangeably if you so choose. The Xtrema2 has more recoil reduction features than any other shotgun on the planet and is designed for maximum durability with a two lug rotary bolt head that locks up bank vault tight shot after shot. The extended, interlocking barrel tang maximizes rigidity, strength, and is at the heart of the extreme accuracy of rifled barrel versions of the Xtrema2.

The famous Winchester Model 1912 pump shotgun was designed by Winchester's Thomas C. Johnson. Introduced in 20 gauge in 1912, 16 and 12 gauge guns followed in 1914. From its debut until the end of the 1950's, the Winchester Model 1912 was the pump shotgun, long known as ""the perfect repeater."" After 1919, the model designation was shortened to ""Model 12,"" but the gun remained the same. Oh, sure, Ithaca, Stevens and Remington guns had their fans, but it was Winchester's Model 12 that dominated both the market and the public consciousness for decades. However, by the beginning of the 1960's, the times were a changin', to paraphrase Bob Dylan.

This is why the pre-64s are so sought after especially when you have a Georgia Peach this sweet my 12 boasts the 28 inch barrel, Full Choke, beutifull wood no scatches or knicks, the finish has been well kept and the blueing is phenomanal.
I have never held a Model 12 in my hand that is over 50 years old almost 60 years old and looks and feels as if it was just made. This with out a doubt a safe queen the bore and action are spotless and tight there are no flaws or no suprises when looking/getting this gun in your hands this is the Winchester of a lifetime and will be a prize in anyones collection. The SN# is 150XXXX Which dates it at 1954/55 production right inbetween there, sorry this is a NO TRADE SALE, I will ship to FFL one must be provided to me before i ship and i will only accept a POSTAL MONEY ORDER if your out of state no exceptions.

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth.

Our exclusive ArmorLokt™process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

The Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18 1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem™ Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail.

The new Chiappa Rhino has revolutionized the revolver with a patented design that tames the prehistoric caracteristic that most revolvers possess. The new Chiappa Rhino barrel is aligned with the bottom most chamber which is the key component to Rhino's tame characteristics. The position of the barrel lowers the center of gravity and yields a centerline of the bore more in line with the shooter's arm allowing for the most natural ""point ability"" while engaging a target. This characteristic also drastically reduces both recoil and muzzle flip which insures subsequent shots to be on target faster than ever before. The reduction of the recoil allows for the use of ultra light alloys to be used in the construction of the Rhino minimizing any adverse effect. The flat sided cylinder design of the Rhino reduces the typical revolver profile allowing greater concealment. The Rhino is truly a multipurpose handgun capable of reliable defensive duty, scoring ten rings, and taking game. Featuring both double and single action characteristics, the single action is actuated by a hammer cocking device that engages the unexposed hammer to repare to fire.

I added an extended cocking handle to make it much easier to grab. The optics cost over $200 new so it's a fair deal there, as is the rifle---just add everything up separately and you'll see.

Gas System : Mid-length short-stroke piston operation
Bolt Carrier : AA 1-piece with integral piston strike face and M4 feed ramps, charging handle included

Handguard : Magpul MOE, mid-length

The traditional AR15 platform utilizes gases to cycle a firearm's action, known as Direct Impingement (DI). It can be considered the biggest concern with the AR15/M16. Because these gases are released into the receiver, a layer of carbon and burnt gases coat all the moving part of the firearm. This also leaves a lot of heat inside the receiver causing undo stress and wear on many critical parts. All of these issues give the AR15/M16 a reputation for being unreliable and having issue like failure to feed and failure to eject.

The Adams Arms Piston System keeps the hot burning gases from entering the receiver. This also means the normal time and energy exerted on cleaning your AR15/M16 will be drastically reduced. To clean the system, simply wipe off the parts with a dry, clean towel.

 It has a fresh oil and Honda oil filter. K&N air filter and the plastic is in great shape. This thing is a beast and will stand up in every gear.
 The only bads is that it sit in storage for a while and the carb needs cleaned and it could use a new front tire. The front tire holds air and is good. It is just getting old.
 It will still fire right up and run, it just runs some gas out of the overflow sometimes and that causes it to load up. The carb kit is about $35 and Maxey's will rebuild the carb and adjust everything for $130.
I will take $2,000 cash like it sits. I might take partial gun trades.

This is the first Schmidt-Rubin straight pull bolt action rifle, beginning a long history of some of the finest, most accurate bolt action rifles ever manufactured. The Model 1889 is highly sought after.

This rifle is in superb condition. Bluing is 90%, there is no rust and there is no pitting. The bore is still sharp. The stock and butt plate do show wear. The stock still has its original finish, but does have some scratches. The butt plate has patina, but compliments the rifle's antique aesthetic well.

This rifle was sporterized long ago. When originally imported in the 20s, they commonly had their stock trimmed down and rear sight trimmed to the 500m mark to make them more appropriate for hunting. This rifle bears those features. So, while not in its original military configuration, it does have a history to tell.

Because this rifle was manufactured before 1898, I can ship almost anywhere in the US direct to you without FFL interference. Of course buyer is responsible for shipping costs via UPS and insurance is required.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.
