The bluing on the gun is fond memory but the gun functions find. It is a breakdown model and also can be 'slam fired' that is you can hold the trigger back while racking the slide and it will continue to fire. Fast way to dump six rounds.

This is a gun made at the British Enfield plant in Ishapore India when the Indian Army was changing over to the FN FAL. They were way down on the waiting list for delivery so they changed the plant over to manufacture rifles in 7.62 NATO. These were not remade .303s they were manufactured as 7.62MM with much stronger steel. When they were placed in storage by the Indian Army, they followed the British Army's practice and spray painted the rifles with black paint. (I believe this one of the reasons the British Empire is ""not so much"" anymore) All of this paint and the cosmoline soaked into the action has been stripped out and removed. It comes with a single 12 round magazine that has a matching serial number. It was the practice of the Indian Army to only issue one magazine per gun and reload via stripper clips instead. I also have 160+ rounds of 7.62 NATO I will throw in. $350.00 or best offer as long as the best offer is $350.00

I have no way of knowing value, but I'm guessing anywhere from $100 to $300?

Smith & Wesson combined a Scandium alloy frame with a Titanium cylinder to build the strongest and lightest weight .44 Magnum revolver ever made. The result...maximum power in a small, lightweight, easy-to-carry package. 4"" barrel, Hi-viz front sight, weighs only 25 oz.

This gun has less than 100 rounds through it and is in excellent condition.  

It comes with two sets of grips, one wood, one rubber.  I am also selling a Hogue, single-piece, recoil-reducing X-frame grip.  This grips fits all N frame round butt revolvers, too.  Add $30 for the Hogue (reduces felt recoil by about 25% in my estimation).  

I want to SELL this gun, which means NO TRADES entertained.  I think the price is quite reasonable for a low round count gun that sells new for well over a grand.  I also follow all laws regarding gun transfers."

 http://he Remington Model 51
The World's Best Pocket Pistol
Fewer than 65,000 of these great pistols were made just after World War I, 
and of that number, fewer than 55,000 were chambered in .380 ACP. These pistols 
were in use long before Walther produced the PP or the PPK, long before Mauser produced
its HSc. Yes, this brainchild of John D. Pedersen was patented in 1915, with the first 
specimens coming out of the Remington factory in late 1918 (only 25 made that year). 
Production geared up in 1919, but in only eight years the Model 51 was relegated to the
history books, aside from a few assembled from parts after 1927.
So what is so remarkable about this little pistol? The intricate and flawless design; 
the ""point your index finger"" ergonomics; the exquisite workmanship - yes these features 
make the Remington 51 a really great pistol.What about the design? Isn't it just like all 
the other pocket pistols? NO! The Remington is far advanced compared to the simple blowback principle of other small pistols. It actually has a locking mechanism, allowing it to handle heavier cartridges in a lighter and slimmer package. This pistol is the only pistol ever produced using Pedersen's unique lockup design. In .380 ACP it weighs a scant 21 ounces. It's only 9/10"" thick - very flat. Length overall is 6.625"". The pistol lies very low in the hand for instinctive shooting.Ergonomics. Nothing compares to this pistol. Pedersenstudied hundreds of hands, taking wax impressions,in development of the shape of the grip. The pistol fits your hand like a glove. Workmanship. In this day of stampings, castings, and mouldings this little pistol of well-fitted milled parts, stands apart from all
the rest. Even as it approaches 100 years old the Remington 51 remains the leader of all pocket pistols.It has not been surpassed.

These tips are brand new and never been used or installed - they are chrome. I purchased them for my E53 X5 4.4 which i sold and never installed. This listing is for 2 exhaust tips that come on E53 4.6is & 4.8is models but can be fitted on 3.0 and 4.4 models produced from 2000-2006. This is the real thing, not the replica's other sell on ebay that have a cheap chrome finish made in china.

It fed all 220 rounds flawlessly from both the stock flush fitting 7 right rnd mags and the Wilson combat 47d 8 round mags.

There is slight surface rust, from the previous owner keeping it in a bag I figure, but nothing that is off the bat noticeable. The actual wear of the gun is remarkably little. You can tell it was kept in the open position, but the slide pump arm has very little wear on it. I've kept it very clean, and only shot a box through it, and of course cleaned it after. It'd be a great gun to show off, hunt with, fun shoot with, anything really.

Low recoil but packs a big punch, which is perfect for anyone sensitive to snappy recoil or who have a hard time pulling back (racking) a semi-auto's slide.

With the low recoil and long barrel for accuracy. It's great for teaching. It's not loud and it won't hurt their hands.

It has kind of a small grip, so women and teens will love the fit. It's even small enough to carry in a purse. With the seven shot cylinder, it holds one or two more bullets than most revolver; which may be needed at some point.

Shoots the .32 H&R Magnum, which is the ballistic equivalent to a .38 Special, but without the recoil.

Guns that shoot the .32 H&R magnum can also shoot the shorter .32 S&W, .32 S&W Long and .32 Auto.

Comes with the Original box, and manual.

Pin type cylinder. This means, you have to pull the pin out to remove the cylinder.

Great for truck, garage, bed stands or toilet. You never know when you'll need it.

Here's how it shoots (see pic). The first shot, I shot at a different target, that's why only 6 holes. The red target is close to 3 inches wide and I shot it around 25 ft away.

It does have some imperfections in the cerakote where it was a little thin from the factory, nothing that bothered me though when I bought it. also theres a few marks on the upper where I had an eotech and magnifier mounted (see picture). Other than that its in excellent condition and shoots perfect. Only reason I'm selling is because I want to get back into a carbine. Will ship in original box with all paperwork and 1 30 round p-mag.

If no one wants it, so be it, I will keep shooting this great historic rifle and enjoy doing so.  Historic collectible firearms like this only come up for sale once or twice a lifetime and then disappear again for a generation or more before being seen again, maybe. 

Winchester Model 70 Short Rifle, .30-06, SN 102.  All of my research shows that this is the VERY FIRST Model 70 Short Rifle (CARBINE VERSION) produced by Winchester.  It was a hunter's rifle and shows the wear expected of a working man's dinner getter.  The stories it could tell from 79 years of hunting American game and putting dinner on the table.  Shoots perfectly, no issues at all.

The scope is a Weaver KV variable power and was installed by the original owner, the original rear sight is still intact and on the barrel, just reversed for the scope mounting.

$3200 FIRM cash price.  Even though this qualifies as a C&R firearm, transfer must take place at a FFL in the Fort Collins/ NorCO area, buyer pays fees.  I will ship to FFL at buyer's expense after USPS money order or personal check clears my bank.
