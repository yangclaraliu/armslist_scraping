I called Dave at CGW shortly after acquiring the pistol and was told it was originally about a $1K pistol with all the work done on it so I feel the price is very fair.I traded a new/unfired pistol I had paid about $1100 for it.I haven't even fired it since buying it and it will come with a Fobus paddle holster and a High Noon belt slide holster and three sets of grips. 
Pistol has about 350-400 rounds thru it and previous owner bought it direct from Cajun Gun Works who worked a little of their legendary magic on it before selling it-installed a 85C combat trigger,their race hammer, and did a trigger job on it with new springs,extended firing pin,etc.Custom grips were installed by previous owner that are less ""tacky"" and slimmer, but original grips will be included as well as all the stock parts.This P-01 has the decocker instead of the manual safety-which I prefer.It also has the NATO (NSN) # on the side.These P-01's are not too easy to come by-especially ones worked on by the talented guys at CGW-they know CZ's.
WI residents only,no criminal records-must have either a CCL (as I do), or a new WI DOJ background check.If the latter I will need the number they issue you when it's completed so I can verify.Also have a valid WI I.D. and sign a bill of sale.
I'm disabled and don't drive so I can't come to you but can arrange a public meeting area.

A fully functional 38 special revolver for $140.00, what a deal.

you cannot find this gun for sale anymore.  there are a coupe fake auction sites out there that say they have sold these for 366.00 but that is 100% not true and they say that about everygun to lure you to the site.  please base prices off of gunbroker.com  that is the only acurate site if you must base off of an auction site.  these sold for $600+ when they were in stores.

the reason they are not sold anymore... gas operated shotguns will cycle through any shell clean.  most semi auto shotguns are inertia based and will only cycle through when enough inertia is made from the load.  gas ones cost too much to make when people didnt know the difference between gas and inertia.  so they decided to make 12g models that werent gas and discontinued the gas ones.  still easy to find parts for online, not that you'll need them.

Although I never had a problem with mine, from what I hear, their customer service is beyond belief.    They literally R the best bang for the buck. This one looks in very good condition.  Comes with both an 8rd mag +  an original manufacturer extended capacity mag (not shown in pictures).  Can't go wrong with this purchase.  With the warranty, why buy new?

The gun will also come with the original fiberglass stock, the scout mount, factory box and paperwork, and the factory short magazine.

It has custom grips made for this gun only. It also comes with 2 mags and a Kydex holster which does NOT take the bluing off the slide after long time use. This gun was made by the Spanish during WW2 and they even sold some to the Nazis for police and civilian use. But this one was made in 1943 by Bulgaria (due to a contract) and when WW2 was over it was re-arsenaled by the Russians. The Russians re-blued it and so forth then sold it to a dealer.  Well, the dealer that bought this weapon and several others tried to make it look like it was a Nazi bought Star. So he (professionally) re-blued the whole gun then he placed a Vermock on the beavertail. If this Vermock was an original (which it is not) it would be worth $10,000 although it is fake Vermock it does actually bump the price up a bit but nothing like an original. So this gun has a very long history and it is in phenomenal condition. The custom grips are made out of a wood called ""firewood"" due to the reddish orange color of the wood.  The gun has the proof marks so if you are a collector you can easily look on Star's website to verify the making and series. I could not take a picture of the Vermock because my camera could not focus on a proof mark that small but it CAN be easily seen in person. If you want something that shoots tight groups this is the gun for you. If your a collector this gun hits all 3 sides of the WW2 bingo book. It was made after an American gun, it was bought by Germany, and it was re-arsenaled by the Russians. Its a great gun either way I would also add the bluing is 99.9%."

NO Trades need cash.  Right here right now for pick up.  Prices vary at peak I paid 300.00 but have adjusted down...but when you do the math at .23 per round (which is what you can order them for) after checking pricing it is almost 16.00+ in tax and 27.00 give or take in shipping which comes in around 270.00.  So I think the 260.00 is right."

Car is in excellent condition as shown in these pictures above, just have twins babies so we need to get a bigger vehicle.
I want to be honest, since it is a used car, there is a couple things with it listed below:
- The paint chipped a little bit on the bumper underneath the license plate and on the driver side on top of the front tire.
- The hinge for the middle console/compartment in between the front driver and the passenger broke so it pops up once in a while.
- The back speaker stopped working a while ago but the two front speakers still work.

It has all the original features, still run great minus those cosmetic issues above.

Have title on hand, will only deal with local and serious buyers only, cash only. The price is $4000 Or Best Offer but please no low ball offer please. These cars are well made and will last for a long time.

Will consider trading if you have a Toyota Prius, Harley cycles or other man toys with comparable mileage and/or condition. Also interested in Nikon Full Frame FX cameras such as the Nikon D4, D4s, Nikon D810 with lenses, Nikon D750 with lenses.

The firearm looks to be in overall good condition. It was my intent to sand wood down and re-finish them this summer, but, I just did not have the time, This firearm was built by Maadi in Egypt. The receiver was built on Russian machinery and is the closest to a Russian AK as you can get. It was imported by C.A.I. This is a post ban AK and has a thumbhole stock which is easily replaced. I have found numerous sites that sell a variety of stocks for this model if someone wanted to change it. Egyptian Maadi rifles are VERY dependable firearms and are well sought after.

It's a V6 Front wheel drive with automatic transmission. Have clean SC title on hand. AC and Heat work wonderfully.
Car is in excellent condition as shown in these pictures above, just have twins babies so we need to get a bigger vehicle.
I want to be honest, since it is a used car, there is a couple things with it listed below:
- The paint chipped a little bit on the bumper underneath the license plate and on the driver side on top of the front tire.
- The hinge for the middle console/compartment in between the front driver and the passenger broke so it pops up once in a while.
- The back speaker stopped working a while ago but the two front speakers still work.

It has all the original features, still run great minus those cosmetic issues above.

Have title on hand, will only deal with local and serious buyers only, cash only. The price is $4000 Or Best Offer but please no low ball offer please. These cars are well made and will last for a long time.

Will consider trading if you have a Toyota Prius, Harley cycles or other man toys with comparable mileage and/or condition. Also interested in Nikon Full Frame FX cameras such as the Nikon D4, D4s, Nikon D810 with lenses, Nikon D750 with lenses.

I would also definitely consider a trade for high value guns like good condition Colt Python, preferably 6"" blue steel, however, just let me know what you have. No junks please!!!

Armslist is being monitored as best as we can and scam ads are being taken down. There are several scam ads on here every day in every category all day long. The only problem is trying to identify them and be 100% sure they are scam ads before taking them down- because the scammers are getting desperate as their bogus ads are being deleted so they are now posting entering their city as Flint,Grand Rapids,Lansing,Detroit and other major areas or counties to try to blend in with the other postings unlike before when they would enter michigan,michigan and they would stand out. Just remember if you cannot pick something up or the person says they are out of town- IT IS A SCAM AND YOU WILL BE RIPPED OFF. No one puts ads online and goes on a trip and on top of that brings all of their items including shotguns and rifles with them in their vehicle or checks them in on a plane!!"

One enhancement that I didn't know until late that the extreme version employs is a SRT. that's a Short Reset Trigger FYI. When in single action the trigger reset is very tight. Nice for doing controlled pairs (double tap) or a mag dump. The other thing you get is the really cool hogue piranha grips. Very fine 9mm for CCW."

Then im hoping to add a can to it after that once i get the tax stamp for that. Keep in mind this is . $350 barrel so of your barrel doesnt equal the value you may add cash. Of you wamt to buy this barrel out right i can do $250 and may be negotiable.  If you have a noveske or any higer end barrel i can add maybe cash,ammo,ar parts or ak parts. I do have pics of the barrwl but it is still on my ar and i really do not want to put pics of my rifle online. However i will send it via email if need be. Very low round count maybe 50 and always 79 grain noslers well taken care of honestly it looks like ot never been fired . Beautiful barrel and i do believe wilson stopped making tge 16 inch and the only bull barrels i seen were the dpms sweet sixteen but those do not have the quality as this does. And i do believe those are 1-9 twist . But if not sold by first of year i will end up keeping it amd use my uncle sam money to build me the rifle i want. Also i can do ak services however you must be present while i do the work as i am no ffl dealer and the law forbids anyone to work on anyone elses rifle without proper license. But it does say you can fix and repair a firearm as long as the owner is present. . So if you have a parts kit that needs put together i can help you with that but you must be present kinda like a build party. Thank you and god bless.

380 Auto +P Ammo - 90 gr. Jacketed Hollow Point (1200fps M.E. 288 ft. lbs. - 20 Round Box





The 380 auto inhabits a valuable and useful place in our society, mostly because of the easily concealable, tiny pistols chambered for it. HOWEVER, because of the very limited size of the cartridge, it is plagued with limited power and therefore most of the existing ammo in 380 auto suffers from not being reliable as a man-stopper. We've studied and played with nearly all of the existing available 380 ammo and find it wanting as a reliable means of self defense, especially against a large, insane, drugged up/pain free, determined attacker.

Here's the problem. The current 380 auto frangible ammo delivers a large amount of surface trauma, but lacks serious penetration. For example, if you shot me or another sane man in the face with modern frangible 380 ammo, it would blow off a big portion of my cheek and send a few teeth down my throat, I would undoubtedly fall to the ground in shock and pain, but I would be very much alive and functional if I could get past the shock and pain as that frangible bullet would have stopped some where inside my face, never making it to my brain. However, if you shot a drugged up maniac in the face with that same frangible 380 ammo and blew half his cheek off, he would keep right on coming because he is insane and is not thinking like you or I. Plus, he is likely pain free and fear free and wont know that half his cheek is missing and if he did know, he would not care. So whatever 380 ammo you shoot him in the face with, had better go through his face and blow his brain stem out the back of his head, because only a CNS (central nervous system) hit with a 380 is going to stop him. Likewise, a torso hit to the sternum needs to penetrate deep enough to blow all the way through his spine in order to shut him down spontaneously. If you fail to shut him down instantly, you and your loved ones are going to have to find a way to survive while you wait for him to bleed out and pass out. The best chance of survival for you and your family is to shut down the attacker instantly. So, we've designed a few 380 auto +P loads to keep you and your loved ones alive under the worst of scenarios.

This 380 Auto+P ammo will better all American made 380 Auto ammo by 150 fps to 200 fps in all bullet weights we make. This is a serious improvement in this typically anemic cartridge. This 380 auto+P ammo is more powerful than the typical 38SPL ammo made by most American ammo makers and you'll get 7 shots of it in a small/flat/light weight 380 versus 5 shots out of a bulkier 38 SPL J frame revolver. Additionally, with the 380 you'll get much faster reloads and the little magazines are flatter than a speed-loader used for a J frame.

Item 27C/20 is a 90gr. Jacketed Hollow Point bullet.  It is traveling over 1,200 fps out of my BDA (Browning Double Action) with its 3.75 inch barrel. We've utilized the very same flash suppressed powders that we've used in our two other 380 auto +P loads. If you like the idea of the extra big hole this expanding load makes in human flesh, we would advise that you load this bullet in your chamber, followed by a magazine full of our non-expanding loads. So, if the first shot does not incapacitate the attacker, your magazine is full of ammo that will, if you can put the bullet in his spine or brain from any angle. Note my ""real world"" velocities from my personal ""real world"" pistols.

This package includes two weapons (with clips), a couple of different types of holsters, and two different types of vests (tactical & casual).  If you‘re nice I might throw in some ammo. The reasons why I am selling these items, is because I am trying to consolidate my concealment. I am planning to go to a higher caliber (45). I am in the market for a Springfield XDS, so if you have one; maybe we can talk. I am asking $740.00 for the total package – FIRM! $700 for the package deal and $40.00 for a FFL dealer (my friend) to make the transaction; unless you have a cheaper dealer that we can use in the safety of his or her own home! I reside in Port Orchard WA and I will not travel over 100 miles; unless the price goes up and it’s worth my time!
Weapons:
-	Berretta PX4 Storm ACP (40 cal) – About 20 to 30 rounds through the chamber.
-	Berretta Tomcat ACP (32 cal) – 20 to 25 rounds through the chamber.
I’ll let you research how much these weapons would go for on the market.
Holsters:
-	Fobus shoulder (under the coat). It’s a customized holster to your liking. The holster and the cartridges are made out of a hard plastic that stay snug’s to your body. You will be able to adjust it to your liking. It has a webbing fabric that goes across the shoulders and it’s very adjustable. It goes great under a nice leisure suit without the bulge. This holster is designated for the PX4. Retail goes for an easily $100.00.
-	A smaller holster for the Tomcat that fits nicely under the belt of your trousers (brand unknown). Retails about $15.00 to $20.00.
-	A holster for the PX4 that also fits nicely under the belt or outside the belt.
Vest:
-	5.11 casual vest – This vest is great to wear with normal attire. It has a lot of pockets for all of your items; it even has hidden pockets inside the vest for your weapon. Great of a nice walk in the park and not have a worry of being unprotected. The size is an extra large – used but in great condition. If bought new – retails at $50.00 and higher. Too big for me to wear – given as a gift from eBay.
-	UTG Tactical vest – Retails for about $35.00 to $40.00 dollars. A great item to wear at the gun range. And if you have a tactical rifle (AR15, AK47, M14); this item is a must. It has pockets all over the vest for all kinds of different types of cartridges. It even has a holster that is on the vest for your PX4.
If you are interested – it’s on a first come first serve basis. I’ll be happy to answer any questions you might have. I am serious in the handling of the weapons – no hanky panky – SERIOUS INQUIRES ONLY (Ooorah)!"

It is a UTG Pro Keymod cerakoted in Gun Metal Grey. The finish is beautiful. This gun has been babied, broken in according to Rainier Arms specs, cleaned, oiled, and greased after every outing. Price is $1,400.00 obo. Shoot me and offer, but be realistic. I know what this is worth. Serious buyers only. Do not waste my time and I will not waste yours. I really need the money right now as my wife's current car needs a new transmission so I am not really interested in trades. Any questions just ask. Text me at 614-582-47seven7 if you are interested. I will try to get some better pictures up tonight.
