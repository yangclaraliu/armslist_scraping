The FLIR Scout PS-32 Handheld Thermal Monocular 0009-01-00S is an incredibly portable thermal imaging monocular that will serve you well on the trail, in the home, or during a hunt. These highly compact Thermal Imaging devices weigh just twelve ounces, and they're less than seven inches long, making for a Monocular that you can easily stuff in your pack, pocket, or pouch. With the FLIR Scout PS32 Portable Thermal Camera in your pack, you can easily pick out heat signatures in any environment, even through fog, smoke, dust, and foliage. FLIR Systems has equipped the PS32 with three selectable palettes - white hot, black hot, and InstAlert (thermal signatures show up bright red on a black and white background) - to instantly tailor your view to your surroundings. Intuitive three-button operation on the FLIR Scout PS 32 Digital Zoom Thermal Monocular makes it simple to customize brightness, contrast, and polarity.

Like other thermal monoculars, the FLIR PS-32 Scout Heat Seeking Thermal Imager is useful for a number of pursuits, from detecting drafts and leaks in your house, to finding lost pets, to tracking injured game, to home defense. The FLIR Systems thermal imager is efficient, too, powered by arechargeable lithium-ion internal battery that will last for up to 5 hours without needing a charge. When you need close-range illumination for a hands-on task, the FLIR Systems Scout PS32 Heat Seeking Handheld Monocular utilizes an embedded LED task light that will give you all the non-thermal illumination you need. And for added stability, the PS32 Scout features a 1/4-20 Tripodmount. If you want to see clearly at night or in vision-impairing conditions, use the portable power of the FLIR Systems PS-32 Scout 320x240 Thermal Vision Monocular."

Had a deal on this, but they bailed out after making me drive an hour and wait two. So to try this again....


I picked up this awesome weapon in trade, but because I already have a hand cannon, I am not as in love with it as I thought. It is an awesome piece, and is a first gen Israeli import pistol. The .357 DE can handle the hottest of loads, and runs flawlessly, chewing through everything. The frame size is slightly smaller than the .44 (slightly) which makes it easier and more comfortable to shoot. The bore has polygonal rifling, much like an HK. 


This is a very early serial number, 83xx... First run!


This pistol is a real show stopper, and is in absolutely stunning condition. The BCG is clean, and there is very, very little handling wear. (Most DE pistols are handled more than they are shot.) 

The pistol will include one magazine and a hard case. 

This variant of DE is far more affordable to shoot, as .357 mag ammo is far cheaper than 44 or 50!


I will sell for 900.00"

I'd say it has less than 200 rounds through it, selling since I barely shoot it. I may be able to add some ammo with it for the right offer. Never been holstered or carried, either been in the safe or at the bedside.

$750obo, best reasonable offer takes it. If you were to buy everything new from Gander Mtn, you'd have over $1200 into it before taxes.. Ouch.. Save some $$ buying used.

I currently have it on consignment at the aisle pawn shop in Mooresville. I can pull it out or you can see it there if that is more convenient.

I have my eye on something else and am no longer interested in trades.

Guess I would also need just a copy of either a purchase or carry permit as well and would provide a bill of sale. Or the Aisle would handle everything since they're an FFL.

From Noveske's Website:
The NSR handguard was designed with the goal of being the lightest and smallest free floating forend option to the M16 family of weapons. The width of the NSR handguard before accessories have been installed is only 1.48"" The NSR handguard is available for sale as standard equipment on our rifles and upper assemblies, as well as a separate component for sale to the public. Available in 7"", 9"", 11"", 13.5"", 15"" and 16.7"" lengths. 

The KeyMod inter-locking rail system is a collaboration between Vltor Weapon Systems and Noveske Rifleworks. Separately, both companies were in development of their own systems, but later realizing that both systems were similar, a standardization of the KeyMod system came to be. 

The KeyMod system offers a mounting platform for a variety of (future) accessories and components. The days of the Picatinny Rail (MIL-STD-1913) are numbered. The future of the direct mountable accessory is here and now. The KeyMod self-contained components/mounting hardware index and V-block onto the platform, achieving a secured and accurate hold to the system, while separate lugs take the recoil force off the fasteners. The pass through attachment method eliminates the need for loose screws and backing plates that can easily be lost, or difficult to install. Another advantage of the KeyMod system over the 1913 system is the direct attach eliminates the need for the 1913 system as a ""middle Man"" thereby reducing weight and accessory off-set from the center of the handguard."

You should learn your shit before telling ppl stipulations when.the concealed carry law was changed the legal age to.own a handgun changed to 18 im 21 and have been.buying handguns since I was 18 the real law states that a 18 yr old can not buy a handgun.from a gunshop or fill out a a form to buy it but can buy a handgun from a private dealer or gunshow and a 18 yr old can also.carry a handgun he just has to open carry til hes 21 so your the one who.shouldnt have a gun you dont even know the laws and no matter how they talk every citizen has the right.to have guns just like you your ignorance is ridoculas learn the law you ignorant moron and that 40 your selling is worth no more than 275 thats why you cant sell it uve had it on here for over a month ppl like you are a disgrace to responsible firearm owners learn your laws.before you act like a know it all look it up.idiot legal age is 18 to carry own or buy a handgun from a private party just cant get it from a registerd dealer

The ""Taurus Judge®"" is so named because of the number of judges who carry it into the courtroom for their protection. Capable of chambering both .410 2-1/2"" shotshell and .45 Colt Ammunition, this amazing combo gun is ideal for short distances - where most altercations occur, or longer distances with the .45 Colt ammo. We have finely tuned the rifling to spread the shot pattern at close quarters or to guide the .45 cal. bullet to the target. Fully customized with fixed rear sights, fiber optic front sights and Taurus Ribber Grips®, the ""Taurus Judge"" is one decision-maker that lays down the law.

Reason I am selling is because I bought an EOTech EXPS2-2 for close range fast target acquisition, which it works perfectly for, but my astigmatism makes it difficult for me to see the reticule clearly without the magnifier, so I have to get something with permanent magnification like a scope or ACOG.  I love EOTech but I am stuck with crappy eyesight so my loss is your gain.  Most standard foldable rear sights will fit underneath the magnifier (I used a Magpul MBUS).  

Primary Arms is an American company with a sterling reputation for making high quality red dot magnifiers.  For comparison, the EOTech 3X magnifier (G33) costs $589.  Your getting more magnification for a LOT less and the quality is almost incomparable."

COMBO UPPER & LOWER KIT The upper block will allow you to work on your A3 flat top with the bolt and charging handle installed or removed, while clamped firmly in your shop vise. You can clamp it vertically for cleaning or horizontally for barrel work with the use of the flat top rail cap. This fixture comes with 2 anti torque plates to positively locate your upper securely in the fixture during gunsmith work. The Anti-Torque plates will allow you to securely work on your receiver on top of your workbench without the worry of scuffing or scratching your receiver and give you a firm hold to steady the receiver on any flat surface. The upper rail block is extra thick and is the full length of your receiver providing full support when held in your vise. Your vise may have jaws that are smaller in width than your receiver, this block set will allow the pressure from the vise to be evenly distributed to the full width or your receiver, increasing the holding power and decreasing the risk of deforming your receiver by applying too much force on too small of an area. The anti torque plates hold everything together, not only simplifying installation into your vise, but also eliminating the chance of block rotation during barrel removal or installation. This receiver block is a heavy duty 1.25"" thick unit that will fit into any vise that opens at least 4 inches wide. The lower fixture will allow you to work on your lower with the upper receiver installed or removed, while clamped firmly in your shop vise. You can install this through the top or bottom of your receiver to allow easy access to trigger guard, pistol grip or buffer tube, or to work on your trigger, safety and takedown pins. This design does not put any strain on your mag release, the thick solid shelf supports the block at the edge of the receiver. These vise blocks are CNC machined from solid HDPE to protect your receiver. HDPE will not soften or swell and can be easily cleaned for a long and durable life.

Purchased off Amazon for $29.99 shipped. Used once to change out the handguard on my Daniel Defense rifle. No longer need. Has strong reviews and worked great.

Although the upper section is from 1972, the gun uses an older frame, with the magazine activated hold open. As a result, the rear sight is from that later era and is not the first version. This makes it easier to use optical sights with this gun, than as if it were the first version.

The bolt hold-open is magazine activated. A different magazine is required for this to function properly, either the ""first version"" GSP magazine, or modifications to the second version (no side and front ribs).

Function and accuracy of the gun are typical of any GSP: excellent function and excellent accuracy. A safety also is present on the frame, and is functional.

This frame can accept the .32 upper sections, but a special magazine is required for .32 caliber use, which is nearly impossible to obtain or make. The 10"" barrels will fit this gun however.

$700 plus shipping. FFL transfer only.

Price includes 2 magazines. Additional OEM magazines available from me (and probably no one else), but are pricey. The second (usual .22 only) GSP magazines will work in the gun, but will not activate the hold open unless modified. 10 rd magazines also can be custom made.

Other version GSP in 22 and .32 available as well as OSP. Just ask. 

Note:  This gun is a ""Schroedinger's Cat"" assault weapon in Highland Park and North Chicago IL at this time.  Depending on who is looking and what form it is in, it may or may not be an assault weapon at any point in time."

I'm selling (1) Beretta PX4 INOX in 9mm. It comes with (4) Beretta factory 10-round magazines, (1) Sig Sauer Kydex Retention holster, and 140 rounds. It's a pleasure to shoot courtesy of the reduced muzzle flip as a result of the innovate rotating barrel design. I've fired under 200 rounds through it. I'm selling it because I'm traveling and can't take it with me.

I'm asking $575. This is a fair price. I'm selling it with extra magazines, ammunition and a holster. The holster was $30 and is a Sig Sauer (ironic since it's a Beretta handgun) Paddle Holster with Retention. I love this holster and use it when hunting in Nevada and Arizona (open carrying). Magazines are $40 each and I have 4 factory Beretta 10 rounders (a new purchase only comes with two). I have all three backstraps as well if you need to swap the grips.

The ammunition is as follows:

(40) rounds of Winchester 147-gr JHP
(30) rounds of Hornady Steel Match 125-gr HAP
(50) rounds of Aguila 124-gr FMJ
(20) rounds of Cor-Bon 125-gr +P JHP Self Defense Rounds (pictured below magazines)

I don't have a box for the Cor-Bon anymore as it's the self defense round that stays in the magazines (2 loaded and 2 empty, alternate weekly). I suggest you do the same.

391s are serious for both clay competition and hunting, and you'd need to spend quite a lot more to get more gun.  Gas-operated recoil absorption means it's ""soft"" enough for all-day shooting.  It swings and mounts fast.  The wood and metal on this shotgun are flawless.  I bought it new for $1250 plus tax on a seasonal sale at Blackwing Shooting Center (Gander Mountain now wants $1600), shot a half-dozen really nice rounds of trap with it and then winter came and I got busy with other hobbies.  I'm pricing it at $900 cash (only) to an Ohio resident legally permitted to purchase long guns, CHL preferred.   I will ask to see an Ohio ID.  Heck, I'll throw in a box of clays and a spring-driven thrower if you want them.

Chambered for 2 ¾” and 3” shells. 28” barrel with fixed modified choke. Black synthetic stock. It breaks down into 3 pieces very easily to make it a great bug-out gun, truck gun or pack gun. There is a ‘switch’ below the receiver that allows you to choose from extractor or ejector for each shot.

The gun is brand new, bought on a whim and never fired, I just cycled about 5 dummy rounds through it to test the trigger and the extractor/ejector. It’s just taking up safe space. All I’ve done with it is unpack it, remove the cosmoline and do a regular clean and lube.

Baikal is part of the big Kalishnikov Concern, meaning imports of their products are currently banned. If you’d like to add a piece of Russian engineering, here’s a chance to do it for far less than a Saiga. 

Price is $135 and is firm – sorry, no trades, just looking for cash right now.

Includes the shotgun only – I tossed the flimsy cardboard box when I got it.

Sale will be FTF. I need to see a current Oregon DL minimum, Oregon CHL is a bonus. We’ll do a basic Bill of Sale. Meeting location will be somewhere between Milwaukie and Oregon City along McLoughlin Blvd. I can usually meet M-F either early morning (like 6am) or after work (about 4pm).

The following is Benelli's item description as found on GanderMountain.com:

Benelli's SuperNova SteadyGrip model features a pistol-grip stock that transforms this pump-action shotgun into a high-performance turkey gun. The Benelli SuperNova is a completely new modular design concept in pump action shotguns. At the heart of this new pump gun is a lightweight steel skeleton framework over-molded with a high-tech polymer, making the new SuperNova super light, super strong, and almost completely impervious to any weather condition. But the SuperNova isn't just tough on the outside. With its dual-action bars and two-lug rotary bolt head that locks up steel-to-steel inside the barrel, the SuperNova is rock solid to the core. Because the new SuperNova is built tough, it makes no compromises. Chambered for 2-3/4"" and 3"" shells and 3-1/2"" magnum turkey loads, this pump gun can do it all. 3-1/2"" chamber. 24"" barrel.

Barrel. I bought this gun new about four years ago and it has been my daily carry ever since. Great concealment gun. Since it is my daily carry it does have some where on the black oxide just from being rubbed all day. Nothing major just light wear on corners and hi spots. It does have a laserlite sight laser on it but it shorted out not long after I installed it so laser does not work but it has front and rear sights. The finish on the laser has robbed off quite a bit.  The gun comes with a 9+1 magazine and a 12+1 magazine plus a magazine holster and the original case.

this is a beautiful Winchester 22 250. Have all wood stock and it is in perfect condition. I believe this gun is about 20 years old. It was my dad's riffle and fires perfectly.
 It comes with everything you see in the picture including the scope and the sling
 Holds five rounds.  Super accurate rifle. I shot and killed a coyote dead in his tracks from 600 meters.

I had a gun smith look over it and he said it what is in immaculate condition.I see other 22-250 with synthetic stocks selling for over $1000.

I will consider a trade for a AR15 or a tactical shotgun (mint). No junk

This thing is sweet. Hate to sell it but I am going away to school and need to sell some stuff and save up.

This gun looks, feels, and acts just like the real thing. Every part of it is real steel. It's heavy, it sounds mean when it shoots too. The gun runs on green gas. I can verify 100% that it works but I'm out of gas so if you'd like to see it in action bring some green gas. Will let you shoot it with cash in hand, just like test driving a car.

Gun includes the original KWA plastic frame, warranty card and box (paid 150 for the KWA)
the KWA internals were swapped to a G&P metal mac kit (another 150 I paid)
I will include about 500 .23g High-end bb's with purchase.

NIB Molot VEPR 12 shotgun with folding stock

With the passing of the recent executive order banning certain Russian imports, the Molot VEPR 12 is now banned from import. This is the rarest and most desirable model with the true folding stock. This model flew off the shelves weeks back once the order was passed.

This is NOT the cheaper/less desirable non folding stock or laminate stock variant. There is a variation floating around with the skeleton stock that does not fold; that version doesn't have a true folding stock trunnion installed.

I have (2) of these available purchase for $1150 each or $2200 for both.

Thanks for looking!

This pistol is used but in very nice condition.
In 1980, Taurus International purchased the Beretta factory in Sao Paulo, Brazil. In this purchase they acquired all the equipment, staff, and designs necessary to manufacture a number of firearms, most notably the famous Beretta 92. Starting with the original design, Taurus improved on it immensely, resulting in the Taurus PT-92 Pistol. These additions include a drop hammer forged ordnance grade alloy frame for increased strength and a three-position frame-mounted ambidextrous safety. Overall, the Taurus PT-92 is an excellent pistol necessary for these modern times."

All maintenance done as needed and have records including heater core, u-joints, wheel bearing, new exhaust, etc... The issues I know are: the front tires are getting pretty worn and probably need to be replaced before winter, tires are loud due to aggressive tread, duals are pretty loud, noticeable dent in tailgate and bottom of inside doors are showing rust (not through the doors but are rust colored when looking at the bottom from inside of cab).

The short: 
Walther G22 in OD.  Will come with 2 magazines, lock, and case.  $300 OBO.  Buyer pays fees.  

The long: 
Selling a G22, Walther's .22LR bullpup rifle, in OD green.  You will receive everything shown in the first image: the rifle, two magazines, a cable lock, and a soft case - scope pictured in other image is NOT included.  The gun is in near-perfect condition, effectively new.  Externally, there is almost no visible sign of wear aside from a few barely noticeable scratches.  Internally, everything seems to be in excellent working order.  

I am the second owner of this gun; the first owner put fewer than 100 rounds through it, and I myself have barely used it, hence its great condition.  One thing to note: the previous owner put spacers on the butt pad, as pictured.  

Considering the condition, I am putting the asking price is $300 OBO.  That price is negotiable, within reason - offer up; worst I can do is say no.  Would prefer to meet F2F at local FFL (e.g. Turner's in Pasadena) but if you want it shipped we can work something out.  Buyer pays all FFL fees (including shipping, if necessary).  



Terms and conditions: 
1. I (henceforth referred to as 'Seller') reserve the right to terminate any interaction at any time.  If Seller has contacted you (henceforth referred to as 'Buyer') and a period of five (5) days has passed with no response, Seller will assume the sale is void.  
2. All sales are final.  Seller do not issue refunds once a transaction has been finalised.  
3. Seller does not hold items.  First come, first served.  If negotiations are in progress with buyer ‘A’ and Seller receive a higher offer for the same item from buyer ‘B’, Seller will notify buyer ‘A’, who will then have the choice to either make a higher offer or allow buyer ‘B’ to purchase the item.  
4. Asking price is negotiable, within reason.  Offers are welcome but lowballs will be ignored.  Asking price does not take into account additional fees that may be incurred (e.g. FFL, shipping, etc.); these fees are Buyer's responsibility.  
4a. All face-to-face transactions must be handled in cash at a local FFL, the location of which will be agreed upon by both parties.  
4b. All non-face-to-face payments must be sent via PayPal.  Unless Buyer has contacted Seller prior to payment and proposed an alternative payment method (subject to Seller's approval), failure to act accordingly will result in subsequent cancellation of sale.  
5. Seller will not ship until full payment has been received.  
5a. Seller will ship via FFL to an FFL of Buyer's choosing.  
5b. Once the item has left Seller's possession, it is no longer Seller's responsibility.  Seller has described the item as accurately as possible.  Any damages are a direct result of shipping and handling procedures.  
6. Buyer may contact seller to ask questions via this website's contact system.  If Seller does not respond within twenty-four (24) hours, Buyer may contact Seller for urgent matters ONLY via SMS at REDACTED.  
6a. When contacting Seller via SMS, Buyer must mention name, item of interest, and location.  Buyer may then include any other message he/she wishes to convey, including (but not limited to) a price offer.  Messages that fail to meet this criteria may be ignored.  
6b. If Seller receives an SMS message and has not received an initial message from Buyer via this website's contact system within the last twenty-four (24) hours, the SMS message may be ignored.  SMS contact is to be used ONLY as a last resort."
