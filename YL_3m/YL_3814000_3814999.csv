I am the 2nd owner of the rifle. The guy who owned it before me bought it brand new as a ""Midwest Industries SSK12 Minute Man Rifle"", and swapped out a few parts on it. He used it in 3-Gun Tournaments. The rifle looks great and functions flawlessly besides 1 minor issue with the stock, the 'preset button' does not engage. But the stock still works fine without it (the preset button allows a predetermined length for the stock to be pulled out to).
 The only reason I am selling it is because I am going to try out the AK Platform & need the money to buy one.

The rifle includes the following...

Magpul UBR Stock in FDE
Hogue Grip in FDE
Midwest Industries Billet Lower Receiver
Midwest Industries Billet Upper Receiver
Nickel Boron Coated Bolt Carrier Group
Monstrum Tactical 1.5x-4x Illuminated Optic w/Mount (Red/Green Reticle Option)

1 Magpul Pmag GEN 2

Overall this is a great rifle for the price! Factor in tax and everything this rifle comes with and to build it would cost upwards of $1,600! It is worth more than what I'm asking for, so I will not be taking offers from lowballers.

I used good quality mid range priced parts that will work fine together to custom build this rifle. Not too fancy but no crap either. That pretty much sums it up and do not let the technical details bother you, it is from the manufacturer so just in case you are into these details, here you have them...

AR-15 M4 configuration Nato 5.56mm (fires the .223 as well...)

New Frontier lower complete lightweight with lifetime warranty!

PSA CHF 16'' 5.56mm 1:7 M4A1 Profile

5.56 Nato Chamber
1 in 7"" twist rate
Extra-thick chrome-lined bore
M4 Feed ramps
F-Marked Front sight post
A2 Flash Hider

Carbine Hand Guards w/ heat sheilds
Forged upper receiver

Barrel:  A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons.   The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable.  In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability.  Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a carbine-length gas system.   The M4A1 profile barrel  is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected.  Barrel is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider.
Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring T-marks, these upper upper receivers are made for us right here in the USA.
Each upper is assembled to order with US-made parts, and test fired to check gas function.

Unlike the cheaper brand AR-15 this one has a forward assist and shell deflector !

Retail value 850.00 USD

This M4 comes in the A2 flat top pattern. On this flat top I installed a regular carry handle that gives it the A1 appearance but also the freedom to install any other gimmicks on the RIS on top. OR to simply add a scope on the carry handle, too !
I also installed a RIS system free floating hand guard that accepts all kind of attachments from lights to lasers etc.etc. so is prepared for upgrades.
The weight is also below standard which makes it more fun to carry on your property or range than the regular weight rifles.
I did test fire this rifle here on my property with different ammo using a 20 round magazine that it will come with. No problems at all ! Very happy with the result. About 50 rounds fired all in all. In a Zombie attack, I would trust this rifle."

Rifling in barrel is like new, no rust or pitting to speak of. Barrel comes with front and adjustable rear sight. I dont have a frame since that was attached to the other Thompson encore set we had, and that was sold. Price for whole set is 200 OBO, and I am willing to ship. To contact me by phone, my number is six-zero-one-four-seven-nine-three-three-five-six, or you can contact me by email @ REDACTED. Thanks for your time and have a wonderful day!"

Through this comprehensive Concealed Carry training program, PatriotTAC's students benefit from decades of real-world knowledge. Topics Include: - Practical Applications of Concealed Carry - Weapons Retention - Handgun Manipulation and Firing Techniques - Legal Aspects of Firearms Storage and Transport - Concealed Carry Gear Selection and Consideration - Firearms Safety Concerns While Carrying Concealed - Low Light Shooting Considerations - Drawing / Weapons Presentation from Concealed Carry - Modern Defensive Ammunition Selection - Defensive and Tactical Reloading - Firearms Safety at Home, In Vehicles, and at Work Participants are better prepared to deal with the real-life implications faced by legally armed citizens. While we do teach avoidance, mindset, and handgun skills, we don't just focus on pre-incident factors. PatriotTAC instructors also explain in great detail what you should expect if you use deadly force. Whether you live in Jacksonville, Wilmington, Richlands, or Emerald Isle, we're the shooter's choice for Eastern North Carolina. While our Veteran-owned, small business was officially formed in 2011, the owner conceptualized its framing more than ten years ago while serving on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps.

All of our instructors possess recent real-world experience in either military or law enforcement service, or both.

 This is not a beat up police trade in, its in .40 caliber, in very nice shape with night sights. Has the nice DAK trigger, which if you aren't familiar with gives it a consistent trigger pull for each shot instead of a da/sa transition, eliminating that ""problem"", while also being much better than a normal DAO trigger. Will come in its original case and depending on what you have to trade can include up to 4 twelve round magazines, a paddle holster, and around 125 rounds of .40. 

Its a great shooter but I haven't had a rifle for awhile, so I'd be interested in trading it for one. Looking for an AK47 (No Romanian's please) or AR15. Not looking for a $2000 custom build, just a good everyday shooter in good shape. I'm okay with polymer lowers as long as the upper makes up for the price difference. Not interested in hunting rifles or shotguns, if the right trade doesn't come along I'll be fine with keeping it.

you cannot find this gun for sale anymore.  there are a coupe fake auction sites out there that say they have sold these for 366.00 but that is 100% not true and they say that about everygun to lure you to the site.  please base prices off of gunbroker.com  that is the only acurate site if you must base off of an auction site.  these sold for $600+ when they were in stores.

the reason they are not sold anymore... gas operated shotguns will cycle through any shell clean.  most semi auto shotguns are inertia based and will only cycle through when enough inertia is made from the load.  gas ones cost too much to make when people didnt know the difference between gas and inertia.  so they decided to make 12g models that werent gas and discontinued the gas ones.  still easy to find parts for online, not that you'll need them.

NLV Area Private Transaction...

Like new in box. Absolutely nothing wrong with it. Purchased last year and only fired 100 flawless rounds of various ammo for function tests, and this thing is an accurate beast that never missed a beat in either FTF's/FTE's. Well built on a solid platform. Outstanding fit & finish. Has a nice clean trigger break with no take up and or play. This is one light weight heavy hitter no doubt. I was going to build on it but decided to go another route. Thus up for sale or trade. Perfect for a race 3gunner... Trade interests but not limited to; AR's, AK's in either pistol/carbine platform, 1911's, FN's, Sig's, Glock's, Beretta Pistols, CZ's, etc... 

Some insight: 

Designed and manufactured to be a multi purpose shotgun to fill the needs of the Tactical Field, Home Defense, Hunting and Sporting customers. Centered around the very popular AR15 platform you will feel very comfortable with feel & layout of the system. Magazine fed allows for the quick change of ammo and is great for a wide variety of roles. Unlike similar shotguns these have been built to work with a wider variety of high & lower power shells. The shotgun is chambered for 3‚Äù MAG has a 20‚Äù barrel with tube choke and a manual safety. Designed for tactical use with its AR platform, 4140 steel barrel this shotgun is made with performance and durability in mind.

3. Magazines are designed to work with both 2 3/4‚Ä≥ and 3‚Ä≥ shells
4. Gas system is self-adjusted to any shell Both Low and HI Brass. Spring and buffer system can handle high powered Magnum shells with no problem
5. Ergonomic grips and cheek rest
6. Rails built into the handguard for easy mounting of optics/sights
7. The BR 99 will work with the MKA 1919 Ten Round magazines

This gun is a solid shooter, im not a terrific shot at all and, can keep it in 2.5 inches at 150 yards. That is with my ammo and the pistol scope. Im sure someone with some ability and time could do much better. 


The caliber is a 7.62x54R witch is close to the 30-06 round, but russian. 
I have taken 2 deer with the gun. And its great for really cheap ammo, so you can plink with friends, with some serious firepower 

I want to sell everything together, and am not making any money or up-charging what i paid at all. 

I would like $300 total. Thats $140 for the gun. $60 for the scope. $100 for the ammo (less than $0.17/shot)

I think its a century arms. i can re verify that as well."

Pack is a condor 3 day assaul bag with 3038 cubic inches of space. Has a 3 liter camelback system included.
Extra pouches include EMT ripaway pouch which is loaded with OTC trauma gear and meds. Has a combat tourniquet, tactical EMT instruments, gauze trauma pads, saline plungers, ace bandages, glucose syrup, antihistamines, dramamine, tums, extra strength tylonol, Band-Aids alcohol prep pads quick clot and tampons(great for gunshot wounds).

Second pouch is from a Kevlar vest I bought. It is intended to hold admin things such as pens and paper. I have in it a perm marker, super glue fingernail clippers, lighter, pen light and tweezers.

Has military issued sewing kit, 150 ft 550 cord, nite ize caribeaner, phone pouch zippo lighter holder, compass, 5.11 double edged knife in holster, flashlight holster, and small pouch with more quick access to simple meds or first aid.  All of the above is simply attached to the bag. That's not what I even  have inside it!

In the bottom pouch of the pack, it has √Ä√Ä batteries, ammonia poppers, surgical gloves, magnesium fire striker, ace bandage, arm sling, some surgical tape and lighter. This is where the only flaw is on the bag. Zipper is broken on the inside of the pouch. Prob an easy fix but not for me.

Front side zip pouch holds freeze dried food or MREs. Meals are Louisiana red beans and rice, rice with chicken, Colorado omlete, and an ice cream sandwich.

Next pouch up is an admin type pouch. Included here is a tactical pen by mtech. Has glass breaker on the end of it. Couple of knives, one is an alce fixed blade with a leather sheath and other is a camo frost cutlery folding. Has a folded stuff bag, chewing tobacco,( for getting burn out of a sting or bite) and a full medical instrument kit in a nice carrier.

Main compartment is huge. Has crossing straps to distribute the weight load of your things.  Has two large zipper pouches on the front of the compartment as well.  This part will be empty so you can add your clothing and other thing you might wanna fit in it. It held my 3 days of clothes, binoculars, extra ammo and a few other things perfectly. Has two side pouches for water also which I will include two nalgene bottles already full with filtered water.  

I also have a thermolite sleeping bag that's registered for 0 degrees that will be included as well.

Smith & Wesson Model 59.  Hammer fire and full metal frame, Smith just doesn't make them like this anymore.  The total round count on this firearm is just 100, leaving the bluing at 95%...you'd be hard pressed to find another one in this condition, and even harder pressed to find one with three original Smith mags at a reasonable price.

I've had no feed issues with hollow points, and this weapon has been fed a steady diet of Speer Gold Dots and Remington Golden Sabers.  You'll enjoy the ease of well-placed follow up shots, because the trigger reset is just 1/16 of an inch.  Comes with the holster and mag pouches as pictured."
