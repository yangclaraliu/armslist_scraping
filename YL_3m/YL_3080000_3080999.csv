 Italian styling and high-tech ergonomics, such as distinctive grooves on the pistol grip and fore-end in place of conventional checkering, complement the Nova’s innovative engineering. Nova Pump incorporates its polymer stock and lightweight receiver into a single unit for unsurpassed strength and weather resistance. With dual-action bars and rotary head locking lugs, the Nova will handle anything from target loads to 3½"" magnums.
 To dampen the recoil of today’s super-heavy magnum loads, the Nova 12-gauge is specially designed to accept a Benelli recoil reducer. Black Synthetic stock, the Benelli Nova is the most versatile pump-action shotgun ever made — and just when everyone thought the pump gun couldn’t be improved.

 Standard chokes included with the gun: IC, M, F.
 Push-Button Shell Stop, The button on the underside of the forend activates a shell stop, allowing a chambered shell to be removed without releasing rounds from the magazine.
 Grooved Grip Surface, Checkering is for wood stocks, but the Benelli Nova Pump use distinctive grooves that give both an unmatched gripping surface and an unforgettably distinctive look.

Nano 9mm - Comfort and Power in Concealed Carry and Personal Defense
The Nano was designed with one goal in mind: creating the ideal micro-compact pistol for concealed carry and personal defense. Thanks to its thin, snag-free profile, the Nano effortlessly glides in and out of your holster, while its smooth contour and low weight offer you maximum comfort even for all-day carry. Its operation is simple and intuitive, and its modular design gives you several custom options requiring no gunsmithing
Easy to ConcealBeretta Nano

Whether you like to carry inside the waistband, on the belt or in an ankle holster, the Nano will meet and surpass your needs. At less than 1"" wide and just over 5"" overall length, it will disappear for ideal concealment and will not ""print"" thanks to its flat, low profile. Also, its organic, protrusion-free design will not dig into your body as you carry it, and its polymer frame and advanced metal coating will make it highly resistant to sweat--even on hot summer days
Personal Protection Made Easy

Nano_with_Crimson_Trace_Laser

The Nano offers you much more than an ideal concealed-carry pistol. Thanks to its modular design based on a serialized sub-chassis, it can be easily modified with different grip-frames to accommodate your preferences and even a number of accessories like laser sights. And an optional 8+1 extended magazine makes the Nano a great choice for home defense or personal protection where deep concealment is not an issue.
Easy to Use and Maintain

The Nano gives you easy assembly and disassembly, plus adjustable sights (no gunsmithing required) that allow you to always get on target even when you change ammo brands or weight. Also, the magazine-release button on the Nano can be easily reversed for left-handed use. In short, ergonomics, size, modular structure and power make the Nano the best-in-class concealed-carry and self-defense pistol. Made in USA."

The U.S. Optics, Inc. SR-8 rifle scope is one of the most versatile and rugged short to medium range rifle optic ever designed.
This scope has a FFP(front focal plane) reticle.

The age old question of speed versus versatility can be argued for days when it comes to scopes. Why argue when you can have both? The SR-8 series of rifle scopes provide a generous magnification range that includes a true 1X power setting at the low end though a high end of 8X. All available models are ideal for engaging targets at distances ranging from point blank out to 800+ yards. 


The age old question of speed versus versatility can be argued for days when it comes to scopes. Why argue when you can have both? The SR-8 series of rifle scopes provide a generous magnification range that includes a true 1X power setting at the low end though a high end of 8X. All available models are ideal for engaging targets at distances ranging from point blank out to 800+ yards.
The SR-8C incorporates a daylight visible, 4 MOA red dot sight in the second focal plane that is precisely positioned in the center of an 8C MIL reticle in the first focal plane. The illuminated dot is optimized at the lowest power setting for rapid target engagement in any condition and subtends at all magnification settings from 1X through 8X.
U.S. Optics, Inc. scopes are constructed of 6061 T-6 aluminum, then type III hard anodized, making it extremely durable. By using the finest materials and advanced engineering, the SR-8 is a lightweight, affordable scope that surpasses the competition.

It has bright night sights, 3 factory high cap and one ten round magazine. The only issue is that I drove off and left the original case at the range and it was gone when I realized that and came back looking for it. It was totally my fault. If the original case is really important to you, just pass. I'm not going to buy a factory case online for $20 and try to fool anyone. If you read the reviews, this pistol is arguably the best compact high capacity pistol you can buy for any amount of money.

The recoil is exceptionally mild for a compact .40, it fits great in the hand, the ergonomics are second to none and the reliability is tops. I'm limited on pic size on here, so if you want more pics, just ask. I did not count every round, but I'd estimate I've fired maybe 200 flawless rounds through this pistol. A new one identical to this (but with a box) will cost you over $900 by the time you get 3 high cap mags to go with the single ten rounder that came with it and add Meprolight night sights.  Must be willing to meet face to face in Evansville and have valid Indiana ID and preferably a LTCH. I really do not want to sound rude, but my bottom line price is $675.00. I could have started at $750 and negotiated down, but this time I figured I'd take the negotiation out. 

I really don't want any trades unless someone has a Kel-Tec PMR-30 all black that is like new with several mags. Just ask for any questions."

251,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3080251,For Sale:  BNIB: Glock 30 9 round magazine still in package,"Medford, Medford, Oregon",$ 40,"Listed On: Sunday, June 15, 2014",Magazines,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Call/Text me @ REDACTED if you want to come pick this up! Price is firm.

This is the infamous flush fitting 9 round magazine for the Glock 30, Glock 30SF or Glock 30S. It's BRAND NEW in the box. These were on back order for a LONG time, and mine just arrived brand new from the factory, although I regrettably sold my G30 a while ago and have no use for this magazine.

The 9 round fits flush in your gun making it much easier to carry concealed whereas the 10 round mag that comes with the G30/G30SF/G30S has the huge bulge for the mag base plate. 

Another cool thing about the 9 round mag is that you can get the Pearce pinky extension for the Glock 29 mag and it will fit on the 9 round Glock mag, yet it won't fit on the 10 round Glock mag.

Just to make clear this is ONLY for the 9 round Glock mag. No pearce extensions. I'm just including info about the G29 pinky extension because it's nice to know that it will fit on the 9 round magazine.

Below are pics of the Glock 30 with the 9 round magazine fitting flush at the bottom, and a photo of a Glock 30 with the 9 round mag with the pearce pinky extension for the G29. It looks a lot better in my opinion than the pearce pinky extension they made for the G30.

This same magazine goes on ebay for anywhere from $50-$100! What a rip off. First person with $40 gets it! Come pick it up and it's yours!"

Vintage upper receiver, vintage triangular bakelite handguards, and vintage EXCELLENT condition GI Colt pencil barrel. This upper is complete & includes the FailZero Nickel-boron BCG & matching hammer. 

I'm selling/trading because I am downsizing my collection of upper receivers. Again, this one is ready to rock & roll once slapped on your lower. I just don't have a home for it anymore. 


$550 takes it home with the FailZero NiB BCG + hammer, $450 with a phosphate BCG. $400 without a BCG or charging handle. This isn't some cheap RedX or franken-upper people are assembling off of Amazon & flipping for profit, this is 99.9% Colt. The only part that isn't is the BCG. 


Why buy crap that people are assembling & flipping on here when you can buy a kickass, name-brand quality upper for the same? 

Shipping available on the buyer's dime. 

Edit: Lowballers, don't even bother. Sorry, but your .22LR ammo isn't worth $60 a brick to me. If you want a ""display upper"" to hang up in your office, go buy an airsoft gun. If you want a solid, ready-to-rock vintage Colt upper for a pretty damn hard to beat price, look no further.

I purchased this about two months ago while I was out of state and haven't fired it yet. Has an Apex trigger upgrade to bring pull to 4.5lbs. Has a reduced recoil spring, upgraded Robar extractor, titanium firing pin, reduced firing pin spring, reduced striker spring, three dot sights (standard), NO MAG DISCONNECT, NO LCI. After all that work I still have not shot the gun. The only shot the gun has seen is the factory test fire.

Comes with two mags, the back straps, lock (still unopened in its bag), case, owners manual. Selling because I have had some bills roll in that need to be paid. I'm not in a rush to sell. Price is firm at 800 due to cost of upgrades, cost of gun, and condition of firearm (BNIB with upgrades).

If interested, please leave your phone number. I will not respond through emails, seeing as I do not check them regularly."

I have a Like New Mossberg 500 Persuader in 12 gauge up for sale.  It has had approximately 125 rounds through it, all of 7 1/2 shot at the trap range.

This shotgun is the Persuader model that has a 7+1 shot flush magazine tube.  It is great for having fun at the range, hunting whatever walks, or defending the house.  It will chamber both the 2 3/4 shells and the 3"" magnums.  It throws a good consistent pattern and I've killed more clays with it than I've missed.

Gun comes with an el cheapo Allen stock sock with some rifled slugs attached.  I'll also throw in a pistol grip, box of shells, some sabot slugs, and the sling studs (already installed).

Based on Rick's crave-worthy XM-18, the new ZT 0560 is one completely amazing knife. First, the blade. It's pure ELMAX powdered steel for the extreme edge retention, high strength, and toughness a hard-use knife demands. It rolls out of the handle on the KVT ball-bearing system so deployment is rapid and it's ready when you need it. The handle is 3-D machined G-10 on the front, and equally 3-D machined titanium on the back. A framelock with lockbar stabilizer ensures a rocksolid lockup every time. To ensure this big bear of a knife carries at a comfortable weight, ZT has skeletonized the liner and machined pockets in the titanium handle and framelock. And to top it all off, the 0560 is equipped with ZT's new deep-carry pocketclip. With black G10 front scale."

3.8"" match-grade barrel
Rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite finish
Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System
The easily concealable Springfield XD(M) has a 3.8"" match-grade barrel. Its compact nature and easy-to-grip handle fits comfortably in your hand. Each handgun goes through a salt-bath nitriding process that leaves a rugged, corrosion-resistant Melonite® finish. With the extremely short trigger travel and a similarly short reset, follow-up shots are faster and more accurate. The Ultra Safety Assurance Trigger System™ prevents accidental discharge from dropping or bumping by locking the trigger until direct, rearward pressure is applied. Stricker status can be checked by sight or touch. Handgun only fires when the shooter has a firm grip on the grip safety. Comes with the XD(M) gear package. Includes: interchangeable backstraps for a custom fit, a holster, a double-magazine carrier, two magazines, magazine loader and a black hard case."

Carried it a bit but it's a little too small for my hands (hard for me to open).  Spring assisted opening (flip or thumb stud). 

This modified drop-point blade shape gives it good slicing capabilities, while the slim tip lets it excel at piercing and detail work. The blade steel is high-performance Sandvik 14C28N stainless that sharpens to a razor edge and holds the edge for a good long time. The 3-inch blade is perfect for most day-to-day tasks. Leek lovers also love the fast and easy opening provided by SpeedSafe assisted opening. Whether you’re left-handed or right-handed, a simple pull back on the ambidextrous flipper or push outward on the thumbstud and the Leek’s blade is ready to go to work. But the newest and most obvious thing about this Leek is the olive drab handle color. The color is eye-catching and different, but also discrete. The olive drab color is fade-resistant, scratch-resistant, and permanently bonded to the anodized aluminum—so it looks good now and looks good later, too. For safety, a locking liner keeps the blade locked open during use and a Tip-Lock slider locks it closed when folded. The pocket clip is reversible for tip-up or tip-down carry and the handle is drilled to accept a lanyard. This slim, easy-to-carry design, with plenty of cutting versatility just may be the perfect EDC. Made In The USA, Flipper, SpeedSafe, Liner Lock, Reversible."

This is an ideal concealed carry weapon. Essentially, the 224 was designed as a scaled down version of the full size P229, one of Sig's most popular guns. This version of the P224 is the SAS Edition, which stands for ""Sig Anti Snag"" meaning that the edges are all slightly rounded off, reducing the incidence of snagging when unholstering in a hurry. An added benefit of this is it looks AWESOME. 
The MSRP of this version is $1,146.
I purchased this a little over a month ago, brand new, from a local gunshop. (You can check out my receipt, I still have all paperwork)
Since then I have not fired it ONCE. It is still brand spanking new. At the time of purchase I was convinced I needed a new pistol, but after thinking it over further I can think of a few other things of greater importance I'd rather own. (Impulse buy, unfortunately...) 
I had posted the same gun previously a few weeks back, but I am reposting and dropping the price, hoping to attract a buyer with this steal of a deal.
The pictures I've uploaded are all from the SigSauer Website, but you can contact me to see the gun in person.

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and
need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

Has the glow sights. 
Comes with the interchangeable 357 Sig barrel.
Has 2 magazines.
Includes hard case and all paperwork.
I purchased it from the Axemen used. I got a good deal because at some point in its life the serial number was tampered with(you can see in the photos). This has been my most favorite and most accurate handgun yet. Has some signs of use but operates smooth and accurately. Only selling because I have come accross a deal on a H&k that I can't pass up.
Feel free to ask any questions. I will accept cash only."

1911R-45-TACOPS DESCRIPTION BELOW

The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s
shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and
need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines
that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics,
and exceptional accuracy they expect. The 1911 Tactical Operations model features a SAO trigger, low profile night sights, integral accessory rail, ambidextrous safety, Magwell, and Ergo XT grips.

THE 1911 LOOKS IN A SMALL CALIBER .22LR

On the other hand we added additionally the magazine safety, drop safety and firing pin safety to meet present safety standard. Sport shooting without any compromises is assured.

I purchased two of these at the same time from Optics Planet and decided that I wanted a 4-16x50mm scope instead of two of the 6.5-20s. I'm selling this for exactly what I have in it so the price is firm. These currently sell for $459 on Optics Planet (and the same on eBay) so instead of sending it back I figured I'd try to pass the deal onto someone local. If I don't sell it by Monday I'm going to ship it back.

Product Information

Vortex Viper 6.5-20x50 PA Riflescopes are necessary when precision shooting at high magnification is a must. The unique ViewMag adjustment lever of the Vortex Viper 6.5x-20x 50mm PA Matte Riflescope allows you to make rapid power adjustments without ever taking your eye off your target. Vortex Viper 6.5-20x50 PA Waterproof Scopes have pop-up dials which provide easy, precise adjustment of elevation and windage, making audible clicks easily and quickly counted. The Vortex Viper 6.5-20x 50mm PA Matte Side Parallax Scope consists of a rugged, durable 30mm tube constructed of 6061 T6 aircraft-grade aluminum. Vortex subjects all of their riflescopes to demanding factory testing under a force of 1000 G's - 500 times! Not only is this rifle scope waterproof, fogproof and shockproof, it is highly prized for its purging with Argon gas, targeting corrosion in an unchallenged way. This feature helps to eliminate internal fogging, chemically ignoring water. Like the Diamondback riflescopes, you can count on the Vortex Viper 6.5-20x50 PA Matte Riflescope w/ V-Plex Wide Reticle for smooth handling when the heat is on.VPR-M06BDC: Vortex Viper 6.5-20x50 PA Matte Riflescopes with Dead-Hold BDC Reticle

These are older decoys and I have used them many seasons. These have consistently put meat on the table season after season. Some may have small cracks that can be fixed with a little silicone. Great starter spread or an excellent way to increase your spread to call in more birds.

2$ Each or 50$ for the entire lot.
