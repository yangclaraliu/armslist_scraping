Adams Arms Upper-
Carbine Tactical Evo 16"" 1/7 twist ratio Upper is a M4 Profiled upper that incorporates the patented Adams Arms technology and the Samson Evolution extended free floating forearm. The piston system parts and the barrel have been treated with a salt nitride Meloniting process making them harder and more corrosive resistant than hard chrome. The free floating forearm was manufactured by Samson Manufacturing and is a 10"" tube that extends along the sides and bottom of the gas block, giving you enough space to mount the removeable picatinny rail pieces to meet any of your needs. Add the patented Adams Arms piston system and you'll have an upper that will run cleaner, cooler, and longer than any other AR upper.

I'd like to start by saying thank you to take the time to read my post. A little about me, I'm 28, United States Marine Corps Veteran. While serving I was a Military Police K9 handle/ Specialized Search Dog handle/trainer. I went on 2 combat deployments to Iraq with my dog Rocky, assisting a wide variety of different Military branches searching for explosives. Now what I offer is in home behavioral dog training. Basic obedience; sit, down, stay, etc. Jumping up, barking uncontrollably, aggressive behavior, and more. I like to take a very inducive approach in the beginning steps, and throughout if possible. Understandably, some dogs may need a more compulsive approach to training. The way I train is like a train the trainer approach. I will be hands on in the bbeginning, then its all on you! I will be there to jump in and assist if needed. I feel this is more productive, it's not me the dog needs to respect! Now that I've rambled, I'll get into the payment. I charge $75 per session. These sessions usually run between an hour/hour and a half. I will come out the first day for an assessment for free, get a feel for the dog and have a meet and greet. After that if you are interested, we can work out a schedule for training that fits your needs. I don't let anyone pay for more than 5 trainings up front. Times are tough for everyone. So if its a pay as you go kinda thing or a certain amount up front That's ok. Anyways, I look forward to meeting you and your 4 legged family member. Feel free to email, or call me at anytime. Thank you."

THE NATION’S OLDEST AND LARGEST SCANNER-ONLY
 Uniden Bearcat BCD396XT 
     
Top of the line trunked digital scanner workhorse that's slim but powerful, packed with incredible features (details below). 

List Price: $429.95

Product Description
The Bearcat BCD396XT is Uniden's newest digital trunking handheld scanner, released in March 2009. The 396XT scanner is a feature-filled powerhouse that represents huge advancements over its recently discontinued BC396T predecessor. With advanced microprocessors, enormous memory capacity and unrivaled dedication to providing the features and technology that scanner hobbyists and professional users have long sought, Uniden has hit another home run out of the park with the BCD396XT portable. We congratulate Uniden's U.S. product management group and their Japan-based research and engineering team for providing us with a sensational new scanner. 

The 396XT handles APCO-25 digital decoding automatically now and does it extremely well. Digital public safety is widely prevalent and growing across the nation, from the hinterlands of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to Miami Beach, Florida. In other areas, such as Boston and New York, major cities where you would expect to see the latest in digital technology, digital radio is hardly to be found. In these and many other areas communications are still analog, as they were 70 years ago, but these systems are rock-solid and provide the coverage that many areas demand. The Bearcat BCD396XT handles both digital and analog (non-digital) systems brilliantly. The 396XT also handles Motorola, EDACS(R) and LTR trunking systems better than any scanner on the market today, with not only standard trunking capability but also with an unmatched feature set such as I-CALL, true Priority, advanced AFS operation, and much more. (Note that there are a handful of non-standard digital systems and encrypted systems which cannot be monitored on any scanner.) The 396XT has voluminous memory, GPS operation, Fire Tone out operation and more features than one could ever have imagined just a few short years ago. The Bearcat BCD396XT is simply a huge leap 

Note that if you're not sure if you need a $500 digital scanner (the cost for all digital models) then check out our Compare Scanners page and enter your name and zip code and our system will automatically inform you of the types of radio systems in your area and whether you need digital or not. Remember that in some areas digital may not be used for local police but may be used by State Police/Highway Patrol agencies 
There is a wealth of information available for the BCD396XT scanner. Websites exist for the radio itself, regional and local scanner groups and software support.

RadioReference.com: (http://www.radioreference.com). 
One of the most exhaustive sources is the RadioReference website. This site has an extensive listing of scanner frequencies for the entire USA, Canada and many other nations. For the USA the scanner database is broken down by state and county, then local systems.

RadioReference also has an extensive Wiki section that explains how almost anything scanner related works. There is a large Forums section where you can discuss the BCD396XT or any other topic. 

Uniden's Corporate Website: (www.uniden.com)
Direct from the manufacturer, you can download information about the scanner here, view accessories and order parts. You can go direct to the BCD396XT page at:

ARSENAL Bulgarian  SAM7K, Milled AK47, Krink Pistol 7.62x39

New in the Box from Arsenal, makers of the best AK rifles in the world, the SAM7K-01  AK47 type pistol chambered in the cheap to shoot and powerful 7.62x39mm (7.62 Soviet).   Accepts the standard hi-cap AK-47 magazines and drums widely available for these rifles.  Krinkov style muzzle brake (krink).  This is in stock and ready to ship immediately!  No reserve!  These milled AK’s are second to none.  This version has the safety on the pistol grip that can be operated with either hand, much easier than the standard safety and real smooth.  The rear sight allows you to toggle to a peep sight, a much needed improvement over the standard AK rear leaf.  If you wait until importation on these is banned, it will be too late at that point.
The SAM7K PISTOL
Arsenal, Inc., the premier American importer and manufacturer of Kalashnikov-pattern rifles and pistols, is proud to offer to the American enthusiast the Bulgarian-made SAM7K Pistol. This 7.62x39mm caliber pistol combines authentic, high-quality features rarely seen in the American market. Every component of the SAM7K is engineered to provide decades of dependable service. The SAM7K pistol is bound to become a sought-after shooter and collectible firearm.

Arsenal’s Exclusive Milled And Forged Receiver
Each SAM7K receiver is milled from a hot-die hammer forged receiver blank by the Arsenal Co. of Bulgaria. Other milled-receiver AKs are machined from bar stock, but Arsenal’s hot-die hammer forging produces stronger and finer-grained steel. Internal voids and cooling deformations are eliminated by the 5-ton hammer forging process.

Each forged receiver blank requires over 5.5 hours of milling before assembly. This forging and milling process is complex and time-intensive, but Arsenal’s meticulous attention to detail delivers a receiver of unequalled strength, precision and durability

Summary: SAM7K - 7.62x39mm caliber Pistol, milled receiver (hot-die hammer forged), short gas system, front sight block / gas block combination, 10 1/2 inch chrome lined hammer forged barrel, black polymer furniture, original pistol grip made to work with ambidextrous safety lever, and peep rear sight, scope rail. Includes one 5-round magazine, sling, oil bottle, and cleaning kit.

This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1943 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped to Springfield Armory in February of 1943. It was Issued to an enlisted serviceman at the time. (Trying to find out who it was issued to now through different channels.) There are specific clues on the gun that tell you who it MIGHT have gone to.. There is AA inscribed (Not stamped) on the ivory grips and on the frame Next to GHD. GHD is significant because Col. Guy H. Drewry inspected ordnance from June 17, 1942 to July 15, 1945 For COLT.

After having multiple collectors and Colt dealers at the gun show look at it. ""AA"" is believed to stand for ""All American"" 82nd Airborne. Which would match the dates the gun was issued, and the eagle carved on the Ivory grips. 82 Airborne was the first Airborne division in US Army history and had three major drops, made their first drop in July of 1943 to invade Sicily. Second was Salerno on 13 September 1943. The third was the invasion of Normandy Jun 1944.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. But not all pistols back then were stamped with ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted national match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by a gunsmith. At some point it was re-blued, and fixtures were 24k gold plated and Ivory grips added. It has been determined the gold was added many many years ago as some has worn off in spots. Bluing and finish is still very nice... Bore is excellent and looks shinning.

This pistol is a shooter. I have put 100 rounds through it and drives tacks. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection.

I have many pictures if you want more. FTF in tulsa area only.. All reasonable offers considered. Email if interested. Will trade multiple guns.. Please list your offer and values of guns. email or text 918-four02-zero854."

Case colored wide grooved trigger & a checkered target hammer both boasting strong colors.

The wood grips are checkered with nice grain & finish & the checkering is still razor sharp. Mechanically like new as is the bore, only fired a box or so through it. This is built on a medium sized frame & looks just like a Smith & Wesson. It is well balanced, nice trigger pull, is dead accurate & a pleasure to shoot as a single action or double action. A nice revolver that can shoot the powerful .357 magnum round or the inexpensive .38 Special.  Taurus Model 66, 4"" barrel .357 Great condition, Production Year 1988-97 Model 66  special 4"" barrel.

History:

I traded for this rifle in June of last year. I was told it had 136 rounds through it at that time. I have documented all I have shot through it since and as of today it is 1237 total rounds through the gun. The only reason I am selling is to finance an AI AT. The rifle has been used in two matches and has been treated as a shooter not a safe queen. It is still in a great shape as the pictures show but there are some small scratches like on the bolt knob. 

Price:

$2900 shipped to your FFL from me. If your FFL doesn't accept from individuals then you have to cover that expense on my end. I will accept USPS MO or discreet Paypal and I will split the fees. This rifle is over $4000 new from GA Precision.

The rifle does not come with scope, rings or bipod. It will come with one 5 round AICS mag. Not the 10 round pictured. I'll leave the SAP two round holder on if the buyer wants or remove it and clean the velcro off the stock. Rifle will come shipped in a midway case/shooting mat bag inside a cardboard box."

Dealers, collectors, and law enforcement, may take any number of very similar Walthers at the same per-pistol price and with no extra shipping charges. From duty on the front lines of the Cold War with the Federal German Border Police, Bundesgrenzschutz, or BGS, here is one of several very attractive Cold War pieces manufactured in the Federal Republic of Germany, West Germany, from 1958 until 1963. These pistol are certainly a symbolic pieces of the Berlin wall, and the island of Democracy that West Germany stood for. 1963 was the final year of government issue for pistols labeled P38; the new P1 designation came at the request of the German Army. Each pistol bears correct West German proof marks, and Its only U.S. marking is the federally mandated import stamp, PW Arms, so marked on the right forward side of the slide. Slide and frame have matching numbers. This is a lightweight, alloy-frame model P-38 in 9mm Luger, production of which began in 1956. It is very similar to, and a direct descendant of, the fabled steel frame P38 of World War II. Construction is durable anodized alloy frame with matte military finish on its barrel , slide, and all its steel parts. Type is traditional double and single action semi-auto with full safety / decocking lever. The P-38 has a firing pin safety as well, but no magazine safety. Magazine holds 8 rounds of 9mm Luger, Parabellum, 9x19 ammunition, call it what you will, THE 9mm. Barrel is 4 7/8 inches. Sights are dovetailed notch rear and blade front. Weight empty is 28.2 ounces. Surface detractions are minimal, only faint amounts of whitening on its sharp edges and light holster contact streaking. We rate these P38s as Very Good, close to Excellent, 85 to 90 percent vicinity by our estimate. If refinished, the lettering is so sharp it doesn’t matter. Each pistol is excellent mechanically; bore, chamber, and mechanism are all bright, clean, and excellent, and the West German Police always took good care of their firearms anyway. This is an excellent quality pistol, but not designed for +P loads. Its historical importance includes the fact that the P38 was the direct ancestor to our own well known 3900 and 5900 Smith & Wessons, and the Beretta 92 / M9.

The grips are made of a hard brown plastic with black streaks going through it, they look quite nice so I didnt have them replaced. Bluing is 95% and it was made in 1972 imported by stoeger. This gun is made of high quality pieces and guns made by Llama in the '60s-'70s were considered to be the best of Llama. This would make a great carry pistol or a nice piece to a Spanish collection. It comes with 300 rounds of Remington Viper. Due to the fact these are hard to find the price is firm"

Its a 1942 Izhevsk (Russian), better known as an IZZY.This Mosin 91/30's serial numbers match. The barrel is well marked with the Triangle with the Arrow that signifies it was manufactured in Izhevsk (Russian). Above that marking is the Russian Hammer & Sickle. The cleaning rod is in 100% condition. It comes in a Russian box with Russian lettering. In the box is the matching Bayonet, Cleaning kit and oil & solvent can. The stock/forearm have lots of distinct markings. The sling slot escutcheons are clean and through. The sights are well marked and in perfect condition. The lands and grooves of the barrel are deep, bright and shinny. The finish has a nice patina and is true to it's age. Include is a duel leather ammo pouch and 7.62X54R ammo.
