The Range Officer® Compact brings the precision of a competition pistol in a small and straightforward configuration.

The Range Officer® Compact has the same quality forged national match frame and slide as the Trophy Match™ and TRP™ 1911s. It gets the same precision fit as these pistols, too. Add in the same national match stainless steel barrel, and you have a pistol that shoots well beyond its price tag. The Range Officer® Compact is topped with a fiber optic front sight and a low profile combat rear sight, so you have maximum visibility. The beavertail grip safety, extended lightweight trigger and flat mainspring housing allow the pistol to sit in your hand comfortably for long periods of time at the range. The single-sided thumb safety keeps things simple and functional. It all adds up to a pistol that will let you seriously compete in a variety of matches.

The Range Officer® Compact means that your favorite range pistol is now easier to carry. Are You Ready?™

I need to sell all 10 because I will have no use for them otherwise. My advice to you would be buy them, then sell what you dont need on ebay. My personal thoughts on magazines is you can never have enough. The pistol does not have many rounds through it. It functions better than military standard, no malfunctions an performs w/any ammo you supply it. Shoot an email to link up to take a closer look.

The upper receiver it's self is a palmetto state armory with forward assist I removed the ejection port door and I don't remember where I put it, the barrel is a stainless redxarms 556 barrel. I am not sure what brand the rail is but it is a free float rail. It also has a muzzle brake not sure of brand or model but it's cool looking. The previous owner had painted the upper rail and muzzle brake so I stripped it down and found that he had lightly sanded everything so I had re spray painted it with flat black paint and it looks pretty good the inside of the upper has not been altered in any way and the paint does not affect the function of the upper in any way. It would be a great for someone to get it cerakote or use it the way it is.

480,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3997480,For Sale:  Anti-Firearms Legislation Proposed in Arizona Legislature...,"North, Arizona, United States",FREE,"Listed On: Wednesday, February 4, 2015",Services,no type,no type,no type,no type,"From the NRA-ILA:

""Several misguided anti-gun bills have also been introduced. House Concurrent Resolution 2009 and House Bill 2118, both introduced by Representative Randall Friese (D-9), as well as Senate Bill 1269, introduced by Senator David Bradley (D-10), would create undue burdens for law-abiding gun owners by imposing restrictions on the private transfer of firearms. HCR 2009, HB 2118 and SB 1269 would make it illegal to transfer or sell any firearm without first going through a licensed firearms dealer to conduct a background check. This process does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of criminals who, by definition, do not follow the law.""

Friends, these proposed bills threaten our Second Amendment rights and must not be allowed to pass. Please contact your state representative and state representative and tell them to vote no on these measures. For those unfamiliar with Randall Friese, he is a medical doctor in Tucson and was one of the surgeons who treated victims of the Gabrielle Giffords shooting. He is a solid anti-gun Democrat and must be watched until he can be voted out of office."

""Several misguided anti-gun bills have also been introduced. House Concurrent Resolution 2009 and House Bill 2118, both introduced by Representative Randall Friese (D-9), as well as Senate Bill 1269, introduced by Senator David Bradley (D-10), would create undue burdens for law-abiding gun owners by imposing restrictions on the private transfer of firearms. HCR 2009, HB 2118 and SB 1269 would make it illegal to transfer or sell any firearm without first going through a licensed firearms dealer to conduct a background check. This process does nothing to keep guns out of the hands of criminals who, by definition, do not follow the law.""

Friends, these proposed bills threaten our Second Amendment rights and must not be allowed to pass. Please contact your state representative and state representative and tell them to vote no on these measures. For those unfamiliar with Randall Friese, he is a medical doctor in Tucson and was one of the surgeons who treated victims of the Gabrielle Giffords shooting. He is a solid anti-gun Democrat and must be watched until he can be voted out of office."

Using the SB47 in this way, recoil is reduced significantly, resulting in more accurate shooting without compromising safety, comfort or control. Designed and made by a U.S. Military veteran with help from a top V.A. prosthetic specialist, the intent and design of the stabilizing brace is to help America's wounded veterans enjoy large frame handgun shooting again. The concept was to invent and create a device that would act as an extension of one's own arm, so it is like a part of your body. Well the SB47 did that - and more! Not only did it help our wounded heroes regain their confidence and handgun skills, it was wicked fun for anyone to use!"

Barrel: A proprietary blend of Hammer forged chrome molly vanadium made by FN that is referred to as ""Machine Gun Steel"" by virtue of its required use in FN's M249 and M240 weapons. The hammer forging process work hardens the steel, making it more durable. In addition, the chrome process for the bore allows for a lining almost twice as thick as a standard M16 for enhanced durability. Chambered in 5.56 NATO, with a 1/7 twist, M4 barrel extension, and a mid-length gas system. The Special ultra lightweight profile barrel has a conventional .750"" gas block diameter, is Mil-spec phosphate coated, High Pressure tested and Magnetic Particle inspected. The weight of the barrel splits the difference between our light profile and our pencil barrel. Barrel is finished off with an F-marked front sight post with sling swivel, standard handguards and an A2 flash hider.

Upper: Forged 7075-T6 A3 AR upper is hard coat anodized black for durability. Featuring T-marks, and M4 cuts, these upper upper receivers are made for us right here in the USA."

THANKS FOR LOOKING!  Up for sale is a Chinese Type 56 SKS Rifle. Caliber is 7.62x39mm, the same ammo used in the AK-47. For those that are familiar with the SKS, and SKS Collectors, this rifle was manufactured at Chinese State Arsenal 0129. Left side of the receiver shows the three Chinese characters that translate to ""Type 56"", 0129, and then the Serial Number: 211195 D. The rear of the left side of receiver shows the usual importer info: ""SKS 7.62x39 Norinco China POLY U.S.A. ATL. GA."" No other markings on the right side of the receiver or barrel. All Serial Numbered parts are stamped, not EP'd. I would like to say that the bluing is 100%, but after 25-35 years, surely it has faded a little. The stock has some dings and scratches from that crazy way they shipped them over here. But nothing major, at all. I really like the grain of the wood in this stock. Rifle comes with the Cleaning Kit, (in buttstock), Cleaning Rod, Sling, Bayonet, and Owners Manual. I'll even throw in a few GOOD stripper clips, not the cheapo ones that don't work well. As far as identifying aspects of the various parts of the rifle: It has the Spike Bayonet, all forged/milled parts and receiver as far as I can tell. No cast/milled parts. Side-mount for the sling on the buttstock, which I thought was interesting with a pinned barrel receiver and late model Bolt Carrier. There are three letters stamped into the buttstock directly behind the side-mount sling hardware. It may be a previous Owner's initials, I don't know. They are small, neatly done, and discreet. I have owned this SKS since 2005 and never fired a round through it. I don't know if it's been fired or not. If it has been fired, it was VERY FEW rounds. The Bolt still has cosmoline inside with the Firing Pin and is sluggish to move. So, I know it was never completely disassembled and cleaned properly for firing condition. This is extremely important on the SKS! If the new Buyer of this SKS has not performed this removal and replacement before, I can show the procedure to him or her at the time of the sale. Terms: Cash Only. Face to Face preferred. I can meet in the Springfield, Ozark, Branson West, and Branson areas. Other close areas can be considered. Price does NOT include any shipping costs or transfer fees. I can ship, but all shipping and transfer fees to be paid by Buyer. If Buyer requests shipping, I require a Postal Money Order and will ship via UPS and supply Buyer with a Tracking Number. My ZIP Code is 65737, if you'd like to estimate shipping costs to you. Armslist only allows five pictures for the ad. But I have 20+ pics of the SKS and can take more at request. Just request more pics of what you'd like to see and where to send them.  Thanks for looking!  SOLD!!! IT WENT FAST!!"

-Red Army Standard 123gr FMJ: 3 boxes ($8/ea. $24 total)

-Arsenal reloadable brass cased 7.62: 2 boxes ($14.99/ea. $30 total)
-PPU brass cased 7.62: 3 boxes ($11/ea. $33 total)

Total that I paid for all that ammunition was $468.50 + tax = $510.67
I also paid shipping for all of that, which was about $40 all together (if not more).

Grand Total I paid for all this ammo was roughly $600 after everything (taxes and shipping got me on most of these) so I'll just sell the whole lot for $550 to save any hassle of shipping or taxes if someone wants to come pick it all up.  Or if you want to subtract the more expensive brass cased ammo, you can take the rest for $500 (minus the brass cased ammo)

I also have 10 boxes of Federal 5.56 XM193 I'm trying to get rid of too $8.50/ea. I also have various pistol caliber boxes too if interested just let me know. 

Thanks!"

customer reviews:
1) I've had mine for over a year now and am very impressed. Accuracy is good, functionality is flawless no failures to feed or eject.
 my only complaint is i wish it had adj. sights cause mine shoots 6-8"" low at 25 yds or so, but for the price (as compared to other 10mm's on the market) its hard to bitch about it. I do wish EAA offered aftermarket sights though.
 all in all i wouldnt turn anyone away from these as they are a well built product. 
2) Very happy with this purchase. Extremely accurate right out of the box. This is a very well made gun, with good workmanship. It is heavy, especially when compared to a poly frame gun but that makes it extremely comfortable to shoot."

Phone calls only ------- REDACTED

I do not text. Bring exact change. I am located 100 yards from Lamberts Restaurant in Ozark.

With low oil level cut-off switch

I bought this generator two years ago in case of ice storm/power outage. Never used it. Always stored in garage. Every 2 weeks, I have started it and let it run for 10 minutes. Has total run time of maybe 10 to 12 hours, spread out over two years.

It starts first pull 99 per cent of the time --- even in very cold weather.

Fresh oil change with full synthetic oil.

The gas tank is clean with absolutely no rust/debris/corrosion.

Only thing wrong with this generator is the fuel level gauge window is cloudy.

You can start this machine up and watch it work. Runs like a top."

Continuous Zero Fixed Rear Battle Sight For Improved Accuracy & Durability

Tactical backup sight is always deployed, so there’s absolutely no delay, no fumbling when you need to transition from the primary optic. Troy designed this sight to be simple, rugged, and reliable—and it takes up only 1-1/8"" of rail space. Precision machined from solid aluminum, with plenty of metal on the protective “ears” around the two-position aperture. All edges and corners are rounded, and there are no protruding knobs or levers to catch on brush, clothing, or other equipment. Rear of the base is undercut to provide clearance for access to the charging handle. Same-plane aperture flips easily between .190"" and .070"" diameter peeps, just like the Folding Rear Battle Sight. Windage adjustable in ½ MOA clicks using a coin in the slot of the flush A1-style detent-locking adjustment wheel. Clamps to any Picatinny rail; installs with a standard flathead screwdriver.

In very good condition. Minor installation marks. $64.99 at Brownells but not in stock. $50 shipped to lower 48 states."
