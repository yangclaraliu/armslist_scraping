History of the M1 Garand
The M1 Garand...Called ""The Greatest Battle Implement Ever Devised"" by General George S. Patton
The Reason he said this was During World War II, the M1 being a “Semi Automatic Weapon” gave U.S. forces a Distinct Advantage in Firefights against their Enemies. 
Their standard-issue rifles were slower-firing Bolt-Action rifles.
The M1 rifle's ability to rapidly fire powerful .30-06 rifle ammunition also proved to be of considerable advantage in combat. In China, Japanese Banzai Charges had previously met with frequent success against poorly trained Chinese soldiers armed with bolt-action rifles. 
Armed with the M1, Rifles, U.S. infantrymen were able to sustain a much higher rate of fire than their Chinese counterparts. In the short-range jungle fighting, where opposing forces sometimes met each other in column formation on a narrow path, the penetration of the powerful .30-06 M2 cartridge enabled a single U.S. infantryman to kill up to three Japanese soldiers with a single round.

No other trades! .44mag revolver only!

Gun Review: This is Posted on GOOGLE
The Charter Arms Undercover is a gun whose owners come hungry for self-defense, and leave satisfied that their attacker ate lead. Whatever else you can—or cannot—say about this mid-priced revolver, it’s one accurate gun of a son.

But a recent experience with the Charter Arms Target Mag Pug left me wondering if a reasonably competent shooter equipped with any of Charter’s products could hit the broadside of a barn. I’m pleased to report that the Undercover is one of the most accurate .38s I’ve ever fired. The collection of dots in the target’s center (at twenty feet) was so well-gathered that Adam at American Firearms School challenged me to repeat the feat using double action. Only I’d already punched the paper in double action mode.

Thank You for Looking

Possibly. Maybe! This car is fun, turns heads everywhere, and sounds/runs like a built 383 stroker should! I don't necessarily need to sell it, but I am having less and less time for it. Sooo...we'll see if anyone wants to adopt it from me! 

This car has less than 65,000 actual miles on it. The engine, transmission, and rear differential have less than 10,000 miles on them. I replaced the suspension and steering components with OEM equipment. Vehicle was built with factory power steering and front disc brakes, rear drum brakes. Also, has newer gas tank with electric pump, and HID headlights.

Now that the interior and powertrain have been redone, my next plans for the car are/were replacing the OEM gauges with Auto Meter gauges and then paint/body work. The body/paint is needing some love. It looks great from 10 feet away but has some imperfections that bug a guy like me up close. The previous owner had all four ¼ panels replaced but where they were installed and blended with the existing body, it was not sealed correctly underneath so there is some cracking in the body filler and paint (See pictures below). There is some overspray and clear coat flaking in a couple of places ...all is an easy fix for someone that plans to media blast the body and start fresh with it. The body is very straight. With the correct body and paint work, this would be a nice $40,000+ show car!

I won't lie.  I bought it because it was cool.  Still is cool.  Just don't use it and am building a flintlock so it's redundant.  The gun handles surprisingly light.  If you've never hunted with a traditional rifle, you're going to wonder where all the weight is.  It's in the barrel, rather than the action.  It's great for taming the recoil of the blackpowder (which isn't much to begin with).  All around just a fun one to have.  Traditions is a good company to go with too, if this is your first muzzleloader.  I won't touch a CVA but like the Traditions."

The Barrett  lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The Barrett rifle’s lower receiver includes a new recoil buffer system that is also optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon plating that increases lubricity is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning.

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference.

Under 112,000 miles mostly highway. Just bought this truck and a few others and did needed repairs. This Dakota has a new rearend, tie rods, tranny filter and fluid along with a full service checkup and new oil and filter a week ago. Very strong engine and tranny. Only thing wrong is the rear CO2 sensor needs to be replaced or possibly moved up some as it sits on the split and not the single pipe. Has newer dual exhaust in great condition with the bad sensor, sometimes causes engine light to come on but does not effect anything. Complete error code check was done engine light is for sure CO2 sensor and nothing else. Runs great, acceptable loud mean exhaust sound, shifts great now with new rearend. Also needs alignment something I cannot do. Cooper tires in great condition. Only real rust is at passenger door bottom front and rear less than 150 worth of body work if picky. Typical rear bumper corrosion at plate otherwise bumpers are great condition. Come with heavy duty grille guard. Great heat and a/c. Interior is near mint with new detail done a few days ago. Comes with four floormats, full manual and two sets of keys with remotes. Power windows/locks/seat.

I do not need to sell so 3500 cash price is firm I will not go any lower as book with miles is 3200+ and I did about 1000 in labor and parts. Plus take a look at what's available in mid 90s to 2003-4, high miles! The 5.2 will go 250k+ easy if not 350k. Great all season truck but definitely a great winter auto. 4x4 on the floor engages easily, properly and works great.

Overall a great truck for being 15 years old and you won't find any with this low of mileage.

Clean title will go down to DMV with you if you want for title change at time of purchase, cost is $40 being truck is 10 years or older. Plates/tabs good until August of 2015.

Not looking for anything fancy, just as long as it's properly made. Don't mind scratches, dings, ect.. 

For those who don't know the TZ 99 is a South African copy of a Sig P226. It's built almost identical (though the parts aren't interchangeable due to small tweaks). There has been about 200 rounds down the barrel. Has some normal wear and tear, innards are all good though, and it's fully ambidextrous! These are pretty rare as I've only seen a few people actually sell them. It comes with 4 15 round magazines, paddle holster and a small case. Slide and barrel is all stainless steel, numbers are also all matching. Made in South Africa. 

I'm only looking to trade for an AK (preferably with all wooden furniture, but I'm not picky I suppose)."

This is not a CMP build 308. This gun was custom built using USGI parts

The rifle is all USGI parts, most of the later 65 or 77 series parts, with the exception of the barrel. The barrel is a Criterion M1 Garand contour barrel with a 1:10 twist which should allow you to shoot any ammo from surplus to match with excellent accuracy. It is NOT chrome lined. I have been able to consistently paper 1 ¼ in groups and I am quite sure it is capable of shooting better than I can.

The receiver was a purchase from the CMP and IS NOT A RE-WELD

All USGI parts were hand selected and are either new old stock or newer parts all well within acceptable tolerance. The stock is in excellent shape, again a walnut USGI item with a nice DAS stamp. The rifle has fired for me without a single problem.

It has National Match front and rear sights and is an excellent shooting rifle. The trigger group has been tuned and polished to National Match standards by Master Gunsmith Jeff Shapiro. It also features an adjustable gas plug which will allow you to adjust gas blow back for any round you may be shooting. The receiver and op rod have been nicely laser engraved with the words “NATO 7.62 mm”

It has on it a 3-9 power Tasco scope.  I sighted it in for 100 yds the other day and got a 1.25"" two-shot group.  EDIT:  I shot it again yesterday with different bullets and it will really stack them in there with Winchester primers.  CCI primers gave a lower point of impact.

I built it as a SHTF style AR. Shoots very well. The bull barrel makes it quite loud but very stable. I have about 600 rounds through it but only 160 with no rapid fire through the bull barrel. It stabilizes the 75s very nice out to 300 meters, haven't taken it past that. I don't need to sell it but I have since switched my tactics and don't need it any more. The camo job is just a textured rattle can finish but is durable and blends very well in the woods. The scope and red-dot are newer to the rifle and not dialed in. The scope was a quick sight at 25m so it will be close. 

Will not ship. Any questions feel free to ask. Thanks"

This quad will do it all. It's a utility quad so when your wife tries to give you shit about it tell her the money it will save when you can plow your own driveway. You don't actually have to buy the plow but it will get her off your back. But seriously with those aftermarket STI rims and clean cherry red plastics, I doubt she will even be able to find anything to bitch about on this beast.

The base price for fixed blade sheaths will start at $25 for a fold-over, and $30 for a 2-piece. Folder knives will probably be a little cheaper.

I currently only stock black kydex. Other colors or patterns can be special ordered. Tec-Loks can be special ordered also if you do not have any, or I can make a belt-slide platform for an additional cost.

I will need the knife (or other item) you wish the sheath made for, the width of the belt you are going to carry on if getting a belt-slide platform, and at least the base payment down before I start work. Currently, without any special order items, I can usually have the sheath done in a day or two."

Shipping to your local FFL is FREE and NO CC FEES!  Price does not include the NFA tax stamp or local sales tax.  Also, with the purchase of this suppressor, we can assist you in creating a basic living trust!  A living trust will speed up the transfer process.  Let us know if you have questions.  Check out this video! The SilencerCo Salvo 12 is the first and only commercially-viable shotgun suppressor on earth. It represents an incredible advance in engineering and technology, and carries with it the same quality and service as SilencerCo’s other products. Every year, millions of sportsmen and women venture into the fields to hunt. While rifle and handgun suppressors continue to increase in popularity, shotgun owners have been without a real solution for ear protection. Some choose hearing preservation in the form of earmuffs or plugs for relief in controlled environments, but spurn their use in the field or in a home protection scenario, where the ability to detect other sounds is critical. The Salvo 12 is modular in nature — the shooter can add or remove sections to balance their sound suppression, weight and length needs. At its full length of 12 inches, it brings sound down to 137 dB at the muzzle — well below the 140 dB hearing-safe level set by OSHA. Whether you grab a shotgun for hunting, shooting clays or home defense, the Salvo 12 fits most common shotguns — provided you have a choked barrel. The suppressor attaches to the existing choke threads via an adapter. Due to differences in shotgun manufacturer and choke preference, it is important that you select the correct adapter. The Salvo 12 is just one more example of the type of innovation that has garnered a fiercely loyal customer base for SilencerCo. SALVO 12 CALIBER: 12 GA.

 The Anderson Rifle is The World’s Only NO LUBE Rifle

 The Anderson Rifle is the only rifle in the world that never requires lubrication. It is only possible because it is permanently treated with RF85, the nano technology that injects calcium into the molecular fabric of the metal. RF85 is permanent. It is IN the metal. RF85 reduces friction 85% and wears with the metal. Under heat and pressure the calcium nano particles elongate and form a protective barrier that eliminates the need for lubrication.

 An ancillary benefit arises because without an oily film to catch carbon particles, the rifle runs cleaner much longer. A typical lubricated weapon traps the carbon byproducts from explosives. Under the heated conditions found in weapons, the gooey mess turns into tar which bakes into a solid mass and fouls the chamber. The result is life-threatening weapon failure.

 The Anderson Rifle uses RF85 nano-technology to fire with
•85% Less Friction
•23% Faster Action
•Never Needs Oiling
•Cleans Up with Soap & Water

 RF85 is proven effective in the medical industry, in automotive and racing, and manufacturing. You can read the independent reports by Oak Ridge National Laboratories here.

 Once you understand just how effective this process is, you won’t settle for anything less than an Anderson NO LUBE Rifle."

If you are a gunsmith, some tweaking can be made as you'd know that these are just the nominal specs. This selectable gas block system is designed for suppressor modification use with the properly specified/modified barrel(s) above. Armalite did the R&D and figured out what works for a selectable gas block on a 7.62x51 supressed semi-auto AR platform. Other systems or mods work, but have had many complaints and errors in function. Selector allows for removal of suppressor system and allows for continued rifle use with out having to swap gas blocks or ammo loads. Retails for $290.00. Don't need it, can't use it with my set up unless I buy/mod an aforementioned barrel. My loss is your gain as this was part of a free float kit at over twice the price. Accepting offers, but be realistic...it's an Armalite part not easily found, not cheap, and pretty darn specific. So I will only entertain offers close to retail."

 Description

 The Beretta CX4 Storm is a semi-automatic rifle chambered in 9mm, .40 S&W, and .45 ACP. The gun is the civilian version of the Beretta Mx4 Storm and is one of two rifles offered by Beretta. Beretta recommends the gun for sporting and personal defense.

 The CX4 Storm features a blowback operating system, so the expanding gases that push a round through the barrel also push back onto the bolt to cycle the action. 

 Features include an ambidextrous controls. The CX4 Storm utilizes a front sight adjustable for windage and elevation with a rear sight that includes long and short range apertures of 50 and 100 meters. And both sights can fold down. However, the carbine is also equipped with a Picatinny rail, which allows for easy mounting of optics and accessories.

No credit card fees and shipping to your local FFL is FREE!  Price does not include the NFA tax stamp or local sales tax.  Also, with the purchase of this suppressor, we can assist you in creating a basic living trust!  A living trust will speed up the transfer process.  Let us know if you have questions.  SilencerCo’s Osprey family of pistol suppressors is a perfect blend of form and function. With the modern combat handgun in mind, SilencerCo set out to create a silencer that performs well and looks like it belongs—the best possible marriage between host weapon and silencer. SilencerCo went to work to make a suppressor that maximizes sound suppression levels, allows the use of more host pistols with factory sights, and has more operationally friendly features. What was created was the Osprey pistol silencer available for 9mm, .40 S&W, and 45ACP. Although round silencers are very effective for many applications, for a centerfire handgun round it has its limits. To obtain the most suppression, silencers must have as much internal volume as possible; but for a round tubular silencer, the only way to acquire more internal volume is by increasing the overall diameter and/or length. Increasing a tube’s diameter will obscure the site picture of the host gun and inhibit the possibility of holstering a weapon with the silencer still attached to the host gun. The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Because of this eccentric design, most of the baffles and internal volume is beneath the centerline of the bore and out of the way of the gun’s sights, thus leaving the shooter the ability to use factory sights with little or no sight or target obstruction. The Osprey has flat side walls and angled edges that mimic many modern combat handgun slides and is just slightly wider than most host pistols.

845,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3601845,For Sale:  NEW Silencerco Osprey 40 Silencer Suppressor With Piston,"Amissville, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 740,"Listed On: Sunday, September 25, 2016",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Check us out online!  www.54-17arms.com Brand new Silencerco Osprey 40 Silencer Suppressor with the piston of your choice.

SilencerCo’s Osprey family of pistol suppressors is a perfect blend of form and function. With the modern combat handgun in mind, SilencerCo set out to create a silencer that performs well and looks like it belongs—the best possible marriage between host weapon and silencer. SilencerCo went to work to make a suppressor that maximizes sound suppression levels, allows the use of more host pistols with factory sights, and has more operationally friendly features. What was created was the Osprey pistol silencer available for 9mm, .40 S&W, and 45ACP. Although round silencers are very effective for many applications, for a centerfire handgun round it has its limits. To obtain the most suppression, silencers must have as much internal volume as possible; but for a round tubular silencer, the only way to acquire more internal volume is by increasing the overall diameter and/or length. Increasing a tube’s diameter will obscure the site picture of the host gun and inhibit the possibility of holstering a weapon with the silencer still attached to the host gun. The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Because of this eccentric design, most of the baffles and internal volume is beneath the centerline of the bore and out of the way of the gun’s sights, thus leaving the shooter the ability to use factory sights with little or no sight or target obstruction. The Osprey has flat side walls and angled edges that mimic many modern combat handgun slides and is just slightly wider than most host pistols. This feature allows the host weapon to be holstered with many popular open bottom holster designs with Osprey attached. The Osprey contains approximately 30% more internal volume than a traditional round tube silencer at the same length, but does so without obscuring the shooter’s sight picture or adding excessive width and length. 40 OSPREY CALIBER: 9MM - 40 S&W .300 BLK Subsonic WEIGHT: 11.1 OZ DIMENSIONS: 1.30”W × 1.75”H LENGTH: 8.0625” SOUND LEVEL: Dry: 130 dB (tested with a Glock 22 with Remington UMC 180 Grain Ammunition) FINISH: Hard Coat Anodizing Black Oxide MATERIALS: Core/Caps: 7075 T6 Aluminum Tube: 6061 T6 Aluminum Piston/Mounting System: 17-4 Stainless Steel, Heat Treated, Mount:Threads FEATURES: Interchangeable pistons Unobstructed sight picture Patented cam lock Mounting system Lifetime warranty MSRP: $849.95 (with piston)"

854,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3601854,For Sale:  NEW Silencerco Osprey 45 Silencer Suppressor,"Amissville, Northern Virginia, Virginia",$ 675,"Listed On: Friday, October 6, 2017",NFA,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Check us out online!  www.54-17arms.com Brand new Silencerco Osprey 45 Silencer Suppressor. No credit card fees and shipping to your local FFL is FREE!  Price does not include the NFA tax stamp or local sales tax.  Also, with the purchase of this suppressor, we can assist you in creating a basic living trust!  A living trust will speed up the transfer process.  Let us know if you have questions.  Check out this video! SilencerCo’s Osprey family of pistol suppressors is a perfect blend of form and function. With the modern combat handgun in mind, SilencerCo set out to create a silencer that performs well and looks like it belongs—the best possible marriage between host weapon and silencer. SilencerCo went to work to make a suppressor that maximizes sound suppression levels, allows the use of more host pistols with factory sights, and has more operationally friendly features. What was created was the Osprey pistol silencer available for 9mm, .40 S&W, and 45ACP. Although round silencers are very effective for many applications, for a centerfire handgun round it has its limits. To obtain the most suppression, silencers must have as much internal volume as possible; but for a round tubular silencer, the only way to acquire more internal volume is by increasing the overall diameter and/or length. Increasing a tube’s diameter will obscure the site picture of the host gun and inhibit the possibility of holstering a weapon with the silencer still attached to the host gun. The Osprey is an eccentric silencer, which means that the bore does not run down the middle of the tube. Because of this eccentric design, most of the baffles and internal volume is beneath the centerline of the bore and out of the way of the gun’s sights, thus leaving the shooter the ability to use factory sights with little or no sight or target obstruction. The Osprey has flat side walls and angled edges that mimic many modern combat handgun slides and is just slightly wider than most host pistols. This feature allows the host weapon to be holstered with many popular open bottom holster designs with Osprey attached. The Osprey contains approximately 30% more internal volume than a traditional round tube silencer at the same length, but does so without obscuring the shooter’s sight picture or adding excessive width and length. 45 OSPREY CALIBER: 9MM - .45 ACP .300 BLK Subsonic WEIGHT: 11.1 OZ DIMENSIONS: 1.3”W × 1.75”H LENGTH: 8.0625” SOUND LEVEL: (Dry/Wet): 132.5 dB/123 dB (tested with an HK USP Tactical with Remington UMC 230 Grain Ammunition) FINISH: Hard Coat Anodizing Black Oxide MATERIALS: Core/Caps: 7075 T6 Aluminum Tube: 6061 T6 Aluminum Piston/Mounting System: 17-4 Stainless Steel, Heat Treated, Mount:Threads FEATURES: Interchangeable pistons Unobstructed sight picture Patented cam lock Mounting system Lifetime warranty MSRP: $849.95 (with piston)"

The grips are military cartouched and the rest of the gun is martially inspected.

The gun came with an old wooden stock with, shall we say, lots of character. The gouges and water marks lead me to believe it was used in less than preferable conditions (rice patties, rainfall etc). You don't know gun cleaning until you've cleaned one of these - caked and soaked in cosmoline and grit, it took about 2 hours of wiping, scrubbing, picking, crying, brushing, and finally heating it to force the cosmoline out of the pores.

Upgrades:
Last time I checked it shoots high, so after about a month or two of waiting my Smith Sights came in the mail (red fiber, and target post). Have yet to install them, scared of screwing it up. I'll take it out and make a decision.

Although I did clean, sand, and put a few coats of linseed oil on the original stock, I decided to put an ATI stock on it (left over from another mosin). Feels lighter, more comfortable, and looks slicker.

Added a comfortable sling (because reasons).

I took off the bayonet and ground off the lug because it: puts extra weight on the wrong end, disrupts barrel harmonics, is sharp, catches on everything, and looked ugly (in my opinion). The bayonets are cool, but this rifle is meant for throwing lead.

Not really an upgrade, but when I was disassembling it the bolt head shot past my face and disappeared into the wilderness that is my garage. Replacement bolt head with extractor is in the mail. 

You can't break this gun, the ammo is inexpensive and powerful, it's really fun (fireballs and loud bangs) and it handles well. 

I've got ammo to go with it.
