This is a SKB 600. It shows wear all over but has solid wood and is a good shooter.
The lower barrel is marked full. The upper mics at .7109(mod) The barrels have no dents and maintain most of the blue and the receiver is in good cosmetic condition too. There is a factory center bead on the rib. Barrels are 28"".
 LOP is 14 3/4"" and it has a thick pad on it.
One ejector sticks from time to time but can always be tripped if you pick up on the barrel/forearm a little when it happens. I left it like that as it made it easy to pick an empty out as it extracts to some degree before tripping and sending the case flying.
Dove season is just around the corner and this would make a great gun for them.
Already has the patina of a seasoned dove gun (Bumps and bruises)

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition. The Tactical version does have a decocker rather than a manual safety.

“Pre-1964” rifles had an action considered superior to later rifles. After 1964, this feature was dropped to reduce cost.

This is a very well-respected hunting rifle, especially for deer.  Its light weight gives it more recoil than a heavier gun, but for hunting, when you may carry the gun through the woods all day and only fire once, this is a good tradeoff. The gun also has smooth trigger action and nice woodwork with cut (not pressed) checkering. 

The Winchester Model 70 has an iconic place in American sporting culture and has been held in high regard by shooters since it was introduced in 1936, earning the moniker ""The Rifleman's Rifle""  (p239 Bolt Action Rifles by Frank de Haas, DBI Books INC, Northfield ILL, USA, 1971)

I have a similar pair of these in my car that are slightly less powerful and will be willing to show you the potential. between these two amps you can push over 2000 watts TRUE rms. 

There's more to this multi-channel amplifier than meets the eye. Hifonics Zeus amplifiers are redesigned to not only look different, but also provide clean, true power. Designed to complement the Brutus Class D series of amplifiers, there's no better match for a multi-channel amplifier. The newly implanted vertical fin heat-sinks are designed to allow maximum heat dissipation from the amplifier, which allows this amplifier to run much more efficiently and have less impact on your car battery. Their new series of amplifier is now CEA-2006 compliant, meaning their specifications have met CEA standards and their output is certified and true.
Zeus Amplifiers incorporate Ultra-Fi MOSFET output devices, which will decrease overall distortion and allow your amplifier to output nothing but pure high-fidelity audio. The smoothness of Ultra-Fi will remove electrical interference and noise that's usually generated by amplifiers, and allow the user to enjoy noise-free music. Zeus amplifiers combined clean power, heat dissipation and Ultra-Fi circuitry makes this amplifier unrivaled for any application. The God's have bestowed clean, pure power. Enough compromising -- it's time for a Zeus.

Underneath the solid aluminum casing, you will find quality amplifier components that are sure to satisfy any compatible subwoofer. The new BRZ amplifiers have changed the heat sinks on each side to vertical aluminum fins. Since heat rises, these fins draw the heat up and allow it so effectively dissipate from the amplifier. The vertical aluminum heat sinks are located on two sides of the amplifier and effectively maintain the temperature of the amplifier to prevent any overheating. Combined with the other power/protection indicators and the 4-way system protection circuitry, the Hifonics Brutus amplifiers prove to be a safe, efficient, and reliable amplifier for your subwoofer.
Every Brutus amplifier is CEA-2006 certified. That means you can be confident in knowing that you are paying for real power. The wattage that the amplifier is rated at is the wattage that it will consistently produce and supply your subwoofer with. This is typically a feature just found on the higher-end, expensive amplifiers, however all the Brutus series amps are CEA-2006 compliant with a low price tag. By choosing one of these amplifiers, you will be high-grade performance and still have money left over. Performance meets value with the Hifonics Brutus amplifiers!

This pistol features a single-position Picatinny rail, low-profile rear and fiber optic front sights, two interchangeable backstraps, and a deep-penetrating Melonite finish that protects against corrosion. The XD-S also boasts multiple safety features, including the Ultra Safety Assurance (USA) Action Trigger System, a loaded chamber indicator, and a grip safety. The disassembly lever cannot be manipulated with a magazine in the pistol, and when the disassembly lever is up, a magazine cannot be inserted into the pistol.
