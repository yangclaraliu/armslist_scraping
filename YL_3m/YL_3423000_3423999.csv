We had some life changing events come up, and now have no place to keep it. This vessel is capable of carrying up to 8 passengers comfortably all day long at the lake.

This boat is the best deal on the planet. Bought it from a friend to help him out, and ended up putting a new 4.3 liter v6 engine into it. Then we replaced the throttle/shift cable. Then we replaced the coupling from the new engine to the outboard. Then we decided to tear down the outboard and rebuild that. High pressure oil pump installed, as well as baffles and all fluids. New marine battery installed. This thing is a BEAST! All work was done by a certified marine repair shop locally.

I'm also throwing in the Cabelas MAXX two person towable with air pump, new Lowrance color depth/fish finder, and the new Minn-kota trolling motor that has never even been mounted on the boat. We installed a beach umbrella holder in the boat. Bimini covers were outrageously expensive, and a friend gave us the idea. Works great, covers the 6 passenger portion of the boat nicely, and doesn't look half bad to boot! Boat has a new marine radio with 4 speakers installed. Radio is a AM/FM/CD/MP3 player, great for a day on the lake. 

It just came out of the shop, and is in a temporary home at a family members house. This needs to go. I hate to see it leave, especially after putting a total of $10k into it after buying it, rebuilding everything in the back end, and dumping another several hundred into the trailer, but I simply don't have anywhere to keep a toy like this.

You could be on the lake this upcoming Labor Day. Do my family and yours a favor, and jump on this deal today! Would like to see $4000 back on it, but would not turn down a serious offer.

Would accept  trades for a 50.  Would also entertain a SCAR, Tavor.......  If you can put together a package worth an equal trade, we can definitely work out a deal.  Thanks for looking"

I'm looking to sell it because I just bought a 229R in SA/DA and the 226 is DAO.

Everything is immaculate on it, ""Made in Germany"" slide.  Meaning this Sig was made in germany (as opposed to the lesser quality US sigs made in NH) and since it doesnt have the ""W"" before germany it was produced after 1990.

I am the sole owner, and have shot approx. 800 rounds though it.  Enough to break it in, still hundreds of thousands left to go in it.  Interested in trades, preferably something in .308, but will entertain anything interesting!

The Samson Manufacturing Evolution Series free float rails are customizable AR-15 handguards. The Evo rail attaches to a standard barrel nut with a two piece thermal bushing constructed of stainless steel, two locking tabs ensure the rail does not rotate under stress. The thermal bushing along with the generous ventilation slots help to keep heat from transferring into the handguard and into the operator's hand. The continuous top rail allows you to mount optics anywhere along the top of the rifle and allows same-plane iron sights to be mounted. The top rail has also been relieved to accept most aftermarket piston conversion systems. Each Evo handguard includes two 2"", and one 4"" customizable rail sections that can be mounted anywhere along the handguard tube. The interior of the tube is 1.56"" in diameter, allowing most suppressors to fit underneath."

It shoots extremely well and functions perfectly. I have around 300 rounds through the weapon and have had no issues. I want $900 for the gun as is. The only trade I would accept is a Tavor in Kryptek with the 16.5"" barrel (I'd obviously be giving you cash on top).

I will ask you to fill out a bill of sale and I'll need to see ID. The gun and myself are located in SE Portland.

Up for sale is my Ruger 10/22 target rifle.
Rallying cash together for a vehicle purchase, otherwise I would most definitely be keeping it. Bought as a standard 10/22 with polymer stock from KYgunco in late January. Low round count (~250rds) courtesy of last years 22lr shortage. Rifle is an absolute tack driver and almost pathetically easy to group. All parts were purchased new and assembled competently and correctly by myself. Never seen mud, dust, dirt, snow etc. No scratches, nicks, dings or any signs of wear. Haven't been shooting much as of late so this has been sitting quietly in the safe. Priced for a quick sale.

Details
- ER Shaw 20"" Stainless Fluted Target barrel
- PWS Raptor Stock
- Mueller APV AO 4.5-14x40
- Burris Zee rings (med)
- KIDD drop in trigger kit (breaks around 1 3/4 pounds)
- KIDD cocking assembly w/ bolt handle
- KIDD bolt buffer
- VQ extractor

I'll also throw in a bit of 22lr, but not sure what I have left. Rifle case not included.

Price: $625 FIRM
No trades
FTF sale only - No shipping
Cash, Certified Check or MO only.
Please don't waste time lowballing as this is my bottom dollar price and it is priced to sell quickly.

It has never been carried and lived safely in my safe.  I am asking $280.00 FIRM for the Bersa Thunder .380 Conceal carry.

I also have 4 boxes of .380 ammo to go along with it for an additional $50.00.  Is it missing the 16 rounds that were fired through this gun.  So a total of 184 rounds for $50.00.  They are quality rounds for target shooting and NOT personal defense.

I am selling the scope separately on a listing in ""optics"", however.  So, here is how to proceed with this listing: you can send me an email stating that assuming the gun is in satisfactory condition that you will buy it.  That starts the 24/hr wait.  Next, I'll need your FOID # and dob for the ISP check, along with your name and address for a bill of sale/transfer form.  If you choose to contact me, please do plan to follow through (you do not have to buy, if you do not like it!).  If you are just window shopping or have too much time on your hands, please keep looking!  I'd rather not spend my time playing around online.  Thanks for your understanding and I am sure you'll be pleased with the rifle."

Its tip-up barrel design makes it easy to load, operate and maintain, while its traditional looks give it the allure of a true classic. The 3032 features a tip-up barrel design typical of the classic Beretta small-frame pistols. Thanks to this design, you never need to rack the slide and you can load that first round directly into the chamber. This is especially convenient in cold weather, or for people with weaker hands. Another advantage is that the barrel may be easily cleaned without taking the pistol apart, making it convenient to give the pistol a quick wipe after a session at the range. This gun is in great condition. Holds 7+1 with 1clip and Comes with 75 rounds of 32 auto. I not very eager to trade it for the simple fact that ive carryed this in my gym shorts with no problem.

844,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3423844,For Sale:  1979 AM General M917 Military Dump Truck,"Morris county, New Jersey, United States","$ 25,000","Listed On: Sunday, August 24, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"You are looking at an original 1979 AM General M917 Military Dump Truck with only 30,000 miles. (Same maker as the original Humvee, also commonly called Hummer.) It is powered by a NTC-400 Cummings diesel engine and has a Caterpillar #7155 16 speed automatic transmission. The truck is in exceptional condition and even comes with the original military service history. 

It shows all the inspections, maintenance, and sign offs for the years it was in use for the National Guard. The original owner bought this truck from the military however had another 6x6 which resulted in this not getting used much. The original owner sold it to the second and current owner who continued this trend as it was more of a novelty and vintage item than a daily work truck. 

I did not clean up the before the sale as I wanted to leave it in its natural state for the next owner. The truck is not filthy but could use an interior cleaning, etc. I tried to get pictures that show the exact condition of the truck. The truck does not have any rot, frame is not bent, never welded, tires are good, wheels are solid, no leaks visible, as this is an extremely clean truck. 

I thought it was also interesting that the truck also had the security change and ""US GOVT"" stamped padlock inside (key obviously was not included from the govt.) The military used the chain, padlock, and that was secured to the steering wheel. 

Here is some additional information about this truck:

The M917 dump truck body provides the capability of hauling and dumping, or spreading heavy loads of hot asphalt, aggregate, dirt, and similar materials. The M917 vehicle chassis has off-road capabilities therefore providing a wide variety of terrain in which the dump truck can operate. The dump body contains a sealed hydraulic system for raising and lowering the dump bed. The hydraulic system is powered by the vehicle chassis PTO unit. 

The tailgate can be adjusted for dumping the load or for controlled spreading while the vehicle is moving. It has a Hydraulic Dump box the can hold up to 20 cu yd of material. Gross Vehicle Weight (lbs): 75000; 8x6 for 20-ton dump truck, The M917 vehicles are authorized in Corps units, primarily the Construction and Combat Support Companies and the Combat Heavy Battalions.

The exterior is has several compartments that can store a wide range of supplies, many of which already have storage area dividers, shelving, and hard wired lighting installed. The outside utility body also has a covenant cut out to store wheel chocks right by each rear tire. The body also has an area you could store longer items like ladders or pipes. The rear has a pinnacle hitch and plug for towing a trailer. 

 Both the drivers and passenger side have an exterior compartment extended locking bar that allows the full size cabinets to be locked in one motion from the rear outside of the truck. You just push the bar forward (located in the rear) and it can be secured with a padlock. That means that you do not need to individually lock each compartment to secure them. The small compartments are not part of this locking system; however have individual locks like the larger cabinets do. (Owner does not have key.)

 The utility body has an interior full size work area that you can stand in and has building in shelving. It also has two large full size locking compartments. You could easily set up a work bench or even store 55 gallon drums inside. There is already electrical lighting mounted on the ceiling (some bulbs or fixtures could need to be replaced.)"
