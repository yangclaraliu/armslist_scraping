All it has is a few symbols right behind the sights & the sights # starts at 3 & goes to 20. The symbols look like a tilted backward C with a straight line attached under it to the left of that its either a ""I"" or a ""1"" & to the left of that its a ""6"". Under those is the ID # which is X8474 & its all matching on the Bolt handle which is curved downward NOT straight. Its on the bottom magazine & the left side on the barrel next to the bolt. Also on the left side of the sights it goes from #4 to 20 on the right side #3 to 19. Ive been searching online & can not find anything. The guy I bought it from said it was Spanish but I dont think he gave me the right stock because the top hand quard doesnt fit right. An its only 30 inches from the barrel tip to the safety in the bolt. Any help would be appreciated. Id like to restore this back to original condition since its in very nice shape, other than the Stock."

European American Armory Bounty Hunter Revolver Single Action Army .22LR /.22WMR 4.75"" Barrell, Nickel Finish

The Bounty Hunter single action revolver has been sold in the USA for over 20 years. Made in Germany and available in 22LR /22WMR, .357 Mag, .44 Mag and 45 LC, it is simply one of the best single action revolvers produced. You can purchase a more expensive, or a famous brand, but you won’t be getting a better single action firearm. The Bounty Hunter is a traditional 6 shot single action revolver with traditional resting notch, but it also has a transfer bar and recessed chambers for shooting safety. Our 22LR/22WMR version is on a full size frame unlike our competition. So you can practice your Cowboy Action Shooting with rimfire or go plinking with our 6rd or 8rd rimfire cylinders. There are a lot of single action revolvers out there but none better than The Bounty Hunter from EAA Corp.

First is my ugly duckling glock 26-sold

2nd is a Leinad .410/.45lc. Single barrel, 11in break action, single barrel. I modded the safety on this because the orriginal design is dumb. Bought new, shot like 20 times and was intended to be a boat gun, but just sat at my wife's house. 100 bucks takes it.
Picture of it shows where I cut a section of the plate that is blocked by the safety. Safety still functions, just now you cna open and close the action regardless of the safety status. Also a little should strap as a sling. Sold pending funds.

3rd is a hard one to let go. SIG P238 darkwood. 1 flush mag and 2 mags with the pinky extension. Leather Iwb of my design made by a custom guy in az. I rounded off the slide stop because I use a really high grip and it wouldn't lock back because of that. Gun shows very little wear, but I've carried it a good bit. 550 bucks.
One pic is the 238, three factory mags, iwb holster and in-the-pocket mag pouch. Great for summer time carry.
The other pick shows the rounded slide stop and a piece of grip tape on the frame. Also if you look close, there is a little knick on the trigger guard. The grips also show some wear from carrying.  Gun eats everything cept steel cased .380.

The 5.7x28 round has a high velocity, but low recoil while still maintaining a high level of penetration with standard FMJs. The 5.7 has been known to pierce kevlar body armor.

There is a small chip in the grip.  You can replace it for less than $20 on Ebay, but I never did because it works great as is.  To be clear, this is a cap and ball pistol, that means you put powder, wad and ball into the cylinder, not a metallic cartridge. The firearm was a huge advancement when it was designed as you can swap cylinders very easily, with no tools.  They are a ton of fun, and the originals were used in the civil war.  Clint Eastwood demonstrated the technique in the movie Pale Rider.I'm firm on the price and not looking for trades.  Thanks!"

Glock 19 is less than a year old with about 500 rounds through it. Comes with standard sights, 3 magazines and all factory packaging. I do have a few extras I would be willing to include for the right trade but I am looking at this for IDPA and cold weather carry. I am in St. Clairsville and will drive to meet in Zanesville, Carrollton or Columbiana.

I really would like to make a trade by Saturday which is our last IDPA club match of the year. Gun is in excellent condition and shoots great but with my new 26 it's a little redundant. Can add a little cash if it makes this go a bit quicker. Please make sure your gen 4 has it's backstraps. I would consider a Gen 3 if it includes an extra magazine or 2. 

I have ZERO interest in any cash offers or other trades at this time.
The gun has XS Sights installed now. And instead of having to remove them I will include them for a little cash or if the 17 comes with extras.

This is a very close competitor to a the Aimpoint Pro at 1/5th the price.

This is probably the highest quality red dot you can buy before you start getting into the ""they want how much for a red dot?"" category, not to mention the fact that Vortex has a lifetime unconditional, no questions asked replacement policy on their optics.  If it breaks for any reason, send it back and they'll send you a new one, no explanation needed.

This red dot comes with front and rear optic covers, has both red dot and green(night vision) settings, and comes with the ""high rise"" mount for AR style rifles along with a 2x screw in magnifier which I would say isnt that great (but they come with all vortex optics).  Ships in original box with all original components as well.

This is an excellent red dot for the price and I highly recommend it!  (have since moved on to different optics.

I also have a 3x ""flip to side"" matching magnifier from Vortex for sale in another listing as well.  Will sell for a package price if interested."

Detailed description
------------------------------------------------------------------

For sale is a pair of like-new and genuine Armasight PVS7-3 Alpha Gen 3 Night Vision Grade A Goggles.  This is the exact item as the Armasight Gen 3 Grade A NVG being sold on Amazon.com if you type in ""B007SYIYAY"" in the search box.  You can also find full specs for the item there.

Although used it is functionally and cosmetically perfect and has only been used for less than 5 hours. Gen 3 tubes are rated 12,000-15,000 hours of life so there's definitely a bit of life left in it.  The NVG was bought about a year ago, comes from a private indoor collection of optics, and has not been used for hunting or military conflicts of any kind.  There are no scratches on any lens, dents/marks on the body, and almost no artifacts or dark spots.  Even military-standard Grade A tubes usually have a few dark spots or blemishes but this one is exceptionally clear as shown in the pictures.

This item comes with all the original parts and accessories except for retail box, soft case, and manual.  However this auction includes extras that the unit did not originally come with, and they are: IR focus adjustment knob, 1 sacrificial lens, 2 x AA batteries, Plano storage case, and strap head mount with new brow pads (almost $200 value).

I understand Gen 3 NVGs are a very expensive investment but I have sold many high end optics from brands like Trijicon, EOTech, Aimpoint, Nightforce, etc. and have a 100% positive eBay seller's rating to show for it (check link above to see).  Please feel free to take a look at my eBay feedback first if interested.

My name is An and please let me know if you have any questions or requests to see a particular part of the NVG, thank you.  :)"

509,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3265509,For Sale/Trade:  Insight ISM-IR  (MIL & LE ONLY),"Virginia Beach, Hampton Roads, Virginia","$ 1,000","Listed On: Saturday, September 13, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale or trade is an Insight ISM-IR ISM-1400-A1. If you are not familiar with this optic, it co-witnesses a very powerful class 3 laser with the red dot. This means that as you adjust windage and elevation on your red dot, the laser moves with it.

This is not your typical Integrated Sight Module. This is the version with an IR Laser and Illuminator. Because of this, I will not even consider selling or trading this to you unless you are Active Duty Military or a Law Enforcement Officer. It is not legal to own this unless you are. This unit employs a very powerful laser that is not visible to the human eye and is capable of traveling vast distances, thus giving you the ability to hurt the eyes of others without even knowing it. It is not a ""tacti-cool"" toy. This is the real deal folks.

This is an older unit and has obviously seen its share of action in the field. I just received it back from Insight where they reviewed its operating status. The IR section is just a hair under their pass marks. The IR co-align is also just .2 mRads out of spec, but should still be good to go. I would rate the glass at 85 percent which is rock bottom. It is probably better than that, but I'm being tough on it considering its age. Included will be the ISM, a wireless remote that can be rail mounted, 2 pressure pads, and an adjustment card as well as a copy of the data sheet from its last evaluation. If you have any questions or would like to see a copy of the spec sheet from Insight, I will be happy to email you a copy. If we reach an agreement, I will need to see proof of service and will make no exceptions to this. 

This is an extremely rare item and finding one is not an easy thing to do. I am asking 1000 cash/trade. If you want trade plus cash scenario we can work something out. I am more than willing to drive to meet anyone. If you are out of state and MIL or LE, I will need to see an email from a .mil or similar email address to confirm you identity. I will only mail it directly to a military or similar mailing address.

Here is a link to the A4 ISM which is the only data I can locate on this module:

From Bladehq:
The EDC-1 is a fine collaboration between Emerson Knives and Multitasker Tools. It takes the best of both of these pioneering companies and delivers an excellent everyday carry tool. The EDC-1 has a Commander style D2 tool steel blade that is PVD coated and opens via Emerson's Wave Opener or with the help of a nail nick. However you open it, you'll be glad to hear the liner lock snap securely in place. The awl/scraper also sports a liner lock on the opposite side. The handle is stainless steel construction with G10 scales front and back. The front scale features a nested stainless steel prytool with bottle opener and 9 different sized hex wrenches. The EDC is as advertised, ready for everyday carry with a tip-up pocket clip.

Designed with input from a distinguished group of current and former professionals, the Patrol Rifle Optic incorporates many never before seen features to maximize this sight's performance within the challenging conditions faced by modern law enforcement. A hard-anodized 30mm tube was utilized, enclosing a high efficiency circuit that allows the sight to be turned on and left on for up to three years using a single battery.

The Aimpoint PRO Patrol Rifle Optic's front lens utilizes a unique band-pass coating, which allows the sight to be used with all generations of night vision devices. The modular QRP2 mount includes a removable spacer that indexes the sight at the optimal height for co-witness with the standard iron sights on patrol Carbine style weapons. This spacer can be removed to enable the use of the sight on police shotguns or sub-machine guns. The QRP2 mount for the PRO Optic also incorporates a torque-limiting twist knob that provides the optimal level of pressure on the rail while completely eliminating the possibility of over-tightening. Both the PRO Optic's front and rear lenses are recessed within the sight body to provide protection against impact damage, scratches, and fingerprints.

Flip covers are included to further protect the lenses, and a transparent rear lens cover is utilized allowing the user to engage a target with the lens covers closed in a emergency situation. A two Minute of Angle (2 MOA) red dot is utilized to allow maximum accuracy at all distances and under all environmental conditions.


Features:

- Always red - always on. Turn it on for up to 3 years using one single battery. No need to fumble with switches prior to use.
- 2 minute of angle red dot for accurate target engagement at all distances.
- In service date and battery change date reminders makes inventory tracking and maintenance easy.
- Enhanced speed on target and increased first shot hit probability when compared to iron sights and magnified scopes.
- Compatible with all generations of night vision devices and may be used with Aimpoint 3X Magnifiers and Concealed Engagement unit.
- Hard anodized aluminum alloy housing. Rugged enough for real world conditions and waterproof to 150 feet.
- Threaded front lens opening allows use of screw-in anti-reflection device (ARD).
- Front and rear flip covers keep lenses clean.
- Transparent rear flip cover allows use of the sight (with both eyes open) even with both covers closed in an emergency.
- Battery and adjustment cap retainer straps means you will never lose your pieces.
- Modular mount set up for use on flat-top patrol Carbine rifles. (Adapter available for carry handle mounting)
- Removable spacer. Remove for use on shotguns and sub-guns.
- QRP2 rail grabber mount. Snap knob three times for a perfect mount. Will not deform your rail like many other mounts.
- Recessed lens openings helps prevent against impact damage, fingerprints and scratches.

This is me and my boys, Devin and Mason. We live in Washington State. 

For the last 7 years the courts had granted me primary placement in Washington. During that time their biological mother has not seen them and has only had sporadic phone calls with them. She has not been a part of their life by her own choice. 

This week a judge in Winnebago County Wisconsin, Judge Barbara Key, refused to allow Washington to assume jurisdiction. Washington state would be a better authority to determine the best interests of the children because the kids and I have lived in WA for the last 7 years. She disregarded all testimony from my attorney, the Guardian ad litem, and the social worker, who all agreed that WA would be the better authority for further proceedings because it is their home state. Judge Key is not looking out for their best interests and instead is holding a personal vendetta against a man who loves and cares for his kids, a man who has cared for their every need, who has not asked for help from their biological mother in doing so. Judge Key is not looking out for these children's' best interests. She is only interested in removing them from a stable, happy household. She is acting in direct detriment to their safety and well being.

This is me and my boys, Devin and Mason. We live in Washington State. 

For the last 7 years the courts had granted me primary placement in Washington. During that time their biological mother has not seen them and has only had sporadic phone calls with them. She has not been a part of their life by her own choice. 

This week a judge in Winnebago County Wisconsin, Judge Barbara Key, refused to allow Washington to assume jurisdiction. Washington state would be a better authority to determine the best interests of the children because the kids and I have lived in WA for the last 7 years. She disregarded all testimony from my attorney, the Guardian ad litem, and the social worker, who all agreed that WA would be the better authority for further proceedings because it is their home state. Judge Key is not looking out for their best interests and instead is holding a personal vendetta against a man who loves and cares for his kids, a man who has cared for their every need, who has not asked for help from their biological mother in doing so. Judge Key is not looking out for these children's' best interests. She is only interested in removing them from a stable, happy household. She is acting in direct detriment to their safety and well being. 

Call or email Judge Key and ask her to decline jurisdiction. Ask her to allow Washington State to determine their best interests. Ask her to listen to the testimony of the people she appointed to the case.

Judge Key is not looking out for their best interests and instead is holding a personal vendetta against a man who loves and cares for his kids, a man who has cared for their every need, who has not asked for help from their biological mother in doing so. Judge Key is not looking out for these children's' best interests. She is only interested in removing them from a stable, happy household. She is acting in direct detriment to their safety and well being.

This is me and my boys, Devin and Mason. We live in Washington State. 

For the last 7 years the courts had granted me primary placement in Washington. During that time their biological mother has not seen them and has only had sporadic phone calls with them. She has not been a part of their life by her own choice. 

This week a judge in Winnebago County Wisconsin, Judge Barbara Key, refused to allow Washington to assume jurisdiction. Washington state would be a better authority to determine the best interests of the children because the kids and I have lived in WA for the last 7 years. She disregarded all testimony from my attorney, the Guardian ad litem, and the social worker, who all agreed that WA would be the better authority for further proceedings because it is their home state. Judge Key is not looking out for their best interests and instead is holding a personal vendetta against a man who loves and cares for his kids, a man who has cared for their every need, who has not asked for help from their biological mother in doing so. Judge Key is not looking out for these children's' best interests. She is only interested in removing them from a stable, happy household. She is acting in direct detriment to their safety and well being. 

Call or email Judge Key and ask her to decline jurisdiction. Ask her to allow Washington State to determine their best interests. Ask her to listen to the testimony of the people she appointed to the case.

For the last 7 years the courts had granted me primary placement in Washington. During that time their biological mother has not seen them and has only had sporadic phone calls with them. She has not been a part of their life by her own choice. 

This week a judge in Winnebago County Wisconsin, Judge Barbara Key, refused to allow Washington to assume jurisdiction. Washington state would be a better authority to determine the best interests of the children because the kids and I have lived in WA for the last 7 years. She disregarded all testimony from my attorney, the Guardian ad litem, and the social worker, who all agreed that WA would be the better authority for further proceedings because it is their home state. Judge Key is not looking out for their best interests and instead is holding a personal vendetta against a man who loves and cares for his kids, a man who has cared for their every need, who has not asked for help from their biological mother in doing so. Judge Key is not looking out for these children's' best interests. She is only interested in removing them from a stable, happy household. She is acting in direct detriment to their safety and well being. 

Call or email Judge Key and ask her to decline jurisdiction. Ask her to allow Washington State to determine their best interests. Ask her to listen to the testimony of the people she appointed to the case.

This is me and my boys, Devin and Mason. We live in Washington State. 

For the last 7 years the courts had granted me primary placement in Washington. During that time their biological mother has not seen them and has only had sporadic phone calls with them. She has not been a part of their life by her own choice. 

This week a judge in Winnebago County Wisconsin, Judge Barbara Key, refused to allow Washington to assume jurisdiction. Washington state would be a better authority to determine the best interests of the children because the kids and I have lived in WA for the last 7 years. She disregarded all testimony from my attorney, the Guardian ad litem, and the social worker, who all agreed that WA would be the better authority for further proceedings because it is their home state. Judge Key is not looking out for their best interests and instead is holding a personal vendetta against a man who loves and cares for his kids, a man who has cared for their every need, who has not asked for help from their biological mother in doing so. Judge Key is not looking out for these children's' best interests. She is only interested in removing them from a stable, happy household. She is acting in direct detriment to their safety and well being. 

Call or email Judge Key and ask her to decline jurisdiction. Ask her to allow Washington State to determine their best interests. Ask her to listen to the testimony of the people she appointed to the case.

This is me and my boys, Devin and Mason. We live in Washington State. 

For the last 7 years the courts had granted me primary placement in Washington. During that time their biological mother has not seen them and has only had sporadic phone calls with them. She has not been a part of their life by her own choice. 

This week a judge in Winnebago County Wisconsin, Judge Barbara Key, refused to allow Washington to assume jurisdiction. Washington state would be a better authority to determine the best interests of the children because the kids and I have lived in WA for the last 7 years. She disregarded all testimony from my attorney, the Guardian ad litem, and the social worker, who all agreed that WA would be the better authority for further proceedings because it is their home state. Judge Key is not looking out for their best interests and instead is holding a personal vendetta against a man who loves and cares for his kids, a man who has cared for their every need, who has not asked for help from their biological mother in doing so. Judge Key is not looking out for these children's' best interests. She is only interested in removing them from a stable, happy household. She is acting in direct detriment to their safety and well being. 

Call or email Judge Key and ask her to decline jurisdiction. Ask her to allow Washington State to determine their best interests. Ask her to listen to the testimony of the people she appointed to the case.
