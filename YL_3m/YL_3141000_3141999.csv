Wake County Firearms & Training Center Apex, NC

This class is designed for the person who has their CCH but has no (or little) formal handgun training. The student is carrying their handgun for personal protection and needs to hone their skills in order to improve both their familiarity and skills with their chosen pistol. The class was created with wide latitude allowing a broad range of skill levels to benefit from the class.

8 students (4 hours) Students need to be 18 years of age or older (Exceptions can be made with a parent or guardian attending)

This class is designed to teach the student the fundamentals of defensive pistol shooting.

The student is instructed in firearm safety, grip, sight alignment, stance, presentation, trigger control, target acquisition, & high and low ready position during the (1) one hour of classroom lecture. The class then moves to the indoor range for (3) three hours of live fire instruction.


Student Required to Bring:

Handgun
300-400 rounds of appropriate ammunition
Suitable holster of correct size and type (if unsure please inquire)
One (at least) spare magazine
Magazine holder
Shooting glasses
Range ears



This is a ""lost brass"" class. (Please choose ammunition accordingly)



The fundamentals of defensive shooting are taught from distances of (1) one to (25) yards utilizing a variety of targets. Call targets of different colors, shapes, and compositions are used in order to challenge the shooter regardless of skill level. We designed this class to give any shooter, which has completed their NC CCH, a series of exercises that will improve both skill and confidence. We designed this class to instill familiarity with the handgun. Once the student gains proficiency with the firearm he/she will no longer view the handgun with intrepidation and he/she will look forward to the range. Once the student becomes comfortable and self-assured the range time will become both enjoyable and productive. Upon completion of this class the student will no longer look at the handgun as a mystery but as a tool. When the barriers are removed the improvements in shooting ability will be prompt and natural. It is for this reason that the live fire exercises are designed to be both entertaining and fun. The student will improve her/his skills and gain a new confidence in both himself and her/his firearm of choice.

The class is kept to (8) eight students with (4) four instructors to ensure each student receives the applicable instruction.

Wake County Firearms & Training Center Apex, NC

This class is designed for the person who has their CCH but has no (or little) formal handgun training. The student is carrying their handgun for personal protection and needs to hone their skills in order to improve both their familiarity and skills with their chosen pistol. The class was created with wide latitude allowing a broad range of skill levels to benefit from the class.

8 students (4 hours) Students need to be 18 years of age or older (Exceptions can be made with a parent or guardian attending)

This class is designed to teach the student the fundamentals of defensive pistol shooting.

The student is instructed in firearm safety, grip, sight alignment, stance, presentation, trigger control, target acquisition, & high and low ready position during the (1) one hour of classroom lecture. The class then moves to the indoor range for (3) three hours of live fire instruction.


Student Required to Bring:

Handgun
300-400 rounds of appropriate ammunition
Suitable holster of correct size and type (if unsure please inquire)
One (at least) spare magazine
Magazine holder
Shooting glasses
Range ears



This is a ""lost brass"" class. (Please choose ammunition accordingly)



The fundamentals of defensive shooting are taught from distances of (1) one to (25) yards utilizing a variety of targets. Call targets of different colors, shapes, and compositions are used in order to challenge the shooter regardless of skill level. We designed this class to give any shooter, which has completed their NC CCH, a series of exercises that will improve both skill and confidence. We designed this class to instill familiarity with the handgun. Once the student gains proficiency with the firearm he/she will no longer view the handgun with intrepidation and he/she will look forward to the range. Once the student becomes comfortable and self-assured the range time will become both enjoyable and productive. Upon completion of this class the student will no longer look at the handgun as a mystery but as a tool. When the barriers are removed the improvements in shooting ability will be prompt and natural. It is for this reason that the live fire exercises are designed to be both entertaining and fun. The student will improve her/his skills and gain a new confidence in both himself and her/his firearm of choice.

The class is kept to (8) eight students with (4) four instructors to ensure each student receives the applicable instruction. Each student is assessed and then the live fire drills are adjusted to be commensurate with the student's abilities. This course is exciting, fast paced, and above all...FUN. Upon completion of the course each student will receive a certificate of completion and an ACCH grad T-shirt.

All offers are welcome and encouraged.

It had been pinned in an attempt to repair it. They made these with really soft wood and beat the crap out of them. It is M44 Spec, so will fit in a Russian M44 Stock or an aftermarket synthetic stock, or you can take a gamble and order a Chinese one and risk getting the same thing. I had planned to replace the stock with an M44. It's shootable as it is, but I'm not sure how accurate it would be. See my other ad's for additional ammo, a 91/30, and an M44.

Retails for $99. Below is the description from the manufactures website.

Whether you are carrying your rifle to the range or need to pack it in the field, this Voodoo Tactical brand padded weapons case is a terrific way to carry two long guns, two pistols and a great deal of related gear.
The 42-inch (40.5-inches inside) padded case from Voodoo Tactical safely holds just about any compact rifle or carbine. 

Inside are adjustable tie downs so that you can be sure your optics are not going to get knocked about. The attention to detail and heavy thick foam on all six sides is a welcome change from the standard nylon case. It even features additional padding to protect your muzzle and the zippers are tough enough to meet the demanding conditions required by the military and law enforcement.

Behind the pouches, there's a second compartment with two padded pouches built in. Each is designed to hold a pistol, but you could also use these for optics or other accessories.

This case comes with the three external pouches you see here, giving you plenty of storage space for magazines, boxes of ammo, cleaning kits, your log book and other accessories. The three exterior pouches have gussets, making them hold far more than you would think. The two outside pouches can hold five or six magazines and the center pouch is even larger.

This gun case features three carrying methods: A standard handle in center of the bag, a shoulder strap, and back-pack style shoulder harness. This backpack style carry is great for long distances. And if you use the PAL webbing to attach MOLLE or ALICE pouches, you can haul even more gear"

This gun was manufactured and purchased 20 Mach 1993. I bought this gun 13 July 2010. I have the receipt still in the box along with the original Freedom Arms paperwork

This freedom arms has very few rounds shots through it. I have shot it less then 50 rounds, and very few full factory loads, I shoot lighter hand loads. The only reason I am selling it I didn't like the 7.5 inch barrel, I bought the same gun with a 6 inch barrel. It has very minor scratches for a gun this old and one good scratch on the right side grip, see Photo 3.  I knocked the rough edges off but it is still visible, if I kept it I was going to get Rosewood Grips. The bore and cylinder are bright and shinny, ready for thousands of more rounds. I don't know why but folks are always looking for these older Freedom Arms because of some manufacturing differences.

More photos at request, $1900/cash.  Background check that will have to be performed at your FFL if local (shipping will be at buyers expense). 

NOT looking for any trades at this time. Unless you have a realistic trade price on your FNH FiveseveN 5.7x28 or Colt Python.

This is a bullpup style rifle that comes in 5.7x28mm.  The rifle has very few rounds fired as I've taken it out just twice but this lack of use and the need to slim my collection due to a growing family is the reason I'm letting this one go.  Included with the rifle are four 50-round magazines and 250 rounds of 5.7x28mm ammo.  Also included is a 1-4x illuminated scope and a Sightmark laser sight.  The scope is a quick flip 1-4x with a lever that allows the user to rapidly transition from 1x to 4x magnification.
With the 250 rounds of ammo and the 4 mags, this is roughly a $300 value, putting this basically new rifle at well below the price I had paid for it not long ago, which was roughly $1,600.
Thanks for looking and let me know if you have any questions."

Trading off my Glocks 22, 23, & 27. All are Gen 4, all have HM3 night sights, 4 lb Ghost trigger, titanium striker and plunger, pins, extended slide releases. All have factory hard cases, paperwork, factory parts and many magazines each. Most mags are new and unused, also have stick mags, all Glock factory. Extra range barrels with each, and 9mm conversion barrels for the 27 and 23, and an unused Glock spare factory barrel for the 23. A Streamlight TRL-1 with G22 pressure switch and many other parts not listed, tungsten recoil springs, titanium take downs and other parts I can remember . These are all extremely well maintained and have only light wear.  Also includes a Glockmiester sight pusher/remover set. I can include Blackhawk, Kholster, and Safariland holsters however many are left handed which is why I am not including them in the exchange set, but the reciever can have them if they want them. The Glock 23 and 27 both have conversion barrels, recoil springs, and four 9mm magazines to run them as G19 and G26 9mm automatics if needed. Conversion barrels, springs, and 9mm magazines have not been used. All after market barrels are Lone Wolf brand. All pistols and parts were purchased new and I am the original owner, I have all purchase receipts from gun shops and online vendors.

$2000 is an estimated price. 

Each Glock has a light and crisp 4lb trigger pull, all have been very well maintained and cleaned. They all have have less then 100 rounds fired per pistol and even then we're being used with range barrels most of the time. They were all purchased from early to late 2012, and the Meprolight night sights were purchased at the same time. They have light carry use only, and I only carried them when mandatory. I prefer either Beretta or M&P platforms and seldom used the Glocks. I would like to get rid of everything to one buyer/person who is interested rather than sell or trade each piece at a time or risk getting stuff with left over parts.

Email for details, serious trades only, all three Glocks are trading as a set.

If you are not man enough I might consider selling you another one of my collectible Mosins. I don't often put any of them up for sale but I have my eyes set on something else right now and wouldn't mind raising some funds.

I've included a picture of it beside another one of my Mosins for comparison.

We got our first batch of Republic Forge 1911's and they are a pretty amazing company. They are truly the only American made 1911 as they only use materials that themselves were made in the USA, and they spent way more money than everyone else to make sure every part and tool is American made as well. I personally know the owner and employees involved and am very excited for them. Here's an article and we have two digit serial number pistols in stock right now."

No, I'm not a promoter, just pissed I waited for nothing. I went to the link below and bought the one I wanted (new). That means some slap Dk didn't have a chance to screw something up (you know when he just took it out the box or shot like 2 rounds.) Prices range from $600 - $1000! Take your savings and get a decent ACOG or reflex sight. Anything larger is retarded.

Free labor on all future modifications FOR LIFE!

   The ""Skinny Essential"" middy got us thinking, it's a great way to get into an S13 gun with fairly basic furniture, that the user can upgrade later to his/her tastes. So why not take this idea further?

   Enter the Series13 MPC System. From stem to stern, this is pure Series13. Our premium cherry-picked forged receivers ensure a solid, no-wobble fit without the need for bandaid fixes like tensioning screws or ""wedge"" inserts. Our unstoppable SevereDuty BCG leads out to the finest 11595E certified barrel, and all components & controls are custom fitted for silky smooth operation, every time.

   For the MPC, future mods were kept in mind. Most importantly, we wanted to retain the structural integrity of the barrel if the user decides to upgrade to a free-float fore-end. This was achieved by the use of Armalite's rock solid clamp-on A2 FSB, which eliminates the need to drill into the barrel for taper pins. Along with this, our precise ""buried pin"" technique of pinning/welding muzzle devices (14.5"" barrels) allows us to carefully cut & drill the weld. We can remove & reinstall the M/D without damaging it or the barrel.

Free Upgrades For Life!

   Yes, really! Say you want to upgrade your MPC, maybe our 4lb trigger, or a full-length KeyMod rail? You'll get a discounted price on the parts, and the installation will always be 100% free of charge!

FOR LIFE.

   And no, there is no cut-off on what mods are accepted. You want to turn your 14.5"" middy MPC into a 20"" bull-barrel rifle? No problem, labor is on the house.

   Out of town? No problem! You cover the shipping, we'll cover the labor! This does not require an FFL transfer when you send it in for upgrades. We are the manufacturer. You can ship your gun to us for work, and we can ship it directly back to you. If the upgrades you want are to the upper or lower alone, you can send just these halves.

> Discounted price on parts
> NEVER any charge for installation
> Peace of mind knowing mods are done right
> Your Lifetime Warranty unaffected by modifications
> Warranty extends to all new components added
> Receive credit for your old parts!
