Included are the following:
- Elite Tactical Advantage - Tactical Safety   $24.99
- Nordic Components Magazine Tube 1 1/2 inch Extended Cap   $19.99
- Nordic Components Extended Magazine tube (adds two rounds and is a complete replacement     for the Mossberg Tube.)    $79.99
- Nordic Components 12 Gauge Shotgun Extension Tube Clamp   $30.35
- Nordic Components Speed Bolt Handle $26.99
- Nordic Components 12 Gauge Shotgun Follower $16.99
- Tac Star Side Saddle Shell Carrier, $26.99
The shotgun is broken in with approx. 300 rounds ran through it and it has the aligned front sight which had been a problem (sight blade canted) in the past. Photos show some ""scuffing"" on the front of the barrel due to sloppy install (on my part) of the extension tube clamp. Needless to say this gun will run as fast and reliably as you can pull the trigger. I used it primarily for 3 gun competition and home defense ..... it is a beast.

Shotgun retails at over $600 and I have over $200 additional into it. First $650 takes it."

Introducing the SIG556xi, rewriting the standard for modularity, reliability, and performance for the modern rifle platform. 

Based on the legendary SG 550, the SIG556xi will change the way military, law enforcement, and responsible citizens look at adaptable rifles. Utilizing the time-tested rotating bolt and adjustable gas piston operating system, the SIG556xi allows operators a choice of caliber, barrel length, handguard/stock configurations and lower receivers. 

A removable barrel allows the operator to select the necessary length for a given mission. Adding the appropriate bolt, the SIG556xi can be changed to any of three calibers, 5.56x45mm NATO, 300 Blackout, and 7.62x39mm NATO. Users can also quickly change out the non-serialized lower receiver, allowing the use of either AR-style STANAG magazines or rock-and-lock AK-style magazines. The SIG556xi upper receiver is the serialized part, making the lower an easy to purchase part. 

Polymer handguards accept all Magpul® light and rail kits, while the aluminum and carbon fiber handguards accept 2”, 4”, and 6” M1913 rails. Barrels are available in 10”, 14.5”, and 16”. Truly ambidextrous, the SIG556xi features an ambi safety selector, magazine release and user swappable charging handle (right- or left-handed). Optional receiver end plates allow for the use of either AR receiver extension tubes and buttstocks or M1913 compatible stocks"

THE BARREL!!
This is the nicest barrel I've EVER seen! Made exactly to my specs.
20"",416 r stainless steel,6 groove button rifled,1in8"" twist, .223 Wylde chambered , 11 degree crown hand lapped muzzle,heavy profile,and the most beautiful spiral fluting job on earth. This barrel alone is worth an average complete rifle.
As you may or may not know, 1-8 twist is better for slightly heavier bullets,say 62-75 grain,but due to the wylde chamber will do just fine shooting heavier or lighter rounds. The wylde chamber will take either .223 or 5.56 rounds.. 
I'm not trying to be an ass but,I'm not selling this rifle because I want to I'm doing it because I need to; therefore I don't want to trade,and won't even answer silly offers. I know firearm values and am an honest hard working guy. I may consider a quality used handgun and cash but there will be no trade only deals.
THERE WILL ONLY HAVE BEEN ABOUT 8-12 rounds down the barrel for the purpose of normal test fire and gas block adjustment.

This is a very stable and very comfortable stand, which I purchased due to the ability to quickly remove and reinstall the net seat. I had poacher issues and did not want them to be able to sit in my stand. This Roost model has a chain attachment whereas the new models have a nylon ratchet strap. I personally prefer the chain. A chain never gets old and needs to be replaced and critters can't succesfully chew on it. I did not even put it out/up during the 2013/14 deer season. Call Steve at REDACTED.

 The IMI Model A Semi Auto:
IMI produced a semi automatic version of the UZI that was imported into the United States by Action Arms. It had a 16.1"" barrel and a folding stock.

In 1983, IMI replaced the Model A with the Model B. The sights were the most noticeable difference but other small changes were also included.

I am selling this gun as is as a ""parts gun"".
When the original Enfield was modified they cut the bridge to add the pop-uo sight.
The bolt side of the bridge has come loose slightly.  The spring mechanism to hold the pop-up sight in position also appears to be broken.
I don't have the skills to correct either of these problems.

Asking $650.00 OBO. The rifle was built by Troy Sellers at IN RANGE, located in Kodak TN. To learn more about this company, visit http://www.inrangec2.com/ .

*Note: I will sell both the AK-74 and the AKARS Mount (other listing) for $700.00

The rifle is a 5.45x39mm AK-74 with a chrome lined bore (and piston if I'm not mistaken) built on a Bulgarian kit with ITM Arms receiver. It has OD Green U.S. made KVAR furniture and an upgraded Tapco G2 trigger group. All serial numbers are matching. The rifle is used, but in very good condition. The only major flaw it has, are a couple nicks in the pistol grip (bottom). It has an estimated 1,600 rds of 7N6 through it. You will be surprised just how accurate it is. I would compare it to my AR-15 1:7 with M855 62g ammo. With irons, I was hitting 20oz coke bottles at 125 meters with no effort. You will need to rezero it, due to it having 3rd party co-witness optics removed from the rifle. 

I am also including four OD green Tapco magazines and one Circle 10 magazine -- for a total of 5 mags. Also, I will include a Sportsman's Guide soft rifle case, a front sight tool and original trigger group. I can include 120rds of 7N6 ammo for an extra $10.

For a FTF sale, we will need to meet someplace public during broad daylight. Also, I will need to verify TN issued ID (handgun carry permit preferred). We will complete a bill of sale, signed by both parties. If you appear shady, or I don't feel comfortable -- I will halt the sale immediately."

USP COMPACT
The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing the most powerful cartridges in 9 mm, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, and .357 SIG (by special order). Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance.

USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.

Like their large frame predecessors, USP Compacts are designed with the demanding needs of the law enforcement and military shooters in mind. Using a modified linkless Browning-type action, the USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads.

To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds.

Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

Features & System Characteristics:
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Grooved target triggers
Polygonal bore profile for increased velocity, easier cleaning, and longer barrel life
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Specially designed captive recoil spring assembly with polymer absorber bushing
Choice of corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish or stainless steel slide
One piece machined slide made from nitro-carburized steel
No snag, bobbed hammer
Flared recurve trigger guard

Winchester Model 12

Often called the perfect repeater, Winchester’s Model 12 pump-action shotgun distinguished itself on game fields, trap and skeet ranges, and in both World Wars.

Winchester’s Model 12 slide-action shotgun has won the praise of hunters, competitors and soldiers alike during the 90 years and nearly 2 million pieces made since its 1912 introduction. Some of its fans have even gone so far as to agree with the company’s appellation of the gun as “the perfect repeater.”

The Model 12 was initially offered in 20 ga. only, which made it the first Winchester shotgun of that gauge and the first hammerless slide-action repeating shotgun to bear the Winchester logo. Two years after its introduction, it was available in both 12 ga. and 16 ga. The 12-ga. “trench” model with a 20-inch cylinder-bore barrel, perforated cooling sleeve and detachable knife bayonet was introduced in 1917. Without bayonet lug and cooling sleeve, it was listed in the Winchester catalog as the Model 12 Guard and Riot gun. A 28-ga. sporting version came on the market in 1934.

The gun’s basic mechanical layout—credited to design team chief Thomas Crossley Johnson in the company’s post-Browning partnership era—remained virtually unchanged throughout its life. It is of the old school, wherein the bolt locks up to a forged, machined, blued-steel receiver, and walnut serves for the buttstock and slide handle. Numerous machine operations, some complex in nature, were required to produce the receiver, and Winchester boasted that only the best steel alloys then available were used in the gun’s manufacture.

That quality at all costs approach eventually proved the Model 12’s downfall, however, as it collided with the reality of modern-day labor costs and manufacturing methods. Finally, in the late 1960s, the Model 12 was deemed too costly to keep in production. Attempts were later made to reduce its cost of manufacture, and limited sales of original-type guns were offered through the custom shop. By the early ’70s, though, the pump shotgun in general had lost much of its appeal, and the old warhorse was relegated to the heirloom and collectible sector of the market.

Nevertheless, the Model 12 remains beloved by tens of thousands of sportsmen who refuse to retire their “perfect repeaters” or think less of them.

Bike has blue under lighting along with battery tender. If you have any question please call.

853,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3277853,For Sale:  An AMERICAN TRUCK FOR AMERICANS! 1969 CHEVY C10 4X4,"Waukesha, Milwaukee, Wisconsin","$ 8,500","Listed On: Monday, July 14, 2014",Vehicles,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Up for sale I have a 1969 C10 4x4 that was built for Uncle Sam when the Cold War was on every American's mind, in every American's home and all over the evening news. This beast was designed by Americans who built the Atomic Bomb, built to support our troops, to resupply them in the heat of battle, and to power forward when lives and country are on the line. This truck was forged in the Heartland of America built from recycled tanks and bombers in a time when STEEL was on the road to not just protect you from an accident but survive and drive you home!
Luckily Former President Ronald Reagan ended the Cold War giving us civilians a chance to drive a beast meant for the heat of battle but tame enough for Americas roads.
It's a stick shift built for that farmboy drafted to be a soldier, one who knows his way around mighty machines that tear at the land and feed a hungry country. 
There is no rust or rot as both fear to even try to form, and with its all American STEEL body she's as straight as an Arrow shot from the bow of Geronimo himself.
Born with a 350 V8 there is NO fancy namby pamby computer crap or sensors to choke life from this mighty machine. Which means you can bust out those Craftsman's tools your beautiful wife/girlfriend bought you for Valentines Day as a symbol of love and wrench on her yourself!
Here's a little 411 directly from Chevy on the engine that beats under the hood of this monster:
The L-48 is the original 350 cu in (5.7 L), solely available for 1967 in the Super Sport version of Camaro SS 350 (1967-up) or Chevy II/Nova in '68-79. In '69 it was used in almost all car lines; Camaros, Impalas, El Caminos, Chevelles & Novas. 1969 L-48's use a Hyd Cam, 4bbl Quadrajet carburetor, cast pistons, 4-bolt main casting number 010 Blocks & casting number 041 or 186 heads. Power output was 300HP and 380 lb·ft (520 N·m) torque. Compression ratio was 10.25:1.
Now take a moment to soak all that information in... An engine so powerful that it powered other champions and still does half a century later! We're talking cars with pedigree's only Legend's can drive!
Tear down trees, rip houses from their foundations, cause your neighbor's Prius to spontaneously combust by merely passing him on the freeway. Did I say freeway! That's RIGHT son of Paul Bunyan, drive her on America's freeways and highways! Keeping her away from those commie states who take your hard earned American money.
This is an AMERICAN truck meant for AMERICANS! God fearing, steak eating, gun shooting warriors of the back woods! This is that EMP proof, bullet proof monster to get you out of dodge in! Taking family and gear to your bug out location and doing it in classic style!
Now it's hard to put a price on American muscle like this! But with a growing family I need to pass her on to another worthy red blooded American who can appreciate power. A man or woman able to control this beast and love it as much as I have.
If you think you measure up shoot me an email and I'll introduce you.

Many parts are included along with a bed mounted tool drawer to keep your tow chains, double-bit axe and bowie knife safe in any weather! And the final item that should push you over is a 100 amp alternator pulsating, feeding unimaginable power to your whim! This means you can put a winch on her or install off road lights or anything else your imagination can conjure up!

WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR! Americas roads needs you! Your honey do list can finally be completed!"

Small, compact, light weight and easy to chamber a round with a slide pull, this is a great conceal / carry gun. The pink can be changed out to any other color offered by Beretta for the Nano including black."
