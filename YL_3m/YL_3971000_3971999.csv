Upper & lower receivers are Olympic Arms. Barrel is a 24"" stainless fluted DPMS with target crown, 1:8 twist, 223 Remington chamber. Other parts: YHM 12"" customizable free float handguard, YHM bipod stud, Jard 2 lb adjustable single stage trigger, JP Rifles anti-walk trigger/hammer pins, Ace stock, Olympic Arms AC-4 pneumatic buffer, spare coil buffer spring & DPMS aluminum rifle buffer, DPMS target grip w/ palm shelf, DPMS lower parts kit, DPMS bolt carrier assembly, Badger extended charging handle, Rock River Winter trigger guard, and Accu-Wedge.

The rifle has been well maintained, cleaned after every use, and is extremely accurate even with a pretty basic scope on it. There are probably about 1500 rounds down the barrel, and it still consistently does 1/2 MOA or better particularly with handloads (I can pass along some of the load information I've been using with it too). Everything on the rifle is in very good condition, no real damage/scrapes/dings/etc. to speak of just a couple tiny nicks from use.

Scope is a BSA 8-32 1"" tube, side focus, mil-dot reticle, 44mm objective, and has some scuffs from mounting. The parallax/focus is off (yardage markings don't match measure yardage) but other than that it works great and keeps its zero. The mount is a generic aluminum 1-piece mount, has been lapped/accurized for a better mounting surface. 

The bipod is not included in the listed sale price. 

I'm selling this to finance another rifle build, so not looking for trades sorry!

We'll have to figure out shipping costs based on where you're at... so if you're interested let me know and I can research that end of things."

The magazine safety has been disconnected and I do not have the parts unfortunately.

This rifle has a BD date code. For those that don't know, the HK MR556 is a short stroke piston operated rifle built as a civilian version of the 416. The 416 is in use by Marines (IAR27) and by select special forces. It is an outstandingly clean operating system. It also has been upgraded with HK licensed Troy Micro flip-up front and rear sights($190). The sights give absolute 1-1 co-witness to the Aimpoint.  It has had the barrel re-profiled to the SOCOM profile by Jayson at IGF. He re-profiles and works on HK's for a living. His work is second to none. It also comes with a 14.5"" SS barrel custom made to fit the HK MR556 and 416, it has been Duracoated and includes a BCM flash hider with pin to lengthen it to 16"" overall. I bought the barrel for another upper but decided to let it go. The upper has a zero round count, while the lower has a 30 rounds or less count. I used it with my other upper to test the other uppers accuracy. I have a larger trigger guard on it but includes stock flat trigger guard. It has 7 HK High Reliability Magazines (2 I bought used and 5 never fired). It also has 5 HK polymer magazines. It comes with all the paperwork and hard case from HK. I will include the Vickers Padded Combat two point sling with quick release. The Aimpoint PRO is used but in perfect condition with box,spacer (not used as to give co-witness to the HK low profile sights), and paperwork. There is almost $500 worth of magazines at HK's price. The total of the barrel re-profile and nitriding (meloniting) is $340. The extra barrel (new), I put a value of $300 even though it cost more than that to have it made and include an extra barrel nut (not pictured). I also have an HK barrel nut tool that will fit HK's proprietary barrel nut. On a side note the barrel tab was removed by Jayson to allow either the MR556 or 416 BCGs to fit the upper, the 14.5"" barrel was made without the tab, so it will work with either also. I honestly am not looking to trade for anything. Please note that I will drive within a reasonable area to meet, but prefer to deal FTF. Must show ID, CCW or PPP to buy this. Sorry for the inconvenience, but better safe than sorry. Price is firm and not negotiable. Please no low ballers I really do not need to sell this and only thought I might as it is a safe queen, I have no problem keeping it as I have way more in it than my price. More photos are available of any and all parts of the rifle. Just email me and request photos. I can take close-ups of the BCG, barrel, sights, etc."

At one point in it's life it was converted into the Sporter style you see here today. I would say it was sporterized by a professional gunsmith in the 60's. When I received the rifle it needed some refinish work so I sanded and smoothed the barrel/receiver, cold blued them stripped/refinished stock, smooth out the bolt, etc... The bluing isn't perfect but I think it looks pretty good for what it is. The rifle action is flawless, smooth, has a very crisp and light trigger (about 1.5lbs). Everything works as it should (safety, takedown, etc.) Judging by the rifling and bore, the rifle has been shot very little. I have put roughly 200 rounds through it without a hitch. New sling installed as well. For the right deal/price I can also include roughly 100 rounds of ammo, 350 or so empty brass, a new set of Lee Ultimate Dies and a new cast mold.

""With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.

With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of
9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched
accuracy in a pistol its size.

Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An
ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. An extended seven-round
magazine will be available separately.

The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line, the P938 will be available in five configurations.

Blackwood: A natural stainless steel slide and black hard coat anodized alloy frame are paired
with Hogue Blackwood grips.""

This P938 is only a couple months old, almost new in box.  It has a couple hundred flawless rounds fired, mostly commercial reloads.  It has also been tested with 3-4 mags of Critical Defense 115 grain ammo.  Comes with two mags, Sig OWB holster, and box.  It is small enough for pocket carry.  Here is the gun being fired by my 10 year old son.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=id0N6UHyOEk&list=UUPKj5FIpuQ78fLCEwQ25PSQ

The new WITNESS PAVONA POLYMER PISTOL is compact, easy to load, easy to control and enjoyable to use. From its inception in the world famous Italian Valley of the Guns, the Witness Pavona offers a lightweight, ergonomic grip in a distinct, compact, smooth, sparkling polymer frame; with integral checkering and sculptured, contoured lines. Tanfoglio kept the traditional external hammer so when the hammer is cocked with the safety engaged, before slide movement, the hammer spring is depressed thus allowing the slide to move easier during loading. Tanfoglio engineers also fine-tuned the hammer and recoil springs to allow for smoother function in addition to adding unique slide-gripping areas to enhance the overall pistol function, feel and ease of use.

The 557.AR223 reflex sight is a lightweight, non-magnifying, optical sight designed for
Close Quarter Battle. It allows very fast target acquisition and engagement at short range while providing aiming capability out to 300 meters equal to or better than iron sights. The sight can, however, be used in conjunction with an L-3 Eotech Optical Magnifier. When an Optical Magnifier is used, the effective range is extended to 600 meters.

Runs flawlessly through rounds and shoots cheap/weak trap and skeet loads without a problem.  Absolutely no rust at all and beautiful wood in 9/10 condition.  I would compare the smoothness of the action to my Benelli (I actually like the feeding ramp much better than the Benelli).  These days its almost impossible to find any semiauto shotgun for under $700, selling because i inherited from a family member and already own a semi auto shotgun.  

please call or text anytime at REDACTED for any questions.  Price is slightly negotiable.  Face to face is prefered but FFL transfers are fine as long as you pay the fee.  You must be an Indiana resident.  Thanks for looking."

Quite frankly, I don't know what it is worth. These seem to range all over the place.

**UPDATE**
After talking to Southern Firearms Appraisals, I have changed the price from $550 to $800. They remembered this very gun because it came out of an estate in '99 with 6 other high end left handed bolt action rifles. It is supremely custom and rare."

My hands are too big for this concealed G29 package.  This is the 10mm powerhouse that is perfect for concealed carry or backup weapon for hunting. I don't seem to be able to handle this baby as I've had failures to eject, etc.  My buddy says I'm limp wristing. I sent it back to Glock for repair. They said they test fired 150 rounds without a single failure and politely said my grip is not strong enough (I have the return invoice). Gun is in pristine condition!  You can test fire first at Bass Pro in Grapevine before purchasing! She comes with the Glock case, two 10 round mags both of which have the newer followers, lock, spent case, cleaning tool and manual.  Im also including two Pearce Grips ($30 value) in addition to the factory base plates.  The G29 new is about $525 shipped.  Face to face only with proper ID.  CHL owners is preferred.

Please, no low-ball offers. I won't respond. I promise.

I am selling the Midwest Industries railed forend for AK-47 rifles, with 3 tops: the universal (as seen in the photos), the RMR, and the BF. Look on the Midwest Industries website to see which optics these are for.

Please note that this is the full-length rail. Not the shorter one.

I had this set mounted on an Arsenal 107FR, but I sold the rifle and the buyer only wanted the original furniture.

It fit snug with no wiggle or play.

It sat in the safe and only went to the range one time, so it looks like new.

I'm including the Blackhawk forward grip and sling loop, but I'm keeping the light and ladder rail covers.

I paid $145 + shipping from Midwest Industries for the lower rail and one top. Each additional top was $30 + shipping. I will ship the rail and all three tops for $160.   This is a very fair price for both of us.

Again, if it is still listed then I still have it, and yes, it is still for sale. I promise. You don't have to ask.

Handmade by James B. Lile.  Has sheath. Has case and belt clip.  This isn't a Dot or stamp knife.  It's scripted ' Handmade by James B. Lile '.  Unlike the guys who bought jimmylile website from Jimmy's wife who have nothing to do with jimmy and you can't even get them to tell you who actually made their ' so called ' Jimmy Lile knife,  Jimmy Lile himself made this one.  And unlike those when the romantics for Rambo die down people will want a Knife Jimmy Lile made himself.  Not a Dot knife they don't even know the man that made theirs, try it ask them.     The knives Jimmy himself made.....are very few and far between , and will appreciate in value at incredible rates.   Possibly even fund your retirement if you buy early enough.  
Ronald Reagan had Jimmy visit his Chateau, he had him make him a Folding Lile Knife.  Jimmy gave it to him and The President responded by giving him a Silver Medallion of the 40th presidential seal of the United States.  And giving his wife Marilyn the same in two cuff links. In 1971, Lile became a full-time knifemaker and was known as ""Gentleman Lile"" or ""The Arkansas Knifemaker"". He was particularly known for his Survival knife designs known as ""The Mission"" series, created by request for Sylvester Stallone to use in his first two Rambo movies. These designs would go on to influence other knife makers in the 1980s. In addition to creating the Rambo knives, Lile designed and made several Bowie knives that he presented to Governor Bill Clinton and U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon, and Gerald R. Ford, Jr. Other owners of his work included John Wayne, Peter Fonda, Fess Parker, Bo Derek, and Johnny Cash
And everyone knows Slyvester Stallone had him make the Rambo knife in which he uses In the Rambo Movie.  

President Clinton talks Jimmy Lile
https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tJY-c-YJbE?autoplay=1

The website for him does not in anyway have any connection with Jimmy.  They bought the rights to his name.   They can't even tell you which of THEIR smiths made what knife.  Knives Jimmy actually made himself engraved Handmade By James B. Lile in his signature are few.  He died in '91 and they grower fewer with each year passing and appreciate in value, especially when the Rambo knives lose their romantics.    He the most famous knife maker in the world .

Converted Saiga .223. Gun is in good shape aside from a few small dings. Definitely not a wall piece. Has had less than 200 rounds through it since I bought it, and has been my project SHTF gun for some time. I have about 600$ in it (conversion, quad rail, etc.) on top of buying it new for 575$.

It fires accurately and cycles perfectly. The only problems are the need for a new gas tube retaining lever (currently a machine bolt with a lock washer and nut, the original was removed for a dog leg dust cover rail), a paint job (to look new and cover the spot on the underside of the receiver where the plate was removed for conversion), and lack of irons (it uses forward mounted optics on the gas tube rail, but I do have a rear peep sight, never got around to adding the bolt on gas block/front site). None of these problems are serious or impact the functionality of the rifle, but they are worth mentioning.

600$ as is. Comes with everything pictured in the first photo (polymer Galil mag and long eye relief scout scope.)"

If you don’t know about this rifle, it is the result of a collaboration between SIG and Beretta. It is piston operated and is extraordinarily well built. The integral bipod (rare) is included. Beautiful bore and internals. The gas shutoff and folding sights for launching grenades are operable. 

This particular rifle was professionally built from original Italian parts by Matt Yeamans, aka turbothis, a well-known builder of high quality AK’s and Berettas. The fire control group is dedicated semi-auto and it would be impossible to convert this back to full auto. After the build, the receiver was engraved (not by Matt) with period correct markings that match the serial number on the top of the receiver. It functions flawlessly. It was professionally cerakoted in a gloss black that matches the original finish. The bolt carrier was cerakoted with their special slippery coating.

No expense was spared in getting the rifle to 922r compliance. It wears very nicely adapted (US-made) handguard and pistol grip from a SIG 556. The folding stock is US made, and the rifle comes with two complete cerakoted 30-round magazines. The adapter for the folding stock is one-of-a-kind (y’all can copy it) that is cerakoted too. One of the magazines has a modified Magpul follower, spring, and US made floorplate. The flash hider was made in the US by Matt. All original furniture and flash hider are included in the sale."

The return spring is also located around the same support tube which is concealed by an enlarged polymer handguard. The MKA 1919 barrel can be quickly removed from upper receiver. To charge the rifle, the charging handle on the receiver must be pulled. The upper receiver is manufactured from an aluminum alloy while the lower receiver, along with pistol grip and shoulder stock, is manufactured as one piece from impact-resistant polymer. Akdal MKA 1919 semi-automatic rifle has a 5 round detachable box magazine. It has a bolt release identical in location and function to the one on the M16. Manual safety also duplicates M16-style being located on the left side of the receiver above the pistol grip.[1] Standard sights include a front post installed on the M16-style removable base and a detachable M16A2-style carrying handle with built-in diopter sight. On the upper receiver, an integral Picatinny rail exists which will accept detachable carrying handle or optional red-dot or other optical sight attachments."
