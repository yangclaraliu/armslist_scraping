VLTOR MUR Modular Upper Receiver w/ Bolt Assist and Deflector - FDE- - 3 available  - $205

The Modular Upper Receiver (MUR) is a rigid MilSpec flat-top upper receiver made to fit all AR15/M16/M4 rifles and carbines. The MUR was developed to give the customer a MilSpec correct upper receiver with a thicker wall, making the MUR upper receiver a stronger platform. This more rigid upper receiver will increase accuracy and reliability, while extending the life of the interfacing components, such as the bolt carrier group and barrel assembly.

The main benefit of the MUR is that it is dimensionally correct. Vltor ensures reliability and accuracy of our production process by using precision machining equipment, thorough quality control inspections, and a 100% final check of all critical dimensions. When you own a Vltor MUR, you have the highest quality upper receiver available on the market today.

The MUR is made from a 7075 aircraft-grade aluminum forging. Prior to machining, the forging is fully stress relieved, heat treated, aged twice and undergoes a proprietary cryogenic treatment. The MUR is precision machined and each part finished by hand. There is not a better upper receiver available"

The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle and extended latches feature internal redesigns to direct the force off of the roll pin and into the body of the charging handle during support hand only manipulations. This new design has a built in backstop engineered into the extended latch and into the charging handle. As the latch is opened up, its’ travel is limited by these flat surface backstops. With this travel limiting feature, the stress is taken off the roll pin, and is now redirected into the entire body of the charging handle.

The BCMGUNFIGHTER™ Charging Handle offers two significant advantages.

1. Since the tiny roll pin is no longer the weak point - it is a much stronger system and tactical latch will stay intact even under repeated support side only manipulation.

2. With the force kept inside the body of the handle, when the handle is pulled directly to the rear, it moves directly to the rear and does not angle off to the outboard side."

KY 40403, Lexington, Kentucky",$ 150,"Listed On: Sunday, August 17, 2014",Archery,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I had heart surgery and it has left me with a lot of restrictions. Because of this I'm selling a lot of my hunting items / equipment, etc. I know you don't care about this, I just wanted everyone to know the 
reason I'm selling these items.

I have an Indian (Archery) -- Stalker compound bow for sale. This is a right hand bow (hold in your left hand and draw the arrow back with your right hand.

This bow has an adjustable draw weight of 45, 50 & 55 lbs. (This can be done without a bow press). 
Draw weight is adjusted by turning the limb bolts in or out to align the marks on the limb with the marks on the bow...   

This is older and it does have some scratches, but overall it seems to be a good, solid bow. 

I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING IT INTO A BOWFISHING BOW, so it has nocking points and a new roller rest.

Also included is a Browning ""tape on ""fishing reel"" (all metal no plastic), the line on the reel has never 
been in water, and there is about half a spool of line left (kind of forgot the poundage on the line, but its ether 100 or 120 lb. test)... There is also a pair of leather gloves so you don't get string burning and comes with 5 fishing arrows.

I used to make my on fishing arrows from the solid fiberglass rods Lowe's, Home depot, etc. sales as drive way stakes. There is a 5 inch reflective section at one end (I put my nocs on this end).

Nocs have been installed but I only had two tips left, they have been glued on but that's all! (I usually drill and install a 3/16 roll pin through the tip) 

The bow, arrows, reel and gloves fit in a hard plastic Contico caring case.

Asking $150.00

I’ve had a couple of questions and I do apologize for forgetting it in original ad!
These solid fiberglass shafts were 48” long when bought, with a 5 inch long reflective sticker around one end. They have been cut down to 32 inches before adding noc and tip. The shafts are 5/16 in diameter (at least the tips and nocs were made for A 5 / 16 shaft and they fit), I usually make my own, but I assume a safety slide made for a 5/16 arrow will fit.

I have a few 357s anyway, so I guess I should have thought about it before I bought it.  Anyway, I paid $650 for it,( Not including tax ), and offering $500 for the sale.  Losing $200 on the sale, but I need a higher cap 9mm for "" conceal carry,"" ASAP.  I've decided to give my 40 cal "" Conceal Carry "" pistols a rest for a while.  The GP100 has all paperwork, box, locks, and a mixture of "" Critical Def/Hornady rounds."" ( 125/158 grain ).  If you have a 40 pistol, I will also throw in a box of Rem. 165 gr Golden Sabre HPs in the deal.  Thanks for looking.  Hope to hear from ya.

Because of this I’m selling a lot of my hunting items / equipment, etc. I know you don’t care about this, I just wanted everyone to know the reason I’m selling these items.

Because of the restrictions mention above I had to sale all my 60 and 70 lb. draw bows and get ones capable of 50 lbs. or less. This is a bow I traded for.

It is High Country American – Supreme LT... Compound bow, the bow is right handed (hold in your left hand and draw the arrow back with your right hand), both draw weight (25 to 80lbs) and draw length (23 to 33) is adjustable. Good deal!        

It is a good looking bow and seem to be a good, solid bow, but once I got it home I discovered that the string is missing. Also a couple of small E clips are missing (see photos). Could be other parts missing, but this is the way I bought it and the way I’m selling it.
The guy at the archery shop said a string would be $60.00 to install a new string!  
Being disables now plus not knowing if I’ll be able to hunt again or not, I just cannot justify putting that much money into this bow. Maybe someone out there can fix it or use it for parts.

 With the bow there is a camo soft case made by Kolpin, to carry & store the bow. They are asking $30.00 and up for these cases.

I’m asking $50.00 for the bow and soft case.  Thanks

Selling a complete drum kit, everything you need to play and impress. This is a 7 piece MAPLE kit with cymbals, hardware, throne, and top of the line double bass pedals. With free floating toms, the sound from these drums is simply amazing. I haven't had the time to play them since getting a new job, and moving into a smaller place means I won't have the room for them anymore.

Included:
7 Piece PDP X7 Maple Kit (originally over $1100)
2 floor toms, 3 tom toms, bass drum and snare.
Yamaha hi hat stand
Standard throne
AXIS Longboard Double Bass Pedal (originally over $500)
Various Cymbals - Ranging from very high quality, to middle ground. Can include older cymbals, too.
8 or 9 Cymbal Stands

This is a fairly large kit with many elements. The pictures are just to show off the drums...I didn't have the time to setup every cymbal stand and cymbal to snap the pics. The smallest tom is made to float on a cymbal stand, but just have it hanging in the middle for the pics. The shells are maple and in good condition. They have a nice looking finish on them. I can't really estimate the value of all the cymbals, but considering a few cost over $300 new each, there is a lot of value in them as well.

Excellent scope, just don't need it. Prefer iron sights. My lose is your gain. 
Look them up on Yourube. Excellent reviews !

The Burris AR-332 is perfect for quick shooting at point-blank to intermediate ranges. 3X magnification plus the Ballistic CQ reticle provide for instinctive target acquisition. The black reticle is etched directly onto the prism with red and green light illumination available with the turn of a dial. Reticle dots correspond to bullet drop from 5.56 or 7.62 rounds, however this tough optic is built to handle much heavier recoil if needed.

The AR-332 is designed for reliability under harsh use, with hand-fitted internals and exacting tolerances. The Burris Forever Warranty protects you and your optic from anything you can throw at it."

The blade is satin finished stainless steel.

The firing button is aluminum and is mounted on the side making it slim and easy to carry. The knife doesn't need a safety since the button requires some force to fire the blade. The pocket clip is mounted on the back right.

>>>>>> ******If this ad is still on Armslist, the knife is still available for sale.******<<<<<

I bought this knife at the Denver Gun Show over 2 years. I carried it for a while but only use it to cut open the tape on boxes.

This is heavy duty construction with 6 very small torx screws holding it together, and a steel pocket clip with 2 larger alloy torx screws holding it to the knife for easy access when needed.

All you need to do is slide the lever on the side to open & close it opens and closes very fast, so please use with caution.

This knife is approximately 4 & 5/8"" long closed, 1/2"" thick, 1"" wide, the blade is 3 & 3/8"" long with a weight of 3.9 ounces, with the pocket clip, this is a heaver than the plastic knifes but it will last years longer.

This knife could save your life if you find yourself in a dangerous situation in our dally activities, especially at night.
