The name says it all.

I lowered the price to 900 which is way low. New this was 1200 and tax
Bought in July this year. Have used it very little. 

There are none of these currently on gunbroker and none of these on completed listings on gunbroker. There are none of these on gunsamerica selling as used. There are new ones these are not with the black houge stock but laminated. 

Mine is most likely one of the very very few available anywhere in the USA as i looked all over the USA looking for this.
So if you have been wanting one for a safe queen or a gift or just as a sweetheart for yourself. be quick. I reserve the right and have been known to be whimsical to change my mind if I am unable to find the other item i am wanting the funds from this to get today.


Interests email me an offer and cell number.  I am just beginning the find a home process but already have it available as a trade in also. 

This is the same .22 LR that was used on top shot season. The rifle is like new with hard shell case. These are very difficult to find or get as they make few of these and the lead time on these can be as much as a year.

if you have ever wanted one of these here is your chance to save tax and and dollars  which makes it a very good value for this.

ask questiions if needed. I am available for voice call and stuff. This is a large purchase so your total happiness is important. I have bought and sold many things here and have a 100 percent happiness rating.


selling to fund another project today or soon. Depends on availability of other item when this is done.

I feel more comfortable carrying my Sig 938 so I decided to sell this holster after wearing it twice. This holster is a step forward in holster design. Whether you are a first time CCW or have carried for years, the Solo can offer options and carry positions that no other hybrid holster can.
Because of the user adjustable cant and the small footprint of the holster, the Solo can be worn anywhere from cross draw to MOB. 
◦Built for a lifetime of use the Solo is double stitched for durability and beauty.
◦Due to the unique molding of the front, one handed reholstering is attainable.
◦The composite back on the Solo makes for unexcelled comfort. The suede, neoprene, and Hermann Oak leather provides the perfect barrier between the pistol and you.
◦Uses our Silent Thunder IWB Clips (Standard, Slimline, J Hook, V Clip, HD Clip or Belt Loop Clip) or the Silent Thunder IWB Tuckable Loops.
◦The single mount system combined with the suede backing provides for rock solid stability while maintaining an easy on/easy off capability

The Ishapore rifles use the exact same action and detachable mag design as the Lee-Enfield, but are chambered in the easy to find .308 cartridge.

Rifle comes with B-square scope mount and Simmons 4x long eye relief scope.  I bought the rifle with the scope mount on it and unfortunately it didn't come with the original rear sights, bayonet, or anything else.

Its a nice setup and the most accurate rifle I own but I have too many bolt action guns and am wanting to sell this one for somethig different.  I only have about 50 rounds through it and I don't think it had ever been fired bedore I got it, or at least not since it was converted by Gibbs.  The feed lips on the magazine need to be adjusted a little more since it can be a little finicky when feeding from the left side of the magazine.

Rifle, scope, sling, 2 clips.

A previously hunted gun that has been collecting dust for a few years.  I grabbed it from the gun case the other day and ran three kinds of ammo through. Federal factory 165gr BTSP and one of my pet loads using 165gr sierra BTSP both just under an inch at 100yds.  Pretty good for basic loadings (as usual tailored hand loads will give the best results; I haven’t done any load development with this gun though).  Its freshly cleaned.

Scope is decent for its vintage and holds a zero fine; the top turret cap can pop off but can just get taped down if you want to run this scope in the field."

Henry H004M Golden Boy Lever 22 Mag (WMR) 20.5"" 12+1 American Walnut Stk Blued

Whether you choose one chambered for .22 LR, .22 Magnum, or .17HMR, the
Henry Golden Boy is a masterpiece of fine crafted gunsmithing. Any shooting
enthusiast who closely examines one is immediately impressed with the
excellent fit, finish and overall visually elegant design. The Golden Boy
has a 20-inch blued octagonal barrel, American walnut stock, brass
buttplate, with a gleaming Brasslite receiver and barrel band. The classic
styling will transport you back to the wild and wooley days of America's
Old West, when company founder Benjamin Tyler Henry designed the original
Henry lever action rifle. Adding to the historic authenticity is the
adjustable buckhorn-type rear sight. Small game hunters and plinkers will
appreciate its substantial 6.75 lb. heft. It balances well and makes for
highly accurate offhand shooting. The smooth action associated with Henry
rifles opens and shuts with the effortless slickness, and left-handed
shooters can safely use any of Henry's lever action rifles.

413,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3581413,"For Sale:  Buffalo Bore Ammo - 9X18 Makarov +P Ammo - 115 gr.

Our introduction of a ""heavy bullet for cartridge"" 9X18 Makarov +P loading is the sole result of numerous customer requests.  With millions of these pistols now on American soil and no +P heavy loadings available, this cartridge and the many pistol owners are suffering from the lack of serious fight stopping ammunition.  This load is 20grs. heavier and 100 fps faster than standard 9X18 ammo.

This loading features a flash suppressed powder, so if you need to shoot in low light, you won't be blinded by your own gun fire and this is a useful tactical advantage since around 95% of all civilian shootings in the US happen in low light while the criminal element is out and about.  Our use of a hard cast bullet, with a flat nose, can best be understood if you'll read our technical article on ""The Use of Expanding Bullets in Small Defensive Cartridges,"" posted under the ""Technical Articles"" category on our home page.

Further, please note that the use of hard cast bullets (not lead but, Hard Cast) does NOT cause lead fouling in the polygonal rifling's used in all 9X18 Makarov pistols.  For more information, please see our technical articles entitled ""Hard Cast Bullets in Polygonal Barrels"" and ""Dangers of Pure Lead Cowboy Bullets"". We found no appreciable leading in any of our Makarov test guns. It should also be noted that all of our test guns functioned and fed flawlessly with this load. We also experienced very good to excellent accuracy in all test guns.

Please note the real world velocities listed below from real world 9X18 Makarov pistols. At Buffalo Bore we always use real, ‘over-the-counter’ firearms for our published velocities, as we feel the use of laboratory test barrels that give false, high velocities does the customer a disservice as each customer needs to know what their carry ammo will really do on-the-street in a real world situation.

MAIN PACK FEATURES:

•  United States Marine Corps Issue
•  Digital Woodland MARPAT
OVER 4500 CUBIC INCHES!
CURRENTLY ISSUED BY THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS!
TAN BUCKLES WITH TAN TRIM


The Idea of ILBE is to More Easily Configure the Pack for the Mission at Hand and to Maximize the Mobility, Survivability, and Lethality of the Marine in Combat Environments. The Feature Mentioned above, that is the Ability to Carry Heavy Equipment in the External Pack, is Augmented with the Ability to Carry 120 Pounds as Required in Intense Operations. Yet the Pack Itself Must not be Bulky, No Larger than 6000 cubic inches. This would include a 4500 cubic inch main rucksack and a 1500 cubic inch assault pack (not included) along with 100 ounces of liquid (not included).


FEATURES OF THE ILBE MAIN PACK

The ILBE Pack (Improved Load Bearing Equipment) was designed by Arc’Teryx and manufactured by Propper international for the US Marines, to provide a durable and lightweight means of transporting clothing and equipment.  The Gen II pack has the coyote brown padding and buckles, and is produced in the Digital Woodland Camo Marine Pattern. (MARPAT)
The ILBE Pack is designed to carry a load of up to 120lbs and distributes the weight for maximum comfort. The key feature to the pack's comfort is its internal frame with 2 metal ribs on the outer sides and 2 larger spars in the middle. The spars are already shaped to fit most people’s backs but can be custom bent if needed.
The pack has soft padding against the carriers back, on the hip belt, and shoulder straps. The wide hip belt displaces the weight around the body evenly. The shoulder straps can be adjusted to custom fit the body and the sternum strap can be raised or lowered to fit both men and women.
Four compression straps on each side can be adjusted for different size loads to keep your gear in place throughout your hike. Lower pockets on each side of the pack make nice rests when carrying longer items, or hold extra water bottles.  Heavy duty zippers on both sides allow access to your gear in the main compartment.
The back  and sides of the pack have several sewn on strips of webbing allowing the ability to customize your pack with MOLLE accessories, and a compartment to hold a hydration system. When not in use, it can be rolled down and snapped in place.
The main compartment is protected by a corded dust cover which can also be clipped closed. The lid covers the dust cover, provides rain protection, has a zippered compartment and additional MOLLE webbing. The main compartment has provision for a radio pouch, and a center flap which can be used to separate it into upper and lower halves. With the zippers on both sides you are still able to access the bottom without pulling everything out from the top.

DuraCoat Firearms Finishes FAQ

As an average gun owner, can I properly apply DuraCoat products without training? 
Absolutely! DuraCoat is extremely easy to apply. Anyone can do it. DuraCoat was designed for the average gun owner. Preheating, baking and blasting are not required. Expensive, space consuming equipment is not needed. Simply clean and degrease the surface prior to application.

How durable is DuraCoat? 
DuraCoat is permanent. With normal use, a firearm finished with DuraCoat will last several lifetimes.

What is DuraCoat? 
DuraCoat is a two part chemical coating. Unlike other firearm finishes, DuraCoat was created specifically for firearms. Other firearm finishes are ""spin-off's"" from other industries.

Is DuraCoat Teflon based? 
No. Teflon is a lubricating coating which is great for internals, but will not wear as well as DuraCoat on the exterior surface of a firearm. DuraCoat's combination of elasticity and hardness creates a finish impervious to impact, scratching and the elements. Some users say DuraCoat displays some lubricating qualities, but this phenomenon was never intended when DuraCoat was created.

Do I have to be a certified finisher to purchase DuraCoat products? 
Absolutely not! DuraCoat can be purchased by anyone. DuraCoat was designed for gun owners with little or no firearm finishing skills.

How do I apply DuraCoat? 
DuraCoat can be applied by airbrush, conventional spray gun, or HVLP spray gun.

Can DuraCoat be brushed on? 
No, absolutely not. DuraCoat is for spray application only.

Will DuraCoat adhere to hard coat anodizing and Parkerizing? 
DuraCoat loves hard coat anodizing and Parkerizing as a base. Both processes leave a good rooting surface for DuraCoat.

How much DuraCoat is needed to finish one rifle? 
A 4 oz. container of DuraCoat will coat 1-2 long guns or 2-4 handguns.

Do I need a special degreaser? 
Yes. Some degreasers, especially those used in the automotive industry, can leave a residue. This residue will form a barrier between the surface and DuraCoat causing a coating failure. We manufacture TruStrip degreaser solely for the firearms industry. TruStrip is capable of cleaning the contaminates commonly found on and in firearms and will not leave a residue.

Do I need a special solvent to clean my airbrush or spray gun? 
Lacquer thinner will work, but clean your equipment with DuraCoat reducer occasionally. This will keep your airbrush or spray gun in top working condition.

Is reducing DuraCoat required? 
Depending on your spray equipment, spray technique, climate and environment your DuraCoat may or may not need reducing. If your DuraCoat does not lay down smooth on the surface of your firearm, it most likely needs to be reduced. Always have some DuraCoat Reducer on hand as it may be required on given days due to weather conditions. DuraCoat Retarder Reducer cures problems normally occurring in high humidity weather. One of these high humidity problems called ""blushing"" makes the DuraCoat appear cloudy. Another called ""dry spray"" occurs when some of the DuraCoat dries before it reaches the firearm and causes a rough or dusty surface.

Can I blend DuraCoat colors together? 
Yes. All DuraCoat colors can be intermixed. With a handful of stock DuraCoat colors, you can create an infinite number of colors by blending them.

When is DuraCoat fully cured? 
DuraCoat is dry to the touch in 20 minutes, can be handled in 1 hour and is ready for use overnight. Although DuraCoat will gain most of its final hardness, elasticity and chemical resistance over a 4-6 week period, time will continue to enhance DuraCoat's characteristics over a lifetime. DuraCoat, like fine wine, gets better with age. As we say, ""DuraCoat wears in, not out.""

How do I apply DuraCoat to wood? 
Degrease and lightly sand wood surfaces. Use DuraFil to remove any scratches and dings, then apply DuraCoat. Allow to dry overnight. Do not bake.

I hunt along saltwater. Will DuraCoat withstand the salty environment? 
Certainly. DuraCoat is well suited for salty environments. One of DuraCoat's attributes is its extreme ability to resist salt corrosion. A firearm coated with DuraCoat simply will not rust...EVER!

What is the shelf life of DuraCoat? 
The shelf life of DuraCoat is 12-18 months if properly sealed and stored in a cool, dark place. The shelf life of DuraCoat hardener is 6 months, but can be extended by sealing it in a zip lock bag and placing it in a refrigerator.

Will DuraCoat burn off my barrel? 
DuraCoat can withstand temperatures as high has 500-600 degrees F. With ""normal"" shooting, your barrel will never get close to being that hot. If you are fortunate enough to own a transferable machine gun, or if you like to ""blaze"" with your semi-auto, do not put DuraCoat on your barrel, as your barrel temperature will rise to over 1,000 degrees F. In those cases, use DuraHeat. Our DuraHeat coating can handle temperatures up to 1,800 degrees F.

How easy is DuraCoat removed? 
Not easy at all. The elastic nature of DuraCoat resists blasting. A qualified individual, with the proper blast media, can safely remove DuraCoat without damaging the surface of the firearm. Be careful. In most cases, we recommend lightly blasting the surface, being cautious not to remove any DuraCoat. Just ""beat up"" the DuraCoat giving it ""tooth"" so your new application of DuraCoat has something to adhere to.

Which is more durable, DuraCoat or DuraBake? 
Both DuraCoat and DuraBake are extremely durable. The advantage of DuraBake is its availability in a convenient aerosol can. The advantage of DuraCoat is it does not have to be baked and is available in an incredible number of colors."

**** SOLD PENDING FUNDS **** Offered for your consideration is a very unique and interesting little .22 caliber rifle. It is a Harrington & Richardson model 760 single shot, “semi-auto”. Manufactured from 1965 until 1970, the H&R Model 760 was very innovative for its time. To operate, the bolt is pulled all of the way rearwards using the bolt handle. Next a cartridge is manually inserted into the chamber and the bolt pushed all of the way forward into battery using the same bolt handle. The safety is located on the left side of the receiver, and when in the fire position, and when the rifle is fired, the bolt will disengage, and using the power of the fired round, will open the action in order that the empty shell casing may be manually removed. 
This H&R Model 760 is in absolute excellent condition showing almost no signs of usage. It would make an excellent “first” .22 rifle for a beginning shooter, and would greatly enhance a collection of Harrington & Richardson .22 caliber rifles. Additional pictures upon request.

Has scope rings.  If you know about Marlins you know that this gun was obviously made by Marlin, not Remington.  Has no alpha letter after the 336, does have JM on the barrel.  All of these Marlins that have a numeric serial number after 1973 are easy to figure mfg. date.  Subtract the first two numbers from 100 (this one starts with 18) thus the mfg. date is 1982.  This was the gun that Marlin came out with after the 30-30 because it filled the void between the 30-30 and bigger caliber cartridges.  With the new Hornady Lever action ammo the out of the barrel fps increases from 2100 to 2300.  Won't give this gun away but am interested in a trade more than outright sale.

From Remington:
Overview:

We created an unrivaled combination of precision accuracy, blazing-fast follow-ups and hunt-specific features. The new R-15 VTR™ modular repeating rifle was born of the most advanced design aspects of AR-15-style rifles available today with a strong emphasis on optimizing form and functionality for the modern predator aficionado. The results are astounding – with very serious implications for every coyote, fox or bobcat that crosses its path.

For peak accuracy, the R-15’s 0.680"" OD barrel is precision-crafted from ChroMoly steel. It’s free-floated within the machined-aluminum fore-end tube and given a recessed hunting crown to ensure gasses escape evenly around the bullet for the ultimate in shot-to-shot consistency. Six longitudinal flutes forward of the gas block promote rapid barrel cooling and increase rigidity while reducing weight, further contributing to this rifle’s ability to print tiny clusters at an incredible pace.

And our new hunting single-stage trigger design is as cleanbreaking as they come. Whether you choose the 223 Remington or 204 Ruger version, the semi-automatic gas action all but eliminates muzzle jump and recoil so your target remains in the crosshairs. And when it’s time to add optics, the receiver-length Picatinny rail makes it a rock-solid cinch.

Control comes naturally with the ergonomic pistol grip and lightweight overall design of the R-15. Its uppers and lowers are machined from aluminum forgings for featherweight durability, and the fore-end tube is drilled and tapped for accessory rails. This new family of firearms consists of three models. Each was designed with input from leading predator authorities and decked in the ultra-effective Advantage® MAX-1 HD™ camouflage to blend with sage, open country and a multitude of hunting terrains. All come with five-round magazines and are compatible with all aftermarket AR-15 magazines and other accessories.

The R-15 VTR Predator Rifle has a 22"" barrel with a fixed stock and pistol grip. At 7 3/4 lbs, it’s extremely stable – the best choice for long shots. Our R-15 VTR Predator Carbine and R-15 Predator Carbine CS* (Collapsible Stock) handle like lightning with their 18"" barrels and weigh a mere 6 3/4 lbs. – perfect for high-speed hunting scenarios. The Predator Carbine CS features a telescoping stock with a fully adjustable length of pull for a custom fit.

New semi-automatic AR-15-style rifle developed with the predator hunter in mind
Free-floating button-rifled 0.680"" Muzzle OD ChroMoly barrels with recessed hunting crown for superior accuracy

Also comes with 3 magazines, back straps, hard case, cleaning rod / brush, Fobus paddle holster, and safety paperwork that comes with new gun.

Fobus holster is used but in excellent condition, used with my Glock 21. This is my 3rd Glock that I have customized with these upgrades and they look and work awesome! One magazine has extended finger rest on it, figured that one was in gun for conceal carry, and the 2 back up mags didn't need them. Including a black extended slide lock because the chrome one does not lock slide back after last round so I figure you can put the black one on because it works fine. I tend to count my rounds when shooting so I load next magazine when last round is chambered, so the chrome ones have always worked fine for me. I have magazine release set up for left hand shooters because I use right hand finger to eject magazine when shooting. Looking to start another project so it's time for this one to go. Got a little over $1,100 invested in to it. $750 firm, No trades or delivery. Text REDACTED for fastest response. Gun was $579 before upgrades so please, no low ball offers. Must be Ohio resident 21 years of age and legally allowed to purchase a firearm. Must show valid picture ID with date of birth and sign a bill of sale.

Had gun sold or so I thought but buyer didn't come through with the money, So it's back up for sale. I have been carrying this gun for a few weeks now so it has a little bit of holster wear on front sides of the slide which is common with carrying a handgun. But still looks awesome.

Model: M1 Garand
Serial: 3564371

Receiver Details:

Receiver serial number: 3564371 - Build Date Feb-Mar 1945. 

The receiver is almost flawless. used very little as you can see form the pictures. Just the standard minor handling wear for a weapon of this age. Everything is original with nothing replaced since it was manufactured. The barrel is excellent condition with no pit marks. The irons are still zeroed in and it is amazing shooter. 

Stock Information:

This is the original Walnut stock, not an after market Birch stock.

There is a circled P on the pistol grip

S/N 1,978,000-3,627,000 August 1943- March 1945 
S. A. / G.A.W. (Springfield Armory / George A. Woody). George A. Woody died in August 1944, however his inspection stamps remained in the Stamp Racks until March of 1945 (An overlap with the SA/NFR stamp). Other stamps used on the stocks were the circled 'P' proof mark (with serifs) on the pistol grip, and the Ordnance Wheel with Crossed Cannons. A mark in the pistol grip of the stock indicating high pressure testing. All rifles were so marked as part of initial acceptance tests, and the lack of the mark indicates either extensive wear, sanding, or a replacement stock.

The two holes on the left side of the rifle were form the M15 Grenade Launcher Sight that was mounted there. The sight was removed long before I obtained the rifle. 

I did put a new leather M1907 sling on it and I will also include the three, eight round clips and the four, five round clips. I believe I have a few more clips laying around, if so I will throw those in as well. If anyone has any questions or would like more pictures of any particular part of this rifle (barrel serial number etc.) let me know. I have this rifle at a reduced price to get it to move."

This shotgun is an H&R Ultra Slug Gun SBS980, 12 Gauge, 24 in heavy, rifled barrel, 3"" Magnum Chamber, Heavy Rifled Blue Barrel, Picatiny optic mount, Walnut Stained Hardwood Stock. This gun is in great shape and I have only added the hammer assist since it was new. I got a kick out of how it is basically like a cannon barrel with a stock on it. So I bought this just for some weekend fun (as everyone loves to try out a 3"" magnum shell). I do not shoot it anymore and just need the room in the safe. Contact me if you have any questions or would like more pictures of any particular part of the shotgun let me know."

This katana is constructed of laminated steel similar to the traditional ""san mai"" method of blade construction. Core billet of the second generation Higo uses a 9260 silicon alloy spring steel. The core is then wrapped around two billets of 1045 carbon steel. The forged blade is then sharpened to expose the 9260 core as the cutting edge. This Katana is a much stronger and uniquely constructed cutter.

From Kel-Tec's Website:

The PMR-30 is a light weight, full size pistol chambered for the flat-shooting .22Magnum cartridge (.22WMR). The PMR-30 operates on a unique hybrid blowback/locked-breech system. This operation system allows for the use of a wide variety of ammunition as it seamlessly adjusts between locked breech and blowback operation, depending on the pressure of the cartridge. It uses a double stack magazine of a new design that holds 30 rounds and fits completely in the grip of the pistol. The trigger is a crisp single action with an over-travel stop. The manual safety is a thumb activated ambidextrous safety lever (up for SAFE, down for FIRE). The slide locks back after the last shot and a manual slide lock lever is also provided. The light, crisp trigger pull and fiber optic sights make the PMR-30 ideal for target shooting and hunting small game.

Slide and barrel are 4140 steel, frame is 7075 aluminum. Grip, slide cover, trigger, mag release, and safety levers are glass reinforced Nylon (Zytel), much like other Kel-Tec Pistols. Magazine is Also Zytel and holds 30 rounds, with round count ports. Other features include: dual opposing extractors for reliability, heel magazine release to aid in magazine retention, dovetailed aluminum front sight, Picatinny accessory rail under the barrel, Urethane recoil buffer, captive coaxial recoil springs. PMR30 disassembles for cleaning by removal of a single pin."

This is a civilian purchased, single-owner scope is lightly used, mounted on only one rifle that was infrequently fired at outdoor ranges, gravel pits, cabin porches and the like for a couple years before becoming a Safe Queen. It was cleaned after every outing and kept in a Scopecoat scope cover when not in use - aside from some superficial scratches and minor wear on raised edges (such as the rail mount, windage and elevation screws, and knob knurling) it is in great shape, about what you'd expect to see on a store demo model. The lenses were likewise kept clean and are (as far as I can see) free of any dings or scratches. The scope cover did it's job and has several indents and marks caused by hot brass and the occasional stick or pebble, but is fully intact and as functional as ever.

The scope comes with owner's manual, lens pen, Scopecoat scope cover and Pelican-brand case. Note that this ACOG was originally a TA31-DOC mounted with a Docter-brand red dot sight; the mount and red dot have since been removed, but it means you are getting the ""larger"" Scopecoat cover designed to fit over an RMR red dot and/or similar external accessories. (And for the sake of full disclosure that also means the Pelican case is labeled as/for a model TA31-DOC, not TA31-CH.)

I'm asking $925 firm, but will work with you on covering some of the shipping and/or payment fees if we aren't doing a FtF transfer. (I can process credit cards via Square, send a PayPal invoice instead of gifting the money, etc.)"

Kahr CM9 in great shape with zero issues and less than a month old. This Kahr has 49 rounds through it exactly and fires true and extremely accurate. My CM9 will come with everything it did new along with a Crossbreed Horse Hide SuperTuck Deluxe IWB Tuckable Holster ($79.99) / Don Hume J.I.T. Slide Leather Holster ($22.99)  / 1 - 6 Round Magazines ( Only came with one) 1 - 7 Round Extended Magazine ($29.99) Hogue Slide On Grip ($4.99) There is well over $500 in this package with all the extras. If you haven't looked at the CM9 / PM9 and you’re looking for a slim concealed carry option with a great trigger and reliability this may be your ticket. The CM9 is as close to a quality pocket 9mm as you're going to find being smaller than the Shield / XDS / PPS. The CM9 is rated for +P loads as well.  I am looking for something else at this time and below are a few things I would be interested in. No black powder / archery / shotguns or antique firearms please.
