It comes with the original case and 2 magazine. The Firearm is in good condition and in fine working order. The finish has a few blemishes here and there but nothing I would consider major. For those unaware, Beretta has begun making some of their old pistol line in turkey and shipped their machines and dies over there and now produce the same Beretta model under the Stoeger name. All parts and accessories will fit the stoeger as did the Beretta branded firearms as they are 1 to 1 copies and still wholly owned by Beretta.

Pistol runs great, just looking for something different. Things that may interest me are .22LR Pistols, or a compact/subcompact pistol, .22Lr rifles or possibly even a long gun of some sort. Also interested in AR pistol upper parts. If you have something to offer please do so. All offers will be considered and responded to in a polite and professional manner.

The P35 designation for this pistol came about after the Nazis invaded Poland and took control of their Radom firearms production facility. Prior to that it was known as the VIS 35.  

It's of Polish design and it's a cross between a 1911 and a Browning High Power.  Many have said it was ""the best"" handgun of the WWII era no matter which side you were on. It was widely regarded as a very accurate, robust and dependable sidearm which is exactly why the Nazis decided to continue producing it almost to the end of the war.  

This particular pistol is known as a Type 2 meaning that it retains the original Polish three lever design, but it does not have the slot cut into the back side of the grip frame for a shoulder stock. Although the blue finish isn't up to the superior commercial quality of the pre-war pistols, it's still much better than the late war production pistols which became more and more crude as the war dragged on.  

This pistol can only be described as excellent and it retains nearly all of it's original metal finish. Grips are excellent as well with no chips or cracks and the bore is bright & shiny with no rust or pitting. All numbers match - frame, slide and barrel, but the magazine does not match. It's in fine shape mechanically and fully functional. All the correct Nazi proofs and acceptance marks are present on this pistol.

Pistol comes with 1 original magazine and one high quality post war aftermarket unit that functions perfectly.

Price is $750.00 with local pickup only in the Brandon, Florida area. I will not ship so please don't ask as it simply wastes both our time.

Buyer must be a Florida resident who is at least 21 years old.

Includes a BCM Gunfighter charging handle. Also has an original factory COLT A1 tear drop forward assist pre-installed.

These come from Daniel Defense as a completely built upper with no rail, BCG or charging handle.

I had built this one into a BLOCK II M4-A1 but now that SBR's are legal in my state I'm parting this out and building an Mk18 SBR and fund some other parts. I've removed the RIS II rail and sold that separately. I had planned to keep this for a future build but now I don't think I'm going to do anything with it.

This would be an excellent starting point for someone looking to build a high end AR. This upper has between 300~500 rounds down the barrel. It's practically still a virgin! Just add the rail of your choice and you will be all set!

I paid right around $530.00 or so for everything, I would like to get $300.00 dollars."

Review by Old Tree Dude on 5/19/14
Quality	
I have owned two of these for about 3 years now. Easy to conceal, easy to carry, easy to shoot. I have had two friends of mine look at them that are both long time gunsmiths. They were both impressed on how well they were built. The cost is very reasonable. You can pay a lot more and not get better quality. All my grandkids, nieces and nephews kids have fired these with 158 grain 38's and they all love the pistol.
Shooting the Range

Quality	
Took the Windicator .357 to the range today and fired 100 rounds. First 3 of 6 hit dead center of bulls eye center.This revolver is well balanced, with very little recoil. and accurate right out of the box. I plan to paint a white dot on front sight post to help me see and aim better, but it is accurate and fun to shoot. EAA has sold me on their quality for the money! gun magazine gun of year

This rifle shoots straight very accurate and low recoiling. I can only describe the accuracy by saying that I was able to shoot some standard clay pigeons set out at 400 yards from a bench. thats a very small target.

The Mauser is a great bolt action which most modern day bolt action rifles are designed from. This one has had a lot of custom work and tuning to load, chamber, fire and eject smoothly and dependably. The stock design looks just like the Steyr Scout rifle and if you shorten the barrel it will be very close clone of the Steyr Scout.

one pull of the trigger and you can tell this things shoots a dime. comes with the Limbsaver soft recoil butt pad, and the shell holding sleeve with the cheek riser piece inside. The bore is still bright with good grooves, the accuracy is all there."

The shotgun is in perfect condition, I am the first owner and i have fired exactly 100 rounds for bird shot and 10 rounds of slugs/buckshot. The bore is still as smooth as glass. Only took it to the range 1 time cleaned it and stored it away.


The shotgun will come with a mesa side saddle that will hold six rounds on the gun so that you can always have more rounds on hand. This is the best side saddle that you can buy for a 870. Its super solid and i would highly recommend it.


Also, i exchanged the original furnature with a magpul SGA stock and foregrip. The stock is ajustable to suit your perfect length of pull. I will also throw in the rounds that are already on the gun (8 rounds double ought buck and 2 slugs)

The T4 resembles the popular T3, but on a shorter 9mm platform. Reliability was the most important consideration when plans for the new pistol began mid-summer of 2012. The proven Bob Marvel Everlast Recoil System was modified to fit into the smaller T4 frame, thus reducing felt recoil and decreasing recovery time between shots. The frame is thinned just like the company’s popular Lady Hawk. The proprietary barrel is crowned and cut flush with the slide. On the outside, the front of the slide has new cuts designed to reduce weight. They taper toward the crowned barrel, giving a unique look to the T4 like no other handgun produced by the company. Grips are like the T3, but are thinned for less bulk."

I am the second owner of the upper and have put approximately 22 rounds through it. I do not recall what the previous owner said he put through it. The upper and barrel have marks and scratches on them from being customized. I can take detail shots of certain parts of the gun if requested. The law folding adapter had to have the internal threading piece ($10 from law) ground down to fit inside the adapter because the adapter is not perfectly round like it is supposed to be. Does not affect function.

The SIG Sauer SP2022 is an excellent choice for duty, defense, concealed carry, and competitive shooting. The SIG Sauer SP2022 is packed with features that have established it as a solid shooter that is easy to shoot and handle. In fact, in December of 2004 the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command awarded SIG Sauer a contract for 5,000 SIG Sauer SP2022 pistols chambered in 9mm. The SIG Sauer SP2022 was born and bred to be a real shooter.

It is drilled into the receiver between the forearm and the magazine well. It doesn't hinder the operation of magazine insertion/removal, but there's not much room for fingers.

Will ship to your FFL, but if your FFL will not accept from a private seller I can work with that. I don't want to split this up either.

I know this isn't the correct place, but figured I could get some really good information here. I have a Remington Sportsman 48 (11-48) with a full choke, and smooth barrel. From what I know, they do not have a rifled slug barrel for this shotgun. 

Is it OK to shoot a slug through this barrel without damaging the rifle? I primarily use it for sporting clays, and will maybe take it bird hunting, but wondering how it would fair for deer. Should I just stick with buckshot?

The stock does have a couple lighter colored wood plugs but still looks okay.  The receiver is drilled and tapped for a peep sight, and the barrel was drilled and tapped for a front iron sight...but one screw was broken off flush with the barrel.

Heckler & Koch MR556A1 556 Nato **NEW IN BOX**
A direct descendent of the HK416, the MR556A1 is a semi-automatic rifle developed by Heckler & Koch as a premium level commercial/civilian firearm with match rifle capability. Like the HK416, the MR556A1 is a major product improvement over conventional AR-type carbines and rifles. The MR556A1 uses the HK proprietary gas piston operating system, employing a piston and a solid operating “pusher” rod in place of the gas tube normally found in AR15/M16/M4-style firearms. This method of operation virtually eliminates malfunctions that are common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. This is the same key feature critical to the success of the HK416 rifles used by leading military and law enforcement customers. The MR556A1 is produced in the USA using American and German made components. The MR556A1 uses many of the same assemblies and accessories originally developed for the HK416 including the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail system. The HK Free Floating Rail System (FFRS) handguard has four MIL-STD-1913 “Picatinny” rails and allows all current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type arms to be fitted to the MR Series. The HK rail system can be installed and removed with simple tools and returns to zero when reinstalled. The MR556A1 also has a Picantinny rail machined into the top of its upper receiver for mounting optics and mechanical sights. Unlike earlier prototypes, major subassemblies, including the MR556A1 upper receiver/barrel assembly, are fully interchangeable with other high quality AR-style firearms. MR556A1 upper receiver kits can be used to retrofit competing legacy AR systems. Like the famous HK416, the MR556A1 uses a German-made barrel produced by Heckler & Koch’s famous cold hammer forging process. The highest quality steel is used in this unique manufacturing process producing a barrel that provides superior accuracy and long service life. But unlike the HK416, the MR556A1 does not use a chrome-lined barrel. Chrome-lining can sometimes mask bore imperfections and negatively affect accuracy. For the new series of Heckler & Koch semi-automatic MR rifles, HK designers and engineers believe best accuracy comes with an unlined bore. Used with the HK Free Floating Rail System, the barrel does not touch the handguard, ensuring the barrel is truly free-floating for maximum accuracy. The unchromed barrel has an internal profile of 6 lands and grooves with a 1 in 7 inch (178 mm) twist. It is also moderately “swagged” with a slightly smaller internal diameter at the muzzle end than the chamber end. This feature has a positive effect on bullet accuracy and velocity. The thick, heavy contour 16.5-inch MR556A1 barrel also contributes to its excellent accuracy. A precise enhanced two-stage trigger adds significantly to the accuracy of the MR556A1 and an extended latch charging handle makes operating the rifle with a telescopic sight easier. The retractable buttstock can be locked into a solid, non-moving position by tightening an Allen screw in the bottom of the stock. Special target rifle takedown pins ensure the upper and lower receivers are firmly mated for accurate performance. Designed to function with a wide variety of high quality 5.56 x 45 mm ammunition, the MR556A1 uses a C.I.P. dimensioned chamber (a chamber with dimensions specified by the Commission Internationale Permanente).The MR556A1 also functions reliably with most quality Caliber .223 Remington ammunition. The MR556A1 is being produced with the same commitment to quality as German-made HK firearms. By using joint U.S./German manufacturing, Heckler & Koch leverages the relative strengths of two continents to make the preeminent AR-type firearm, combining the designs innovations of the USA and Germany into one new product.

Up for your consideration is an unopened brand new in box ATI PX2 12 Gauge pump shotgun. Made in Turkey. It is a well built reliable shotgun for an affordable price.18.5"" chrome lined barrel, Holds 4+1 rds and 5+1 on some shells. Receiver top has factory rail indentations to mount both small and normal scope rings. Black synthetic stock with a nice absorbent recoil pad. I have one of these same shotguns myself that i have assembled which i will show a photo of also- but the one you are buying is still in sealed factory plastic in the box with manual. Cash and carry-Price is very fair and FIRM. You wont find one cheaper than this so with that said- do not bother to make me an offer as i am not hurting for money and i could care less if this sells or not. Thanks.
Pick up in Commerce Township. 2 closets crossroads are Glengary Rd/S.Commerce rd.

I found it here in Tucson in August of 2006. The previous owner was selling this 20 gauge Skeet model and an original Model 21 Skeet model in 410 bore, both of which were left to him by his father. The father bought both guns from the original owner here in Tucson on December 16th, 1976. The original owner had ordered both 21's through Mathews & Boucher in Rochester, New York on February 7th, 1952. The guns were built to his specifications and finally arrived at Mathews & Boucher where they transferred to the original owner on September 24th, 1952.

Once I took possession of the gun, I decided to send it to Connecticut Shotgun in New Britain, Connecticut to have the barrels and receiver reblued. There were a few spots of missing blue on the trigger plate, possibly from a few drops of blood, and some fine scratches on the barrels from what I assumed was from use in the field. The buttstock and forend wood were and still are just about perfect and needed no attention at all.

After about six weeks, Lou in the gun room at Connecticut Shotgun sent the gun back to me. His work on it was exceptional. It hasn't been fired since.

The length of the raised matted rib barrels is 28 inches. The left barrel is choked WS-2 and the right WS-1. The front sight is a Bradley red bead and the middle is the 94B Winchester white metal sight. The safety is non-automatic. The trigger is gold plated. The ejection is selective. Bore diameters by my CPS bore gauge are .616 for both barrels. The choke constriction on the left barrel measures just shy of .602 and the right comes in at .603 so in fact, the chokes run closer to modified. Quoting from Schwing's book on the 21 regarding chokes, it states on page 95 ""Where constriction was slight, in the case of Winchester Skeet #1 and Winchester Skeet #2, choke diameter would vary with the bore.""

The stock is the straight English style with the later Diamond pattern checkering on the slim beavertail forend. DAC is 1 5/8ths of an inch and DAH is 2 inches. LOP is 14 inches to the center of the checkered butt. The cast is neutral and the overall length is 44 and 5/8ths. It has ""select nice wood"" and a ""medium comb - leaning to the thin side"". Although the gold oval name plate is supposed to be engraved with the owner's initials according to the build sheet, there are no initials present. The oval is still slightly proud of the stock, so I think that he must have changed his mind about that. Weight is approximately 6 and 1/2 pounds. 

I'm not a dealer but I can go through a local dealer if needed at an additional cost to cover his transfer fee. The gun will be carefully packaged and shipped in a hard case. 

One like this doesn't come along often. I have been very careful to represent this desirable 21 as accurately as possible. As stated previously, this gun was reblued and serviced by Connecticut Shotgun and has not been fired since. It is in perfect working order if you choose to actually shoot it."

This shotgun was originally issued to the Texas National Guard and was later purchased by the Texas Dept. of Public Safety. Amazingly, it appears to have been relatively unfired. The previous owner was retired from TX DPS and he shot it exactly 4 times. The condition is consistent with only having been fired 4 times... There are VERY minor handling marks on the trigger guard but the bluing and wood are in remarkable condition.  The receiver internals show no wear whatsoever and there was still very old factory grease inside.  It has a true 18"" cylinder bore barrel with an XS big Dot tritium sight professionally installed. This shotgun is truly a piece of Texas history and, in my opinion, is built much nicer than current 870's. The terrible cellphone pics really don't do it justice but if you'd like more, let me know and I'll try."

The scope & rings are not included. NO trades I will ship it for $45 from a local FFL. It may take a day or two to reply if I am at my camp. I have been getting questions about the trigger. So here is the answer that some of you may need for your own rifles. All model 7 & 700 made for a 10 year+ period had defective triggers in them. Some of the gun would discharge when the safety was flipped off. All the triggers had to be rebuilt. You can check any guns that you have by serial number. Just do a  search for the Remington trigger recall. They are about 3 to months behind on repairs.
