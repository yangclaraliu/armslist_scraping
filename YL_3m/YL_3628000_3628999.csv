Here for sale is my SIG P220R. It is a GREAT pistol, and the only reason I'm selling it is because I want to get the stainless nitron version of the same gun. This pistol is in fantastic condition...I'm the second owner and it's been taken care of. This comes with all you see in the pictures....case, two mags, lock, instructions....plus a new set of Hogue grips (superior to the SIG grips, IMHO), and a Gray Guns P-SPIT trigger. This gun was made in November of 2011, and I'm the second owner. It has been well taken care of.

I have the stock, SIG, short-reach trigger installed at present, but am including the GGI P-SPIT as well. I was going to install the P-SPIT in my P229, but know that some people like the thicker trigger in the P220 and would rather sell my P220 first and tinker with my P229 later. The new manufacture P220s come with the short trigger, but I personally prefer the longer one. But then I also prefer Von Stavenhagen sights....""the '90s called, they want their SIG's back..."" Everyone's hands/fingers are different, so this way you can choose which trigger you like best.

I'm asking $575, and am open to trades for an all-stainless, nitron-finished P220R. Those are kinda hard to find (most think they're too heavy....), but I'm all for it if you have one.

Check out the pictures and contact me with any questions. I'll of course need to take a peek at your CHL or Oregon ID....but that seems to almost go without saying nowadays.

Thanks,

For sale here is my SIG SP2022 in 9mm. It comes with the box, three magazines, and two backstraps. Currently the ""small"" backstrap is installed, but the medium is also included. I prefer the small one, which is odd, as I have bigger than average hands.

This gun has the smoothest trigger I've ever felt on any gun (and yes, I have a *decent* 1911). This gun is in near-new condition....I'm the second owner, and the first owner put maybe a few mags through it. No discernable wear to the frame or barrel...I've kept it well-lubricated (probably over-lubricated, as I'm used to alloy-framed SIGs, and this thing is set up more like an H&K or Glock, what with the frame rails...)

I do not have the original factory grips they are target grips on the gun.  Lock up and timing are perfect and not too much of a turn line.  There is some blueing wear near the end of the barrel on one side of the pistol as if someone stuck it in the drawer and left it there for many years and a little wear on the ramp otherwise it's exceptional and with a little ren wax will sparkle like new the pics don't do it justice.

The OTV is lined with finely woven Kevlar aramid, these two parts of the vest are both bullet and heat resistant. The vest was tested to stop a 9 mm 124 GR full metal jacket bullet (FMJ) at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the armor panel. These plates also come in five different sizes and go into the front and back of the vest.

The Interceptor can not, however, be called a Level III-A vest as military standard does not require protection against heavy .44 Magnum ammunition. However, both Level III-A vests and Interceptor do protect from much lighter 9mm threats in identical tests. The vest will stop other, slower-moving fragments and is also equipped with removable neck, throat, shoulder and groin protection.

Two small-arms protective inserts may also be added to the front and back of the vest, with each plate designed to stop up to three hits from 7.62×51 NATO (.308 Winchester) M-80 ball ammunition, with a muzzle velocity of 2,750 feet per second (838 m/s). The plates are the most technically advanced body armor fielded by the U.S. military, and are constructed of boron carbide ceramic with a Spectra/Dyneema shield backing that breaks down projectiles and halts their momentum before reaching the wearer.

A complete Interceptor system costs $1,585, which includes the $500 (each) SAPI plates. looking for $850 cash since im missing the shoulder protectors or open to trades."

Allot of this is hard to find , very time consuming, but for a much larger amount than cost you can buy what you need. But again the 1050 buyer will get the first option. I also have Large used Dillon vibratory cleaner, and a New one in the box DP1200 cleaner, New 1050 conversion kits, New plate sets, New Die sets, some standard, and some carbide. Large Dillon new in the box tumbler. Other parts, and pieces, most all new. 

Also Brand New in the box Dillon 650 in 223  plate, $750, Dies extra, in standard or carbide for 223 and maybe 308, for sure plates and Dies in 308 for the 1050 in carbide, all new in the box. Most all back ordered for months, but I have it. I bought it all to make profit, so no low ballers.If you can buy cheaper go buy it, and do not tell about it. I am looking for a person that does not have time to fool around, and is happy to pay a Premium price, and get what you need with no wait, and that wants to start loading right away, as now. Please reply with your email, and your phone number. 

No phone number, no replies. 

Please - No Lowballers. If you do not like my prices, go buy from someone else, don't tell me about it. I am looking for Buyers with money, not poor shoppers that never buy, and waste a sellers time. I have all in demand equipment, extras, powders, primers. I paid huge money for it as a investment, and plan to make a profit. I am not needing to give away, and will keep it. OK.  
 Again, send your phone number, or no reply. Thanks...

P.S. No shipping on any powder or primers. I maybe willing to ship machines, or other parts, and peices, but prefer you meeting me in person, in Federal Way. I may add photos, but most is all New in the Boxes. Send your phone number.

I very much prefer to sell to a CCW, or anyone else who can show good Character... If you do anything that makes me suspect you are a thug, I will terminate the deal.... If this turns you off, please don't contact me....

It comes with a correct flap style holster that has storage for flare cartridges, and other stuff. It's made from a woven vinyl material that's water resistant and durable. It's OD green in color and has a shoulder strap for easy carry.

It also comes with a sub caliber adapter that allows you to shoot .22LR, Short or Long ammunition making for a very flexible package that's perfect for emergency self defense or survival applications. Then there is another adapter for shooting the less expensive and more readily available 12 gauge flare ammunition. 

Finally there is a nylon rope lanyard and a complete 26.5mm cleaning kit included. 

The pistol has been issued and it does have a few scratches and a little finish wear from being holstered. I would rate it very good overall with no rust or corrosion. Bore shows use but again no rust or corrosion. It's 100% mechanically sound and is sure to fire. All in all it's a nice looking set up that's ready for action.

Asking $200 with pickup in the Brandon Florida area or I can ship to you directly in the lower 48 states only for. $15. Although this flare pistol is not a firearm it would become a real handgun if the .22 adapter is installed. So buyer must be at least 21 to purchase."

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.



The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.



The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

It's never even been threaded onto a muzzle brake!

I bought this several months ago for a SBR project but I've changed the specs on the build, so I no longer need this.
I bought it with the intention of using it on both a 5.56 rifle as well as a 300 Blackout.  It will work just as well on .223/5.56 barrels as well as .30 caliber (e.g., .308/7.62, 300 Blackout, etc.)

This is the latest, Fast-Attach model.  Mounts to Surefire Socom Flash Hider (SF3P-762) or Brake (SFMB-762).
Includes all original packaging, case, brush and handling mitt.

Here's the link to Surefire for all the specs:

Sells for $960 or more elsewhere.
I'm knocking over $200 off - it'll pay for your tax stamp!

A private party transaction is not difficult.  Here's how we do the transaction:
1. I collect the money (we can put it in escrow in PayPal if you like).
2. We fill out form 4’s (2 copies) and submit them to the ATF along with the tax stamp check for $200 made out to the BATFE.
3. I give the suppressor to you after the approval/tax stamp is issued. 
The transaction must be in state (CO).

Once you receive the approved form 4 back for the suppressor I give the suppressor to the purchaser in person.  It’s that simple."

It was used by the Hungarian armed forces, and is still used by their police, so it has a long history of reliability.  It has an aluminum/titanium alloy frame giving it a light weight yet keeping it robust. Firing the 9x18 Makarov round, it is more powerful than the .380, yet not quite as powerful as the 9mm(9mm is 9x19 and .380 is 9x17). I have fired about 100 rounds through this gun and have had no malfunctions whatsoever. And because of its fixed barrel, it is inherently accurate. I was able to get 5 out of seven rounds on a man sized target at 100 yd. Included are 179 rounds of ammo for it, also included is an extra magazine which alone usually goes for $45-$50. It is really allot of fun to shoot, so I hate selling it. But its what I got to do to pay for school.

 I'm the original owner of the rifle, and I had it converted and Parkerized locally over at Bullseye Bluing several years ago. The rifle is in excellent condition, has only been fired a handful of times, never a problem, and is dead-nuts accurate. I have no problem with a test fire if you have someplace safe and convenient to shoot.
The only cosmetic issues are some light dings around the scope rail on the left side of the receiver where I mounted a Russian PSOP scope a few times (sorry, I sold the scope years ago).
The rifle has sufficient US-made parts to be well within full compliance with usc922r for parts count, and has a (Dinzag) bullet-guide installed (making it fully and properly converted, unlike some I'm seeing). These are built in Russia, with brand-new chrome-lined barrels, on genuine Russian receivers.
 Included is a polymer mag, and a standard East-block steel mag, both 30 rounders.
In case you haven't heard, earlier this year, ""The Administration"" has banned the importation of Russian-made firearms, and this is unlikely to ever be rescinded, so Saigas are disappearing from store shelves and prices are predictably rising.
Thanks for looking......

It's the newest production version with various enhancements introduced to solve early issues with the P938 platform.

This pistol has fewer than 100 rounds fired through it and has never had a misfeed or jam.  I have broken it down and cleaned it once.  It is for all intents and purposes 'like new'.

The sports version P938 normally comes with Hogue grips but I have replaced those with the more expensive Sig genuine rosewood grips.  I no longer have the Hogue grips but if you prefer those you can get them on eBay for about $20.

Sports version P938 has rear night sights and front tru-glo fiber optic sight.  This is actually a pretty sweet setup for faster target acquisition.

Includes extended and standard magazine and other original accessories.  I will also throw in a pretty nice concealed carry holster that cost me about $50 at time of purchase.

So why am I selling this fine firearm?  P938 is a little small for my hands and I have alternate firearms for concealed carry that are a better fit for me.

Buyer transaction needs to take place at a local FFL that will handle running CO state mandated BG checks and the buyer will pay those fees.  There is a FFL that lives a few blocks from me, so I can provide his contact information and he can set you up with doing transfer of this firearm in Highlands Ranch which is where I would prefer the transaction take place.

$525 price is firm.  New these go for $600+ not to mention extra magazine and other goodies that are included with mine.
