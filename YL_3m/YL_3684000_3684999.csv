This has functioned flawlessly with any type of ammo I've used...Federal, Estate, Remington brass, hornady critical defense etc.  I bought it brand new, purchased two additional mags and have run about 700 rounds through it without a hiccup.  Looks GREAT- see pics, barrel has some slight wear from slide use and there is a faint scratch in slide on top right, rear.  I tried to get the pic of it as best I could so you could see it, it's small enough it's hard to really capture.

This rifle also has a VLTOR IMOD collapsible stock, Ergo grip, and a Samson free float quad rail that all came standard from the factory.

It also comes with a 30 round magazine and a black padded rifle case. 

This rifle has a minor ding between the picatinny rails on the upper receiver  (pictured) and minor installation marks on the flash hider. The mark on the upper rail is easily covered with an optic or rail cover and will not affect operation of the mounting of optics.

I have a like new AA date code (Manufactured in 2000) H&K USP .45 compact in the hard to find 2 tone Stainless slide which is an absolute work of art. The gun has digested around 200 rounds, flawlessly and I had no intentions of getting rid of it but... I really, really want another revolver. This gun comes with 2 mags, one of which has the pinky extension and the other is a flat base for less of a footprint while being carried. This gun is currently in the DA/SA with a safety which means it can be carried cocked and locked like a 1911, but also the safety serves as a decocker akin to the SIG line of pistols - best of both worlds and they are infinitely customized with an enormous amount of trigger options which are easily installed. Comes with the box, 2 mags, original paper work and I also have a few hundred rounds that can go with the gun in the trade if a deal is struck.

These stainless models are considerably rarer than the standard ""hostile environment"" blued finish and look a helluva lot better in my opinion. H&K positively makes the best polymer handguns out there - nothing else even comes close.

This is a brand new (never fired) Mossberg 590A1.  Has thick-walled barrel and metal trigger assembly and metal safety.  Built like a tank.

This is the Blackwater edition which means it comes with XS ghost ring rail, Speedfeed stock and railed forend.  The furniture it came with was great but I like the wood look so I put on a traditional military stock and rat-tail fore end.  Also installed an ergo rear sling attachment point (between stock and receiver), John Masen heat shield, M9 bayonet w/ sheath, and Condor buttstock shell holder (also has extra Condor shell card that can be attached to receiver if you want).

ONLY trades I'm interested in at the moment would be for a quality over/under in 20 gauge or possibly a nice semi-auto in 20 gauge.  I MIGHT consider a 12 gauge but really need to find a 20 gauge.

Trade value is $650.

I'm located in Lawrence/Maury County area and will not travel far.

I can't say enough about this beautiful revolver.  I bought this last fall to see if handgun hunting would be my next venture, but it's not for me.  It was sent to Wilson Combat where it received it's perfect trigger, action, and ""Wilson Magnum Hunter"" inscription.  The Magna-Porting reduces recoil.  I sent about 100 rounds down the pipe and cleaned it religiously the 3 times I've taken it out.  I've kept it lightly oiled and always stored away from corrosive elements in a safe.  (Not in the foam lined case which, from what I've heard, can have a negative impact on a gun's finish over time.)

$1300 firm for the revolver with the wood grips, or $1450 for everything listed.
This package retails for over $1600 including tax and fees.

It's shorter in height than the standard CZ75 for ease of carry and has a fantastic grip feel. It comes in the factory box with two magazines and all the paperwork CZ provides.

I've fired approximately 100 rounds and it worked fine. It's almost LNIB (Like New In Box), except for normal wear for operation.

The double action/single action is a great choice and is done well in this pistol. The first trigger pull is a little harder than my Gen4 Glock, but every other trigger pull is much easier - it feels like cheating. Also, this has a quality barrel and the slide sits inside the receiver rails instead of outside as other pistols have it - it makes for a very accurate pistol and a low barrel centerline. It's a fine pistol, just made for carry.

I'm retired military, and this is better than what they gave me to carry on active duty.

Three day non-firing inspection. Buyer pays return shipping and fees. I can ship with no  magazines to California and possibly other states that have magazine restrictions. I answer all emails, so if you don't get a response consider sending it again with your phone so I can contact you."

It's shorter in height than the standard CZ75 for ease of carry and has a fantastic grip feel. It comes in the factory box with two magazines and all the paperwork CZ provides.

I've fired approximately 100 rounds and it worked fine. It's almost LNIB (Like New In Box), except for normal wear for operation.

The double action/single action is a great choice and is done well in this pistol. The first trigger pull is a little harder than my Gen4 Glock, but every other trigger pull is much easier - it feels like cheating. Also, this has a quality barrel and the slide sits inside the receiver rails instead of outside as other pistols have it - it makes for a very accurate pistol and a low barrel centerline. It's a fine pistol, just made for carry. I'm first owner - new in June 2014, with approximately 100 rounds through it. Selling to finance new Colt collection.

I'm retired military, and this is better than what they gave me to carry on active duty.

This is a factory original, drop-free magazine for your Glock. Glock magazines have a hardened steel insert encased in high tech polymer. This polymer coating protects the magazine and prevents deformation, even when dropped from a great height. 

Technical Informaion:
Glock magazines have very stiff springs when new and may be extremely difficult to load to full capacity. It may be necessary to use a Glock magazine loader (generally included in the Glock case with the handgun) to load the magazine to capacity or near capacity. 

If the last round appears impossible to load, for example if the magazine should hold 15 rounds and it will only accept 14, leave it loaded with 14 rounds for several days to allow the spring's tension to decrease. After a short time, the magazine should then accept its full capacity, but it may still be necessary to use the magazine loader. After several cycles of full capacity through empty, the magazine will be easier to load. 

Glock 33-Round Magazines feature a polymer follower, Glock #SP01812-6, MidwayUSA #927957 and a +2 style basepad to allow the magazine to hold 33 rounds.

NOTE: All current production Glock magazines are also compatible with all previous generations of Glock pistols."

VERY sweet to shoot and with its chrome line 22"" match grade barrel can reach out and touch very far. Cerakoted upper receiver in Tactical Gray. A lot of money and work put into this rifle. A few small dings and missing one screw for the top rail. Original was cerakoted but cat hid it from me and needs a new. It doesnt much leave the safe so new owner will need a trip to hardware store.

This is a Stoger P-350  .... Stoger is Bennelli's sister company ,,, This shotgun  features a Realtree APG finish and SteadyGrip vertical pistol grip. Stoeger’s sister company Benelli helped pioneer the popularity of tactical vertical grips on turkey guns nearly a decade ago, and for many hunters who may find themselves locked down in position to fire for extended periods of time waiting for a gobbler to close those final yards, the configuration is both more comfortable and provides a more reliable aim. The fore-end is ergonomically designed to better fit the hand with ridges for improved grip.

Overall the gun is in very good condition.  The only part that shows some surface scuffs is extended mag tube.  This gun cycles smooth and runs 100% reliable.  Below is a list of the upgrades/parts.

Factory remington 18"" smooth bore with 3"" chamber
Scattergun Tech Trijicon ghost ring night sights
Houge overmold stock and fore end.  
The stock was shortened and a Limbsaver recoil pad installed. Length of pull is 13.25"".  This makes for much better close quarters handling.
Ambi single point sling plate
Extended magazine tube, fits six 2 3/4 shells
Enhanced Wolff magazine spring 
Custom picatinny rail on fore end for a light, etc.
Side saddle shell carrier.  Uses velcro cards so once one is used up it can be peeled off and another full card added.  Also uses elastic to hold the shells so they dont slip under recoil.

All in all this is a great package.  It is not a tacti-cool shotgun with a bunch of useless crap on it.  This is a streamline fighting gun made with quality parts that work in the real world.  The sling and light are not included in the asking price.  If you really want them Im sure we can work somthing out.  More photos for serious inqueries.

It is a predecessor of the Czech VZ-24 which was listed earlier. The Steyr factory mark on the receiver is the date of manufacture, not patent date. I believe this qualifies it as an antiqure for Federal reg purposes (States may differ). While the action is working, the barrel appears to be slightly bent at the muzzle end. It is a good wall hanger or a parts gun.

Info / Specs
The TA31RCO is an Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) designed for the M4 and M4A1 weapon system (14.5"" barrel). It incorporates dual illumination technology using a combination of fiber optics and self-luminous tritium. This allows the aiming point to always be illuminated without the use of batteries. The tritium illuminates the aiming point in total darkness, and the fiber optic self-adjusts reticle brightness during daylight according to ambient light conditions. This allows the operator to keep both eyes open while engaging targets and maintaining maximum situational awareness.

Designed to the exact specifications of the United States Marine Corps, the unique reticle pattern provides quick target acquisition at close combat ranges while providing enhanced target identification and hit probability out to 800 meters utilizing the Bullet Drop Compensator.

The MR Eagle Series from Magnum Research - best known for its famous ""Desert Eagle"" handgun - is a joint American/German project to improve upon the classic Walther P99, a striker-fired, 9mm hangun that James Bond now carries instead of his old PPK. 

It features a black polymer frame with integral steel rails from Walther, a silver stainless steel slide and a ChromeMoly steel barrel: all machined and assembled in the USA. It retains the Walther ""Anti-Stress"" trigger with its short, consistent 5lb pull. The gun has three integral safeties and a manual decocker that can reset the single-action trigger to a firmer double action for added security making it one of the safest guns to carry or keep at home.

The frame comes with three switchable back straps to vary the size of the grip, a fully adjustable rear sight and five interchangeable front sights for varying elevation and windage. The MR9 comes with two 15-round magazines, a cable lock, and an injection-molded carrying case that keeps everything securely in place.

The MSRP on the gun is $559. I am selling it for $400 firm. I accept CASH or PAYPAL plus $20 for shipping, handling, and insurance. At this price, it won't be around for long."
