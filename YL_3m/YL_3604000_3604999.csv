Market price: $699 



The GSG-5 is an identical replication of the MP5, except one great thing: It's a .22 caliber. Because of the low cost of ammunition the GSG-5 makes a perfect plinking rifle, training rifle, or a serious varmint hunting rifle. Nothing of its kind has ever been introduced in the United States. The user will be impressed with its weight and performance. If you are a varmint hunter, you will be encouraged by all the options the GSG-5 has to offer with its railing system, faux supressor and easy change magazine. For training purposes, the GSG-5 is a low-cost alternative for Law Enforcement agencies and departments that use MP5s in the field.

This rifle was in production from 1950 to 1951 and has the reputation as being one of the most accurate rifles Mossberg ever produced. After shooting this rifle, I can say that it is very accurate and has a very nice trigger. I put 50 rounds though it and only had one mis-feed that was due to a bullet being wonky in the casing. It would not have fed correctly in any rifle. It has an interesting and unique safety that actually locks the bolt slightly open. This rifle has been hunted with over its lifetime, but it has been well cared for.
There is a small crack right behind the breech cap and there is a little damage to the butt plate.
Parts for this rifle are affordable and available through Numrich, but you wont need any for this Lady. She functions just like she should.

The first $150 takes her home. I am in Little Rock. Shoot me an email if you are interested. I will post pictures soon."

Item is the Sig P938 Sports. This sale includes the gun, case, extended magazine, flush magazine, silver grips, sig holster, and Alabama Holster holster.

I am asking $550.00 for everything. Trade value is a little bit more but I am very workable on trading!
Total Cost breakdown:
$585- $560 shipped is the cheapest you can find this model right now. Add $25 for the average FFL fee.
$30- Silver grips and silver screws(stock ones strip/fall out easy). The original rubber grips are included as well so you have multiple options.
$50- Alabama Holster Tuckable Holster. Great holster that features a 1.5 inch belt loop, has a small forward cant, and is tuckable(Great option for polos!)

Total of $665.00 invested for an amazingly small pocket holster or IWB that you won't have to dress around. The tuckable holster works great at walmart or when I need to bend over because if for some reason my polo pulls up all they see is my white undershirt which is tucked in. I can ride around all day in my Jeep and it's not uncomfortable to drive in. Gun has less than 500 rounds through it and cycles all ammo 115gr FMJ, 124 FMJ, and 124 JHP. The gun was manufactured in 2014 and is not associated with the early models of this gun which had issues with FTF and shooting 115gr ammo. I have not had a misfire with this handgun.(I have posted about issues with a P938 that was an early model that I used to own.) Condition is 9/10 only because it's used. Gun was babied even though it was carried.

I am interested only in 1911s. The only imported model that I would be interested in is RIA. Will trade down/same/add cash to make a deal. I am looking for 5 inch or smaller 1911 in 45ACP or 4.25 and smaller in 9mm. No 40S&W Please. Will trade for XDS9 +$100 for blued and +50 for bitone. 1911 will trade with AL/FL;XDS AL only.

I took these pictures and realized the Holster is not in there. I don't know how I missed it but a new picture will be uploaded tomorrow."

If you need to be very discrete and still want to dress up a bit or wear professional clothing at work where guns aren't allowed or might be frowned upon, these are the pants for you.  I have one pair, Brand new still in the package.  There are two hidden pockets on both the left and right size with a hidden zipper. The actual pocket that is visible is still 100% usable, so nobody will know you are carrying.

They are also very comfortable and durable.  The waist is a flexible material with reinforced belt loops which makes them very easy to wear.  I have size 34x30 only.  They'll probably fit if you normally wear anywhere from a 32-36 waist because of the sort of flexible waist design and you can wear a belt if needed, too.


Check out this youtube video showing a guy from Woolrich actually doing a demo on the pants.  They'll retail for $50 or more, I'm selling for $30 cash.  

I have several pair that I wear, this one is extra, and I've never opened the package.  Tags still attached. Thank You, and May God bless America and our 2nd Amendment."

It came with the main board, the DJI motors, and ESC controllers.  I bought exteneded landing gear for the camera gimble.  DJI NAZA controller.  Zenmuse H3-2D Gamera gimble.  DJI naza VMU.  iosd Mini(on screen display). NAZA GPS.    

I also purchased two controllers that you can see.   One is a Turnigy 9X and the other is the one out of the box the 9Xr.  Neither have been used, the other has not been out of the box.   I purchased a long range system for it.   Transmitter and receiver.  One is installed in the radio the other on the aircraft.  

This will come with 4 batteries.   3 DJI phantom batteries and a turnigy battery.

Fat shark antenaes are included.   For a FPV set up that is not included.

2 sets of different length blades.

I'm also throwing in a video recorder for someone who wants to do FPV.  You hook this to goggles or a monitor and it records anything you see.  Comes with a belt carrying case, a remote control, and all the cables.

Nothing has been powered up.   The board was soddered and the motors and esc's were put on.   the other parts are either loose or velcro'd on.   I was mocking everything up.   

If you look on the rc-drones website all of this gear cost over 2K  to purchase.  This can be a cheap way to get some of the best parts available for someone who already is into FPV drone flying, or someone who wants to go deeper into it.  My loss is your gain.   

Everything listed is brand new never been used except the batteries that have around 2-5 charge cycles on them in other craft.

Most of this stuff came with very few directions(as does most RC stuff).  I'm including what came with them.  All of the orignal packaging is gone for the most part except what you might see.   Youtube has examples of installing every single piece of EQ listed.

The cash price will be 950.   Putting the trade value closer to 2K depending on what we come up with.  If there is cash involved with firearms I will be a lot easier to negotiate with."

767,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3604767,For Sale:  French Model 1873 and German Suhl 1883 Reichsrevolver,"Waverly, Iowa, United States","$ 1,000","Listed On: Wednesday, October 15, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Please view pictures for best idea of condition. Here are a few observations:

French 1873: I am not super familiar with the action of these revolvers, although I have read they use the ""Chamelot-Delvigne"" design. When this one is in its ""resting state"" the cylinder will rotate somewhat. To give you a rough idea, it will rotate approximately slightly more than the length of a bolt stop notch and preceding lead. However in both single action and in double action it seems to line up the cylinder about where it should be. Testing it like I would an old Colt, when the trigger is pulled, after the hammer falls, and the trigger remains pulled back, there is roughly a millimeter in movement in the play of the cylinder. I am guessing this is all normal but since I dont know I want to disclose it. Some strawing remains as shown. Note that these guns were produced ""in the white."" I have seen a number that people have blued, or even nickeled. I am calling it the german revolver a ""reichsrevolver"" and I hope that this terminology is correct. If not, please feel free to correct me.

German Model 1883 (Suhl): Not much to say on this one although I wanted to point out that it appears that the cylinder pin has a different number on it than the rest of the gun shows so I will assume it is a replacement from some point. Finish as shown, some bluing remains in protected areas.

I have not disassembled, or modified these guns in anyway (other than what I did for pictures), and am selling exactly as found. Please have inspected by gunsmith prior to shooting, and know that these are black powder guns not safe for modern cartridges.

TERMS: I would like $1k OBO for either one of them, or $1800 for the pair. 15$ for shipping. I accept usps money order, cashiers check, or other pre-agreed upon arrangements. I know that I can send the French as an antique because it was made in 1879. I will only need a copy of your driver's license to verify age of 21 or older, and a written/signed statement verifying that you are allowed to own this item. While I feel relatively confident the 1883 is classified as antique, I am told some WERE made after 1898. At this point I have not been able to verify age of this revolver and thus will be shipping to FFL. I will send it to C&R but shipping will be more since I am not allowed to ship handguns to C&R through post office. (Yes I know this is a debated topic but its how I run my business based on my understanding of PO regulations, thank you for your understanding!)

803,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3604803,For Sale:  Swiss Model 1871 Vetterli Stutzer,"Lake Villa, IL, Illinois, United States",$ 850,"Listed On: Saturday, December 27, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a RARE M1871 Vetterli ""STUTZER"" model. These hardly ever come up on Gunbroker - haven't seen one for sale in the past several years. 

Unlike the stnadard 1871 Vetterli, the 1871 Vetterli Stutzer model is distinguished by the double set triggers. 


Some additional info about the Vetterli M1871 STUTZER: 

The Stutzer (carbine) variant of the 1871 rifle was used to equip the Scharfschützen (sniper) companies of the army. The Stutzer were equipped with a sensitive Stecher (double set trigger) action and featured a shorter barrel.

The 1871 Stutzer  incorporated several modifications over the 1869/71 and was intended for riflemen.  The 1871 included double-set triggers and special heavy buttplates.  The rifles were shorter, and had a single barrel band.  Early Stutzer models used the Thury dual trigger set, however, after 1875 a dual trigger set designed by Rudolph Schmidt was adopted.   However, while the Stutzer possessed a shorter barrel, it kept the Model 1869s rear sights.  This produced a point of impact error at when using the rear sights range graduations. 


Specs:

Barrel Length: 30.9 inches 
Overall Length: 49.6 inches 
Weight: 10.2 lbs empty 
Chambering: 10.4x38 (.41) Swiss Rimfire
Rifling: 4 groove, RH twist, 1 in 26""

Capacity: 11 (10 round tube magazine +1 in the cartridge elevator) 
Caliber/Ammo: 41 Swiss Rimfire 10.4xR38mm

Additional Details: 

1. Original, ALL matching SN 5331 on receiver, barrel, lifter, bolt, fore-end cap and fore-end wood.
2. Date of Manufacture: 1873 (aproximiately 7,500 for that year) Approximately 16,000 produced in all.
2. Arsenal: Eidgenössische Montier-Werstätte and Eidgenössische Waffenfabrik, Bern
3. Completely original. Has not been restored.
5. Beautiful old patina
6. Lands are sharp

The Bad:

1. The preivous owner at one point had converted the bolt to centerfire. Would NOT recommend firing. I know a guy in Flordia that can convert the bolt back to it's original Rimfire  configuration for $50.
2. Missing: Rear sling swivel (about $20-30 when the come up on Ebay) and Rod

This is a beautiful and rare 1871 Vetterli Stutzer.

 Its in good shape with a little bit of carry wear but nothing major worth mentioning. Comes with two 8 round magazines. Has an excellent trigger, light and breaks very cleanly with a short reset. If you aren't familiar with these they are very similar to a Kahr CW9, basically the single stack 9mm Glock has yet to make.

 It carries nicely but I prefer to pocket carry so I'd like something with a shorter grip. I'd be interested in a Ruger SR9c or LC9 or an M&P Shield in trade. Might also consider J frame sized .38 special revolvers, or the same guns mentioned in .40. Depending on what you have I may add a little cash.

 I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.
