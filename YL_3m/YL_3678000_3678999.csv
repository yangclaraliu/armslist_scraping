Built on the SE122 frame, the SE12 Tactical shares important characteristics: a strong but sensitive gas system that cycles reliably with a wide range of loads; an action bar milled from solid steel; a convenient magazine release that allows you to extract unfired shells from the magazine without cycling the action, an added safety feature. Combining proprietary engineering and renowned Turkish craftsmanship, the new SE12 Tactical may be the most reliable and versatile semi-auto we have ever produced.

Fiber optic front sight, fully adjustable rear sight; buttstock may be removed for storage; sling attachment points; extra shell storage in the stock. Super strong muzzle brake unscrews, allowing barrel to accept included modified and full extended choke tubes (ideal for Turkey hunting).

Baretta - Made in Italy. In very good condition. No rust or corrosion. Action works very well and I've had no issues at all.
This shotgun was passed down to me when I began to get into trap and skeet shooting, however as I've now purchased an over-under that is better suited for these activities, this shotgun should really be in the hands of someone who can use it for bird hunting or whatever.  The Beretta actually worked very well with Trap as it has a fixed full choke.  
The gun does show some signs of wear though the engraving on the black receiver is still easily visible and there are no noticeable dings or scratches on the wood stock or fore end.  
If you're interested in a magazine extension, I believe I still have one and I'm happy to include that with purchase.  Just let me know this is of interest.  
Asking $350 or best offer and again, I'm happy to throw in ammo and/or the aforementioned mag extension.

Like I stated before the unit was purchased brand new a month ago. You can't get a better deal on this. You will save $400.00 buy buying this, because the brand new model from Taser will cost you $1,000.00!

I am the original owner on this pistol.  It has less than 300 rounds through it.  They did also produce the same color and pistol configuration again for another batch of 200 in 2013 but CZ USA had changed the roll pin of the safety mechanism and therefore it would have to be re-certified to keep it's NATO NSN (which they did not do in time for the 2013 production run).

I have the accuracy trigger spring kit in it, which reduced the pull to about 1/2 of stock weight, but retained the hammer strike weight (it lightens the trigger return spring so you don't fight that as you squeeze off shots). Military and Duty ammo primers will not have light strikes.

All new magazine springs installed 11-6-2014. I have spare springs still new in the package from WCW Co. floating around here somewhere.

Recoil spring was replaced 11-6-2014 when I had my gunsmith make sure this was in 5-star condition to sell it. It didn't need it, but we did it anyway to be absolutely sure.

If you're not familiar with the SIG P250, this is the model famous for it's modularity. You can literally swap calibers, slides, even the lower polymer frame in seconds (the trigger is a drop in piece). Parts to swap calibers and frame sizes are CHEAP!

Face to face transfer OK, please follow the rules (be a resident and not an asshat).

Edit: Price lowered from 475. If you have a gunbroker account, you could probably make a few bucks reselling this over there. I personally don't like that site, so I have no interest in dropping a listing there."

Answers to some popular questions I've been getting:

Question: Why selling? 
Answer: Because I haven't used it, don't need it, and it takes up space.

Question: What will you take if I had to drive 65 miles all the way from Collinsville?
Answer: The same if you were driving from across the street, $225. Or are you making an offer? C'mon, dude.

Question: You say it's full metal but the barrel shroud and stock are plastic?
Answer: Yes, they're plastic. ICS calls this their ""full metal"" model and I am merely restating the company's model nomenclature and description.

Question: Still have the rifle? Text 228-6xx-xxxx.
Answer: If you want the rifle or have a specific question, please feel free to ask a question through my preferred methods listed per armslist.

Question: Have you received a lot of interest in this airsoft?
Answer: Yes, quite a bit. But there are a lot of flakey people on Craigslist and I'm not going to sell to strange, irritating, or people of questionable intent."

This was one of the small group of fully converted Saiga AK-47's that came into the country legally before the ban on Russian arms importation went into affect.

There will likely be no more of these imported due to the ban so this is a rare and sought after rifle.

I have a very rare colt officers ACP. This is the only 3.5"" Barrel Colt out there. She has defiantly seen her share of rounds and has been around the block and back. I am forced to let her go as I need to lower down the collection to make room for new projects. 

This is a private party transfer no TAX. Buyer pays his/her own dros fee. Transfer will be done at Ades Gun Shop Orange, Flowers in Orange,  Stock aid in Westminster. Will ship on your dime. 

Due to the gun being so old I did not get the box from the previous owner. The gun comes with Two Officer Colt Mags. No box or case. Just the gun and one mag. She is defiantly a collectors item. 

The gun fires absolutely flawlessly. Surprisingly there is seriously very little recoil for such a small Gun. If you would like to test fire the gun, you are welcome to at Evans Gunsmiths indoor range in Orange. Ades Gun Shop is only a mile away form the range so convenient for those that want to test and transfer.

Savage 110 BA in .300 Winchester Magnum with Hillbilly 223 camo.

The appearance of the Model 110 BA from Savage is as radical as the extreme accuracy it delivers. The BA’s modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods and more.

The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series — built for pinpoint accuracy. The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like no Savage we’ve ever made.

The Savage Law Enforcement Series is now the official precision rifle of the New York State Police Mobile Response Team. Every heavy contour barrel in this series is button rifled for enhanced accuracy and features a recessed target crown. There is no need to lap the bolt, because the floating bolt head ensures both lugs have full bearing on the locking surface. And the headspace on every rifle is set at absolute minimum. Standard features in this series include an oversized bolt handle that permits rapid acquisition for follow-up shots.

Up for sale is a Glock 22 (Full frame, 40 S&W) Gen 2 with 2 15 round mags. As illustrated in the pictures, this Glock was a police trade in from the San Antonio police department.

The G22 currently has Gen 3 sights installed as I liked those a bit more than the Gen 2 sights. Also currently installed is a Lone Wolf 3.5 pound trigger connector which really smoothed out the play in the stock trigger group. Unsure of an exact round count but I have owned it for about a year and put an estimated 1,000 rounds through it without any issues. I can also include a gun sock or Glock hard case if interested. Really is a great reliable sidearm, just have not used it in quite some time. Looking for $350 OBO. Located in Lake St. Louis area and will consider delivery depending on distance.

This rifle is perfect, I shot one 10 round mag(thanks hickenlooper) through it and it is amazing. Was awaiting the arrival of my illegal 20 round mags to go out and do some serious shooting, but not gonna happen.

My loss can be your gain, but I am not going to play around with non-serious buyers. And no, I will not take payments. It is as I represent it...amazing work of art that I wish I could take credit for. List price is $3148 and there is a wait to get one built. This is king shit in the .308 AR world in my(and thousands of others) opinion. There is a very good reason it is the issued infantry rifle in Great Britain. Very, very accurate rifle out to distances my old eyes just can't see any more. 

I will ship out of state, but only to your FFL. Colorado law does not require I use an FFL to ship OUT, but I sure am only going to ship TO an FFL. If you are in-state, I will meet you at Gander Mountain in Denver Metro and you can pay for your background check there. No other options.

I added a rear aperture sight with windage and elevation adjustments from Tech-Sights. This sight mounts to the receiver (not the cover) without drilling or tapping, and it returns to zero after removal. I've also replaced the firing pin with a spring-loaded, stainless steel version from Murray Gunsmithing—this makes a slam-fire impossible. I replaced the hammer and sear springs with reduced power versions from Wolff for lighter trigger pull. All the original parts are included, so the rifle can be returned to stock if desired.

Other extras included: leather sling, buttstock cleaning kit, thick recoil pad (increases length of pull), front sight pusher, front sight elevation tool, about 20 stripper clips, and 160 rounds of ammo.

This is a fun old rifle and bayonet in the Mauser 98 tradition made by the State armory of Czechoslovakia at Brno and accepted by the Czech army in 1939. (Tiny second rampant lion followed by ""39"" side of receiver.). ""G5"" leading the serial number designates the production lot and factory. (See detail at the bottom of the pics.) ""G"" is for the 7th lot within one of 5 production cycles before the German annexation. 1939 would be the last cycle. ""5"" means it was made by the factory Povaska Bystrica in Slovakia. At that time Czechoslovakia had the largest small arms industry in Europe and enjoyed exports to many armies worldwide. This Mauser style rifle was one of the favorite service weapons through WWII. This one is in good condition and works even though it has seen a lot of history as the pictures show. The rifling grooves in the bore are a little dark but the lands are quite strong and crisp. It sure has a lot of sling mounts. My favorite feature is the bold lion crest of the armory. My second favorite is the sighting system which appears to be designed to minimize damage from rough handling and yet preserve precision. This same sighting system is still used in Czech guns being made today. Of course the Mauser type bolt action is great and so simple to remove.

The rifle comes with its VZ-24 bayonet. The spring action locking mechanism works well. Bayonet marking is CSZ. 4 digit marking on the wooden hilt is probably a unit number. Detailed bayonet pics are in the 2nd picture, right hand side.

Hard to find a VZ-24 with this visible history. Most exports have the crest polished out and you can only see a faint trace.

A footnote to history... After WWI from 1918, Czechoslovakia developed into a healthy democracy in Central Europe. But it was in the shadow of what became Hitler's expansionist Germany which occupied it piecemeal and finally annexed entirely in 1939 as western Europe watched. After WWII in 1945, it was nearly independent until 1948 when Stalin installed a puppet government. The VZ-24s for the small Czech army were only produced in the 5 production cycles preceding 1939... those not exported to earn hard currency. After 1939 their factories were appropriated for German or Soviet arms. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, CZ was organized as a company, and once again it is producing the renowned VZ-24 rifles. The rifle listed here was produced in the tiny flicker of hope in 1939. It was not used by the German troops, those had Nazi marks. Perhaps it was a partisan? The Czechs had an active and organized underground in those years.
