Looking to beat LGS prices, which I'm not figuring would be too hard to do.  New or used is okay, frame color isn't important nor is the standard/RTF frame, but I'm not looking for something that's been hacked on too badly.  Refinished slides are okay but polished isn't for me - would do NIBx or similar, or even Cerakote or something.  Would GREATLY prefer gun in original box.  Willing to pay a little more for night sights and will talk accessory deals depending on what you have.  Not looking to buy a kajillion rounds of ammo but can talk a deal there as well if you're looking to get out of 9mm or something.

Yeah, I know I can drive to Indy and get a great deal at a cop shop or something, but gas is expensive and I don't have the time.  If you've got a Glock hanging around in your safe and want to make a deal, give me a shout."

This safe is a few years old so it doesn't have the pocket door accessory.  
I purchased this one from H&H.  I don't have any way of delivering so you'll have to come pick it up.  I'll be more than happy to help load it up though.  Feel free to contact me with questions."

Has the unique mag catches on special order (to arrive Wednesday or Thursday this week) that will be included to allow it to accept Smith and Wesson and Sig Sauer double-stack 9mm magazines.

Great powder dispenser
October 29, 2011
Wanted a powder dispenser and was conflicted by all the different ones available. I figured that I should by from the source, ie. a manufacturer that makes the scales vice one that sources out. Quite happy with the purchase. Have loaded everything from .38 to 30.06. Loading .223 goes by in a flash with extreme accuracy. Unit is easy to operate and clean.

Very nice dispenser, but a little slow
October 29, 2011
I got this on sale and it is a very nice dispenser for the money. It does seem a little slow, but for me, the accuracy and features make up for that.
I'm using it mainly for load development, where I vary charge weight. I generally use a powder measure for large batches so speed is not my top priority.
You can speed it up a lot by changing the dispensing parameters , but at the expense of inducing some error. Production can also be increased by simply manually filling the pan with powder using a dipper with most of the charge and then using the auto feature to top off the pan.
The scale side holds zero pretty well (better than my older RCBS electronic scale) and the calibration function shows the raw counts on the display so you can get some feel for how stable the load cell is, if you care about that kind of stuff.
Construction is OK, but not top notch. Some parts seem like they could break with rough handling. Disassembly for cleaning is straightforward, although there are a lot of parts. The upside is it breaks down far enough that you can ensure you get all the old powder out. If you do your part, you won't get any Bullseye in your .308s.

Great purchase!
October 29, 2011
I was also reluctant to buy this product because it wasn't a ""name brand"". I bought it to replace my Lyman 1200 DPS III. So far I am very pleased. After I adjusted the motor speed in the configuration menu it consistently threw dead on charges. My Lyman would consistently be off as much as .5 grains and I was losing confidence in automatic powder dispensers, this product has restored my confidence at a fraction of the cost as the other guys. I have never left a review for any item I have purchased from Cabelas but I had to take the time to recommend the Salter Brecknell powder dispenser. It does exactly what it says it will do. Do not hesitate to buy, you will not be disappointed.

Awesome!!!
October 16, 2011
Was hesitant to purchase this item because I wasn't famaliar with the company. After reading the two posted reviews, researching the company, & doing price comparisons, I decided to give it a try. That was a good decision. It has excellent features. Not only can you select the powder type, you have complete control of the motor speed through the ""configuration"" menu. You can set the high, low & pulse speeds for each powder type. I found this to be especially useful for extruded powders. It dispenses ""dead on"" each time. Has auto function, & can be easily disassembled for cleanout during powder changes. Also has a ""powder feed tube restrictor"" that screws into the feed tube & allows you to virtually trickle one grain per pulse! Would be nice to have the powder target weight displayed, but I can live without that feature. Awesome product. Only had it for 2 weeks, have to see how it performs over a period of time.

Excellent Buy
April 18, 2011
The reason I bought this scale is that I wanted to reload match grade ammo for my M1 Garande and in .300 win mag.Once I had the scale calibrated my friend and I put it to the test trying every function in the owners manual trying to get it to mess up.It was dead nuts every time! One of The functions we liked, is that you program the scale what type of powder your using, i.e. ball,extruded or flake. The scale will adjust the feed rate of the powder so it weighs perfect every time. My friend was so impressed that he bought for himself."

Norinco NHM 91 AK47. Converted to accept standard AK Mags. Comes with original thumbhole stock and sling and Ironwood Designs RPK AK Stock finished in Russian Red. One 40 round Mag and Chinese drum mag.

Based on the Russian RPK light machine gun, the NHM features a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches (508mm) compared to the 590 mm (23.2 in) of the original RPK, along with a forward-mounted steel bipod.

Like the RPK, the NHM-91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or Chinese-made AKM, resulting in increased rigidity, heavier weight, and improved overall accuracy. The longer, heavier barrel reduces shot dispersion and gives the NHM-91 a longer sight radius, again resulting in improved accuracy over the typical semi-auto AKM. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs, and some users report the rifle capable of 2-2.5 minutes of angle accuracy or better with factory 7.62x39mm ammunition."

What's the difference between the ""regular"" brass knuckles, ""belt buckle"" brass knuckles? The short answer is, NOTHING! They're All The Same!


Because the manufacturers know that Brass Knuckles themselves are questionable from a legal standpoint, they started making them with a removable stud that would allow them to be used as a Belt Buckle.

Yukon's exclusive PULSE IR illuminator extends viewing range 2 to 3 times farther than standard IR illuminators and increases viewing ability on nights when no ambient light is available. The unique pulsating frequency of the PULSE IR prolongs battery life an incredible 30-50 hours using only 2 - AA Batteries while the infrared light will reflect off the pupils of your target up to 75 yards away, making it easier to spot game at night. Perfect for low-light or no-light situations, when using the Tactical 2.5x50 by Yukon yours will not be a trivial pursuit.

The illuminated red-on-green reticle has an adjustable brightness control that can be dimmed for a clear view while scanning for your next opponent or lit for extra brightness when there is little or no ambient light available; be sure to put your game face on.

I have for sale an upper receiver I built a few years ago. It is a pin and welded barrel. It has a Rainier Arms Ultra match receiver with m4 feed ramps, Adams Arms bolt carrier with POF firing pin & cam roller, KNS Perma pin, CMMG bolt that was machined with the CMMG Heavy barrel. Daniel Defense FSP 9.5 rail, Magpul rail covers and AFG. Adams Arms carbine gas piston system with three settings and a Noveske KX3 muzzle device. Also I am including a Surefire tac light with night vision cover and quick throw mounting, cover can be removed easily to slim light down. Also comes with never mounted pressure switch. I am asking $800 obo for full upper, if you have any questions please feel free to ask. Rifle has about 800 rounds through it and always cleaned after range time. Not interested in trades, but never hurts to offer another upper. No registration needs to be done with upper, it is not the registered part to a rifle. Also Rainier Arms shortened the barrel to 13.75 inches, retuned the gas ports to work with shorter barrel length, and they pin and welded the KX3. You can text or call at REDACTED, and I can send more photos on request."

It shoots well, and is easily capable of taking deer to 150 yards and beyond.  I am no longer hunting in slug only areas and it is taking up space in my gun safe.  I bought the youth model when the regular models were sold out a couple of years ago.  It is the same exact shotgun as the regular 220F, the only difference is a 1"" shorter length of pull.  I put a limbsaver recoil pad on it and extended that to make it 3/4"" longer making it feel exactly like the full size and making recoil that much lighter.  Scope and sling not included, it does come with 5 rounds of Federal Sabot slugs and 17 rounds of Remington Accutips.  The best part is, you don't have to spend money figuring out which slugs it shoots the best.  For full power loads is shoots the groups in the picture with the federal 3"" slugs, and it shoots slightly bigger groups than that at 100 yards with the Remington slugs which recoil less making it a perfect load for youth or recoil sensitive shooters. Only about 50 rounds through the shotgun. Only selling the shotgun, ammo, and limbsaver recoil pad.  Sling, scope, and scope mount not for sale.  No box included.  Price is $410 dollars firm, no lowball offers."

I have for sale an awesome one of a kind Remington 700 in 300 win mag with a 26 inch Stainless steel barrel. For those of you familiar with this round you know it's an elephant killer. This round will reach out to 1,500 yards and has the power to bring down a bear. Fear not it is still great for taking down deer without blowing them to pieces. Now I've done some great modifications to this rifle. To start out I have fitted it with a Axiom TH thumb-hole rifle stock. This aftermarket stock reduces felt recoil up to 85%! That's huge! Check blackhawks website for further info. It's amazing!

On top of that I purchased a Recoil Eliminator from JP Enterprises for this bad boy. Do not be fooled by its appearance. This Recoil Eliminator is all science. It was specifically designed to properly displace pressure as the gas exits the barrel allowing for amazingly low felt recoil. Please check out reviews and JP Enterprises website for even more info. I remember the first time I shot this cannon and I can tell you I felt like my shoulder was going to dislocate. But after these mods I can literally shoot all day long with absolute comfort! It also has an awesome hair trigger. They say a good trigger should scare you and this one definitely will do the trick!
 I've probably shot about 150-200 rounds through this and its a dream to shoot now. Hurry before it's gone!

It also has a Burris Fullfield II 4.5X-14X-42mm scope mounted on it with a Vortex scope level on it as well. Very nice setup as well. This package comes with 40 rounds of Federal 180 grain soft point ammo.

Approx. 200-300 rounds down pipe.  Very reliable and very low muzzle rise.  

This is NOT your typical gas or a piston rifle.     The LR 300 however uses an adapted version of the AR-15's standard direct impingement gas operating system which removes the need for a buffer.
Original LR-300 (LR stands for Long Range) rifles were designed by Alan Zitta as an upgrade to the well known and popular M16 / AR-15 rifle. In fact, LR-300 and Para TTR both use standard AR-15-type lower receivers; only upper receivers are different and contain patented modified gas system. The key reason for that modification was to provide AR-15-type weapon with capability to mount side-folding stock rather than partially collapsible M4 carbine-type stock. Z-M Weapons intended its rifles mostly for military and law enforcement personnel, by offering LR-300-ML weapons with short barrels and select-fire capability."

For sale is a M91/30 Mosin Nagant manufactured in 1942 with correct sling and all matching numbers.  

The action on this Mosin Nagant is smooth and the spring to open the bolt is strong.  All four stenciled serial numbers match: receiver, bolt, butt stock, and magazine floorplate.  The bolt handle is straight.  The cleaning rod is present in the stock.  

I have not had a misfire / FTF or FTE.  It’s a Mosin Nagant – they were made to endure in all climates.  

This rifle fires a 7.62x54R round.  This ammo is cheap, readily available in bulk, and hard hitting enough to drop anything in North America you may need to.  

If I had a cabin and wanted the perfect rifle to store at it this would be on the short list.  It can be used for hunting or for protection.  It can be left at the cabin with a light coat of oil and you don’t have to worry about it not being functional when you need to use it.  If someone breaks in and steals it while you’re out it’s not like they took your one of a kind, limited edition, hand signed Barrett.  You can teach anyone to operate it effectively in about 60-seconds and 10-rounds.  

This time-tested design has seen over 50 years of military service and is still used today throughout the world by Mosin enthusiasts, hunters, survivalists, outdoorsman, hobby shooters, and more.  This rifle was produced in 1942 which means it likely saw service in WW II – it is reported the Russians could not make Mosin Nagants fast enough as the Germans pushed into Russia and at one point the fighting was so close to the factory they had to move the production facility.  

This rifle has a light colored wood, original clean iron sights, and clear factory markings (cartouches) stamped on it. 

 Here are my amateur attempts at interpreting some of the many cartouches: 

Izhevsk Crest on the Barrel shank.  This is a hammer and sickle surrounded by a laurel wreath with an “I” stamped at the base of the wreath.  This is considered a Russian property marking; although I will sell to non-Russians (insert smiley face).  The Izhevsk arrow inside the triangle is also present.  

Rifle will be sold with 1,220-rounds of 7.62x54R ammunition.  That’s enough to kill every zombie in all seasons of The Walking Dead… twice.  Here’s the ammo break down:

Two sealed sardine cans of ammo with 440-rounds in each
One open sardine can of ammo with 340-rounds remaining 

Here are the sites used to verify history and cartouche markings:

The XD(M)® pistol from Springfield Armory® sets the standard for what a polymer pistol can be. The XD(M)® has everything you want and need in a pistol – superior ergonomics, reliable performance, and features that make it easy and intuitive to use. The XD(M)® 3.8” Full Size is the perfect pistol for those who want full-size performance in a slightly shorter package.
The XD(M)® 3.8″ Full Size mates a 3.8″ barrel with a full-sized frame. This means you’ll get the handling and capacity you’d expect from a standard sized pistol, but with a shorter top end for easier carry. The XD(M)® is packed with features. The three interchangeable backstraps mean that no matter what size your hand, the pistol can fit it perfectly. Mega-lock texturing will keep it secure in your grasp, while the dovetail sights align with ease and the minimal reset trigger breaks crisply and cleanly. And when you do send a round downrange, the match-grade barrel will direct it with industry-leading precision.
Whether you’re looking for a pistol based on ergonomics, reliability or features, you’re in the right place. It’s available in a variety of calibers to fit a variety of needs. See what you’re missing and pick up an XD(M)® 3.8” Full-size. It redefines what a polymer pistol can be."
