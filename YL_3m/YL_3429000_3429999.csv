I have owned it for about 50 years.  It is in above average condition.  Everything including the screws appear to be original.  I am not an expert on grading firearms so you will have to judge by the attached photos.  I have never fired it but it appears fully functional.

I refinished the stock with linseed oil about 50 years ago.  (Yeah, I know.)  There is a small chip out of the top left rear of the receiver where it meets the stock. The joint of the stock and receiver is slightly loose.

The rifling depth is good but there is some corrosion in the barrel.  I have never cleaned it.

The Serial Number appears to be: JK255925.  I have been unable to find what year this would have been made.  Model 4’s were made from 1890 - 1933.  Take-down models were first introduced in 1902.  Octagon barrels were discontinued on the Model 4 in August 1924.  This narrows the date for this specific rifle to 1902-1924."

Since 1959 the venerable AR-7 has been the choice of U.S. Air Force pilots who need a small-caliber rifle they can count on should they have to punch out over a remote area. Through the years the AR-7′s reputation for portability, ease of operation and reliability has carried over to the civilian world. Today it’s a favorite of bush pilots, backpackers and backcountry adventurers who, like their Air Force counterparts, need a rifle that’s easy to carry yet has the accuracy to reliably take down small game.

It has night sights that still function, but are dim compared to new. It is a Sig Blue Line gun meaning it is a former LEO weapon. Given that, it is typical condition of carried but shot very little. Some minor finish wear on the slide but not bad by any means and the internals are still clean and it functions perfectly. Mostly looking to see whats out there to trade as I dont shoot this much. Will sell for $400 cash if not trading.

I have approximately had about 500 rounds through this rifle with the majority of those rounds being slow controlled shots at long range. Its an incredibly accurate rifle easily capable with sub-MOA groups as long as you are doing your part (I have had an Aimpoint PRO as well as a Redfield Battlezone on the rifle). With the Redfield, I was able to hit 16"" ringers out at 200-300yds.

Also being a piston driven platform, the bolt and carrier have always stayed immaculate (although I never let more than 2 range trips go by without a thorough cleaning).

I will be including the shims (for suppressor), two keymod rails (with allen wrench), and the case the rifle originally came in. I will also throw in a YHM picatinny bipod adapter.

Nitride Treated:Read about this process bieng better than Chrome lined bores
These barrels have been treated with a Black Nitride treatment (melonite). The result of this process is markedly improved surface properties on ferrous metal parts while maintaining dimensional and shape stability. Metal components treated with Black Nitride have increased wear-resistance, fatigue strength, corrosion resistance, lubricity and cosmetic appeal. Often replacing the more expensive processes of hard chrome or nickel plating, Black Nitride gives better corrosion protection. Additionally, Black Nitride is commonly used as an alternative to high temperature conventional heat treatments such as carburizing and carbonitriding.

Not sure if it shows up well in the pictures, but I did an undercut where the frame meets the trigger guard.  Before doing so, the trigger guard would rub the top of my middle finger raw while shooting it, but now it accommodates larger hands much better.  Originally got it to carry, but I find that I usually grab my G36 for tighter clothing or G17 for looser clothing instead and this one mostly just hangs out in the safe.

I have made up a few of these folding adapters to sell and currently have one available. The pics with the Tapco stock are just for reference on how it looks and how it works. What you get is the item in the first pic. You will need to buy an AR buffer tube to fit your Tapco Butt stock as this will replace the plastic 'tube' assembly that comes from Tapco. Also, make sure you know which tube you need because older Tapco SKS stocks used commercial sizing in the butt stock whereas the newer ones(around 3 years or newer) use mil-spec sizing. If you are not sure do a search on AR mil-spec vs. commercial buffer tube difference and you will find a diagram with the dimensions on it.

EDIT: I have not obtained the stocks to verify, but Tapco has told me the Intrafuse stocks for the Rugers(Mini-14/30 and 10/22) have the same sized cavity for the butt stock tube set up. So, if any of you guys with those rifles and Tapco stocks are interested we could check it to verify fit before you buy.

Price is $35 with you coming to me. Add $5 and I can install it for you. Just bring your stock with the buffer tube over and I'll set it up in about 5-10 minutes. I can also ship it for $5 if you are a little too far away to drive over to my house."

Im asking $1000, but I will accept REASONABLE offers. If I get full asking value, I will throw in an Eotech 552 clone. Trades considered. No revolvers except S&W Governor + cash. Additional pics available on request.

What I have up for sale is an Adams Arms (AARA-16-M-B-556) AA15.  A3 M4 Midlength (9"" hand guard). This is build  #34 off the line for the year in this model.

Gun is 2014 production and was purchased new in April this year. Production premium rifle, not a piece together or factory second.  Has 6 position collapsible stock, new PRO 9"" 1 piece railed, free-float hand guard with anti rotation locks placed (14 rail covers included), and dual-pin 4 position gas block/gas regulator. 1 30 rd mag included. 16"" Melonite treated 4140 chrome line Vanadium VOODOO barrel. 

My costs incurred on the rifle (rounded to nearest $5):

Rifle: $1015.00

Railed forend: $95.00

F.F.L.: $25.00

Tax: $ 80.00

Total : $1,215.00

I put the hand guard on it and will include the original with all delta ring components. Has 16-3/4"" of continuous rail across the top. Other than the factory test fire, I have put 20 rounds downrange bringing the total rounds fired to 21.

This is one sweet rifle and if I didn't have 2, you wouldn't be reading this! The rifle is in near NEW condition, fit, finish and function.

Adams Arms supplies many gun manufacturers with their gas systems because of their reliability. Some that use it for their builds, but not all are: S&W, Spikes Tactical, Sabre Defense, Mega Arms, Core 15, Huldra....you get the picture. 

Chrome lined barrels are great, but its been proven that taking it one step further by treating them with Melonite process makes them that much more reliable, longer lasting AND more accurate. Also makes the barrel 100% corrosion resistant!  Don't take my word for it, look it up for yourself! Lot of 3-gun competitors prefer this rifle!

What I'm offering is the rifle, original hand guard and supplies, 1 mag, rail covers and a Doskosil hard case. No sights. Whats you see in the pics is what you'll get. I WILL NOT HOLD THE RIFLE, sorry. Got burned that way once and lost a sale.

 Mother Russia's most historically proven battle rifle and a popular selling rifle. Rifle is reliable, hard hitting, and extremely accurate. The 7.62x54 round was the Warsaw Pact heavy caliber from the early 20's until modern day, so surplus ammunition is very plentiful and extremely affordable.  This renown cartridge is more powerful than a .308 and  rivals a 30/06 caliber.
