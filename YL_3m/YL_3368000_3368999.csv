Hornady’s Critical Duty ammunition is high-performance full power hollowpoint ammunition not just designed for full-size duty weapons but designed to pass the famous and stringent FBI ballistic protocols.  What are those protocols?



The FBI protocols are a specific set of tests for handgun ammunition where they are fired through a number of intermediate barriers into ballistic gelatin.  Penetration is the only fixed requirement—if the bullet doesn’t penetrate a minimum 12” of ballistic gel after passing through the barrier, it doesn’t pass.  Expansion isn’t required, but the more expansion a bullet shows (provided it penetrates the required distance) the better."

uses a piston and a solid operating  pusher  rod in place of the common gas
tube normally employed in AR15/M16/M4-style weapons. Pioneered by Heckler &
Koch in the G36, HK416, and HK417, this method virtually eliminates
malfunctions common to direct impingement gas systems since hot carbon
fouling and waste gases do not enter the receiver area. The MR762A1 stays
cleaner, reducing heat transfer to the bolt and bolt carrier, and
drastically reducing wear and tear on other critical components. The
service life of all parts is increased substantially. The MR762A1 uses a
barrel produced by Heckler & Koch's famous cold hammer forging process.
This manufacturing process uses the highest quality steel, producing a
barrel that ensures superior accuracy, even after firing thousands of
rounds. The MR762A1 is produced at Heckler & Koch's American manufacturing
facilities from both American and German-made components. The MR762A1 uses
many of the assemblies and accessories originally developed for the
HK416/417 series including adjustable buttstocks, ergonomic pistol grips,
mechanical sights, and the HK free-floating four-quadrant rail
system/handguard. This MIL-STD-1913  Picatinny  type rail system allows all
current accessories, sights, lights, and aimers used on M4/M16-type weapons
to be fitted to the MR series. The HK rail system can be removed without
special tools by the user and ensures 100% return to zero when reinstalled.
Ambidextrous operating controls are standard on the MR762A1, including a
convertible charging handle and an ambidextrous selector lever. The MR762A1
uses the same 10- and 20-round translucent polymer box magazines made for
the HK417."

Im a college kid looking to make my hobby pay for itself. I do hardscaping part-time. I do not currently have all of the ammo finished but can make, upon request, the calibers mentioned in the title. Reloaded ammo is cheaper than factory and much more accurate. I can also custom make ammo if desired or follow my reloading books for the most accurate loads. I mostly use Unique powder.

I bought this knife at the Denver Gun Show over 2 years ago, I carried it for a while and I never use it for anything except to cut open the tape on boxes.

This is heavy duty construction with 6 very small brass screws holding it together, and a pocket clip for easy access when needed.

All you need to do is slide the lever on the side to open & close it, it opens and closes very fast, please use with caution.

This knife is approximately 4 & 5/8"" long closed, 1/2"" thick, 1"" wide, the blade is 3 & 3/8"" long with a weight of 3.9 ounces, this is a heaver than the plastic knifes but it will last 100 times longer, with the pocket clip it is not noticeably heavy.

This knife could save your life if you find yourself in a dangers position in our dally activities, especially at night.

If interested, reply by email or call REDACTED for more information. I would trade for .22 magnum 40 grain ammo.

The compensated model does reduce felt recoil and helps quite a bit with muzzle flip. Gun comes with all factory gear plus a 3rd mag with 30rd capacity. Will also throw in 200 rounds of brass fmj for a quick hassle free sale. Much more invested than the asking price.

The DPM System is about the best guide rod you can buy on the market.

Complete conversion kit (uses hardware directly off factory 10/22) 

ALSO, throwing in a FAB Defense vertical fore grip ($20 value) for free.  The Fore grip matches the stock's pistol grip really well and has a clean look when completely assembled on the 10/22. 

In total this is a $140 value.

I made a minor alteration to the stock where the charging handle is located: out of the box the archangel stock does not allow for the installment of an oversized/aftermarket charging handle, so I dremeled out a small section to allow for it without effecting performance or look. In fact it improved performance because the oversized charging handle is a great upgrade along with auto bolt release.  I would also recommend getting a Volquartsen Automatic Bolt Release (not included). Those 2 mods (bolt and release) made the 10/22 incredibly fun and easy. (Bolt and Release are not included. Those are parts in the actual 10/22 not the stock)"

The only reason I am selling it is because I am looking to get a P228 so if you would like to trade I am open to that as well. 

I bought the pistol from the Sig CPO program last year. The springs and grips were replaced and it was cleaned and inspected by a Sig armorer. Since I have owned it I have only put approx 500 rounds through it and it has functioned flawlessly as you might expect. The pistol is in excellent condition. I don't holster it so there is very little wear, the rails are in great shape and the barrel is clean and bright. 

The date code on the slide is KB (1991) and the serial number is U450-xxx-xxx. In full disclosure the serial numbers on the slide and frame match however the barrel must have been replaced in the CPO program so there is no serial number on it so it is not a 'triple serial"". Regardless it is still the sought after early 90's West German Sig. 

It comes with two 15 round Sig mags, cable lock, manual and red CPO box. 
Asking price is $600. If outside NJ buyer pays actual overnight shipping cost from my FFL to your FFL within 3 days of receiving payment via USPS money order or certified bank check and FFL info. If you live in NJ I will meet for a cash transaction however you must have a valid pistol permit and DL that all match and not have purchased a pistol within 30 days as per NJ statute. 

Let me know if you have any questions or need to see any additional pictures. 
Thanks for looking!"

This is a gun manufactured in Turkey. The barrel is made from one of their defense contractors MKEK. Don't let your familiarity of these weapons discourage you. They are of great quality and a price that you can afford to learn that with. The style is the same as a Baby Eagle and the design is similar to a CZ 75 with comparable quality.
