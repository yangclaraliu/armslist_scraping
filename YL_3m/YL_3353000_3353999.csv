I purchased this gun two years ago. Right after I bought it, I sent it to S&W to lighten the trigger pull (when they were still doing it). They did a fantastic job reducing it to 5 pounds (all within warranty). Then I took it to the range, shot a box of ammo to test it...then clean it, oil it and kept in the safe since that day. Due to the high cost of ammo of the last years, I never shot it again, and focused on my 9mm only. 
Now, turns out that after two years, I realized that I have too many guns , and this is one of the chosen to leave the house..... 
The gun is in excellent conditions. Operationally and cosmetically. Comes with the original box and two magazines.

The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.

TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.

Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.


I've put less than 500 rounds through this gun, function & performance have been absolutely perfect.  Gun comes with 2 mags & all accessories in pictures.

The Type 53s' were made on the same Soviet tooling that was used to make the M44 carbines, but it was sent to communist China after the USSR started transitioning into making AKs, and many of them saw action in Vietnam.  Unfortunately, the Chinese were not very good at fishing their stocks, and the one on this one was pretty rotten and had to be ditched.  

From the pictures you can see that this gun is a little rough, but hey its only 100 bucks for a piece of history with a side folding bayonet! Its a blast to shoot, 7.62x54r is cheap, and if nothing else you could bury this and not feel too bad about it. (kidding!)

This gun was originally purchased for hunting and Skeet shooting. I have never been able to find the time to hunt and only manage to shoot skeet maybe 1 -2 times year. This gun cycles very smoothly and can take 2 3/4 and 3 inch shells. It has a 24 inch barrel. I was told its the perfect gun for hunting duck and other fowl. If thats what your interested in then you cant go wrong with this purchase. I have the manual and some choke tube accessories for it to. Since it mostly just sits in the safe have decided to sell it. My gun interest has shifted slightly towards tactical firearms so I would be willing to discuss trades. Text 2I6- 6o9- 774I for more details"

62E has an IFR certified GPS, 3EL has an S-Tec auto pilot. Maintenance, inspections, and insurance is all handled by the club. Why rent when you can own a share of 2 airplanes? When you join, your immediate family is also a member. We've had a member teach their family members to fly.

Monthly dues are $65, with flight time being $70/hr wet. We also have a club instructor for $25/ hour. This is why we were featured in the AOPA article, ""Flying as cheaply as possible.""

Here's what their website says about it:

Stoeger 8000 Cougar Pistols: Champions of Tactical Reliability

The new Stoeger 8000 Cougar semi-auto pistols inherit the reputation of the original Beretta 8000 as reliable, durable and powerful. First designed primarily for tactical undercover work, the Cougar is now carried by a growing number of police officers as their official duty sidearm thanks to its ergonomics, low recoil and inherent accuracy. The original Beretta Cougar was NATO qualified and boasted a long service-life of more than 30,000 9mm rounds. In its new incarnation, Beretta has developed an ergonomically-advanced pistol that is compact but capable of handling high-power cartridges, offering high magazine capacity and giving a long service life. This has been possible also thanks to the innovative adaptation of a locked-breech system with a rotating barrel. Today, the new Stoeger 8000 Cougar pistol is manufactured by the Stoeger Silah Sanayi A.S., strictly in line with the most traditional Beretta quality control and attention to detail.


Low Recoil

Upon firing this pistol, shooters are amazed by the low felt recoil. This is due to two factors working together. The first is the rotating barrel system, which dissipates recoil radially rather than directing it into the shooter’s hand. The second is the central block, which absorbs the mechanical recoil from the barrel and the slide before this is transferred to the frame. When the Cougar is in battery, the positive lock-up of barrel to slide assures perfect alignment of barrel and sights. Upon firing, the barrel travels and rotates with axial movement. Besides low recoil, the result is superior accuracy and quicker recovery for follow-up shots.


Advanced Ergonomics for Easy Handling, Control, Concealment

The Cougar is one of the most ergonomically advanced pistols in its class. The user-friendly, contoured frame and grips make the Cougar exceptionally easy to control during firing. By taking hand anatomy and instinctive hold into account, the Cougar accommodates smaller hands and also protects larger hands from being bitten by the slide. All edges are rounded or beveled, and are carefully finished to make the Cougar virtually snag-proof and exceptionally easy to draw and conceal.


Different Configurations to Suit Most Tactical Needs

The Cougar L Type P is conceived to deliver high firepower in F or D (Double Action Only) operating systems. F models have the same safety features of the famous Beretta 92 FS pistol: external ambidextrous manual safety with decocking lever, trigger bar disconnect, rotating firing pin striker, firing pin block device and loaded-chamber indicator. The double-action-only D versions have the firing pin block device and the loaded-chamber indicator but no manual safety, thereby offering a super-smooth, exceptionally snag-free side. Both versions are manufactured in 9 mm or .40 caliber to satisfy the different needs of police officers and concealed-carry permit holders.
The 8000 Cougar L 9mm pistol, available in F or D configurations, features the same rotating barrel system of the full-size Cougar L Type P; the difference is in the shortened grip frame that houses a 13-round, high-capacity double-stack magazine. The beveled slide and the reduced dimensions and weight also make this model ideal for undercover work."

If you're into milsurp guns or WW2 weapons, you know what this is! The rifle is a 1936 Tula, and has all of the distinguishing characteristics of an SCW. This has been affirmed by other Mosin collectors as well!
This particular SCW is definitely a ""shooter-grade"" collector piece, as opposed to something so rare you can't even touch it. Own history and be able to use it too! This rifle might've been carried by the Lincoln Brigade in Spain, who knows. Not me or you, that's who!

We cater to all levels of experience and our classroom setting is a 100% hands-on approach to firearms and our students go hands-on multiple times during this course to ensure safety principles and fundamentals are being executed before live firing of a pistol is introduced. 

  Upon completion of classroom portion our students are given a written examination in accordance with Illinois State Police training standards and are dismissed to the gun range immediately following the grading of the exam. Generally the classroom portion runs until 5pm but may run slightly later based upon class size and comprehension of the material.

637,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3353637,For Sale/Trade:  Hornady .22 cal seating die,"North West Omaha, Omaha, Nebraska",$ 15,"Listed On: Sunday, August 31, 2014",Reloading,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Had a ruined full length sizer (my fault), had to buy a new die. Needed to get back to reloading and shipping would take to long. Decided to just buy another die set. Now I have a second .22 cal seating die that I have no use for.

I believe it is the 3.7"" seater, which would be Hornady part number 044102. Hornady's site: http://www.hornady.com/store/22-Cal-.224-Seating-Die-3.7-1-Each/ I'm not 100% on that, it could be the 4"". The outside of the die measures 3.9"" full length, so I'm guessing it's the 3.7""

This would be the die meant for .22 cal bullets, not cartridge specific. It will work for commons like .222rem, .223rem, 22-250 as well as some of the less common .22 cal cartridges.

If you have never used a Hornady seating die, they are amazing. They have a free floating sleeve that aligns the bullet BEFORE it reaches the seating stem. Say goodbye to crocked bullets and crushed cases!

I also love Hornady's lock rings over RCBS's, they don't use a brass screw into the threads that strips out. They squeeze tight around the threads with a steel ring and screw.

This would be great for someone who plans on loading wildcat cartridges, is loading for a bolt action (so only will be using a neck sizer), or someone who wants to upgrade to a nicer seater die then what they have.

Will come with the Hornady plastic case, the instructions, and the brand new seating die. MSRP is $23.79. Midway sells them for $20.49. 
I'm asking $15. In no hurry to sell, just figured I'd post it since I don't need it."

Detailed Review - http://www.tactical-life.com/magazines/special-weapons/sig-sauer-556-swat-556mm/

SIG 556 SWAT features the same high-performance two position adjustable gas piston operating rod system engineered by SIG’s sister company Swiss Arms and marries it to a trigger housing that not only cuts the rifle’s weight by a pound but is designed to accept standard AR magazines. The SIG 556 SWAT features a 16” military grade cold hammer forged barrel, chambered in 5.56mm NATO, with a twist rate of 1 in 7”. The high performance flash suppressor provides enhanced flash reduction and features an ACME type thread for compatibility with select industry sound suppression devices. The flash suppressor retains a standard .5 x 28 TPI thread pattern, ensuring compatibility with after-market accessories. The vented tactical quad rail forearm is machined from aircraft grade aluminum alloy and hard coat anodized for durability. The quad rail features four integrated Picatinny rails for mounting a wide range of accessories. The Picatinny rail equipped receiver is made of high strength carbon steel with a durable wear-resistant Nitron® X rifle finish. The rifle comes standard with the flip up combat front and rear sight system. The trigger housing is machined from an aircraft grade aluminum alloy forging with a hard-coat anodized finish designed to survive extreme conditions. The rifle comes equipped with a smooth two-stage trigger, ambidextrous safety and is designed to accept standard AR magazines. A 30-round magazine is supplied with each rifle. The rifle features the MAGPUL CTR Carbine Buttstock. This buttstock is adjustable for length of pull and features a unique locking mechanism that friction locks the stock to the receiver extension for zero movement. The ergonomically designed pistol grip features an integrated storage compartment. The rifle also includes the Grip-Light vertical forend grip which features a removable tactical LED flashlight and mounts directly to the quad rail forends.

abuse and pounding that police departments inflict on their gear. It has a 
metal trigger assembly versus the Express's plastic assembly. The Police 
Magnum also has heavier springs (7 lb. sear disconnect spring versus's the 
Express's 5 lb. disconnect spring). The Police Magnum has a 22 inch 
magazine spring versus a 16 inch magazine spring in the Express. 
The Police gun comes with a heavier lifter spring. Each Police Magnum 
comes with front and rear sling swivel studs. These are just some of the 
differences in the two guns. Remember, you get exactly what you pay for. 
Both models function the same and digest the same ammo, so if you are 
inclined to inflict this type of punishment on your guns then consider a 
Police Magnum. Otherwise the Express model will serve you very well.

The barrels are in excellent condition inside and out with the only wear mark being on the lower barrel where it contacts the forearm.  The stock has a few very small blemishes, but is in an overall great condition.  The action shows no signs of wear and is still tight enough that gravity alone cannot break the action out of battery.  

The gun is the standard invector model and I have several extra flush mount choke tubes and a choke wrench that go with it.

It will also come with the factory box, paperwork, zipper sleeve, spare 7 round factory Ruger mag, and a leather/ kydex hybrid holster.

There is nothing wrong with it, just looking for something different to carry for a bit. It does have some slight holster wear on the slide from carrying but is barely noticeable. I've probably only fired 100 rounds give or take through it.

To give an idea of value,  gander sells it with the Laserguard installed for 599.99. (They're overpriced though. And I got them separately.) Holster was a good deal at $35. Extra mag was $48! But that's Ruger for ya... Of course it is used, but you get the idea."

Upgrades to gun:

-Has Krebs custom enhanced safety lever with ""bolt hold open"" feature  so you can operate safety with the shooting hand still on the pistol grip 
- Hogue OD green pistol grip with built in/removable storage compartment inside grip
- Magpul AFG angled foregrip in OD green with adjustable/ removable finger grooves
- lightweight, polymer quad rail/ picatinny/ weaver rail, so you can easily mount your favorite optics, lasers, flashlight etc...
- integrated sling swivels
- shark fin front sight vs the typical front post style sight
- elevation/ wind age adjustable read leaf site with adjustable set screw
- solid, 1 piece construction, MILLED! Not stamped receiver!  Made right here in the good old U.  S.  of A. 
- Tapco G2 DOUBLE hook fire control group/ trigger which I particularly like.  Super crisp light trigger pull with positive reset. Pleasure and easy to pull 
- AK recoil buffer installed onto the BCG/ spring which drasticallyyyyyyyyyy reduces recoil and muzzle climb.  Seriously google it if you want. This little 14$ upgrade might arguably be the best single upgrade purchased for this piece.  Wayyyy less recoil.  This and the AFG and you're good. 
- Tapco custom retaining plate instead of cheap AK shepherds crook 
-Tapco  birdcage flash hider (AR style) built for this piece.  Really spreads the pattern of the fireball that comes out the muzzle  in a cool X pattern like the ARs do. 
- CHROME LINED BARREL, shoot all the cheap commie steel ammo you want, this puppy can eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner. 
- a 3 point sling included 
- nice floating gun bag with 4 mag pouches and storage zipper made by Bulldog 

This gun has been pampered and cleaned thoroughly after every outing.  Probably around 700 rounds down the pipe   I have upgraded everything for reliability and performance  and long lasting use.  This was my primary SHTF piece and got it just the way it should be to make it through that scenario.  I love the ak platform and have 2 Serbian/ Yugo ak variants and want to get rid of this one and buy another different ak so I can have all yugo/ Serb aks.  I'm Serbian and love our line of ak variants and want them all now!  This is a great piece and quality made with quality made upgrades. EVERY single time I go to the range with this piece I get crowds of people asking about it and wondering what it is. It looks like robo cops gun.  People love it. I love it.  And have let those spectators shoot my gun to their surprise and let everyone enjoy it.  This is a piece to enjoy and share with others.  So that's what I did and plan to do by selling it or trading so I can get my next project.   A zastava pap m92 ak pistol.  Which is cheaper than the one I have.  But I want one. I will also entertain the zastava pap m85 ak pistol chambered in 223/556
Guns should be fun, and you should enjoy shooting them, and they should also protect your home and family.  This piece fits the bill, great for home scenarios with its short body and barrel.  Easily maneuverable in tight places.  And it's classified as a pistol, not a rifle.   It's a pistol in rifle caliber. Must have FOID card to purchase.  No FOID, don't contact me. I might entertain an offer for an AR just because I kinda want one.  Text me for updated pictures.  These are kind of old and don't depict all external upgrades.  Will happily text you back. That the easiest form of contact. I will definitely message you back.    Just say your name and tell me you're contracting me about the armslist post. Ray @ REDACTED text all day or night I don't sleep until late at night."

She tells me today she decided she'd really rather have a pistol. So it's up for sale now to fun toward something else. Looking for cash really, not particularly interested in trades at this time.

I just paid $250+tax for the gun. Buds has it listed at $236 their cash price, $243 with card. I'll beat that at $225 cash, but I'm firm at that price. Anything less and I'll just hang onto it. It's literally still new in box, unfired. I can text pics if you want, gun still has original box etc, black synthetic stock with blued (black) barrel and receiver. Lasermax laser seems to be really nice and laser also has a rail on it for light attachment. Probably a fun little gun. Enjoy as is, mod it, or hell buy it and sell the laser off of it and have an even cheaper 10/22!

Again, $225 cash firm takes it. About what you'd pay for a regular 10/22 at most shops and you're avoiding tax!"

First opened the box it was a sight to behold much nicer than pictures show. M16 style is very well incorporated into this 12 gauge and with the integrated butt pad very little recoil. Hip firing is quite enjoyable an accurate, shot leaves the barrel as fast as you can pull the trigger. Yet to have a single shell that won't feed. Overall great quality appearance accuracy an overall value.

This has quickly become my favorite shotgun. It has fired over 150 rounds and has performed flawlessly. Dis assembly for cleaning is easy and simple. The weapon shots great, is very accurate and just feels right when you fire it. You won't get a better weapon at twice the price. Great product and the price makes it a steal.

Finally had a chance to see what the Linberta could do. Took it out in the hills so I could avoid any range rules. Great gun! Not a single mis feed, or fire. Broke it in with 00. Lots of fun and a great looking gun. Where can you get this kind of gun for $400? I'm in Calif.

Got this gun and loaded it up, found some types of 2 3/4"" ammo (Winchester) will only fit 4 in the tube while others (federal) will allow the advertised 5 to fit. Probably not Linberta's fault. Started shooting with some low 2 3/4 dram federal birdshot, and experienced a failure to eject on the second shot. Maybe part of break in? Ran the rest of the box of 25 2 3/4 dram without any issues, then 5 rounds of 00 buckshot, no issues, rapid fire as fast as I could. Later that night ran another 100 rounds of mixed federal and Winchester 3 dram birdshot without a hitch. Shot it upside down, behind my back, from the hip, on each side, this thing ran awesome! It's totally a keeper, very happy with this gun!

Out of the box this gun is awesome.... looks great...feels great... solid grip that feels good in your hand ... pictures on this item are dead on... smooth action...has more safety features built into it then I expected.... recoil is minimum and it shoots flawlessly.... overall an awesome gun for the price ....Before the purchase I talked with the LInberta rep...Very helpful.... gun came with items listed on description....and of course came with a shell belt... the gun was longer than I thought but the tactical effects on the gun are really cool....this is one bad ass gun...another issue is ammo. hell around here you can’t find any pistol ammo...but 12 gauge is still reasonably priced and easy to find...and the ability to rapid fire 5-6 rounds with this is awesome

The MFI Fake Suppressor for HK pistols are designed for real weapons. They will also fit replica & airsoft weapons with appropriate adapters. These do not suppress sound in any way and are 100% legal for the regular civilian to own in all 50 US States.
MFI Fake Suppressor means:
No $200.00 Tax Stamp
No special licence needed
No FBI background check needed
No wait 3-6 months for BATF transfer or approval
The MFI fake suppressors are made specifically to take the punishment from live fire! Unlike lesser quality mock silencers made for the HK pistols the MFI version allows the weapon to cycle without jamming!
FROM GG&G WEB SITE: There is little doubt that weapon mounted tactical flashlights are an all important accessory for urban combat. GG&G manufactures over 20 different tactical flashlight adapters and mounts for various weapon systems including the GG&G USP adapter. There is also little doubt that the HK USP handgun is one of the ten best handguns manufactured. Unfortunately, HK chose to manufacture the dust cover integral mounting rail to only accept the URL flashlight. Besides being very expensive, large and heavy, the URL lacks the flexibility to be mounted to other weapon systems. GG&G has engineered a HK compact flashlight mounting rail adapter for Streamlight TLR-1/2 , ITI M3/M6, All Viridian and Surefire flashlight or light/laser combos.
Our highly regarded design engineering staff developed an innovative and clever mount to interface the TLR-1 and 2, ITI M3/M6, All Viridian Surefire models and with the USP standard and compact handguns in a small and lightweight package. As can be seen in the photographs, the GG&G Slim Line USP Flashlight Mount fits tightly to the USP trigger guard allowing the TLR, M, Viridian and Surefire series rear rocker switches to be activated by the fire control finger or the thumb of the off hand. The Slim Line USP Flashlight Mount rail adapter is available for the full-size and compact USP handguns. The GG&G Slim Line USP HK Flashlight Mount consists of a three piece lightweight aluminum adapter that easily clamps over the existing USP light rails. The installation only requires a small wrench. The rail fits tight enough to retain zero of the light/laser. The GG&G Slim Line USP Flashlight Mount is machined from solid billet 6061 T6 aircraft-grade aluminum alloy using modern CNC machinery. It is then Type III hard-coat anodized matte black per mil-spec for combat durability.
FROM THE H&K FACTORY WEB SITE: Enhanced versions of the USP, the USP Tactical models are designed for users who need the features found on the HK Mark 23, but in a more compact pistol. Both pistols approach the precision found on the Mark 23 by adding an extended threaded barrel, adjustable trigger, and adjustable target-type sights.
Features & System Characteristics:
Threaded barrel with polygonal bore profile
High profile target sights
Target sights with micrometer adjustment for windage and elevation
One piece machined, nitro-carburized steel slide
Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
Patented HK recoil reduction system
Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame
Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines
Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories
Ambidextrous magazine release lever
Extended slide release
Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator
Patented Lock-Out Safety device

The rifle is almost new with less than 300 rounds fired (primarily to test fire the rifle at various ranges). The contrast of Black and Flat Dark-Earth looks very nice and the rifle's competition muzzle brake coupled with a 4 lb. single stage trigger with a light hammer allows the shooter to maintain accuracy while firing multiple rounds in rapid fire or follow-on shots. The rifle's high quality compensator keeps muzzle rise to a minimum while the heavy 5 oz. buffer weight all but eliminates the rifle's recoil.
