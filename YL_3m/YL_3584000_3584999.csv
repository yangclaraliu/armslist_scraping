Brand new in the box, MSRP $1,899.00, Sig 1911 Fastback limited edition designed for 5.11 Tactical. They are just about to stop production of these pistols.

It features a Flat Dark Earth  (FDE) finish, flat trigger at @4lbs, custom VZ G10 Piranha grips, a rounded butt and MSH, a 4.2"" barrel on a full sized, rounded grip, and custom Novak style Viking Tactical V-Tac sights. The sights are a combination of green fiber optics on top, only visible in the light, and tritium fiber optic 3 dot combat sights at the bottom. They are tritium, only, no white dots, so they are only visible at night. They also have a tactical ledge on the rear sight to rack the slide off belt, table top or whatever is handy.  The pistol is chambered in .45acp.

I ordered this as a carry gun, and changed my mind about carrying something so hideously expensive after I ordered it.  Absolutely brand new, only test fired by Sig. I haven't even opened the slide or messed with it, to keep it absolutely new in the box. 

I am offering this new pistol for only $1,000, so if you've wanted one of these but didn't want to dish out anywhere from $1,400 to $1,900 for one -- if you could even find one -- this is your chance. I'm not a range gun or safe queen kind of guy. If I can't carry it or won't use it for home defense, it goes.

Not much to photograph with it in the plastic, etc., so I'm attaching some photos from Sig's website. Everything comes with as from the factory, and I can even show you the invoice showing that it was shipped directly from Sig on Thursday, October 2, 2014. This is brand new, unracked, etc. 

I am in the Western Cook burbs, Brookfield-LaGrange area. FOID, FTF, cash only, ISP check and 72 hour waiting period will be observed. 

EDIT:  I pulled the ad because I had an agreement with a buyer meet face to face to complete the transaction later this week.  He just called and canceled, so it is again available."

This is a rare opportunity to save hundreds on a world class Nightforce scope and the matching Nightforce Ultralight rings. I hate to part with it, but with a baby on the way, I'm forced to sell. Save 20%+ for a LIGHTLY USED scope. The scope has only been used at the range, off of a bench, 5 times. The scope has always been covered when not in use. The scope will come with everything that came with it: scope, bikini cover, lens cleaning cloth, reticle description and 1.00"" rings.

This really is an awesome scope. But I have to reduce the collection. That is why it needs a new home. 

Manufacturers info:

What’s in a name? In this case, everything. Our all-new ATACR™—Advanced Tactical Riflescope—builds upon the long and successful history of our NXS™ series. The result is a riflescope of unprecedented long-range capability and image quality.

Exit Pupil Diameter:	5x
Field Of View:	5x
Eye Relief:	3.54in (90 mm)

The 34mm tube allows 120 MOA/34.9 Mils of elevation adjustment—20% more than our most capable NXS™. Fully multi-coated ED glass results in light transmission values of over 90%, brilliant images and exceptional color contrast. A magnification range of 5x to 25x, and a wider field of view as a result of its unique optical prescription (17.96 feet at 5x) will cover virtually any situation a shooter could encounter.
 All this power comes in a compact package, too, measuring just 14.3″ in length. Our patented ZeroStop® is standard, and the ATACR™ is offered with two of our most sophisticated reticles, leaving nothing to chance.
 The ATACR™ redefines the “long” in long range for serious shooters and hunters, pushing the envelope of precision…and possiblity.

The following is info on the included rings:

Ultralight Rings (retails at $184)
Nightforce Ultralite™ Rings - 34mm - 4 screw pattern
Part Number	                                                           Description

When a tough, reliable mounting system is required without adding substantial weight, Nightforce Ultralite rings are the answer. They feature CNC machined 7075- T6 hard anodized aluminum bodies and titanium beta series crossbolts and jaws. This unique construction provides exceptional strength, normally not found in lightweight rings. Testing has proven that this combination is actually stronger than steel."

The debut of the full-size P-09 last year brought refined lines and interchangeable backstraps to our polymer Omega line. This year the compact-sized P-07 follows suit, with new features and a nitrated slide finish that wears longer and has increased corrosion resistance. The pistol as a whole has been dehorned, removing any sharp edges to make it more comfortable for all-day carry.

Like the P-09, the P-07’s safety and decocker are interchangeable with a few minutes and minimal tools. Add to that small, medium and large backstraps and an integrated 1913 Picatinny rail on the dust cover and the P-07 is adaptable to the shooter and their needs, from service pistol to bedside protector to the envy of the shooting range.

The P-07 shares the P-09’s updated trigger shape which is more comfortable for long days at the range, as well as its snag-free hammer and forward cocking serrations. Metal 3-dot sights and a beefed up magazine spring round out the bevy of updates, resulting in the best P-07 we’ve had to date.

Note- Some CZ-USA dealers order special versions that vary from the standard configuration. This might be a difference in sights, safety mechanisms, finish or accessory package. From time to time you may find a P-07 with an extended barrel, tactical light, tritium sights or safety levers only. There are a number of special versions we ship throughout the year.

Featuring an integral 1913 accessory rail on the dust cover, rubber grip panels, and CZ’s corrosion resistant black polycoat finish, the SP-01 is the newest model to join the family of pistols based on the CZ 75 (SA/DA) platform. Borrowing from the improved grip geometry of the compact P-01, the SP-01 utilizes an extended beavertail to protect shooter’s strong hand as well as allowing for a deeper and more secure grip. The new grip geometry, checkering in key areas on the front and back straps, and redistribution of mass provided by the accessory rail noticeably decrease the perceived recoil from previous models and allows for more rapid target acquisition and transition.

The SP-01 was designed as a military and law enforcement duty sidearm. The new model is currently in use by security forces fighting the war on terrorism. Thanks to its exceptional accuracy and superior handling characteristics, the CZ 75 SP-01 has also found supporters in the field of sport and target shooting. Its list of users on the competition circuit include World Champions Adam Tyc and Angus Hobdell (1st and 3rd place respectively in 2005‘s IPSC championship, World Shoot XIV).

The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. 

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.

The Henry Lever Action rifle features an extremely attractive American walnut stock, the quality of which can only be found on guns three times the price. The action is exceptionally smooth, so smooth many first timers remark that they cannot believe the rifle has any internal parts. You simply have to get one into your own two hands and cycle the action a few times to see for yourself.

Modern Sporting Rifle ANSCHÜTZ MSR RX 22™

ANSCHÜTZ semi-automatic precision rifle with a .22 l.r. caliber

ANSCHÜTZ target rifles are known worldwide for their accuracy, precise construction and unmatched shooting performance. The excellent characteristics that allowed ANSCHÜTZ sporting equipment to dominate national and international competitions such as the biathlon since 1856 can also be found in the new ANSCHÜTZ semi-automatic precision rifle with a .22 l.r. caliber. The MSR RX 22 is a joint development by three German companies: ANSCHÜTZ, GERMAN SPORT GUNS and ESC Ulm.

The goal of this cooperation was to develop and produce a highly accurate semi-automatic rifle with excellent shooting performance that is suitable for the dynamic disciplines as well as precision shooting at the shooting clubs BDS, BDMP, DSB, DSU and VdRBw. The resulting product is an all-round sports device for discerning customers.

The ANSCHÜTZ MSR RX 22 model is a modern small-calibre, self-loading rifle with a .22 l.r. caliber. It contains a force-locking blowback action with a hammer lock. This weapons system made by German Sport Guns is well known, sophisticated and has been sold 150000 times.

The MSR RX 22 uses an ANSCHÜTZ sports barrel as well as a high-quality trigger system with an adjustable trigger weight from approx.  1500 g – 2500 g.

During development and design, care was taken to ensure that all operating elements are installed on both sides of the weapon. This ensures equally good operation for left- and right-handed shooters."

The BDA-380 Pistol was introduced in 1977 (and discontinued in 1997) as a compact and lightweight pistol for police and civilian use. The gun was manufactured in Italy under contract from FN Herstal (Belgium) and marketed as FN model 140DA (in Europe) or Browning BDA 380 (in USA). Some sources said that BDA 380 is a copy of Beretta 84, but close inspection shows some differences (i.e. Beretta 84 has frame mounted safety while BDA 380 has slide mounted safety). The manufacture of the BDA 380 was ceased circa 1997. It was adopted by Belgian police.

The BDA 380 is a blowback operated, double action semi automatic pistol. It has aluminium alloy frame and steel slide. Ambidextrous slide mounted safety switch disconnects the trigger from the hammer when engaged. The pistol featured low profile fixed sightst and was available in either polished steel or blued finish, with wooden grip panels."

It was designed by Robert Hillberg, based on his earlier work on the Hillberg Insurgency Weapon. It was manufactured by the now defunct COP Inc. of 3040 West Lomita Blvd., Torrance, California (COP stood for Compact Off-Duty Police). The double action weapon is only slightly larger than the typical .25 automatic pistol, which made it a good choice for a defensive weapon or a police backup gun.

Construction and operation of the COP 357

The COP 357 is quite robust in design and construction. It is made of solid stainless steel components. Cartridges are loaded into the four separate chambers by sliding a latch that ""pops-up"" the barrel for loading purposes, similar to top-break shotguns. Each of the four chambers has its own dedicated firing pin. It uses an internal hammer, which is activated by depressing the trigger to hit a ratcheting/rotating striker that in turn strikes one firing pin at a time. Older ""pepperboxes"" also used multiple barrels, but the barrels were the part that rotated. The COP 357 is unique in that it uses the ratcheting/rotating striker, which is completely internal, to fire each chamber in sequence.

The weapon has appeared in numerous films, including Blade Runner, The Matrix Reloaded, and Bad Boys.

Norman, REDACTED
Hey all,
So I just picked up a little lot of this 25 acp ammo yesterday and was just planning on shooting it or sticking it in the ammo can. However, i noticed that a few of these are really old boxes and actually still have the ammo inside (only one of them isn’t full and it has rounds in it as well. So, Being as i am not a collector of the older boxes, I would rather get them to someone who does want them for their history rather than they “bang” effect. So I am offering these up for trade for 25 auto ammo. That being said, I will not trade for aluminum cased ammo unless it is a little better in my favor. I would also trade for jhp 25 ammo. I do not have a brand preference per se, but i just want them to be “newer” and in good condition (IE I’m not going to trade for your old corroded coffee can ammo). This is for pickup in Norman only. These all are pre “keep out of reach of children” as well
Here is what I have and their quantity of bullets contained inside. Please refer to pictures for the designs and appearances of the boxes:
2- 50 round boxes of Remington Dupont ""Kleanbore Priming"" 25 auto, both boxes are full and the ammo still looks great and shiny
1- 50 round box of Winchester “OilProof” 25 auto, box is full and ammo looks good
2- 25 round boxes of Geco “OilProof” 25 auto all are shiny and look good (the whole box looks to be in german, so i can’t tell the specific type)
1- 8rd box of Peters Dupont “Rustless” 25 auto, cartridges are “dingy” in appearance but not overly corroded. (wanting to trade this one for a full box of 25, given its greater ago)
To arrange a meet up shoot me a text at REDACTED and we can go from there. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

Professionally re-built with an E.Arthur Brown heavy stainless steel barrel, heavy bolt and compensator. Truly a one of a kind Ruger. 

For those that may not know, HM2 17 caliber rounds fit in standard Ruger 10/22 magazines but this round packs a lot more powder, speed and power. It truly is a MACH 2 round - hence the HM2 designation and the need for ""re-inforcement"" inside the standard Ruger 10/22 housing to handle the additional pressure.

The durable cold-hammered steel slide and barrel are coated with GLOCK's high tech Tenifer 64 HRC surface treatment. Safe Action trigger system teams a trigger safety, trigger bar, and firing pin lock that automatically deactivate one after another as the trigger engages. The barrel's rounded interior profile offer easier cleaning and longer lasting precision. Loaded chamber indicator. Built-in mounting rails for tactical lights or laser sights. Double action.
