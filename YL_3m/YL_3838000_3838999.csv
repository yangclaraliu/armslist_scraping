The Model 22-4 was built to directly chamber rimless pistol cartridges like the .45 ACP and the .45 GAP but allows for use with moon clips.[1] The Model 22-4 is a large frame double-action revolver chambered in .45 ACP using half or full moon clips. It may also use .45 Auto Rim as they were designed for revolvers chambered in .45 ACP or .45 GAP using the half or full moon clips. Built around Smith & Wesson's large N frame, it was originally sold as the Model 1950 and is normally fitted with a 5½"" barrel with no under lug and fixed combat sights. The Model 22 was re-introduced as the second limited production Thunder Ranch revolver in 2007. This gun features a 4"" match barrel with under lug, fixed sights, coccobolo grips, and an internal lock. The popularity of this revolver led S&W to continue its production in its classic line as the 22-4. It is quite an accurate revolver and has a smoother trigger pull than the original, most likely due to improvements in production. The listed revolver has a weapons grade hard chrome brushed finish"

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Hey all, 
Im looking for a new ""project"" of sorts. I am looking for a 12 gauge pump (preferably mossberg but open to most) in the 100-225 range. That isnt a ""hard cap"" but for me to go more than that it needs to be ""very worth it"". Mainly because higher than that I can go into academy/wal mart and buy a new one to modify. I am fine with used and ""ugly"", just needs to function perfectly. What I want to do is make it into a ""home defense"" shotgun with the ability to swap on a slug barrel or use the provided barrel for hog hunting. As such, i prefer it to have more traditional sights or at least a rail to mount a red dot on for that use. I know about what they go for new/used so please dont try and sell me your used savage for 175+. Shoot me a message on here or a text at REDACTED and we can try and go from there. I would actually prefer an ""ugly"" gun as it would let me add a touch of my own ""paint scheme"" to it instead of a purely factory bolt on look. I have cash and or trades on hand.I need to meet in norman if possible, but that isnt a deal breaker. 
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

If I don't sell it by Tuesday evening it will just go back in the safe.

Maverick 88 12 gauge shotgun, configured for Home Defense, great condition, only had 10 rounds fired, I am the original owner.

This is an excellent Home Defense shotgun, as well as a fun range toy.  For those that don't know, the Maverick 88 is a less expensive version of the Mossberg 500, and takes most of the same accessories and is arguably as reliable.  I honestly don't know what the actual difference is.

I installed a pistol grip, adjustable AR-type stock with rubber shoulder pad (nice and comfy to shoot), top mount rail, TruGlo red dot, and very bright ""tactical"" flashlight up front.  I have used the light far more than the shotgun!

Will also come with the pictured Bulldog Nylon tactical carry bag, 185 rounds of 00 Buckshot (Mostly RIO brand), 10 rounds of PDX1 Home Defense ammo, and a Molle 25 round ammo pouch.  Basically, all of my remaining shotgun stuff, going now.
Bring this little baby home before the holidays, or as a last minute gift to yourself or loved one for only $250!  If you don't want the ammo and carry bag, I'll take $200 for just the shotgun and all attached stuff (red dot, flashlight, stock).  Unfortunately, I can not find the original plastic standard rifle type stock anymore, so you can't have that.

$250 for everything, only listing until Tuesday evening, FTF near Worcester/Millbury/Uxbridge.  Again, if I sell this it needs to be gone and paid for by Tuesday evening, otherwise I'm keeping it.  No trades please.

All laws followed! First with cash takes it, no I won't hold it til after Christmas, thanks."

In 1999 Smith and Wesson introduced the VE series. These models were billed as 'enhanced' and featured an improved grip, improved trigger, and enlarged ejection port. This model returned to the black coloration of the polymer frame mated with a stainless steel or black melonite slide.

At this time Smith and Wesson retired the 4.5 inch barrel and switched all Sigmas to the 4.0 inch barrel. Sigmas from this era onward are considered '2nd generation' Sigmas. Shortly after the introduction of the VE series, Smith and Wesson further improved it by adding an accessory rail but did not change the model number to reflect this update.

Used but in excellent condition.  This is a drop in fit for your Remington 700 Short Action rifle with any factory barrel profile.  Green with black web.  No complaints about this stock.  It was a huge step up from the Hogue stock that came on my SPS AAC-SD.  Its been on this gun for about 8 months...maybe 400 total rounds fired.  I need to sell it to help finance a new chassis system that has my attention.

Face to face in the Portland area preferred.  I'll throw it in a box for you and ship in the US for a total price of $200.  Comes with the original factory installation instruction sheet.

It is nearly a foot shorter than conventional sniper rifles, maintains 1/2 MOA or better accuracy with DTM Ammunition, and can be easily adapted to individual mission requirements by changing the weapon’s caliber and length. Whether a police sniper is shooting 50 yards or a military sniper is shooting a mile the SRS offers unrivaled flexibility in a package shorter than the M16 battle rifle.



Details

Accuracy
The SRS achieves superb accuracy in all calibers because it's built around core accuracy components:

1. Match grade (free-floated) barrels, chambers, and crowns
2. High quality match trigger
3. Solid, repeating return-to-zero barrel mounting system (the receiver securely clamps around the first six inches of barrel)

Quick Caliber Conversion
The SRS is quickly convertible between the following calibers: .308 Winchester (22"" and 26"" barrels), .260 Remington, 6.5x47 Lapua, 7mm Winchester Short Mag, .300 Winchester Magnum, .338 Norma Magnum, and .338 Lapua Magnum. The caliber conversion and return to zero is simple and takes less than 60 seconds.
Benefits:
1. Operators can change rifle length, penetration, and distance capabilities.
2. Snipers can shoot various ammo calibers and types depending on METT-T.
3. Snipers can progressively train on more powerful ammo.
4. Reduced training costs (train and practice with .308 WIN)
5. Reduced system down-times (the operator can change his own barrels).

Compact
The SRS is the shortest purpose-built sniper rifle in the world. The telescoping bolt and bullpup configuration make it almost a foot shorter than conventional Mauser-style turnbolt sniper rifles. The compact design shifts weight and center-of-gravity rearward, creating a perfectly balanced and relatively short sniper rifle.

Rugged
The SRS was designed to operate under the harshest conditions and abuse. It is built of high-impact polymers; aircraft grade aluminum (ANSI 7075-T6); ultra high-strength steels; and some of the most durable coatings known to man. The monolithic receiver serves as a full length mounting chassis, eliminating the need for any sort of receiver-to-stock bedding interface. Ergonomic stock panels attach directly to the receiver.
The SRS maintains its accuracy and reliability in virtually any environment, including subzero arctic temperatures, extreme desert heat and dust, and wet jungle environments.

Comes with 3 30 round mags, 2 15 round, 2 17 round, and 2 20 round mags, all factory beretta. Also has upgraded steel guide rod and beretta steel trigger and spring kit. Slim grip installed that I stippled, dont worry it looks great, professional job. The grips are still readily available from beretta for around $20 if you dont like it. I have to say its a vast improvement as the factory grip is like trying to hold on to a greased fish.

This would be an ideal setup for the CASS shooter.  I have had these pistols for quite a long time and I'm just not going to be able to ever get to this style of shooting.

The first pistol is a true Vaquero Bisley pistol from Ruger.  The second pistol has had a new grip frame and hammer installed to match the other pistol.  The pistol with the Ruger grips is the converted pistol.  Both pistols have the Power Custom Free Spin Pawl installed.  Triggers on both pistols are very very nice.  I'm guessing that I've perhaps shot 100 rounds through each pistol if that.  Original Parts will be included.  I ordered a Bisley trigger from Midway and was sent the wrong one but it's included.  I really like the Bisley configuration with these pistols.  There's really no comparison when shooting these pistols.

Gunbelt is made by Scotties Leather.  It measures 42"" from the center hole to the end of the buckle.  It's in excellent condition but I purchased it used.  It shows super and is very stiff leather.  The custom grips are made by Eagle and are of Rosewood, they cost 79.95 if I remember right.  They are one super modification for this pistol. I'm including the other Eagle grip set that was installed on the converted pistol, you could sell or trade them for the pistol with the original grip panels.  BTW if you were wanting to convert it to the original configuration the original parts included would make it a job that would only need a screwdriver to accomplish.

This is a great package.  The pistols have a very slight pawl line on the cylinders but look nearly new.   

I decided to separate these two pistols to see if I can find some interest.  The pistols are now priced at 450.00 for either one of these pistols and the gunbelt is 175.00."
