I'd keep the ammo but Buffalo Bore says not to use it in S&W revolvers (the Redhawk is on a short list of revolvers it IS compatible with, they're built like tanks).

Looking to sell these two pistols, a Norinco 1911A1 and a Taurus PT740 Slim, both in nice condition.
First off, is the Norinco 1911A1. As most know, these are no longer imported, due to Norinco being naughty back when Slick Willy was in the White House. It's in .45 ACP with factory plastic grips and 1 (one) magazine that is electropenciled matching to the gun (not sure if done at factory or Bubba did this) and no factory box. I've swapped out most of the guts with the following: * C&S 24/7/365 Prof. 5LB Trigger Pull Set * C&S Lightweight Videki Trigger aluminum * C&S Extended Safety * Wilson Combat Drop-in Beavertail Grip Safety The trigger pull is great on this, but there is a little vertical play on the trigger, maybe 2mm. Much improved trigger pull over stock and now better ergonomics. However, for those that don't like someone else's trigger job or want factory, I still have and am including all the original Norinco parts, so it can easily go back to original. I've only put 1 1/2 boxes of ammo thru it, so about 80 rounds, but unsure of what was run through it before me. Also have 5 Snapcap rounds for it, included. I'm looking for $520 on this pistol. Pics: (http://imgur.com/a/ygobz)
Second, we have a Taurus PT740 Slim in 40 s&w, in nice condition with just a little wear from carrying. Good little conceal carry gun, but not my cup of tea anymore. Comes with factory box and all its accessories (locking keys, cleaning brush, etc) and 2 factory magazines with Pearce finger extensions installed on both (makes a big difference in comfort for bigger hands). Less than 200 rounds thru this one. Looking for $250. Pics: (http://imgur.com/a/bbjDa)
Looking to sell this locally ONLY, in person with valid Drivers License or CHL, I'm located in Katy/West Houston, but will drive a reasonable distance to meet. Not looking for trades. Hope everyone has a fantastic weekend and stay safe!"

Approximately 2700 pieces.
About 2/3 of this is from new cartridges I fired, the remainder is from range pick up.
The cartridges I fired have only been fired once. The range pick ups do not have any resizing marks on them and therefore I presume they are also once fired. 
The brass has been tumble cleaned, de-primed and any crimped pockets have been carefully reamed with a Hornady small primer pocket reamer.
Cases with noticeable dents or split necks have been removed.
A new Lowe's 5 gallon bucket with lid is included.

I partially prepped this brass with the intention of eventually reloading it, but have since lost all interest. I do have plenty of experience reloading NATO 9mm so you can rest assured that I can ream a crimped primer pocket without making a mess out of it.

$120 FIRM. No trades, will not ship.

Really wanting to trade for another .40 with a threaded barrel such as a Sig P229 or similar quality SA/DA gun, not really looking for anything striker fired. Also prefer its a factory threaded barrel setup if possible. If whatever gun you have includes more mags, I have a metric ton of M&P mags I can toss in and tons of 9mm mags too if you want to drop a 9mm barrel in the gun. Not looking to sell them separately so please don't ask, I still have a few M&Ps so if they don't go with the gun, I'm keeping them.

Cash price $800 for everything, prefer to trade though. Can add cash for the right gun and may take guns in 9mm and .45, and always a sucker for a factory AR. I also have thousands of rounds of factory .40 I can add if its another caliber or something I Really like."

Hi guys. I have a like new 12"" 5.7x28 upper that i just got in direct from AR57 center last week. This one has perfectly concentric threads and is suppressor friendly. Verified with a 5.56 can! :) i put exactly 50rnds of FN sporting blue tips through it. No issues. I decided i would like some car parts for the new toy instead of this. Really light upper and fun for plinking. 

Comes with an A1 flash hider on loose, and the factory one that i asked not be installed. I ran this on my SBR lower and the heavy buffer works great. ALL 4 MAGS were FN 30's and I removed the blocking plate and they now are 50's.

Pistol has seen two trips to the range (150-200rds) and was cleaned both times after the range. Fed it a couple different types of ammo (Federal, Winchester, and Tula) with no issues.

I have become disabled and thought archery might help in my rehabilitation. I found this bow on craigslist, and the draw is supposed to adjust low enough for me (weight restrictions since surgery).

The guy said he would let it go cheap because the string had slipped off the cams. The bow has 3 strings on it so I brought it home. Took it to archery store today. Turns out the bow is supposed to have a fourth string! 

Maybe someone can fix it, I don’t know how to fix it myself and can’t afford to have it done. 

The limbs and handle look good as do the pulleys, it just needs a string. One other thing: the sticker on the bow that has the draw weights, draw lengths etc. says it is Left handed bow! But it’s not it’s a right handed bow (see photo). 

Anyway here are a couple of pictures, if you need a picture of something else or a close up of something, let me know and I’ll try to send you one.

1. Match grade free-floating, and fluted barrels, chambers, and crowns
2. High quality match trigger 
3. Repeatable return-to-zero barrel mounting system

Quick Caliber Conversion
The HTI Sniper rifle is available in .50 BMG, .416 Barret, .408 CheyTac, and .375 CheyTac. Both cartridges have excellent accuracy at extreme distances and deep penetration on hard targets. A sniper now has the option to fire high-precision/low-recoil .375 CheyTac and switch to .50 BMG when you need to deliver Armor Piercing, Tracer, or Incendiary payload ammunition.

Rugged
The HTI was designed to operate under the harshest conditions and abuse. It utilizes high-impact polymers, aircraft grade aluminum (7075-T6), ultra high-strength steels, and the durable coatings. The monolithic receiver serves as a full-length mounting chassis, eliminating the need for any sort of bedding interface. Ergonomic stock panels attach directly to the receiver. The HTI sustains its accuracy and reliability in virtually any environment, including subzero arctic temperatures, extreme desert heat and dust, and wet jungle environments.

Compact
The HTI's bullpup design makes it the most compact and portable Hard Target sniper rifle in the world, 12 pounds lighter, 12 inches shorter, and far more accurate than the US M82A1 50 BMG rifle currently in service."""

Don’t let the stunning appearance of the BAR ShortTrac fool you. Underneath the attractive exterior is a rugged and powerful autoloading rifle capable of delivering magnum-level power with pinpoint accuracy. From its satin nickel receiver finish and hammer-forged barrel to its multi-lug bolt and oil finished Grade II select Walnut stock, the BAR ShortTrac is ready to put rounds right on target and meat on the table. The BAR ShortTrac is the hunting rifle that sets the bar for every other autoloader on the planet.

The hammer-forged barrel provides outstanding strength, lasting durability and precise accuracy.

The barrel’s target-type Crown enables a more uniform release of gas as the bullet exits the muzzle, helping prevent any unwanted shift in bullet trajectory. The barrel Crown is recessed to help protect it from accidental impact damage that can degrade accuracy.

The satin nickel plated aircraft grade alloy receiver on the BAR ShortTrac model is drilled and tapped for scope mounts to provide a rock-solid optics mounting platform.

The BAR is a gas-operated autoloader with a high-strength multiple lug rotating bolt that locks directly into the barrel.

The seven-lug bolt and precise breech-to-chamber relationship give the BAR exceptional accuracy and the strength of handle modern magnum class cartridges.
The strong, rigid action bar/inertia block link-up improves accuracy by reducing barrel vibration.

The buffering mechanism reduces wear and stress on the rifle’s mechanism for longer life and greater reliability.

The bolt release lever is incorporated in the BAR’s receiver for maximum reliability and ease of access, even when wearing gloves.

The floorplate on the BAR ShortTrac model is hinged, allowing access to the detachable box magazine for quick and easy loading and unloading.

Magazine capacity on the BAR ShortTrac model is 3 rounds in the magnum calibers and 4 rounds in standard calibers.

The BAR’s trigger design provides a crisp pull that breaks like a glass rod.

The generous trigger guard opening allows easy access, even when wearing gloves.

The metalwork on the BAR ShortTrac model has a subtle matte finish that is intended to shrug off everyday wear and reduce game-spooking reflections.

The charging handle on the bolt is sculpted to give you a solid grasp without snagging on your clothing or rifle scabbard.

The crossbolt safety offers easy accessibility without removing your firing hand from the stock. You can quickly manipulate the safety, or verify the position of the safety, without losing your sight picture or cheek weld.

The Checkered Walnut buttstock on the BAR ShortTrac model is user-adjustable for cast-on, cast off and drop at comb via interchangeable shims that insert between the stock and the receiver.

The well-formed recoil pad on the BAR ShortTrac has optional interchangeable pads to let you adjust length of pull and greatly reduces felt recoil and flinching.

Sling swivel studs are pre-installed for easy mounting of your sling.

Also comes with matching silver bases, Burris Z Rings, and a Tasco 3x9x40mm scope.

from DT site:
DETAILS
Accuracy
The SRS achieves superb accuracy in all calibers because it's built around core accuracy components:

1. Match grade (free-floated) barrels, chambers, and crowns
2. High quality match trigger 
3. Solid, repeating return-to-zero barrel mounting system (the receiver securely clamps around the first six inches of barrel)

Quick Caliber Conversion
The SRS is quickly convertible between the following calibers: .308 Winchester (22"" and 26"" barrels), .260 Remington, 6.5x47 Lapua, 7mm Winchester Short Mag, .300 Winchester Magnum, .338 Norma Magnum, and .338 Lapua Magnum. The caliber conversion and return to zero is simple and takes less than 60 seconds.
Benefits:
1. Operators can change rifle length, penetration, and distance capabilities.
2. Snipers can shoot various ammo calibers and types depending on METT-T.
3. Snipers can progressively train on more powerful ammo. 
4. Reduced training costs (train and practice with .308 WIN) 
5. Reduced system down-times (the operator can change his own barrels).

Compact
The SRS is the shortest purpose-built sniper rifle in the world. The telescoping bolt and bullpup configuration make it almost a foot shorter than conventional Mauser-style turnbolt sniper rifles. The compact design shifts weight and center-of-gravity rearward, creating a perfectly balanced and relatively short sniper rifle.

Rugged
The SRS was designed to operate under the harshest conditions and abuse. It is built of high-impact polymers; aircraft grade aluminum (ANSI 7075-T6); ultra high-strength steels; and some of the most durable coatings known to man. The monolithic receiver serves as a full length mounting chassis, eliminating the need for any sort of receiver-to-stock bedding interface. Ergonomic stock panels attach directly to the receiver.
The SRS maintains its accuracy and reliability in virtually any environment, including subzero arctic temperatures, extreme desert heat and dust, and wet jungle environments."

I'm working towards an early retirement so I'm lightening up my load and these are the finest examples of military rifles I have left. It would be a great opportunity for the serious collector to acquire a ""ready made"" set of all the MAS series rifles with the exception of the MAS 44. I had one of those too in similar condition but had an offer I couldn't refuse from a family friend. So buy the one you want or buy them all. These aren't seen nearly as much anymore today - especially in ""as new"" condition and they will without doubt continue to appreciate in value.

MAS Model 1936 - bolt action, unfired, basically perfect. Chambered in 7.5 French MAS round. $450 SOLD

MAS Model 1936/51 - a later production & much beefier version of the 1936 designed to launch Nato spec grenades. Again unfired, basically perfect. Fires the 7.5 French MAS round. $600

MAS Model 1949 - this is a detachable clip fed semi-auto that replaced the 1944. It's a full length rifle, and it's by far the rarest of all these rifles. Fires the 7.5 French MAS round and is in unfired perfect shape. Tons of factory accessories included with most still factory sealed including 4 mags, pouches, cleaning tools, etc...  $1000

MAS Model 1949/56 - replaced the 1949 and is a carbine length weapon based on the 1949 that's designed to launch Nato spec grenades. Unfired and perfect.  Fires the 7.5 MAS cartridge which is a high power round that is on par with the 7.62 NATO round. Again tons of arsenal fresh accessories including. 4 mags, pouches, cleaning kit, bayonet and even spare firing pin.  $750

The 36 & 36/51 rifles both feature cruciform/spike style bayonets that are stored under the barrel. There is a release that is depressed that releases the bayonet from it's stored position which allows it to be fixed.

The 49 & 49/56 rifles both have grooved receivers to accommodate the MAS scope mount allowing them to be easily transformed into sniper configuration.

I can take some additional pictures or arrange a time for inspection. Serious buyers only please.

All of these rifles are being sold FTF only with pickup in the Brandon FL area by a FL resident who is at least 18 years old.
