Rifle has about 2000 rounds through it. Well maintained. Never had a single misfire or feeding issue so not having a forward assist hasn't been an issue. I've added a lot of things to this weapon some higher end others just for fun. I'm looking to sell this as a package so I'm not going to sell bits and pieces serperate from everything else. Here's a list of what's on the actual rifle:

- Black Magpul hand guard with drop in rail slots
-Two drop in rails for hand guard 
-Tan magpul RSG vertical foregrip 
-Tan magpul pistol K2 grip 
-Tan magpul BMSMIL extendable stock 
-BCM Gunfighter charging handle 
-DPMS assault muzzle brake 
-Tasco rifle scope 3x-9x magnification with lens caps
-Truglo one inch vertical rail mounts (to see over the irons with the optic) 
-Protec RM90 90 lumen laser/light with pressure switches

As for mags I have two 30 round  Magpul PMAGS, one tan one black, and two Troy industries 30 round mags with pul tabs, both black.

I will also include 270 rounds of 223/556 ammunition. 

I have a Drago rifle bag that I might let go with it, if not I still have the box. 

I've spent a lot of time and money on this weapon and will not entertain low ball offers so please don't even try. I'm asking $1000 obo with the ammo. This is a great package deal and you can take it straight to the range. Well have to go to liberty arms in Fort Collins for your backround check and transfer of registration which you will need to pay. Please text is preferred REDACTED. Thanks names nick."

Use the flush-fitting 13 round magazine, and you have a Compact (11 rounds in .40SW, 9 rounds in .45ACP).

Hey guys, I recently decided to make a conversion kit for my 21sf to shoot 10mm. to do so i just need a heavier spring, factory block 20 mag, and barrel. I already have the mag and have found a source for the springs, but haven’t ordered a barrel yet. I figured I would ask local and see if any of y’all have one from your 20 or 20sf that you swapped out when changing it to porter, lone wolf, or just aftermarket in general. I know what I can order a brand new stainless lone wolf factory length barrel for so please be realistic on you price and condition. Im not looking for a “steal” just figured y’all may have some laying around that you wouldn’t mind unloading. I have ammo or cash i could trade for it! Either way works for me. if you have one shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here and we can go from there. Also, if you happen to have some extra recoil springs (looking for probably a 20lb or 22lb) then i may be interested as well. Im open to aftermarket barrels as well (no internal ports obviously) but basically anything reasonable is fine for me.
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

I want this rifle gone, so I've dropped the price quite a bit.

For sale is my Ruger 10/22 Varmint Rifle. It’s one of my favorite rifles, but just doesn't get a lot of use, and I'm clearing house a bit. I’m putting it out there to see if there is any interest. It's a sweet rifle for plinking, taking out varmints, target shooting, SHTF, Zombie Apocalypse, whatever you may need.

As for the mods on this rifle, here is a rundown:

· Adams and Bennett Heavy Match Bull Barrel
· Fajen Thumbhole Silhouette Stock for .920 Barrel
· Extended Bolt Handle
· Barska Varmint Scope 6-24x42 AO

It’s a great varmint rifle, accurate and solid. And she certainly is nice to look at.

Included with the rifle is (1) Ruger BX-10 magazine.

Price is $400 - Lowest I've listed it. It won't go any lower and will only stay up for a short time at this price. It's worth more, but I want it out of the safe.

Sale will be cash, FTF in Milwaukie, Oak Grove, Gladstone or O.C. Current Oregon DL is required, current Oregon CHL is preferred and will be given preferential status if more than one person wants this.

The Walther PPQ is a short recoil-operated locked breech semi-automatic pistol that uses a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol. The PPQ has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools.
The internal preset striker 'Quick Defense' trigger of the PPQ is a departure of previous Walther pistols and has been developed for the PPQ. When the trigger is pulled the trigger bar engages a disconnect lever, which props up a sear hook, which releases the fully pre-loaded striker assembly, firing the pistol. Pulling the trigger does not partially load the striker spring as with the Glock and many other striker fired pistol designs. The PPQ trigger pull is entirely due to the trigger and disconnector springs.
The PPQ has a trigger travel of approximately 9 mm (0.4 in) with a relatively short trigger reset of 2.5 mm (0.1 in) and a trigger pull of approximately 25 N (5.6 lbf). Unlike many other trigger systems, preset internal strikers have a let-off point and trigger pull that remains unchanged from the first shot to the last and requires no decocker. It should however be noted that the striker of the PPQ variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, as the firearm is in a constant cocked state."

Sorry for the horrible I-Potato pics but if you want better ones I can try to send you some if needed.

Compare this stick to others being offered around the area and you will see mine is a better deal.

Below is a guide and guide only and some could say our opinion.

MYTH number of rounds shot affects what should pay for every gun... Collectible gun is only bought for appreciation of value not to shoot.
FACT only in a collector's gun, Fact is if any Collectible gun has seen zero rounds to few with correct ammo and cleaning then it is collectible Rare and Desired by many but few gun's to buy. FACT a gun shot with few rounds and or incorrect ammo as to much grain for twist and not cleaned and cleaning being a huge factor is far worse then Thousands with correct ammo and grain used for twist then a few rounds shot and not cleaned..

WE HELP CATCH TRENDS and know when a gun is just another gun CALL before any buy we are happy to give you a price quote for used gun below are factor's FREE Advice.

IS NEW MODEL A PLUS OR MINUS from previous?
Serial number, this especial on rifle's and shotgun's as above or below a certain number barrel's were made better or worse. Back to new model is it mass produced and really better and accepted or is old model more accepted and liked.
Do you care it come's with added item's and who added them.
Is gun clean in barrel and no crack's or slag, simple light can tell more then any word's by the seller and a snap cap of caliber can save huge.
Is it tight in all area's revolver especial, and stock of long guns has been fixed and correct and barrel straight. 
Do not pay for prior owner's overpaying of additional item's extra clip's maybe only 4 for 60$ yet they paid 60$ each and expect you pay. Hard to find or once a year made ammo if come's with is it safe any greened copper is a NO. Again snap cap's go long way as testing the firing and back to revolver is timing on so several snap caps for every type gun is golden this checks feed fire and jam....

This is a mini list of what to look for now what to ask n offer is another part, ask questions pertaining to cleaning (if have a bore snake or cleaning kit ask to see it, can tell much about how was treated and if a snake and they have not a caliber use for it ask to throw in with buy IF BUY... Again this list is for most firearms Collectible's are near same yet many factor's can change price by larger % factor's.
BOTTOM LINE on a common firearm do NOT PAY MORE THEN what can buy NEW for any reason if the gun sells at near by store or the next gun show that is coming and will be dime a dozen also no tax private buy..
IF UN-SURE pass and or CALL or refer to price on smart phone via internet or phone call to local supplier of both gun and Optic's and accessories. (know where to look before going to see and buy gun and do RESEARCH BEFORE as always with any product you buy.
AS with anything differ by Collectible and just a shooter. Your buy is either a investment or a tool, know why you are buying. As always if a kit gun as so many today to keep price's low and people that cannot afford nor want pay for the real thing, have checked before shooting as if not built correct not like other tool's or item's when it break's or broken there is a large risk, Beware of the new tactile kit weapons one being the Remington 870 to that of semi auto bull pup. The 80% lower's are a red flag on Rifle's as AR to AK. ALWAY's have a light that will see down or up bore.(this information is not intended to replace professional opinion.
