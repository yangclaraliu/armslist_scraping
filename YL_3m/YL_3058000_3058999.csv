Description from SIG website:
   With the introduction of the P938, SIG SAUER now offers the ballistic advantage of the 9mm cartridge in a platform similar in size to the best-selling P238 pistol. A single-action-only trigger, coupled with full-size SIGLITE® Night Sights makes the P938 handle like a much larger pistol, yet is still easy to carry concealed.
With dimensions just slightly larger than its .380ACP counterpart, the P938 packs six plus one rounds of 9mm into an all-metal frame. The cocked-and-locked single-action trigger gives the P938 unmatched accuracy in a pistol its size.
   Fans of the 1911 will find the thumb safety, magazine release and slide stop lever in familiar places. An ambidextrous safety makes the P938 easy for left- and right-handed shooters. The most compact 9mm in the SIG SAUER product line a polished Nitron two-tone slide is paired with a black hard coat anodized frame. Tru-Glo® front and SIGLITE rear sights and Hogue black Diamondwood grips complete this package.

57,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3058057,"For Sale:  Barrett M107A1 20"" CQ FDE 50 BMG QDL Suppressor","Myrtle beach, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina","$ 9,000","Listed On: Tuesday, May 13, 2014",Rifles,Barrett                                                                                ,50 BMG                                                                                ,no type,Rifle,"BARRETT M107A1 !!

The Barrett M107A1 .50 BMG semi-automatic rifle is an exceptional firearm! Here are some of the new upgrades:

* It has the upgraded muzzle brake which gives you less recoil, and enables you to stay on target for faster, more accurate follow up shots. The new 4 chamber muzzlebrake is also able to receive their quick attach suppressor if you ever wanted to silence your 50. (Barrett has said that currently the new muzzlebrake is not available as a separate accessory for the M82A1).

* It's made of a much stronger, lighter titanium, so even though it's very light it's more durable, and the titanium w/ the upgraded brake keeps recoil down. Also aluminum and steel areas where possible have been thinned for further weight savings without sacrificing the integrity of the design.

* The mags are much better with a tougher finish, and the mag has sight holes so you can tell exactly how many rounds you have left; our customers that hunt w/ their .50's love that feature, and our troops demand it.

* The finish on the M107's is much more durable, scratch resistant and rust resistant.

* It has the thermal cheek guard that allows the shooter to rest their face on the cheek plate and not directly on metal. Also, it's elevated which is ideal because the M107A1 has a really long, elevated mono-rail.

* It has a lightweight, quick detach bipod with modular feet.

* It has a monopod as standard equipment instead of having to pay additional and add as an accessory; this is a big help so you do not have to support the weight of the rear of the rifle with your own strength. It also allows you to dial the elevation of where your aiming up or down with the monopod with even more accuracy so even if you don't want to upgrade you may want to ask about adding a monopod.

*The case it comes with from the factory is an upgrade from a Pelican case to a nicer Storm case. The Storm case is much easier to open and close, and you don’t bust your knuckles on it, and the case features padding inside instead of bare plastic.

*More potential investment value as it has the same rollmark as our military gets, with the M107A1 designation. We see with our Knights Armament Rifles, Schmidt & Bender scopes, Remington Defense rifles, etc. that military markings always drive up price further down the road when the rifles are no longer offered.

BARRETT QDL .50 BMG SUPPRESSOR

The Barrett QDL suppressor is an extremely light, easy-to-attach suppressor that fits directly over the muzzle brake of your rifle. The M107A1's titanium four-port muzzle brake is engineered to work seamlessly with this quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor.

The QDL features its own two-port muzzle brake, which reduces the recoil. It’s been tested and approved for short barrel (20 inch) CQ use. This outstanding suppressor is made of dual layered tube construction of specially heat treated high-strength alloys and redundant 360 degree spot welding.

The suppressor attaches by sliding over the muzzle brake, which guides it directly to the indexing point. The QDL mounts using a Quick Detach 1/4 Turn Lock Ring.

Features:

Suppressor-ready muzzle brake. Lightweight quick-detach bipod with modular feet. Accepts M1913 accessory rails. Thermal cheek guard. Modular hand-grip mounted on M1913 rail. Model:M107A1 Caliber:.50 BMG Operation:Semi-Automatic Rifling Twist:1 turn in 15” (38.1 cm) Magazine Capacity:10 Rounds

  B) this is hands down the sweetest shooting. 40 I've ever owned. I generally don't like handguns chambered in that caliber, but I could shoot the pro series all day.
  C) very well made (night) sights make this an impressively accurate sidearm. Perfect for home defense.

It comes with the normal stuff you'd come to expect, I.e. the case, 3 mags, lock, etc... this one comes with a C.O.R.E. serires medium backstrap, and a regular small sized one. It didnt come with alarge one when I bought it. We can talk about including some ammo (IF I STILL HAVE SOME, lol). I paid 675.00, so I think 550.00 is fair (edit: discounted to 520.00). I'm willing to meet up anywhere in the metro area. No low ballers. This is good price, for a good gun. If you find one cheaper, buy it. I doubt you will (pro series, at least). Either way, thanks for looking, and have a nice day.

This SKS is a numbers matching gun with an exception for the stock. The stock is an laminate stock and appears to be a arsenal force match, but is does not have the old serial number X'ed out like most other russian guns it appears to be sanded away, but you can still see some indentation as if their was another serial number at one point, could be just a covered up mistake when the gun was being first built? or a arsenal force match?, could be anybody's guess. Their is also an armorers marking [/] stamped on the top of the reciever cover ""you may be able to see in the picture"", as well as the bolt being black instead of rew steel color, so this SKS was sent back to the armorer at one point. But seither way, a very RARE FIND! and a must have for any SKS collector! Overall the gun is in great shape and in origional condition, the stock has not been messed with and still bears the origional stain. I have searched the internet to try and fine a similar SKS to find a doller value, but have found nothing, most likely due to Rareity. I am asking $550, I feel it could be worth more, but seeing that I failed to find another for sale, I couldent make that call.

Specs: 
The Multistrada is a model of motorcycle introduced by Ducati in 2003. The word Multistrada is Italian for ""many roads"" as the bike is designed to handle asphalt as well as some unpaved surfaces. Essentially the bike is a hybrid of a supermoto and a sport touring motorcycle. Its upright riding position gives it a stronger appeal for those who like touring but want something lighter than a touring bike. The Multistrada competes in the same niche market as do other multi-purpose and dual-sport motorcycles such as the BMW GS, but even according to the owners manual the Multistrada is not intended for off-road use despite its off-road inspired design, hence Motorcycle Consumer News classifies it as a standard.[1]

Designed by Pierre Terblanche as an evolution to his previous design, the Cagiva Gran Canyon, the Multistrada has always received mixed reviews for its aesthetics. One magazine reviewer said the bike looked like a ""wet cat with a large forehead"".

The Multistrada 1000DS was released in 2003. There were two basic Ducati Multistrada models in 2005, the 1000DS and the 620. There was also the 620 Dark entry model. 

Ducati Multistrada 1000DS
The 2005 Ducati Multistrada 1000DS has a 992 cc air cooled 90° V-twin engine with a 40 degree included valve angle, based on Ducati's existing engines, with twin-spark plug heads, pressure fed plain camshaft bearings, redesigned crankshaft, higher oil pressure and volume, and new alloy clutch basket, drive and driven plates. The 2006 1000DS uses Ducati's signature trellis frame with fully adjustable 165 mm travel Showa forks up front, and a single-sided swingarm, with a Showa fully adjustable rear shock coupled with a rising rate, height-adjustable suspension system at the rear. Brembo ""Serie Oro"" four piston brake callipers are used in the front and rear disc brakes. Front 320 mm discs, single 245 mm rear disc, and steel-braided brake lines are used throughout. The discs are now mounted directly to oversized hubs, eliminating the disc carriers.[2] The wet weight is 504--505 lb

Go off of the typed description for items included, but the picture is of the actual lot.

*2 BDU field jackets. One is XL, one is Med. Both are in good shape. XL jacket has seen almost no use. Med jacket has some wear. Expect some minor tears and such with either, but I haven't noticed any. Med jacket has a bit of fading, but I think that's just because I'm looking at it beside the brand-new XL jacket.  Both are very much serviceable.  I wear both, and I'm of pretty average build.  XL is great for layering.
*1 complete set of Revision Eye Protection: 2 frames, 1 set each of clear and dark lenses, soft case. Lenses have some scratches and wear-spots. You can still see through them pretty well; just a bit of haze in spots. Lenses are fairly cheap to replace, as well.
*1 pair of OD green shooter's gloves. Flame resistant. Don't know the size, but probably medium or large. Used, but serviceable.
*2 flame-resistant Anti-flash hoods. Pretty much like a thin balaclava. Grey.
*Wet Weather bag.
*Some assorted wet-weather garments; various sizes. Not listing items or quantities, because it's subject to change; still going through stuff. You'll get (at the least) a set of brown Mid-Weight Poly-pro thermals (top and bottom), and a mid-weight thermal ""honey comb"" knit shirt.  I think the poly-pros are large, but I'm not positive.  The thermal knit top is Medium, but fits me, and I usually wear a large tee-shirt.

Price is really based on just the jackets. Figured I'd just throw in other stuff that I don't have a use for. Shipping is $20.00, and will be either USPS or FedEx. I'd prefer to just meet F2F in Conyers, GA."

 IF YOU HAVE SEEN THESE IN ACTION YOU KNOW YOU WANT THEM.

 THIS IS A MUST HAVE AMMO FOR ANYONE.

 This bullet was purposely designed to break into 9 separate paths. Once the bullet penetrates its target, high velocity fragmentation will increase the effect of temporary and permanent cavitation. The 8 fragments sheared from the bullet cause many small permanent cavities around the main entry point. This causes multiple wound channels that will effectively hit vital organs for the eventual complete termination of interest. The main mass base of the bullet can continue its path and cause a truly massive amount of tearing as the perforated tissue is stretched.
 The G2 Research R.I.P. 9mm features
 * 16"" Penetration 
 * Up to 6"" diameter spread 
 * 96 gr projectile 
 * 2"" grouping at 25 yrds

""STRIKE TWO"" CAPABILITY - The Taurus 800 Series is now ready with ""Strike Two"" capability. If you have had a hard primer and the gun misfires, the 800 Series senses this and automatically gives you instant ""Strike Two"" capability by resetting the trigger for automatic double action re-strike. No need to do anything else, simply pull the trigger. Research indicates a 93% or better chance the round will fire on re-strike. When it fires, the 800 will automatically revert to single action by itself. If it falls on a dead primer, simply manually recharge and keep going.  Lightly used.

 This bullet was purposely designed to break into 9 separate paths. Once the bullet penetrates its target, high velocity fragmentation will increase the effect of temporary and permanent cavitation. The 8 fragments sheared from the bullet cause many small permanent cavities around the main entry point. This causes multiple wound channels that will effectively hit vital organs for the eventual complete termination of interest. The main mass base of the bullet can continue its path and cause a truly massive amount of tearing as the perforated tissue is stretched.

The wait list to buy one of his barrels is something like two years long. High-quality craftsmanship, precision, and attention to detail are evident by looking at the threading, crown, gas port, etc. The feed ramps have been polished to a nice shine. This barrel is threaded 5/8x24 and is 0.75"" thick at the gas port.

I don't know where the blank came from, but the barrel extension says Stag Arms so I'm guessing that's also who forged the blank. I purchased this barrel new in November 2013, used it to build a pistol upper, let the upper sit in my safe for 6 months, and then I disassembled the upper and decided to go with a different length. This barrel is brand new, unfired and hasn't had so much as a round put into the chamber. There is some minor wear on the exterior finish from assembly and disassembly, but nothing major and nothing that won't be covered up by the handguard. $200, cash only, no trades. Price is FIRM. Buyer must pick up in downtown Dallas or in NE Dallas near the Arboretum. Thanks for looking."

VDIBRL-14.5-M-L-556-M-T-L

This Voodoo Barrels AR-15 Barrel features their signature Ultra-Lite profile that eliminates absolutely all unnecessary weight and bulk, making it perfect for use in a super lightweight rifle build. It comes with a 5.56x45mm NATO chamber that's safe for use with both commercial-grade and military surplus ammunition, while its 1 in 7"" twist rifling allows it to properly stabilize medium- to heavy-weight projectiles of up to about 77 grains. Additional features include a mid length gas port for a longer sight radius and smoother recoil impulse, a pre-installed barrel extension with M4 feed ramps, and a 1/2""-28 threaded muzzle for the installation of a flash hider, muzzle brake or sound suppressor. 

This 14.5"" AR-15 barrel is constructed from Mil-Spec 4150 Chrome Moly Vanadium Steel, and has been finished inside and out with Voodoo Barrels' proprietary QPQ Melonite treatment that bonds with the metal on a molecular level. Also referred to as salt bath nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, extending a barrel's service life by reducing the friction produced inside the bore upon firing for a net decrease in bore surface wear over time. Nitriding converts the barrel steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. The end result is a barrel that's capable of producing accuracy on par with a match stainless steel tube, while also exhibiting the longevity and resilience of a chrome lined, mil-spec barrel.

It has a 16"" chrome lined barrel with a 1:9 twist rate. I have seen them in stores for an average of right around $1000 or a little more. I added a Magpul handguard and a Magpul MVG to the front of the rifle, and a Blackhawk Ergo pistol grip. It has a nice winter trigger guard, and the Magpul MBUS flip up rear sight. It will come with one 30 round magazine, as well as the owners manual, lock, etc. that came with the rifle. This is a nice rifle, and comes with the Core15 warranty which is pretty awesome. The warranty reads:

“The rifle you have just purchased has the simplest, most plainly written warranty you will ever read. This is no fine print. There are no exceptions. This CORE15 rifle has been manufactured and assembled with painstaking care and precision by proud US Veterans, trained by the best there is. If anything is not up to your standard, accuracy included, if anything goes wrong, gets bent, broken, cracked, misaligned, tweaked, snapped or otherwise, simply contact one of our professionals and we will work to make it right. If you are the 5th owner and the rifle has seen 40k+ rounds, it simply….doesn’t….matter. We stand behind our products and we take care of our customers. That is our promise and your assurance.”

That is the Core Difference. See. Shoot. Believe.

I think that pretty well speaks for the quality of rifles that this company produces. I am looking to sell the rifle for $950 cash, which I think is a very fair deal considering that is less than these go for in the stores (plus there is no tax, even more savings!), and I have added the sight, handguard, vertical grip, and the pistol grip."

Its a pre ban ak47 nmh-91 made by norinco in china. 762x39 caliber. 
This gun is in amazing shape and was imported in 1992. I have had this rifle since it was imported and its only ever had 30 rounds through it. This is NOT your average cheap ak. 

Gun has factory blueing,factory match 21"" heavy chrome lined cold hammer forged bull barrel (thickest and strongest barrel that came out on any ak),1.5 mm receiver,nickel plated bolt/carrier/and trigger,factory blued fold under bipod that lets u fold it under or just take pin out and set it to the side. These are very rare to find in this shape with bipod. All numbers matching. Still has flash hider and threads. No welds!!! A lot of these were welded or had threads ruined in order to meet req for import. A lot of them have had barrels chopped to 16"" because of barrel quality. Look it up and check them out. 

Gun comes with 2 factory Chinese pre ban mags and 2 Chinese pre ban 30 round mags with chrome springs!!!

Asking $1000 Obo u wont ever need another ak. This will last a lifetime.

The SIG516 uppers allow operators to upgrade their current AR-15/M16/M4-type rifles from direct gas impingement systems to the SIG SAUER® advanced short-stroke pushrod system. This advanced operating system reduces carbon fouling, excessive heat and unburned powder in the action, ensuring reliability and function that is unmatched. A standard 5.56mm NATO chrome-lined chamber and bore ensure reliable function in any environment. 

All models feature a free-floating, aluminum, M1913 quad rail and 1:7 right-hand twist bore configuration.

An adjustable gas valve allows operators to increase the flow of gas when using lower pressure ammunition or when adverse conditions require additional energy. Reduced flow and the off-position enhance the use of suppressors. Barrels feature an A2 flash suppressor and are threaded ½x28 TPI, allowing the SIG516 to adapt to a number of aftermarket accessories and suppressor mounts. 

All upper assemblies are shipped with a recoil buffer and action spring. These components must be installed to ensure proper function of the SIG516 upper assembly on your AR-type lower receiver.

I obviously pictured it attached on my lower, but I will disassemble everything and the upper will include the spring and buffer. 

I would be willing to trade, but pretty much only for 1911s, sig p220/226/229, or other ar uppers(300aac, 6.8, 450 bushmaster, 458 socom, .50 Beowulf. Possibly other guns, but mostly just want to trade/sell this upper for a hunting upper."

NEW IN FACTORY BOX


Bearing the namesake and call sign of legendary Navy SEAL Paul Basal, this knife is the new choice of operational warriors throughout the globe. Designed by Basal with the Dark Ops design chief, it features all the critical items for a Modern Spec-Ops knife. The Shadow offers an extended blade length for penetrating Comm-bloc frag vests with an accelerated spearpoint tip and sharpened foretip for maximum penetration. The top edge features a bone breaker and a radical, self-cleaning BlastRip™ saw for carving survival notches in spears and anchoring notches for detonation cord. A pat pend. BarbSnap™ cutter allows for rapid notching and snapping of interdiction wires in entry ops. An abbreviated top-hilt/bottle opener works with a new serrated palmstop, allowing for a reverse grip with an astonishing six linear inches of surface area! The Shadow features a corrosion resistant finish designed to take the saltwater immersion often involved in SEAL operations. The handle is made of a low-durometer, high tensile aramid composite that is impervious to everything from aviation fuel to Al Qaeda body fluids. The handle is thinner and wider for greater mechanical advantage with deep finger grooves orienting the blade axis of the knife in the hand and dramatically increasing effective grip surface. A prominent WhipLok™ finger notch provides an axis point for hacking as well as 200 degrees of grip area, ideal with wet hands or when using gloves. The handles are field replaceable to blend with woodland, desert or black camo schemes. Quartz impregnated inserts provide extreme circumstances grip enhancement and are replaceable should decontamination be required. The Basal Shadow utilizes the same CTV2 Blade Steel and CryoHardening techniques as the StratoFighter Folders. The hilts do not protrude forward effectively reducing the length of the blade. Hollow grinding lends to greater cutting and slashing effectiveness. Deep blood grooves keep the weight of the full .250 inch thick blade properly balanced in the hand. The black Titanium CarboNitride (TiCN) vacuum deposited finish is designed to shed the micro-fine airborne sand of Middle-Eastern deserts.
