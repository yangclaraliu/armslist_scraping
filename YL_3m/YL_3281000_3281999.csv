The .35 Remington is considered a fine round for deer, elk, black bear, and other medium and large game as long as ranges are reasonable.

About the gun:

This gun has seen very little use - about 350 rounds total.  It is hands down the best SA trigger I've ever seen on a DA/SA pistol.  I shoot it a few times a year at most.  This should be in the hands of someone who can utilize something this great.  I'd like to downgrade to a mid-range gun. So trade plus cash or just cash.  An example would be a full-size M&P 9mm and $400 or a Gen4 Glock 19 or 23 and $350. 

I don't have to sell this - I just recognize it is far more than I need."

Including with the purchase of the bow are two sights, one whisker biscuit, one quiver, one release, five broadheads, one lighted nock, one stabilizer, one wrist strap, and a foam target. The sight and the rest that are currently on the bow will be coming off before sale. This is everything you need to get started for the upcoming bow season minus arrows (Depending on sale I might be able to throw a couple Gold Tip arrows in with the deal)! 

Considered by many to be the 'bowhunters bow'; the FX is not only lightweight and maneuverable, it's also hard-hitting and dead on accurate as well. Add to that the slimmer Mathews Competition grip and Realtree X-Tra Camouflage, and you've got a bow that preforms in the field.

There's a lot I love about her- she was a fun project and I'll probably do it again sometime. I owned a compact m&p and sold it to buy this full size and chop it. 
The good:
Shoots like a full size carries like a compact. 
15 round mags
No failures ever. 
Custom- can't buy it anywhere. 
Larger upper negates the felt recoil more than the compact. 
You'll notice the baseplates on the magazines are slightly larger than the grip- initially I planned on radiussing it flush but realized I really liked the way it framed my grip every time I grabbed it. 
Undercut trigger guard 
Night sights with lots of life left 

Cons:
Nothing too bad- I did this over about a week on my lunch breaks at work so the magazines have detectable work done on them (when I was planning it I wanted to hide the chops)
I currently one have one blackstrap cut to size but could easily do the other two if you're interested. 
The pin that holds the backstrap in doesn't have anything to lock into anymore so it is just lodged snug in there- I have never had any problems with it wanting to come loose but from a fab standpoint I wish there was a better way- some people epoxy the backstrap to the grip but I wanted to still be able to interchange them.  
Lastly as I took a pic of the front sight for you to see. Once in a while the fiber optic tube will slide out a couple of millimeters. It's never gone further than that or been a problem. They pick up light great and are bright. Back sights are at about 95%-100%. Front is probably 80%-90%. 
The picture doesn't do the night sights justice but I thought is try. 

There she is. I tried to include every good and bad about her because surprises are no fun in this case. I only have a 200-300 rounds through her but no problems. Let me know your thoughts. 
Just throwing it out there to see if there's any interest. 


I could stipple the grip and bob the beavertail for an extra fee. 
Feel free to contact me if you are interested in having any work done to your polymer pistols. My rates are low since I love the projects.

See the ankle holster in the pics? This came from a Rochester detective that carried it as a backup years ago.  AS you can see in the pics, the grip on the left side is a little warped from what I would guess is his perspiration.  

The finish has some ware on it, but considering it must have been carried around a lot, it's not bad.  There is a little surface oxidation, but nothing significant.

Hard Cast Wadcutter (1,300 fps) - 20 Round Box","azusa, California, United States",$ 33,"Listed On: Tuesday, July 15, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"https://www.extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=283

This full profile wad cutter hard cast 44 magnum load was designed for the owners of 44 magnum firearms that choose to use those firearms for self defense against humans. This load is specifically designed to permanently and quickly disable humans. The big flat wad cutter nose crushes living tissue, unlike mushroomed bullets that are slightly rounded on the nose and tend to slip and slide through living tissue. The crushing action of the flat nose keeps penetration straight and when penetration is straight, it is generally very deep—deep enough to obtain full penetration on the largest human from any angle. The hard cast nose will not deform at these velocities so the nose profile remains constant (flat, with a sharp shoulder) along with bullet path and terminal damage. Noted NYPD “stake out” officer Jim Cirillo used full profile wad cutters in his 38 SPL revolvers because they incapacitated his human targets with certainty. See our item 20D. (38 SPL) The light weight bullet at moderate velocity aids in low recoil for fast follow-up shots.

Unlike our other Anti-Personnel 44 magnum loads, this one utilizes a hard cast bullet, which will not mushroom and the resulting penetration is very deep. Expect at least 24 inches of straight-line penetration in mammalian tissue, thus allowing this load to also serve well on small to medium sized game such as deer, black bear and even elk. This hard cast construction keeps your bore from being substantially lead fouled even after hundreds of rounds.

We’ve utilized a flash suppressed powder to the shooter will not be blinded by his/her own gunfire should you be required to drop the hammer in low light.

Note our real world velocities taken from stock over-the-counter firearms.

From Taurus:
We can think of a million reasons to add this highly regarded pistol to your belt, but for time's sake we'll just highlight our favorites. Like remarkable versatility. Non-stop performance. And your choice of models including: 9mm (12+1), .40 caliber (10+1), or .45 ACP (10+1 or 6+1 in a slimmer grip, single stack magazine sub-compact .45 at under 21 ounces). The Millennium PRO"" also features the same revolutionary Single Action/Double Action trigger and matching serial numbers on the frame, slide and barrel as the 24/7 PRO, Heinie ""Straight Eight"" sights, an ergonomic grip design, enhanced finger indexing Ambidextrous Index Memory Pads"" and posi-traction slide serrations. Light, powerful and technically advanced, the Millennium PRO is the choice for concealment and back-up carry.


Taurus Security System (TSS)s
Taurus family of semi-auto pistols now feature the Taurus Security System, which provides instant-ready defense with built-in ability to secure your pistol and make it inoperable at the turn of a key. When the Security System is engaged, the pistol cannot be fired or cocked and the gun's manual safety cannot be disengaged. As with our revolver Security System, the device is part of the firearm and cannot be lost, and the same special Security Key works for both the revolver and pistol Systems (two keys come with each gun). To engage: simply insert the Key into the button on the rear or side of the pistol and rotate one-quarter turn clockwise. This engages the Security System. The manual safety cannot be moved and the trigger cannot be pulled. To disengage: simply rotate the key one-quarter turn back. This releases the Security System, yet leaves the pistol's manual safety in the ""safe"" position until you are ready to release it yourself and fire the gun.








Loaded Chamber Indicator
Taurus provides a loaded chamber indicator on all new compact, medium and large frame pistols. As with all Taurus safety and security innovations, the indicator in no way interferes with the operation of your pistol and is provided at no extra cost, but gives you an ""at-a-glance"" verification that there is a round in the chamber. When a round is in the chamber, the ejector pops out of the slide, exposing a red strip just behind the ejection port. While any loaded chamber indicator is no substitute for common sense and safe firearm handling, it is one more example of Taurus' commitment to outstanding firearms.








Heinie Sights

Accessory Rail
Features the Genuine Picatinny Rail allowing use of many accessories








New Unique SA/DA Trigger System
The PT24/7 Pro Trigger system solves the double action/single action dilemma once and for all. Figure 1 shows the trigger at full rest. When a round is chambered, the trigger sets in single action mode with the trigger traveling freely to the crisp break point shown in figure 2. The trigger resets to DA mode until another round is chambered.

Introducing the SIG556xi, rewriting the standard for modularity, reliability, and performance for the modern rifle platform. 

Based on the legendary SG 550, the SIG556xi will change the way military, law enforcement, and responsible citizens look at adaptable rifles. Utilizing the time-tested rotating bolt and adjustable gas piston operating system, the SIG556xi allows operators a choice of caliber, barrel length, handguard/stock configurations and lower receivers. 

A removable barrel allows the operator to select the necessary length for a given mission. Adding the appropriate bolt, the SIG556xi can be changed to any of three calibers, 5.56x45mm NATO, 300 Blackout, and 7.62x39mm NATO. Users can also quickly change out the non-serialized lower receiver, allowing the use of either AR-style STANAG magazines or rock-and-lock AK-style magazines. The SIG556xi upper receiver is the serialized part, making the lower an easy to purchase part. 

Polymer handguards accept all Magpul® light and rail kits, while the aluminum and carbon fiber handguards accept 2”, 4”, and 6” M1913 rails. Barrels are available in 10”, 14.5”, and 16”. Truly ambidextrous, the SIG556xi features an ambi safety selector, magazine release and user swappable charging handle (right- or left-handed). Optional receiver end plates allow for the use of either AR receiver extension tubes and buttstocks or M1913 compatible stocks"

I'm just tired off people making offers and not honoring them. Either do the homework, or trade for what you want without msrp driving you, or honor your offers and take your medicine if the dollar is your 'god' and you can't be bothered to do the research first. 
That's the real problem...no one honors their word anymore...There is always a reason why they should not have to, why honoring their word doesn't apply to them.
Don't know you or need your guns, just wish someone would grow a pair and be a man these days.
I don't think that is too much to ask. So if this shoe fits you or you offer ""options"" and use that word later to say ""I didn't make you an offer, just an option"" (you know who you are in columbia at the engineering firm) then don't respond to my ads. I don't have time to deal with lazy @$$€$, msrp freaks, or those without any real honor in their offers.

This KSG comes with Magpul MBUS flip-up sights, Magpul angled fore grip, and Viking Tactics two point sling. 

 This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

No modification to your weapon is made, it just mounts on the existing bolt release paddle and allows you to instantly drop the bolt after a magazine change with just a flick of your trigger finger while maintaining your grip. Will sell for $30 cash or trade for items that interest me, possible trades are listed below  

Developed from the operational experience of the Magpul DynamicsSM team, the B.A.D. Lever (Battery Assist Device) is designed to considerably improve the speed and efficiency of the AR15/M16 bolt catch. The B.A.D. Lever quickly addresses reloading and malfunction clearance shortcomings of AR15/M16 platforms by extending a paddle to the right side of the weapon, allowing manipulation of the bolt stop from the fire control/ready position with the right-hand trigger finger.

Made from milspec-anodized aluminum, the B.A.D. Lever attaches to the standard AR15/M16 bolt release without permanent modification to the weapon. Functional for both left and right-handed shooters, the B.A.D. Lever also allows traditional bolt catch manipulation according to the AR15/M16 manual of arms. All mounting hardware included.

It has puzzled every single collector at every gun show I have brought it to. It is based on the Romanian ""G""  Platform. It has an SVD sniper stock, and very attractive Bakelite Forarm furniture. It has original Bayonet lug. Perfect bore and action. It looks like it is set up to be a Sniper Rifle and has seen very little use. All parts are matching including original barrel. Wood and Bakelite magazine are almost a perfect match. Comes as you see with scopemount, sling and optic. 
(When ever I used to  bring it to the range, it would never fail to bring everyone over to look at it and try to buy it.) If you ever wanted an AK that stands out from the crowd and looks as beautiful as it shoots, this is the one! 

NOTE: I have had this since the 1980's so it is therefore EXEMPT from 922R compliance or control and is a ""Pre-Ban"" AK."

This has been a carry piece for the last 5 years and it reflects that, it also has the idiot mark from the previous owner. The gun its self has had night sights installed by the kimber custom shop as well as a polish job. The gun also had a trigger job done and is very crisp and clean. Gun comes with three magazines, a DC holsters IWB holster that was cut down so as not to interfere with the draw stroke, a tagua double mag holster, a good size bag of brass, and a little over 250 rounds of ammo. Its been a great gun, I'm standardizing calibers and moving to 9mm.

lower receiver shell and I installed bushmaster internals- (essentially a bushmaster lower.) the upper receiver is made my Barrier

shoots great and is zero'd at 100 yards. Bullets cycle fine, never had a single misfire or jam. I've put about thirty rounds through it and it's been just sitting ever since. This is a great gun and I hate to see it go but I'd like to put my money towards a Remington 700 in 308.

918,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3281918,For Sale/Trade:  Kimber Combat Carry (Predicessor to the CDP line),"Tacoma, Seattle, Washington",$ 875,"Listed On: Tuesday, August 5, 2014",Handguns,Kimber,no type,no type,no type,"This was my number 1 carry gun for nearly 8 years.  Its an officers size frame, meaning its a 7+1 with standard mags.  It will come with 3 Wilson Combat 7rd mags as well as 1 8rd mag that is specific to the officers frame. It does not protrude any more than the 7rd as it has a low profile baseplate.  

The gun itself has roughly 2500 rounds through it, and I had changed out the recoil spring last June and put maybe 150rds through it since.  I have had a number of 1911's, and this can hold its ground against my fullsize Wilson any day, and in my opinion, its the more accurate of the two.  With the proper holdover, this thing will make 5"" groups at 75 YARDS all day.  

The only ammo hangups I have experienced with this gun was with Cor Bon DPX hollowpoints, but it was only 1 in the 100rds of it that I shot.  I have shot it nearly 1200 rounds without any malfunctions down at Howe's pistol course and the worse report I could give of it was that it did start to slow down, but it did not jam up. 

The gun will also come with two holsters: A Bladetech paddle holster and a Krounds pancake style owb.  I also have an IWB Bladetech as well if that is what someone is looking for.

This gun is 1 of only 900 apparently, so it is not something that you see everyday. That being said, I wont sit here and try and convince anyone that its made of gold, however, I am not going to even entertain any lowball offers.  

I will also ask the buyer to present a valid drivers license as well as a current CPL. If you don't have one, I will not sell it to you. Just like things staying legal, safe and sane."

I watched just a  box like this one sell for 200 on ebay.

I don't have a set price. Don't ask.    You can step up and make an offer.  

I do see them selling on gunbroker which is where this one will probably end up.

I will accept cash offers. I will also accept partial trades plus cash."
