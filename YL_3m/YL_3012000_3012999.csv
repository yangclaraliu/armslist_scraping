4,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3012004,For Sale:  War Clubs,"Lincoln/fayetteville, Fayetteville, Arkansas",$ 100,"Listed On: Friday, May 16, 2014",Knives,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Welcome, one and all. As you can see my name is Lee and I would like to speak with you today about War Clubs. Here in the mountains and foothills, as in most of the world, spring has blossomed and with it naturally follows the time of the new War Club. With the insolent encroachment of aggressive vegetation and the unwanted and unwarranted advances of the lovelorn who have awoken from their winter slumber, spring has traditionally been the time of clubbly armament and re-equipage. I doesnt matter if you are replaceing a club lost or damaged in last year's campaign or are flexing your fingers in anticipation of grasping your very first, I am the man you need to talk to.

At this time I currently have three clubs in hand and ready for immediate shipment. Let us consider them all together and then one by one.



To begin, I present Phlegmlor, the largest and longest of the three. With mighty Phlegmlor at you side you need fear nothing under the brutal Sun.



Phlegmlor's prodigious head is crafted of the finest hot rolled tool steel and boasts a full six, four edged protuberances with a solid pyramidal spike on top.. When it comes to edged protuberances, six is always the perfect number. 



Phlegmlors shaft is made of fine, figured black Walnut, and is hafted by a semi-dished butt to keep the hand planted. The wood is polished and oiled with a Tung oil finish to keep its beauty for generations of use. Phlegmlor is 27 and 1/2 inches from tail to tip.

Now, we move onwards with the dark horse and pocket battleship of todays collection. Allow me to intrduce Lymphgar! 



Lymphgar knows no equal for lumpy spikes and sports seven pyramids of thump in two, stacked, offset rows of three with one more topping the crown.



Lymphgar is made of the same fine steel and polished Walnut only having a considerable knob on the end of the shaft to aid the grip. Lymphgar stretches a full 23 inches.



Lastly, and with whispered glee, I offer the last of the three. Cindy. 



Cindy has no warm wooden center and is solid steel through and through. Like the rocky shores of Antarctica Cindy is all cold, hard, icy business with a slightly tapered end to keep you holding on in adverse conditions. Cindy is not to be trifled with!



Cindy is 20 inches long of brushed steel with a tiny hard center of chromalloy.



And again with all three including a standard beer bottle for size reference.




You have a hard descision to make. Any of the three would make a fine companion in this springs reawakening. But which will it be? Mighty Phlegmlor? Immoveable Lymphgar. Svelte and icy Cindy? Only you can decide.



 As an aside, and I feel somewhat discomfited even making mention, but we all know that among us are those who although otherwise perfectly charming may have a slight problem with understanding the norms and moreys under which we in this society are burdened. Also, those who are less than adept at decoding interpersonal communication and/or non verbal gestures and signals. It is to those that I respectfully address the following. If you happen to cross paths in the public thouroughfare with any member species of the Constabulary while carrying any one of these fine instruments and it is NOT Halloween night or you are not with similarly dressed and arrayed persons obvioulsy on your merry way to a costume party or fancy dress ball you will be assured of some excitement. I don't mean excitement in front of you, or around you. The excitement will be most assuredly happening TO you. Although, you, yourself, will probably also be excited to some degree. Do not let this happen. It is usually better for the individual to happen to other people, and not to let them happen to you.

Ah yes, this sordid business of price. $130 each shipped to the cont US. 100 local pick up. Otherwise, further arrangements will have to be made. These are all handmade works of Clubby art made by myself with quality and longevity in mind. I can also make many other similar or dissimilar things on request. . Thanks for looking and I hope spring slides up into summer for you with the greatest of ease and satisfaction.

Serial# puts it at 1967. Tobacco sunburst top, natural mahogany sides and back. This is the square shouldered model-- not the slope shouldered, and it has the trapeze bridge, which essentially eliminates the problem of ""bellying"" or bridge pulling that are so common with 12 strings. Nice bright, full sound that you'd expect from a Gibson. Action is nice and low, neck is solid and straight as an arrow, and saddle has plenty of room for adjustment. Completed items on ebay have these going for anywhere from $1500 to $2500. But the market is down here in NH, and not a lot of people have cash to throw around, so I'm checking to see what people might have to offer for trades. Often trades can benefit both parties more than a cash sale. Would make a nice gift for a collector or player.  This is NOT a ""brand new"" guitar-- it's got its share of nicks and dings and repairs. While it's been restored and has a clean bill of health, it's been played, and has lots of mojo; it's a players guitar, for sure."

I feel the need to address the above post in quotes, since the poster decided in a sense to call me out (ad was posted right after 4 of my ads for ""New Custom Built ARs"" were posted).  The Anderson Mfg. and Aero Precision builds on the Summerville/Charleston ads are indeed built by a professional with over 30 years experience in builds, repairs, and coatings.  This individual built the guns prior to obtaining his FFL and starting a company; therefore, they are being sold as private builds.  The company is W & M Sales and Service , and their website is www.wandmsalesusa.com.  As a representative of the builder, I did not want to confuse the ads by adding a lot of this information, as it would be provided to the potential buyer during the initial contact. 

To the poster....I hope this clarified things for you.  Please contact the originator of an ad you have a problem with before posting personal comments on a public site that could possibly be construed as a personal attack.  Thank you."

N-Frame, 4"" barrel, blued finish.  I bought it brand new, the only owner.  I haven't had the cover off, so no stoning of parts or any of that.  It's just back from the factory (had wrong size rear sight blade insert installed originally).  I called S&W, they sent me a 2-day air shipping label the next day and paid to ship it both ways, I had it back in under 3 wks, with a whole new rear sight assembly, and they decided to put in a brand new cylinder and sent along extra walnut grips as well (apparently they updated the parts).  ~200 rds total fired through it on the old cylinder in two outings, most of them (~150) .44 specials.) Worked great, never a misfire.  I haven't fired it yet since getting it back, so except for the very light use on the frame and barrel, it's basically brand new.  Timing is great.  Shoots the .44spl's quite softly without much recoil.  Similar ballistics to a .45acp, but more reliable. There is one small blemish, a tiny light spot in the bluing of the barrel (see pics), which can be easily touched up with some gel-blue and a toothpick.  It is small, so I've left it as-is.  That's why the price is reduced.  I like the gun, as the amount of accessories I've purchased should tell you, I'm only selling it because my situation has changed and I really need to put the money towards outstanding debts.  It's a great backpacking or dirt biking gun, or if you're in 'large and possibly aggressive' animal country and you don't want to carry a rifle.

Comes with: Extra new factory walnut grips, Pachmyer 'Decelerator' grips, (4) HKS 29 Speed loaders.  $750 is the price, firm.  $875 gets you everything listed in this ad, a bonus discount for taking care of it all at once.

I am selling my Taurus .40 S&W pistol.  I shot one 20 round box through it only. The PT101 AF has the adjustable rear sight and accessory rail. 

This is still in new condition.

2 magazines and case are included.

I bought a Kahr .40 from my uncle - so no trades please.

I don't believe these are still in production, but they sold for around $470-$550 new.  These are values I got from on-line stores (like budsgunshop) and big box stores (like Gander, Bass Pro... the overpriced stores).

The finish is a beautiful non-reflective hawkeye matte steel, trigger pull is crisp and excellent in DA/SA.

This is a collector's gun as much as it is a lethal combat firearm. Ruger only made 2000 SS models like this, taking the design from legendary gun writer and Marine Combat instructor Wiley Clapp. This is a gun you can pass on to your kids. Hard to find online and avalaible, more so as the remaining amount of this production model is bought out. The design is Ruger's famous, unbreakable GP-100--built tough for thousands upon thousands of rounds. This piece is also articulated by it's beautiful design, sexy finish, and custom Wiley Clapp rubber wood inlaid grips. Those who have held this gun have never felt a finer, more comfortable combat pistol. Novak sights get you on point, and contoured design makes for great everyday carry.

You are buying this pistol from a USMC SGT. Who has put under 50 rounds through it for accurizing and combat testing, then religiously cleaned, polished, and lubricated before going back into it's box. It comes in original form, with box, papers, lock, and I will also throw in a speed loader. $700

I have a crimson trace lg-435h laser with holster that is designed specifically for the pf9 and fits it seemlessly.

I really like this tightly integrated laser, since as soon as you grip the gun you automatically activate the laser, which means nothing to remember and nothing extra to practice.  A really nice accessory for a ccw gun like the pf9.  The only problem with them is that they are expensive (and require different holsters).  So buying this one used helps keep the cost down, and it comes with a pocket holster to get you started in holsters.  Also comes with the original box, tiny Allen wrench to mount and whatever other swag is in the box.

I see msrp is 229, I see lots online for 200 and a couple examples for about 170 with shipping.  I'll sell this one for $120 if you can meet me in monument or north Colorado springs (like chapel hills mall) if you live too far away, I can drop this in the mail for the cost of postage.  I have a few other holsters (laser and no laser) and some spare mags for my pf9 that I'll list in ads in the appropriate categories if you need those as well"

With the Spectre 22, users will also enjoy its multi-caliber versatility.

The Spectre 22 has a unique CTA baffle design for easy disassembly and is user serviceable, which is very important for any .22 lr silencer. Because the .22 lr round is not copper jacketed, molten lead and carbon debris will explode into the silencer when the projectile exits the muzzle. After some time it is possible for a .22 suppressor to fill completely with lead and become heavy and ineffective. To avoid this issue .22 silencers must be able to be disassembled for cleaning and regularly maintained. Most .22 silencers on the market can be disassembled for cleaning, however they require cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds or often times they will fuse together and they are unable to come apart. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the silencer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the tube, there is simply too much build up of fouling and lead to remove the tube from most .22 lr silencers on the market. The Spectre 22 has the unique CTA baffle design that keeps the carbon and lead debris from reaching the silencer tube allowing it to be disassembled easily."

Until Silencerco introduced the Sparrow 22, the only .22 silencers that could be disassembled for cleaning required a cleaning every 50 to 200 rounds. However, often the components of those silencers would be fused together and unable to come apart. Competitor products on the market have baffles in their .22 silencers that must be removed by twisting the outer tube around the baffles and/or sliding the outer tube off of the baffles. When the lead and carbon debris adhere to the inner wall of the outer tube and fill the spaces between the baffles and the outer tube, there is simply too much buildup of fouling and lead to remove the outer tube in that manner.

I bought one of these when I first got my keltec, and another when I bought the crimson trace laser for it.  The pistol is gone now, so I am selling the accessories. 

The removable leather flap helps break up the pattern of the gun especially when using as a wallet holster.  I personally always carried as a pocket holster without the flap as printing wasn't really bad, but the flap would break it up more and would really be necessary for wallet carry.

A decent holster that the guy that makes them sells them primarily on the most common auction site, so you can find them there for comparison and probably a better description.  

They sell for $34 with shipping, so you can have your choice of either for $20 if you want to meet me in monument or north Colorado Springs (like chapel hills mall).  If the gas isn't worth it to come pickup, I can drop in the mail for the cost of postage."

I have all the original materials (owners manual, cd, spent factory casing, etc). The gun is in phenomenal shape with very few marks of any sort. The reason I'm selling it is......well I really don't need to sell it but I have a few other projects I'm currently looking into that might be more of a priority.

I prefer to sell face to face but will ship if need be. Email or text (nine 06-three 61-four 148). If you want pictures emailed or texted, just let me know and I'll send some your way. I'm asking $1825 OBO for the entire package but I might be open to some trades. It doesn't hurt to ask. Thanks for looking.

The safe is in great shape with maybe a couple little nicks from moving it downstairs. I bought the safe about 6 months ago for use at home, but since then all our long firearms have been moved to our cabin so we have no need for it.

 The safe is all black with electronic pin pad for opening. The safe also has 2 back-up keys in case you forget the code, etc... You can set to your own code.

 The safe is fire rated for 30 minutes to 1400 degrees.

 The safe is rated for 18 long guns with an upper shelf for ammo; or you can use 1/2 the safe for long guns and use the additional shelving for handgun storage, etc...

 Most of these safes are over-rated on the amount of long guns they will hold. There is slots for 18 guns (9 on each side), but with scopes, red-dots, etc... you're probably looking at less than 18.

It's heavy and you'll need a truck or large SUV to haul. Dimensions are: 55"" Height - 19"" Width - 20.5"" Deep. The safe can be bolted down if you prefer.

It comes with three different firing pin springs, with one spring it's a 2.5lb pull, with another is 4.5lb, and with the other it's 5.5lbs, allowing one to pick the trigger pull for carry or for the range/competition. You'll get the OEM factory trigger setup, the Ghost Rocket and all the extra springs. The reset is the shortest I've felt on the glocks I've tried, and I think you'll find the same. The gun is perfect and flawless and you wouldn't be able to tell it's been out of the box.

Bushmaster’s Carbon 15 made its debut at the 2006 SHOT Show in Vegas with mixed reviews. By the end of 2006, we had local shooters in West Tennessee and North Mississippi who swore by it, not at it. Not only has its high impact polymer receiver held up, the Carbon 15 outclasses its new no-frills competitors who do not have a Forward Bolt Assist, the C-15 is equipped with one. This M-4 type carbine also has a 16 inch standard barrel, 18 inches including the cage flash suppressor; and it comes in traditional matte military finish. This variant has a full length 13 slot Picatinny or Weaver type rail on top of the receiver. It is Optics Ready, then, and it comes with a Bushnell Trophy 1x28 red dot sight system complete with batteries, rings, and rail mounts. Here is what the factory says about the Carbon 15: Features of this lightweight, semi-automatic rifle include a standard barrel with a Gov't. mil. spec. chrome lining in both bore and chamber for optimum durability and accuracy. The 16"" barrel, and all the steel components, are manganese phosphate coated for complete protection against exterior corrosion or rust. The receivers, upper and lower, are precision molded polymer for maximum lightness and strength. The upper receiver includes an integral cartridge case deflector and a last round bolt hold open feature to alert the shooter of an empty magazine. Forward bolt assist enables the operator to continue firing under the most hostile and dirty conditions; and here the Carbon 15 stands out from its similarly priced competitors. The ribbed front handguard offers increased control and heat dissipation and is molded of mil. spec. polymer thermoset composite. Buttstock is 6 position retractable C-AR / M4 type that extends the overall length from 32 1/4 inches to 36 inches. The Bushnell 73-0131 Red Dot sight is waterproof and fogproof, multi-coated lenses with unlimited eye relief. It has a sunshade and extension tube, polarizing filter, and protective lens covers. Battery is included. All of this makes this not only the lightest AR-15 type rifle on the market, but the best value on the market for features offered. Replacement price on these rifles in our area, if a person can even find one, is upwards of $800.00 apiece. We're offering Carbon 15 in the photos , however, or one of its identical mates, for only $ 619.00. 2% discount if payment is with USPS Money Order & Not Credit Card. Not transferable to civilian residents of Aurora IL, California, Chicago, Connecticut, D.C., Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, or any jurisdiction with Any One or Any Two language; or jurisdictions that restrict AR-15 type rifles. Civilian buyers in Maryland will receive a 10 round magazine instead of the BFI 30 rounder.
