Included in the price are 300 rounds of brass ammo, 120 rounds of steel cased Tul-Ammo, and 48 rounds of various steel cased ammo all in 7.62 X 39.

OVERVIEW:

“Why yes, that’s really five shots.” Tell your friends it’s genetics. Fact is, when it comes to precision, there’s no finer pedigree in the industry than Remington® varmint rifles. And with the introduction of our new Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint, staking claim to our legendary accuracy is a more attainable feat than ever.

The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is capable of punching tiny groups straight out of the box because it’s built on the Model 700™ action, the most solid, dependable and trusted in existence.

Its 26"" heavy contour barrel is perfectly matched to its high-velocity caliber offerings, including the .243 Winchester mag. Plus, the ergonomically designed black synthetic stock has a vented beavertail fore-end for enhanced grip, reduced weight and better heat dissipation. And sharp predator eyes won’t spot the tough, non-reflective matte blued finish on the barrel and receiver. Other standard features include a hinged floorplate magazine, sling swivel studs, and a drilled and tapped receiver. The Model 700™ SPS™ Varmint is destined to leave a lasting impression on any varmint that crosses its line of sight.

KEY FEATURES:

Newly designed SPS Varmint stock with vented beavertail fore-end
Sling swivel studs included
26"" heavy-contour barrel (0.820"" muzzle O.D.)
Legendary Model 700™ action
Drilled and tapped for scope mounts"

Up beside the rather pricey SR-22R Sibling to this 10/22 Ruger Variant, it looks very attractive. This is, like the SR-22R, a standard basic 10/22, the most durable .22 Autoloader ever built. Barrel is 18 1/2 inch blue steel with folding adjustable rear sight and bead-tipped blade front sight; action is blowback semi-auto; receiver is high impact polymer with steel bolt and springs; weight empty in this configuration is only 5 pounds empty. Stock is Tapco 3 position M-4 type high impact polymer with straight pitch, better for optics than with the factory sights. Forend guard is a very stable 16-slot Picatinny Accessory rail, and of course this rifle comes with its TO-1 Weaver type receiver scope rail mount as well, that easily attaches to the four screw holes on top of the receiver, right where they’ve always been. This rifle comes furnished with a brand new factory Ruger 25 Shot Magazine. Photos show a stock specimen, buyer will receive it or one of its identical mates. This rifle is a special edition factory Rugers custom made for our good friends in the Louisiana Canebrakes. Further good news is that it is $200 cheaper than the SR-22R. Own the rifle in the photos or one of its identical mates		for only	$ 289.00.		For civilian buyers in jurisdictions where the 25 round magazines are restricted, notably Aurora IL, California, Chicago Cook County IL, Colorado, Connecticut, D.C., Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, And New York, we will sub a BX-1 Ruger Factory 10 round magazine instead of the 30 rounder, or $15 off with no magazine.

I haven't fired it very much, maybe 200 rounds of factory 220 grain match and 180 hunting ammo. I'm not a group shooter, so I don't have any groups to post, but I will tell you that I was consistently decimating small cans of Barbasol at 450 yards the last time I took this rifle out. It does not have a muzzle break like you see on a lot of magnums, but at roughly 13 pounds the weight offsets the recoil. Also, in the interest of full disclosure, it isn't a safe queen. There are a couple small dings in the stock (purely cosmetic), and I painted it in Krylon because I can never seem to decide what color I want. It is easily removable however, because I kept the paint off of the bolt and out of the action.

I need to move this soon as school priorities are taking over, so I am looking for $2200 or best offer. Cash is king, as well as local sales. If local, I will require a valid OKDL or CCW and a bill of sale. I will entertain trades, however it will only be for a factory Remington 700 (.308) AAC-SD, 5R milspec or SPS Tactical (1:10"" tw) plus cash. Thank you for looking!

Also, the pictures are of the rifle fully kitted as it sits at the moment, however the sale will NOT include the scope, bipod, sling or stock pack."

Savage Model 10 FCM Scout in 7.62x39.  I bought it two years ago and it's only been out shooting once.  The rifle had a 20"" barrel, oversized bolt knob, detachable box magazine, accu-stock and accu-trigger.  It's equipped with iron sights and a picatinny rail mounted with HI-Lux 2-7x32 long eye relief scope.  I've only shot brass cased ammo and the round count is less that 30.

Don't get all butt hurt if I ask for you ID, a concealed carry permit and ask you to sign a bill of sale.  I gotta at least try to protect my ass..  

I checked the Savage site and it looks like the rifle is no longer in production.  

I have 730 rounds of brass cased mil-surp ammo.  It's accurate but has hard military primers.  $850 if you're interested in the rifle+ammo.

First person with cash in hand gets it.

ARAK-21 556 \223 20 Inch Heavy Barrel Never shot except factory 
 ARAK-21 Upper by Faxon ARMS Adjustable Gas In Other features include:
 These sell for 1200 This has never bee fired except factory.
•The upper receiver is fully machined from an aircraft grade 6061-T6 aluminum billet in a one piece design that incorporates a full length picatinny rail (Mil-STD-1913) on the top and three additional rails on the muzzle end of the receiver, making it a full M4 style quad rail upper. The top picatinny rail is laser engraved for optic placement. There are also half-length picatinny rails available.
•12 ½” length BAU is available in 5.56, heavy profile. 16” and 20” length BAU’s are available in both the 5.56 and 300 BLK. There are two profiles to choose from, medium and heavy. BAU’s can be interchanged in less than 3 minutes by removing the (6) captive allen screws on the bottom rail using the enclosed allen wrench.
•Long stroke variable setting gas piston system. There are three options for gas flow, and one for no gas flow. This allows for single shot operation. There is also a clean out port for the gas block between the gas cylinder, and the barrel.
•Charging handle is ambidextrous, non-reciprocating, foldable, spring returned and is easily relocated from left to right side without tools by the operator.

•Model “39” Eight (8) lug bolt design with involute profile for both right and left hand versions. The extractor is positioned at 3 o’clock. This allows for a left hand version to use the same bolt by simply removing the cam pin and rotating 180 degrees and reinstalling the cam pin.

•Self-contained firing pin retention system enclosed in a rectangular bolt carrier that no longer requires a cotter pin.

•Bolted in hardened steel rail system for the bolt carrier to ride on. This allows a metal on metal wear surface for better wear characteristics and a much smoother operation.
•The ARAK-21® system allows for a folding stock to be added, as our recoil system does not extend beyond the upper receiver to fully operate. This eliminates the noise and feel of the buffer tube cycling back and forth.

 It will fit on any AR-15 Lower shown on Rock River.
 Scope, Forward Grip, Sling not included. I have seen these operate in real time and they are awesome read reviews and check out their links.
 New Cost is 1199 plus tax and shipping. This one is new with box and paperwork. 999.00 or trade for Colt Defender or Colt New Agent.

The stock Glock 34 Gen 3 goes for $699 at Gander Mountain and Vance Outdoors. Night Sights will run you another $100, extended slide and mag release another $40-50 plus bench time. You're looking at around $850 plus tax in stores.

Many shooters prefer the Gen 3 model over the Gen 4. This highly accurate pistol has found widespread use as a competitive pistol for USPSA, IDPA, IPSC, GSSF and other sport shooting organizations. Makes a great home defense gun or range gun. Should be very female friendly shooter with little recoil.

I’ve owned this for just a few months. I purchased it as a potential home protection weapon, which it is indeed a good one, however it makes my wife way too nervous to leave it sitting out, and when children visit the house I have no place to stash the gun save my vehicle or loft, which is a pain. 

I've added a nice five-shell ammo butt sleeve to the shotgun (included), and will also include a partial box of bird shot, and 4-5 #3 buckshot shells.  

I’ve decided to stick to my easy to hide pistols for home protection. My loss is someone else’s gain to own this pretty piece Old West arsenal history for protection, game hunting, or if you’re good, skeet shooting.

Advantage Arms says to shoot only quality ammo such as CCI Mini Mags but I have put CCI, Blazer and Remington through it with no issues.

The smudge in the photo is just a thump print in the oil, it is in perfect condition.  The first time I shot the kit I shot a little high so I called Advantage Arms and they said some people do shoot high so they sent me a black Heine front replacement sight which is included. I now shoot point of aim with it. It is a great training tool for shooting cheap 22 vs 9MM or 40. It has been to the range twice and was purchased by me this summer for $295. + shipping.

Columbian Madsen Rifle Collection 30-06 This auction is for Columbian Military Rifles chambered in .30-06. This semi auto is the rarest with only around 5000 being made for Columbia. It is in very good condition and has all the visible numbers matching. The Madsen bolt action is another unusual military rifle. It was produced at a time when most militaries were moving to semi auto rifle and only around 5000 of these were manufactured. It is in very good condition. The barrel has an early form of ""scout sights"" and even has an intergal muzzle brake of unusual design. The butt plates on both these rifles are soft rubber. Here is a chance to enjoy a unique and hard-to-find Columbian rifles. Please email any questions or requests for additional, detailed pictures that you wish to see. In cardboard box to protect them.

We would to this only to protect the buyer as well as us against any civil or criminal violations and greatly appreciate. I'll let pictures tell the story, and provide links to info about these rifles, but essentially, the Danish Madsen was the last Military bolt action rifle produced, and due to it being produced after WW2, it actually never saw any military use, and was only stored by the Columbians who were the only country to place an order for the rifles. After storage, they were sold surplus to the USA, and are found only on the second hand market now. They are chambered in .30 cal(30-06) for the american M2 ball ammunition, which is why i picked it up, as i have several U.S. rifle already in 30-06, as well as a supply of M2 ball ammo to feed this rifle and others. THey have an integrated muzzlebreak, and adjustable peep sights as original equipment. This rifle is in original condition, and not sporterized in any way. Estimates place the total quantity of these rifles made at less than 6500 total, since columbia never accepted the contract with Madsen, no more were ever made, so these rifles are a cool piece of C&R military history. Columbia never accepted the contract due to the U.S. loan/leasing them a stockpile of semi-auto M1 Garands and Carbines after WW2, not due to any flaws with the madsen, it's just that the bolt-action rifle's day had passed and semi-auto's were the new norm THANKS FOR THE INTEREST AND HAPPY BIDDING!!!"

This pistol has been completely reworked, and shoots amazingly.

The Slide:
The slide has lightening holes cut into it on the sides and the top. The recess on both sides of the slide have also been milled for a more pronounced look, and to shave off a touch more weight. Front cocking serrations have also been added to the end of the slide. The barrel has been polished, and the slide is finished off in Cerakote Burnt Bronze.

The Frame:
The frame has had the entire trigger guard reworked for more comfortable handling. The trigger guard has also undercut for a higher grip purchase. The frame has been stippled for a more rock solid grip with sweaty hands as well. The frame has been finished in Cerakote Coyote Tan.

Internally:
Trigger job has been done for reduced pull and overtravel. Breaks cleanly and crisp at 4.25 lbs every time. Also has a Wolff steel recoil guide rod and 20 lb recoil spring. 

The pistol comes with three magazines, the box, and all the factory paperwork etc. 
2 magazines are 17 rounds mags, and 1 is a 17 round with an Arredondo base plate for a total capacity of 22 rounds.

This is not a ""BIG NAME"" build like those pistols you see selling for $2500 and up, but this is as close as you'll get without having to spend that much money. This gun shoots flawlessly and accurately, and eats anything. You will not be disappointed.

Not interested in trades, only want to sell.

I purchased it with the intention of using it on a lower receiver I already had, but almost immediately decided to register that lower as an SBR.  When I purchased it a few months ago, I took it out of the box to inspect it and fired 10 rounds to be certain it operated properly.  Ten rounds, no more.  I then cleaned it thoroughly and replaced it in the packing.  Shortly after this I received my Class III stamp for the lower and have decided to purchase a new 9"" instead.

This upper comes in the original box, with all of the original packing, paperwork and even the shipping carton.  You will not be able to tell this receiver from a new one, inside or out!  I would keep it if it were not for wanting a new AAC short barrel.  I'm not interested in trades or bartering.  This gun listed for $999.00 new and can be found for the same on Gunbroker now.  This is an original AAC upper that is priced to save you some money.  Thank you for your interest.

Its the base model AR-15 from Smith & Wesson. I bought it new for $1150 (probably not the best deal) from a gun dealer in Pacifica, in late summer of 2013.

I've fired maybe 350 rounds through it, and honestly haven't even taken it the range once this year. I've kept it clean, maintained.

Here's the thing. I also had Cerakote applied to this rifle. You can find out all about Cerakote here (http://www.cerakoteguncoatings.com/), but essentially it is professional grade finish for guns. I was living in Daly City at the time and I knew rust was going to form from the foggy climate so I had this applied as a pre-emptive strike against rust. It works great, had it done by a certified Cerakote applicator who is also an ex-cop.. go figure.

The color of cerakote is called ""Burnt Bronze."" Honestly I love the look of this gun, but I need to sell it. Sadly a lot of folks want an untouched, or black unfinished rifle.. so I am dropping the price to $850 which is a steal for how good of condition this is in. The rifle is rust proof and looks awesome... its just not black.

I only removed it from the box to inspect it when it came, and that is all.  It has never been used.  Nikon is a leading name in optics, and this scope is specifically designed to be used with the .300 Blackout cartridge on the AR platform.  It is an excellent scope.  I purchased the mounts for it also and will include them as part of the sale.  I am not interested in trades or bartering please.  Thank you for your interest.

Embracing a New Caliber:
The .300 AAC Blackout is one of the industry’s hottest new cartridges for AR platform rifles.  This is an extremely versatile cartridge that provides the ability to shoot subsonic ammunition for low-noise applications and supersonic ammunition for long-range shots. Nikon has developed the all-new P-300 BLK riflescope to harness the effectiveness of this exciting new caliber.

Spot On Optimized:
 Introducing the all-new BDC SuperSub Reticle
Designed for the ballistic profiles of the .300 AAC Blackout cartridge in both supersonic and subsonic loads, the P-300 BLK is completely optimized for use with Spot On™ Ballistic Match Technology, which allows shooters to discover all of the exact aiming points on the BDC SuperSub reticle at different yardages for any ammunition and load.

Spring-Loaded Zero-Reset Turrets:
To simplify field adjustments, Nikon has integrated Spring-Loaded Zero-Reset Turrets into the P-300 BLK. Just sight in at 100 yards as usual, then lift the adjustment knob, rotate to your “zero”, and re-engage.

Fully Multicoated Optical System:
High Resolution From Dawn to Dusk 
Nikon engineered the entire optical system in the P-300 BLK to provide the shooter with maximum brightness and maximum light transmission.  The result is an extraordinarily clear sight picture.

Hand-turn 1/4 MOA Adjustments:
Reticle adjustments are made in 1/4 MOA click-stop moves you can both feel and hear, and with no backlash to make your shot creep off target. Positive click reticle adjustments get you zeroed in quicker and maintain your setting—even with repeated recoil and under rugged conditions."

Antique Cannon – High Quality

High quality and fully functional miniature known as a “desk top cannon”

This thing is old and I will describe it with what I know and what I think.  If you have expertise and/or experience and can tell me more … please do.  Email me.

I found this in an estate buried in stuff.  The patina in the wood and the age (with surface rust) of the iron confirms its age.  All I did to clean it up was to scrub it with a rag because I did not want to impact the patina.

The cannon base measures    and the barrel is … long.  The end of the tube is about …
I have fired it and it works well; perhaps too well.  Once, I loaded it (and even put less of a charge in it) and pointed it out into the harbor/river across from my house … thinking the projectile would land in the water.  It actually went over the river/harbor and disappeared over the other side.

The caps and the nipple were interesting to figure out.  Part of the reason that I think it is REALLY OLD is the nipple.  They come in sizes and this is the larger size.  I tried to find a smaller (modern cap) nipple that would fit, and they do not exist.  I investigated getting a machine shop to make a modern sized nipple that would fit, but failed.  Eventually, I found a web site that led to the one company that still makes these nipples, which are intended for Civil War re-enactors with Civil War era weapons.  They use this size (which I learned while looking at weapons at Gettysburg).  I purchased all of those caps that I could … AND THEY WORK GREAT.  Apparently, the previous owner was shooting large marbles.

The other interesting part is the engraved plate that is on it.  It is hard to read (and harder to photograph) but it's there and you can make it out.

Pretty cool.  Prefer cash FTF but will ship after payment.  This is not a ""gun"" so can mail.  Shipping in the 48 included in sales price.
