Product Information, Features, Specifications:

This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

It weighs just 10.2 ounces without a magazine. The pistol has a black polymer frame and features 4140 steel inserts molded into the front and back of the frame for added rigidity. It has a machined, solid 416 matte stainless steel slide and a textured polymer grip.
The Kahr CW380 features a lock breech, modified Browning type recoil lug, and utilizes Kahr's seven patents including the ""safe cam"" action found in all Kahr pistols. The result is a micro-compact pistol with very little recoil and quick follow-up shots. The pistol features drift adjustable white bar-dot combat rear sight and pinned-in polymer front sight.
Differences between the Kahr CW380 and Kahr P380 models include: the CW series has a conventional rifled barrel instead of the match grade polygonal barrel found on P models; the CW slide stop lever is MIM (metal-injection-molded) instead of machined; the CW series slide has fewer machining operations, and uses simple roll marking instead of engraved markings; the P380 comes with two magazines, but the CW series comes with one 6 rd steel magazine with flush baseplate. Lastly, the slide locks back after firing the last round – another feature missing on a number of other value-priced compact semi-auto pistols. The durability and reliability of the CW380 model makes it a strong consideration as a backup gun for law enforcement.

Are you interested in getting more consistent groups out of your rifle? Glass bedding the receiver, and working the kinks out of the trigger will definitely help if your bore is good, they were build for 2-3MOA accuracy, but with a solid rifle and experimenting with different bullet weights you can do much better.

I had a lot to list so if I missed something please contact me.  All firearm sales will be in accordance to local State and Federal laws so please make sure you know what yours are.  All firearms that are shipped will be shipped to a licensed FFL of your choice.  Handguns will be shipped at $25.00 and long guns at $50.00; this will include packaging, insurance and tracking.  No dreamers, no holding guns for a week or two, no loans or payment plans, no trades (Lord knows I have plenty more).  Cash in person, CC through PayPal (but you will need to add 5% that PayPal charges me for processing), checks ok, but the funds need to clear MY bank prior to shipping or picking up.

If not otherwise stated all my firearms are in pristine, new condition – I collect, don’t shoot.  Almost 90% of my collection is not even broken in – under 200 rounds fired per firearm.  I clean the guns every 3 months, and they are stored in a climate controlled indoor gun safe.  You are more than welcome to inspect the guns at my gun range in Cornelius, NC but do not ask to meet anywhere else because the answer will be no.

I provided a picture of the gun so you can view the actual piece but for more detailed information please go to the manufacturer’s website 1st then if more information is needed send me an email.  I do work but check my emails regularly.

I had a lot to list so if I missed something please contact me.  All firearm sales will be in accordance to local State and Federal laws so please make sure you know what yours are.  All firearms that are shipped will be shipped to a licensed FFL of your choice.  Handguns will be shipped at $25.00 and long guns at $50.00; this will include packaging, insurance and tracking.  No dreamers, no holding guns for a week or two, no loans or payment plans, no trades (Lord knows I have plenty more).  Cash in person, CC through PayPal (but you will need to add 5% that PayPal charges me for processing), checks ok, but the funds need to clear MY bank prior to shipping or picking up.

If not otherwise stated all my firearms are in pristine, new condition – I collect, don’t shoot.  Almost 90% of my collection is not even broken in – under 200 rounds fired per firearm.  I clean the guns every 3 months, and they are stored in a climate controlled indoor gun safe.  You are more than welcome to inspect the guns at my gun range in Cornelius, NC but do not ask to meet anywhere else because the answer will be no.

I provided a picture of the gun so you can view the actual piece but for more detailed information please go to the manufacturer’s website 1st then if more information is needed send me an email.  I do work but check my emails regularly.

Night Vision Helmet Mount:
AKA2 Night Vision Goggle Helmet Mount Assembly (AKA2 HMA) with Universal Shroud. The AKA2 mount is precision manufactured from high grade metal billet to achieve ultimate strength and tight tolerances resulting in the best wobble-free helmet mount on the market. Using both sockets the AKA2 night vision helmet mount is compatible to both PVS-7/14 and PVS 15/18/21 style goggles.
Shroud:
This Universal Shroud is designed to easily mount a night vision goggle to a 3 hole or 1 Hole helmet without the need for straps. The Universal Shroud attaches to various 3 hole and 1 Hole ballistic helmets with the most common being the MICH. This Universal Shroud will also fit non ballistic helmets such as PROTECH. If drilling is required please consult your helmet manufacture to obtain its effect on the integrity of your helmet. Another feature the Universal Shroud has is its Lanyard Break Away Tether Plug, allowing one to attach a lanyard from their Universal shroud and goggles to keep them from misplacing one or the other.

I have a used Polytech Mak 90 for sale.  It's a true Polytech, not a Norinco, and it has a 1.5mm reciever.  It was one of those poor guns that had it's markings removed shortly after the ban, but it still retains its Factory 386 markings on the trunnion. Some yahoo who owned it prior to me took out the rear trunnion and then reinstalled it with screws rather than rivets, it works fine but it doesn't look very good. 

The good news is mechanically the gun is perfect, the BCG looks brand new despite the fact that the bluing on the gun has wear. The gun has one of the best actions of any AK I've ever seen, it's extremely slick, everything is perfectly aligned and it rivals some of the best AKs on the market. It's got some age and would be a fantastic shooter, but at heart it's a Polytech, which means quality. The gun is 922r compliant, it has a US PG nut, screw, PG, K-var US stock, G2 trigger, US gas tube and heat shield and will come with a tapco mag. I'll also throw in three chinese 30 round surplus mags and the original thumbhole stock if you so desire. 

Price is 640$, which I think is very fair, it IS a Polytech afterall.  I would much prefer cash over trades, but I'm willing to entertain offers provided they're in my favor.  You're going to have to have something pretty special to entice me."

It is a fantastic carry gun as it actually has 3 safety positions! Comes with case, speed loader, extended mag and regular mag. It is basically 2 sized guns in one. Using the regular mag, it makes for a nice concealed carry weapon. Also comes with an extended mag to make it full size. Be legal and I will do a bill of sale.
The SR9c compact pistol weighs in at 23.40 oz. and features an overall length of 6.85"", a height of 4.61"", and the same slim 1.27"" grip width (across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. It comes with two magazines that provide options in both capacity and grip size. The standard magazine holds 10 rounds and features a flat bottom butt plate; a finger grip extension floor plate is also included. The second magazine features a grip adapter and holds 17 rounds, instantly transforming the smaller, compact grip into a full-sized 9mm grip. The 3.50"" barreled pistol features an integral accessory rail that accommodates most lights and lasers.
The SR9c compact pistol utilizes the same adjustable, high-visibility 3-Dot sight system as its full-sized predecessor, setting it apart from many compact pistols that rely on fixed sights. New serrations are located on the front portion of the slide, making it easier to both manipulate the slide and to press check the chamber.
Just like the original, full-sized SR9, the SR9c is loaded with modern safety features like a 1911-style ambidextrous manual safety, internal trigger bar interlock and striker blocker, trigger safety, magazine disconnect, plus a visual and tactile loaded chamber indicator."

Trade value $350

  I have a single shot, lever action, .22 mag and 240 rounds of good ammo.  It is an Ithaca Model 49 Saddle gun (Made in the 60s).  It was originally a .22lr but was re-chambered to .22mag.  They did make the M49 in .22mag from the factory also though.  Its in very nice shape.  Scope that's on it now is a tasco 3x7, not the cheaper fixed 4x that's pictured.  The only flaws are that its missing the rear sight, but they can be ordered ($12), has a small imperfection in the bluing on the barrel and and a little paint is chipped off the lever.

Rifle only came with 2 stock mags & the box when I bought it. The new owner will get the original box, 2 stock mags & 2 10rd P-mags (weapon will also take any AR style mags), 3-9x42 scope/red dot, 146 rounds of American Eagle Green Tip 5.56, 30 rounds of Tula .223, & 19 rounds of PMC .223

Last range outing I zeroed the scope to 100yrds (top mounted red dot has not been zeroed yet) & then cleaned the rifle & put it away in the safe. Just don't shoot it enough to want to keep it. Not against trades so let me know what you have. Would love to add a RIA 1911 to my pistol collection."

Quite the neat gun in that it's both a black powder shotgun as well as shoots balls on a 1"" Renegade frame. Specifically made for New England hunters who were not allowed to use rifled barrels during black powder season in the late 70's. This gun is quite rare and it's estimated that only about 2000 or so were made. Great gun from everything from deer with balls out to 100 yards, and depending on shot and powder good for small game to turkey.

These guns are becoming quite collectible as they're getting harder and harder to get. They're also very sought after by people shooting in black powder matches and are also compatible with any aftermarket 1"" barrel (green mountain etc) meaning you can buy a nice rifled barrel for it to go along with the smooth bore, though this is arguably one of the best 26"" barrels ever made. . Gun is used, but in great condition, it was my first black powder gun and carried by me and my father before me (who bought it new) and has taken quite a few deer between the two of us so it has minor dings from being in the deer woods but overall nice and still a great shooter.

This is the billeted GTR-3S AMBI (meaning you can release the bolt from either side, without needing one of those magpul B.A.D. levers - it's actually a pretty nice feature. I assembled it, and borrowed my friends upper to try it out - fired 50rds or less (you'd never be able to tell it was fired, just has a little locktite in the screw holes because I did put it together, but no need to lie that I didn't fire it). Ended up not liking how the mega upper receiver looks (I'm ocd in a bad way) and ordered a different brand matching upper/lower. This is a STRIPPED lower - you should know how to put this thing together. Everything shown in the pictures is what's installed. I still have the receipt from Rainier Arms where I bought it for $225 plus shipping/fees/etc. I'm firm on the price, and I am strict on following the law, so you'd be paying the $20 at a local shop for a background test (sorry, I know it's a pain). Also has the mega arms instruction kit. Like I said, price is firm (I think the price is more than fair, you're getting it basically brand new for $80 cheaper and no shipping/tax/etc) and you'd pay the $20 background check fee. Let me know if you have any questions, you can see more info about it here... Thanks!

AMERICAN INGENUITY MEETS EUROPEAN REFINEMENT
The legendary 1911 design has been brought into the 21st century with the refinement today’s shooters demand. The SIG SAUER® 1911 proves that close tolerances equal complete reliability and need not be incompatible in an off-the-shelf pistol. SIG SAUER has introduced clean, distinct lines that American shooters have embraced, while retaining the crisp trigger pull, classic ergonomics, and exceptional accuracy they expect.

The 1911 Scorpion is truely unique, from its desert tan Cerakote® coated stainless frame and slide. Complete with a 5.0 lb SAO trigger, 8 round magazine, and low-profile night sights. 

The 1911 Scorpion features Hogue's innovative Magwell Grip Set. The advanced design combines grip plates and main spring housing in an integrated magazine well extension that promotes rapid magazine changes. Manufactured from G10, the Magwell Grips provide strength and light weight in a highly functional assembly. The grips feature Hogue's Piranha texture for excellent retention in any environment and come in a multi-layer green and black pattern that accents the Scorpion's Cerakote Flat Dark Earth finish."

The M6A2™ rifle is ideal for those who utilize optical sights as it employs a low- profile gas block. There is no A-frame front sight to obscure the field of view of the optical device. The M6A2™ rifle also features a longer midlength free float rail system with a removable return-to-zero top. Any M4 MIL Std 1913 accessory can be mounted to the rail, and because the rail has a monolithic profile, you can bridge devices from the receiver to the rail seamlessly. The longer rail also affords more 1913 “real estate” to mount your accessories.

What we have here, gentlemen, is ""The Rifleman's Rifle."" A late 50's era Pre-64 Winchester Model 70, with the world famous ""claw extractor"" controlled feed design. It enjoyed a good life in its original chambering as a .220 swift, but that caliber is a notorious barrel burner, and somewhere along the line it was rechambered into the venerable .257 Weatherby. The favorite chambering of Roy Weatherby himself, he once took down a cape buffalo in Africa with one shot from the .257 just to prove it was possible. This particular rifle has a butter smooth action, 3 position safety, crisp trigger that breaks like glass somewhere around 2 lbs, and shoots sub-MOA with Weatherby factory loaded ammunition. The condition of the rifle is fair, it is definitely not a show piece. It has honest wear from good use of a gun over 50 years old. It appears that at some point someone added a raised cheek piece and tried to turn it into a left handed stock, but the work has been skillfully repaired. The true value of this rifle is all in the action. This rifle will be great for someone who wants to own a piece of U.S. history and do some serious long-range shooting/medium-game hunting as well, or someone who wants to build a BADASS custom rifle on one of the greatest actions ever manufactured! My plan was to hunt with it a few times and eventually build it into a sweet 7mag, but I've been blessed with a wife and babies instead :-) It comes complete with; hard case, additional 22"" sporter barrel chambered in .270 wby (never tested) and RCBS reloading dies and brass on request. Asking a firm $600 on this one, another hundred and I will throw in a 3-9x50 Redfield scope with rings. Will consider trade for a 3 1/2 chamber semiauto shotgun, 7mm RM rifle or high quality scope."

The only problem I can tell on this is the spring system for the sight is pushed down therefor no resistance is on the rear sight and it can move up and down pretty easily.  I intended to make this a bullpup but went with a .308 instead so I never fixed it.

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of brand new, factory fresh and hard to find Henry H001V Varmint Express .17 HMR lever action rifles!

I just have two in stock, and have them priced to sell for only $489.00 each.

Henry H001V Varmint Express .17 HMR Lever-Action Rifle, 20 Inch Barrel, American Walnut Stock

This is the rifle the range riders of the 1800′s would have loved to have had close at hand for picking off varmints or just plinking at whiskey bottles. But since the .17HMR didn’t hit the market until 2002, it will be up to you to make it a legend.

Our Henry Varmint Express® rifle packs eleven .17HMR rounds in its tubular magazine. It features a 20″ barrel, comes with a checkered American walnut Monte Carlo stock. Like all lever action Henrys, the action is incredibly smooth from the very first shot. It will enable small game and varmint hunters to take full advantage of the .17HMR with regard to velocity, trajectory, wind drift, richochet resistance, quietness and accuracy.

Already considered by many to be the most accurate rimfire cartridge ever produced, the .17HMR incorporates a .17 caliber bullet into a necked-down .22 magnum case. This high-powered combination produces a sizzlin’ muzzle velocity of up to 2,550 feet per second and the laser-flat trajectory makes it lethal for long-range shots on woodchucks, prairie dogs, foxes and other small varmints. Henry’s take on this revolutionary caliber, the Varmint Express, has a 20″ barrel that delivers dead-on accuracy.

Just like all Henry rifles, it’s handcrafted in the United States using only high-grade components such as a checkered American walnut stock, and Williams Fire sights and, of course, it’s outfitted with that legendary, smooth-operating lever action that sets a Henry rifle apart from all the imitators.

I had this scope for a little over a month (still have box). Reason Im selling is that I was planning on doing more long range shooting than I actually have time for (or the money). This scope was going to be used as duel use for long range shooting and (long range) hunting. I did not try and cheap out on this scope. I bought what would be best for the scope. Also I put in a lot of time lapping the rings so there would be equal pressure around the body of the scope. 

The scope is in like brand new condition. It is currently held by Burris extreme tactical rings (low), that have been lapped. 

The anti-cant is a Holland Signature Series. Best in my opinion. 

I paid:
Scope $1400
Rings $63
Anti cant $65

Total $1528
