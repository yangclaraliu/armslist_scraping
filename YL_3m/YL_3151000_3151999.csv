It's a blast to shoot, but as you can tell by the stockpile of ammo, I just don't shoot it enough.  Plus I sold my press so I cant reload for it anymore which makes it expensive.

The sleek SpecOps Folder takes the pain out of shooting magnum buckshot and slug loads even when the stock is folded. A sturdy, rubber-coated, folding wire-frame stock with integral rubber buttpad collapses easily over the receiver for convenient storage and mobility in tight spaces such as vehicles, motorcycles, hallways, and entryways. Shooters testing the SpecOps Folder with magnum buckshot loads found that there is virtually no muzzle rise and that recoil was significantly reduced in both the open and folded positions.

Rifle is in exceptional condition with only the slightest handling marks. Overall condition is any easy 95%+. 

Frankly you'll find it hard to believe this rifle is well over 100 years old after inspecting it, but it is 100% true. 

There is absolutely no rust, pitting of the metal or cracks in the stock. Finishes on both are excellent. 

Every number matches on this rifle including the cleaning rod. 

Bore is excellent with no darkening or worn rifling. 

Bayonet is made by SOLINGEN and is also in excellent condition. Number does not match the rifle. 

IMA USA obtained a small quantity of the same bayonet a few months ago and sold out at $275 each. 

Also included is 5 boxes of Argentine made surplus 7.65 ammo. Head stamp SF 81.  

Asking $575 with pickup in the Brandon area. You must be at least 18 to purchase. 

Since this rifle is a true antique by ATF definition (made in or before 1898) it can legally by shipped directly to a legal age purchaser in most cases. 

I would consider shipping at the buyers expense which runs about $35 - $40 via Priority Mail Insured.

I hate to say its BNIB cause everyone says that and its kind of stupid to buy guns and sell them a few months later, I know this. But in reality, I bought this brand new in March with my tax refund. Haven't had a chance to go shooting yet, so it hasn't ever been fired, and I just don't think I will ever get a chance to take it out. I have other long guns which are more for hunting, and I just don't foresee that I will ever get a chance to use this in a practical sense, so I am selling it.

I am asking $725 but I might be wiling to negotiate a little. Let me know if you have any questions

Purchased back in 2011. It has been in my safe for the most part and hasn't seen much use. When I first purchased, it frequently failed to eject. Upsetting me so much, it went into the safe and I didn't pull it out much until this year. I sent it back to Sig Sauer and they installed a new lower unit on it, fired 90 test rounds and sent it back functioning flawlessly. I LOVE this gun now, but I need money more than I need this gun. It is lightly used. I will toss in 2 magazines and a little bit of ammo."

Very old turn of the century weapon.

Shotguns of that era used a 2 9/16ths "" shot shell.
So a qualified gunsmith should be consulted to determine if modern ammunition can be used.

What I was able to research was that all NEWPORT shotguns were made by either Crescent Fire Arm Company, Iver Johnson's Arms & Cycle Works, W. H. Davenport Arms Company or Stevens Arms & Tool Co. Again according to my research. the Model CN and Model WN were made by both Crescent and Iver Johnson.

I f found that Aguila makes a #7 1/2 shot 1.75"" 'mini' shell that will work for this gun.
http://www.midwayusa.com/Product/255579 ... -box-of-20

Shotgun is in good shape, no rust and appropriate patina for age.
Wood retains most of finish.
Matching serials on forearm & metal catch for forearm
Forearm a touch "" wobbly ""

If nothing else, it would make a great wall hanger for an antique side by side enthusiast.

More pics upon request. I only seem to be able to load two pics on Armslist.

It is based on the S&W 59 series with the addition of the ""triple action"" trigger system.

Daewoo K5 / DP51 / Lionheart pistol is short recoil operated, locked breech weapon. It uses a conventional Browning-type locking system, with two lugs on the barrel engaging cuts inside the slide. Locking and unlocking is controlled by the cam-shaped lug at the bottom of the barrel. Frame of the pistol is made from aluminium alloy; all other parts are made from steel. Trigger is of ‚Äútriple action‚Äù type. This means that other than traditional double or single action fire modes it has ‚Äúfast action‚Äù mode, apparently borrowed from FN‚Äôs GP ‚ÄúFast Action‚Äù pistol. In this mode hammer is cocked by the cycle of the slide, then it is pushed forward by the pressure on the hammer head. In this position, the main spring remains cocked, so only light pressure on the trigger is necessary to recock the hammer and fire the gun in the ‚Äúdouble action manner‚Äù. Or, alternatively, hammer can be recocked manually to be fired in single action for maximum first-shot accuracy. Sights are fixed, with the rear sight dovetailed to the slide. Ambidextrous levers at both sides of the frame, above and behind grip panels. To set on safe: pull the lever up. To disengage safety: pull the lever down; red dot will appear on the frame.

Mine includes 1 10rd Magazine, a nylon holster, and 20 rounds of Hornady XTP 124gr hollow points (which work very well in this gun)

This particular target is made by Challenge Targets and I have owned it for over a year. It is used but in good condition. I'm selling it because I've moved on to some other more portable and smaller targets because I have to lug them quite a ways in my shooting area in the mountains. This is a great target for someone that needs to hike in less than about 200 yards or even leave it in place. 

I live in Monument and work in Centennial. I can meet a buyer at either of those locations for the sale. Call or text me at (937) 689-Six One Seven Four if interested.

Here are the specs from the Challenge Targets website:
This model is rated for handguns up to .44 magnum and rifles up to .308 Winchester (7.62x51).
Multifunctional stand locks in upright position or pivots and falls when hit. 
Heavy Duty Pivot Stand is larger and more durable than the Standard Duty version.
Additional size adds stability and is better suited for larger Head Assemblies. 
8"" Diameter x 2/3rd scale popper x 3/8"" AR500.
Reversible target plate for extended life.
Adjustable forward lean for different calibers.
All-weather design with powder coat finish is capable of year-round outdoor use.
Heavy 1/4"" steel construction helps protect against errant handgun shots. 
Portable, lightweight design with ergonomic front carry handle.
Description

This unique dual purpose design can be used as a static steel target or you can remove the lock pin and let if fall like a pepper popper. The innovative four point stance elevates the center of the stand so the weight is supported by the outer contact points. This reduces wobble and provides stability on uneven terrain. The stand legs are notched for staking if extra stability is needed (stakes not included). Our target plates are laser cut to reduce heat and preserve the hardness of the AR500 steel. They are also reversible which increases their life and helps keep the shooting surface flat and smooth. The target plate leans forward at a 30 degree angle to deflect bullet splatter safely to the ground.

Specifications

Target Plate: 8"" diameter x 28"" tall x 3/8"" thick AR500 steel plate - unpainted
Construction: Heavy gage steel with black powder coat finish
Stand Dimensions: 27"" long x 26"" wide x 9"" tall
Weight: 30.1 lbs

This gun has been finished with a unique deep blue finish on all metal parts, which is seamlessly complemented by the classic lines and intricate grain of the gloss finished wood furniture. This combination offers the reliability of a Kalashnikov rifle, but with a classy wood and steel finish that is more typical of American or Western European produced rifles. 

The barrel is chrome-lined and has only 70 rounds down the pipe to test for function. The gun functions reliability as expected from an AK, and the 5.45x39 round produces negligible recoil. 

The pistol grip is custom made from hickory wood and is very comfortable. The finger grooves and thumb and trigger finger rests make the gun fit your hand like a glove.

This AK-74 has been built using 6 US-made parts, so reliable surplus magazines can be used. This gun comes with one red Bulgarian Circle 21 30 round magazine and one black Tapco 30 round magazine.

The trigger is a Tapco G-2 that is relatively light and smooth. An axis pin retaining plate has been used for quick fire control group disassembly and reassembly.  

I also have a fairly large supply of 7N6 5.45x39 surplus ammo available if interested. Please email me with any questions or to request more pictures or details. I will be happy to answer any inquiries. I would be willing to ship through FFLs and would also do face-to-face private party transfer. Thanks for looking!"

The CZ50 succeeded the CZ24, 27 & 38, and was a staple with Czech police units for many years. It was later improved and served on for years more as the CZ70. 

The CZ50 is a well built all steel pistol that is quite similar to the Walther PPK. As with all CZ built firearms quality is high and function/reliability is excellent.

This particular pistol is in very good condition. It retains about 85% of it's original finish. However there are some rubs/thin spots in the bluing resulting from years of being carried in a holster. Absolutely no rust or pitting though and the bore is bright and shiny.

Grips are very good with no cracks or dings, and function is 100%. 

Pistol comes in it's original importer box with two genuine original CZ thumb rest magazines.  

Additionally a CZ cleaning rod and an original CZ holster made specifically for the CZ50 or the CZ70 is included. This holster has become quite hard to find. 

Finally there are two 50 round boxes of Fiocchi .32ACP ammo included. Ammo is recent production brass case with 73 grain FMJ bullets. 

Asking price is $350. Local FTF sale only to a Florida resident of proper age who can legally own a firearm in Florida.

Now for the second part.. R/C cars.. My one true love. Besides my 3 baby's mommas. Nitro, electric, I love em. The only way you can go 25mph in a 20mph school zone. So thrilling!

The cold hammer forging process work hardens the steel around a rifled mandrel, which creates the lands and grooves. These barrels are chambered in 5.56mm NATO. The barrel is then chrome lined to the spec for a M249 Machine Gun barrel, which is about twice as thick as that of an M4 barrel. The end result is a rifle that can be run hard day after day. Having been part of many excellent training opportunities, I have seen how a barrel may experience serious trauma from high rates of fire and sustained high temperatures. For any high round count, high temp, heavy shooting, Noveske recommends their chrome lined barrel."

Looks brand new.

Includes a $700 NIKON M-308 4-16√ó42 Scope that‚Äôs made specifically for the .308 platform with an incredible 95% light transmission rate. It‚Äôs fully water-proof, fog-proof, shock-proof and holds zero perfectly.

I also added a very expensive Magpul PRS Precision Tactical Sniper Stock which is an absolute necessity in a gun of this build. I further complimented it with a hard to find aluminum monopod made specifically for the PRS that in combination with the Harris bipod allows the gun stand to be integrated into the gun for ultra precise long range targeting.

I added a precision machined bolt-on Kahntrol Solutions Heavy Muzzle Brake designed for the .308 round. A bolt on brake is the best option since some states like California have made some threaded brakes illegal without a stamp. You can simply unbolt and remove this from the bull barrel. This muzzle brake along with the heavy bull barrel makes this AR-10 recoil lighter than most AR-15‚Ä≤s.

Also added a tactical rubber coated grip with hand relief perch. Excellent comfort and trigger control.

This is a beast of a gun and in one of the pictures you can see the size difference between it and an AR-15 sized HK 415 I have chambered in .22. This AR-10 gets a lot attention anywhere I‚Äôve taken it including a couple of trips to the range.

Includes 3 steel magazines and about 20 rounds. Serious inquiries only. Must be over 18 and legal to own and operate a firearm in Idaho. CFP a plus. I have mine.
