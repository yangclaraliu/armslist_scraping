Considering trading off my 4 Winchester Model 94 Commerative Rifles. All rifles are UNFIRED, in the original box, wrapped in the original wax paper and have all paperwork/hang tags. These are all pristine rifles.  Some of the boxes have a little wear but everything is still together. I'm mainly looking for a multiple gun deal. AR's, Glock's, anything of QUALITY. This is over 3,500.00 in guns... So all lowball offers will be ignored. The model of the 94's can be found below. Thanks for looking!

200,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3562200,For Sale/Trade:  CUSTOM 870 TACTICAL,"Dunnellon, Florida, United States",$ 750,"Listed On: Tuesday, September 8, 2015",Shotguns,Remington                                                                                ,12 Gauge                                                                                ,Pump Action                                                                                ,Shotgun,"Magpul 870P - upgrades make this one of the finest combat shotguns you could deploy in the defense of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 

It started as a Remington 870 Tactical - 18.5"" threaded barrel with Tactical RemChoke muzzle stand-off/breaching device.  XS Sights picatinny rail with XS Sights rear Ghost Ring aperture and front XS Sights blade.  3"" Magnum chambering and factory-installed +2 magazine extension makes this pack 7 full rounds of 2 3/4"" shells or 6 3"" Magnum shells.  

I then decided to add every available piece of Magpul SGA 870 furniture and accessories available: The Magpul SGA 870 stock, and forend.  In addition, I added the Magpul rear sling mount, which mounts between the receiver and stock and is ideal for connecting a single-point sling (Like the Magpul MS/2).  Also added is the front Magpul 870 sling attachment tower... which has a dual-sided connection.  One side has a fixed sling-attachment loop, the other has been enhanced with a heavy-duty, 1.25"" QD Sling Swivel.  I have added a Blue Force Gear Larry Vickers digital camo QD/Qwik Adjustment sling.  This allows me to use this sling when I want or simply detach it and use the Magpul single-point sling when I want to, and gives a LOT of various ways to connect these slings and methods of carrying the shotgun... MANY MORE Than a simple strap most people use.  Also added the SGA 870 Stock riser kit for a bit extra ""comb"" for your cheek to rest on.  This makes using a red dot sight (like an Aimpoint etc.) much easier and very, very fast.  

-- I also purchased a precision-fit LimbSaver recoil pad and the Magpul stock adapter which allows the use of the LimbSaver with the stock.  The recoil reduction, less pain, and less muzzle climb and more controlability is absolutely dramatic.


After I got done upgrading all the externals I Set about making this gun the same as the 870P specifications and I upgraded and replaced each part found on the POLICE models.  I replaced the Extractor with the non-MIM (cast steel version vs the Express MIM-metal version) Extractor.  I then replaced the carrier latch spring which is heavier and stiffer for more positive feeding and enhanced results with full power loads.  I then installed the Wilson Combat heavy duty tactical magazine spring and follower, which is actually another improvement OVER the Police specifications.  I then also added the Wilson Combat oversized safety for perfect and positive manipulation when the situation is critical.  After careful discussion with a Remington certified factory and law enforcement armorer - I decided to leave the polymer trigger guard and sear spring alone.  The only thing the sear spring does is make the trigger pull stiffer and harder... Something police agencies may way (the idea being it's harder for the officer to pull the trigger so there is less chance of him shooting before he is absolutely wanting to shoot and a lawsuit will show the trigger was hard to pull etc) but certainly no civilian ... and the Polymer trigger guard is being looked at as actually much more durable and robust than the metal version sold in the Police models, so I kept it.

-- Hand polished the chamber with Dremel, felt, compound, wheels, etc.  Painstakingly slow and smooth work for absolutely enhanced extraction.

This is a build that has over $1,100 into it, just about as custom and piece by piece upgrading on a tactical / combat defense shotgun you could want or hope to get.    $750 or best offer

With a total weight of only 766 g, (27oz) the new M-A1 pistol is extraordinarily light. The unique trapezoid sight offers a new dimension in rapid target acquisition. The sight's shape guides the eye onto the target, and thus the target is captured exactly and quickly The new innovative grip offers unsurpassed ergonomics, which results in a natural pointability. It optimally supports the natural posture of the wrist during shooting. Improved adhesion is provided by the special surface design.

Looking for $400 for SR9c and $350 for the LC9s. We do not need to sell so no low ball offers please. We just want to free up some cash for other purchases. May go lower on a package deal but we can show receipts for them new and at such a low round count we are basically taking a tax hit and we paid to prove the guns are as reliable as the Ruger brand is know for.

Can throw in cleaning kit and supplies plus range bag for the right price. The bag is a generic bag and the cleaning kit is basic as well.

Yes I am aware that a NIB WASR is 600. However it doesn't come with good wood or even finished. not does it come with a sweet wire fold, muzzle break or good grip. If you went out and bought all of the stuff I put on it would cost around 150/200 extra.

This Smith & Wesson SW40VE is truely ""LIKE NEW""!!
I purchased this brand new at Big Boys Guns in Wheatland, OK for $350, and had them do the 1st trigger job ($40) to fix the long trigger pull these guns come with from the factory, which takes the trigger pull from about 8 lbs, to about 4 lbs. (2nd trigger job can bring it close to 2 lbs.). 
Also had them install the correct S&W Rail Adapter ($15) and the Crimson Trace Laser ($185) which carries a lifetime warranty, including the battery! If battery ever dies, take it to Big Boys or any other Crimson Trace dealer and they will replace it for free, for life!
Finally a 50 count box of ammo ($30) of which I have 40 shells left. YES, this pistol has  been shot ONLY 10 times total! It shoots like a dream & it's so close to a Glock that S&W lost a lawsuit and now pays royalties! Do your research and the only complaint you will find is the stiff trigger that after being fixed, makes this a fantastic hand gun at half the price of a glock!
It also comes with the original case, two high capacity 14+1 magazines, manual, and the original box of ammo that is missing the only 10 shells ran through it when purchased.

I have $620, not including tax, invested. Would sell for $575 cash, BUT the reason I'm actually posting this is to find my nephew a nice deer rifle w/scope. Would prefer something in 7mm-08 ... but would also consider any of these ...  25-06, .260, 6.5 Creedemore, 6mm, or a nice .243 caliber rifle. Might even trade for just the rifle if it is worth it, and I'll take care of the scope!"

Miami Shooters Club provides such a course with its team of NRA certified instructors - who will teach students the important fundamentals of how to safely use a semi-automatic pistol and revolver. Your concealed weapons permit will allow you to concealed carry in more than 30 states.

Miami Shooters Club's instructors carry multiple certifications under the NRA, have traveled abroad to train and receive firearm certifications, and are hand-to-hand self defense experts - having taught multiple seminars for the Miami Dade Police Department. Under their instruction in the concealed carry class, students will learn the mechanisms behind pistols and how they operate while learning how to grip the firearm, aim, pull the trigger, get into a proper stance, and much more. The class also covers many of the legal issues and expected ethics of concealed carry in Florida. The classes are designed for complete beginners who have never touched a gun before... but experienced shooters will learn something as well.

At the end of the classroom portion, students will safely discharge a pistol under the supervision of a certified instructor, as required by the State of Florida. Miami Shooters Club will provide a firearm, ammunition, eye protection, and ear protection at no extra cost.

Classes take place in Miami on Fridays at 6:30pm or on Saturdays at 1pm.
