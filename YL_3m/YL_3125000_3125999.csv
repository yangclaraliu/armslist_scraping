Info from LaRue:

NEW LaRue Tactical PredatOBR 14.5” 5.56. The PredatOBR 5.56 was designed for those who are searching for a hybrid cross between the standard OBR and PredatAR 5.56x45 Rifles. The PredatOBR takes the highly accurate OBR 5.56 design, and lightens it in every possible way with the least-possible impact to the accuracy that the standard OBR is known for.  PredatOBR barrels are chambered in 5.56x45mm, and feature rifling in a 1/8 twist rate. All muzzles are threaded in 1/2 x 28. Like the OBR and PredatAR riles, LaRue has eliminated the conventional AR barrel nut and bolt the handguard directly to the proprietary upper receiver, creating a true “free-float” barrel. The handguard does not touch the barrel or barrel nut at any place. The zero-MOA upper rail provides plenty of room for weapon-mounted night-vision day/night combinations. Both the upper and lower are CNC-machined from billet aluminum for the optimum fit and consistency. Even though it has been lightened certain features, there is still additional material in strategic areas to achieve maximum accuracy.  The PredatOBR has threaded stainless-steel hard-points over the entire length of the handguard at the 3, 6, and 9 o’clock positions. These hard-points have an integral spine built-in for structural support. Provided with the system are three 3-inch MIL-STD-1913 rail sections that can be positioned anywhere along the handguard, per operator preference. These rail sections are attachable/detachable using a supplied tool (Torx® T-15 wrench). The rail sections are CNC-machined from billet aluminum. This robust solution provides a perfect precision mounting space for aiming lasers, illumination and bipods. The PredatOBR's Port Selector Technology™ (PST) gas block is adjustable, to aid in the optimum function when using a sound suppressor. This special gas block contains a dual port mechanism that is operated by rotating a lever from one side to another. When the lever is rotated to the right-side of the rifle, the gasses are reduced, to compensate for the extra blowback created by the suppressor. When rotated to the left side, the gasses are increased for use without a suppressor. The LaRue Tactical 6-position Retract Action Trigger (R.A.T.) Stock comes standard with every PredatOBR. It is ergonomic, has protected control surfaces and contains a set of cleaning rods in an internal compartment. Since the height of the 12 o’clock rail is at the optimum position, there is no need for a cheek riser as part of this system. The New A-PEG grip also comes standard. This grip was designed to be ambidextrous and places the hand in the corrected position for precision shooting.
3ea 3” Rail Sections, Operators Manual, Barrel Wrench, FDE Hard Case also included in this auction!"

It would seem to have been built around the time of the bi centennial as on the side plate there is the man's name that built it and the dates 1776-1976 engraved there. The rifle has a total length of 44 inches, and it has a nice balance to it. It has a flawlessly working adjustable double set trigger. It would seem that this rifle was built from a kit and was customized by the builder to his tastes, it has beautiful grain to it. It would make a great squirrel or rabbit rifle. The browning on the barrel is getting a little thin in spots and the hammer screw has split and lost half its head, so it would need to be replaced with a new one. I have an old one to go with it but it looks like hell, and this gun deserves a new one. Comes with bullet bag, and ball starter, and quite a few round ball. Also some maxi ball. This rifle needs to be seen and handled in person!   asking $300, or best offer"

I picked this up at an estate sale awhile back with the intention of getting back into shotgun loading, but time restraints keep getting in the way. 

Everything seems to function correctly, and I was told by the seller that it was working fine a couple years ago when the owner got to ill to shoot anymore. It could probably use a good cleaning and adjusting though.

Included is the press w/automatic primer feed, two charge bars and fifteen bushings of various sizes. Also included is approximately 5 lb.s of Scot 453 propellant, 3,000 WW12 wads, a 100 round carrying case and a nifty little table that it mounts to.

Only 90% the size of a P226, the Mosquito, chambered in 22LR, is the ideal
choice for hours of shooting fun. Its wear-resistant polymer frame and
integral accessory rail is ergonomically designed to enhance accuracy and
provide a better all-around shooting experience. Additional features
include a rugged blowback system, fixed barrel and adjustable rear sight.
It's also loaded with safety features including a decocking lever and the
automatic drop safety you'd expect in a Sig Sauer pistol. It is further
enhanced with an ambidextrous manual slide mounted safety, magazine safety
and internal locking device. This model features a wear-resistant color
finish over the polymer frame and a stainless steel slide with a blued
finish. The frame finish, while wear resistant, is a decorative coating
that can be expected to experience wear from holstering or accessory
mounting. Contact with bore solvents or similar cleaning agents should be
avoided.

The SIG SAUER P226 is the pistol that set the standard by which all other
combat handguns are measured. The exceptional ergonomics and balance make
this full-size pistol easy to handle. Its longer barrel yields better
ballistic performance and accuracy. The P226 MK25 is identical to the
pistol carried by the U.S. Navy SEALs the fleet s special warfare
operators. The railed P226 chambered in 9mm and engraved with an anchor on
the left side of the slide is the official sidearm of the SEALs. This
Desert version features flat dark earth coated alloy frame, and stainless
steel slide. It also features a UID identification label, anti-corrosion
coatings on controls and internal components and anchor engraving on left
side of the slide.

1942 VKT (Valmet) made rifle on a Westinghouse (WWI USA Made) M91 receiver.
Caliber - 7.62x54R Rimmed Russian - so you can feed it Cheap Russian surplus ammo.

These M39's are about the best of the Mosin Nagant family of rifles out there.
They feature super accurate Finnish made barrels and were carefully hand fitted by the Finns for maximum accuracy.  The military standard was under 1"" at 100 yards.

Westinghouse made M91 infantry rifles for the Russian Government during WWI.
The Finns bought and captured many Russian rifles during their independence wars as well as during WWII.  These were later converted/recycled for their own use.

Post war square splice stock
Numbers match
Stock shows the usual armory storage wear.
Rifling appears to be excellent/near excellent condition. 
You don't see many of these old war horses with such beautiful bores.

Please note - there was no choice for ""Valmet"", ""VKT"", or ""Finnish Army"" in the Manufacturer's list - so I picked SAKO - another Finn manufacturer of these rifles.
It is NOT a Sako, but rather a VKT.

Description	The all terrain look of the XD(M) isn't about cosmetics, it's about function. Featuring deeper, longer, and more slide serrations, the rugged Melonite finish on the XD(M) is a salt bath nitriding process that leaves a thick, corrosion resistant, hard surface. The XD(M) trigger has the shortest travel than any currently available polymer pistol along with a similarly short reset which keeps you on target with greater ease for faster, more accurate follow up shots. Also featuring the special package of a case, interchangeable backstraps, magazine pouch and loader, (2) magazines and a holster.

I have for sale an original and very good condition Smith & Wesson  Model 38/44 Heavy Duty HD. It was made between 1946 and 1948. That is actually the model name. This is NOT to be confused with the 38/44 Outdoorsman which was common because many were made. Few of the 4"" 38/44 HD were ever made and even fewer are in this good of condition. Timing is tight as can be. Bore is like new. Slight muzzle tip blueing wear. Rest of the finish is excellent including the cylinder. Case colored hammer and cylinder. The reason I rated the gun at 90% instead of 95% is because the grips are a bit worn. Although you might expect that from a 75-year-old gun. More importantly they ARE the original diamond pattern smith grips not the later traditionally cut checkered grips of later on. Just these grips could fetch $100 on eBay.  A few of these have been seen on gunbroker going for $900-$1400 in way worse shape than mine. Priced under book. No trades. $960 Cash

Made in 1915 by Westinghouse (Here in the Good 'Ole USA) for the Imperial Russian Government for WWI.

This is the ""Original"" Mosin Nagant Long rifle for Russian infantry use.
It shoots 7.62x54R Rimmed Russian - so it will take Cheap Russian surplus ammo.

At some point - it ended up in the hands of the Finnish army - you can see that from the Finnish Civil Guard markings (The big S and cancelled numbers on the receiver) 
The stock is a Finnish Army stock - apparently replaced when the original stock was broken or damaged during war.  This is fairly typical of these rifles.  It has a nice, visible Finn cartouche on the stock.  Surprisingly, the vast majority of the rifle is still Westinghouse.  This is not typical - as the Finns assembled random parts as needed to get a working rifle (Much like the US Military has done since WWI)

This rifle went to the Russians - so it does not have any ""US Ordinance"" stampings on it.  It does have the Russian acceptance stamps on the metal, as well as the Finnish Army stampings on the metal and stock.

Externally - it shows wear.  This rifle has seen war.
The stock has a chip in the forend.
The barrel is also well used - the lands are slightly rounded and the grooves are a little dark.  You can see that the rifling is still very strong, though.

Please note - there is no Manufacturer Category for ""Westinghouse"" or ""Russian Military"" - so I listed it as ""Sako"" - another Finnish company.  It is NOT made by Sako.

Face to face sale only.
Please email me if you have any questions."

This is an opportunity to have in hand today a top quality custom holster from a highly respected maker as soon as you can pay for it vs. waiting.

The holster may be used for a Glock 19 or 23 and has a custom length sweat shield to cover the entire length of the slide which is intended to put a barrier between the slide and skin.

The belt is polymer reinforced, 1.5 inches wide, with 7 holes. Size is 41 inches which should work for roughly 36-40? pants size. To check measurements use a measuring tape and thread it through the belt loops of your pants. If it measures between 40 and 42 inches this setup I would think should work for you. The belt size is not equal to pants size so just measure.

It's the REAL DEAL people; not a theatrical rip-off!!! 100% flexible, folded steel; if you put pressure on it, it will flex and bend back into shape. The sword is a Damascus steel approximation and the fuller (or blood groove) reflects that. It is sharp, though it can probably benefit from some time on a whetstone.

Here is a little info about the 99-M1:    
The Marlin Model 99M1 is a short carbine with the same tubular magazine and action as the Marlin 99 and 99U. The main difference is the 99M1 has a walnut stock and hand guard and an 18-inch barrel to make it look more like a US military M1 Carbine. Marlin introduced the 99M1 in 1964, in hopes that the resemblance to the US M1 carbine would appeal to the thousands of WW II veterans who had trained with and carried into combat the larger caliber US M1. The 99M1 was a success and over 160,000 were sold before production was discontinued in 1978"

The finger grooves date it to 1934 or 35, they did away with them in late 1935. It is also designated s,l and lr which only were on the older ones.
