Bought this in December 2013 to be able to drive out to the woods on the weekends; other car is a sports coupe. Now I'm moving to Chicago.
Clean title on hand. Vehicle passed inspection and was registered in December 2013. Tires are at about 40%, still roadworthy and will pass inspection.
In December, I did a tune-up (K&N air filter, new spark plugs, wires, and new distributor cap and rotor), installed new starter, new wipers (linkage, arms, and blades), new front brakes (drums, rotors, and pads), new head lamps, and new tie rods, sleeves, and control arms. Replaced the OEM FM radio with a CD player with USB input; OEM radio included. Truck also comes with new in box front springs, shocks, fuel pump, and windshield wiper motor. It doesn't need any of those parts right now, but I had long term plans for it before I found out I'm moving soon. Camper cover and roof rack come with truck as well.
Engine runs well, transmission was rebuilt in 2012, also works fine. This truck took me all the way to Chicago in December 2013 and back here in January with no issues.
Paint job is tri-color woodland camo, inherently tacky, but tastefully done. Perfect truck for the woods, hunting, camping etc. Would not be parting with it if I wasn't about to move. Asking $1200, absolutely firm on price. Not interested in trades."

I am interested in trading for many things. Looking for pistols (Glocks, HK's, Sigs, Colts, 1911's, and old military/surplus pistols).

May consider Aimpoints, Eotechs, Acogs, or Leupold scopes. As you can see, I'm pretty much open to anything, just let me know what you have. I am not looking for straight cash offers as the wife may not let me spend it again.

Contact me via email, text, or phone call. I can send good pics of whatever you are interested in.

Use the flush-fitting 13 round magazine, and you have a Compact (11 rounds in .40SW, 9 rounds in .45ACP). Like all XD(M)®’s, the XD(M)® 3.8″ Compact comes with three interchangeable backstraps, dovetail sights, mega-lock frame texturing, an ambidextrous magazine release, a multi-position frame rail, and a match grade barrel.You’ll also find all the safety features that make the XD(M)® a safe pistol in responsible hands.

If you want a gun for daily carry as well as a trip to the range, but you only want to buy one gun, try the XD(M)® 3.8” Compact. You’ll be amazed at how controllable it is to shoot and how easy it is to conceal. It’s two guns in one."

BUILT TO PERFORM RAIN OR SHINE

You never know where the hunt will take you, which is why Thompson/Center adopted its innovative Weather Shield® coating to endure the elements. Fifty times more corrosion resistant than stainless steel, Weather Shield locks out moisture and wear to ensure optimal performance over a lifetime of use and beyond.

ACCURACY YOU CAN COUNT ON WITH AN MOA GUARANTEE

Out of the box, T/C Venture rifles are equipped with a minute of angle guarantee, meaning it will shoot a 3 shot group in an inch or less at 100 yards (with premium ammunition). Every gun is certified for accuracy and with an MOA guarantee, you know you have a gun you can rely on hunt after hunt, year after year. 

5R RIFLING LEADS TO A BETTER SHOT

Different from conventional 6-groove rifling, 5R rifling results in less deformation of the bullet jacket and a better gas seal. It causes less bullet upset and less barrel fouling, leading to a cleaner shot that you can count on hunt after hunt, year after year, with easier cleaning.

GET A GRIP ON HUNTING

Your heart is racing, your palms are sweaty, but your head is cool. With Hogue raised traction panels on the T/C Venture, you don’t have to worry about missing the perfect shot. These innovative raised grips provide the stability needed to keep you on target in any weather conditions."

This Desert Eagle has rubber Hogue finger grips installed but I also have the factory grips to include. 2 mags total, only came with one. I'm looking to trade this excellent gun for 2 Glocks and/or Springfield Armory XDs's in 9mm, or .40 and/or S&W M&P 9c (or a combination). Let me know what you are willing to trade. Not in a rush to get rid of this Desert Eagle, but will for the right trade. This gun runs $1599 new right now at Gander Mountain, but has been seen cheaper elsewhere (not including shipping or transfer fees). I bought it new for $1400 and it looks like it just can from the factory. The extra magazine was $50 as well as the Hogue grips. I would put the value between $1100-1200. Let me know what you have to trade, the worst I can say is no. I can add home defense ammo for more valuable trades. If offering cash, I will take no less than $1000."

This was my original ccw which was carried for approximately 1.5 years back in 2009. It has spent the time since, either in the safe or on the Mrs. bedside table. Round count is approximately 300 rounds and I am the original owner.

I'm mainly looking for a carry weapon for my wife, as I'm not comfortable having her carry an S/A only weapon with limited trigger time. Currently looking for anything .380 and above. 
+/- cash as needed.

All offers considered. 

I am also looking for a BCM KM13 rail, and MBUS pro sights currently. 

On to the details:

There is carry wear on the slide, and this model does not have the Siglite sights. I polished the feed ramp and since, have even had luck cycling Federal JHP rounds with truncated noses. Will come with 2 standard mags, 1 Sig extended mag, Crossbreed microtuck, and original box. 

Now for the bad, the pin that is behind the takedown pin is poking out past the frame which I've included a picture of. I don't know if it was always like that, and I didn't notice. Either way, it is aesthetically unpleasing to the eye ( to me anyways), functionality wise, it runs flawlessly."

This has been a personal piece and is a slab sided, 7 round capacity stainless steel revolver.  The 5"" barrel length is the minimum length for hunting deer in Ohio with a pistol and makes a nice compromise between the shorter 3"" and 4"" shorties for personal protection and the longer 6"" and 8"" barrels normal for hunting. 

Additional enhancements to this revolver include a green fiber optic front sight (HiViz) and a Wilson Combat Spring Kit which is a standard upgrade for S&W revolvers.  Additional moon clips are included, but I prefer to load using the 7 shot speed loaders.

The Smith & Wesson Pro Series represents the next step between the standard models and the performance series. Bringing competition specifications and features to factory models, the Pro Series offer that ready-to-go package while still maintaining production line integrity.

Trijicon HD Green Nights Sights installed. Titanium striker and block for smooth, rapid cycling, and faster reset, when used in conjunction they work very well in producing a smoother cycle and clean break. Ghost trigger system for a clean 4 lb pull, with a Glock factory smooth surface trigger not found standard on the G30. The standard serrated trigger can cause point of impact drift when the trigger finger drags across the trigger face. Pearce grip extensions for better control while not giving up conceal ability . Titanium alloy assembly pins and take down that are drift, wear, and corrosion resistant. Vickers extended and contoured mag release and Glock extended slide release. All original factory parts, paperwork, hardware, hardcase, Glock Holster and mag pouch, two 10 round magazines are included. This G30 is made in Austria with the dark black Tennifer finish that is proven to last longer then the newer grayish finish. This pistol has extremely light wear and only range use and looks new. The pistol has not had enough rounds fired in it to even break it in. I use this same setup in many other Glocks (21, 22,23,27,) and if works flawlessly and holds up perfectly, much better then out of the box.

Any upgrades can be un done. All factory parts are included.

Pistol fires extremely well. It has a crisp, light and clean break with tight groups. While it is outstanding I use the M&Ps and Rugers more which has left the G30 sitting in the safe.

May include up to 400 round 230 Winchester FMJ and up to 200 Defense rounds depending on trade. Also have additional G30 (10rd) and G21 (13 rd) magazines depending on trade.

Choose from .44 Magnum, .45 Colt and .357 Magnum. All are SASS approved so Cowboy Action shooters who enjoy stepping back to that bygone era can use them in competition.

ENGINE
Back in November 2013 I had the engine removed for a professional rebuild.  Once the engine was removed I had the engine compartment stripped of all components.  The engine compartment was degreased, sandblasted, and repainted factory flat black.  All the components were degreased and repainted.  The 390 CI engine was totally dismantled.  It has new rings, pistons, heavy cam, springs, lifters, rods, Holley 4 barrel carb with electric choke, spark plugs, spark plug wires, distributor cap, coil harness, bearings and gaskets.  The heads and crank shaft were remanufactured and the block bored .30 over.  The block and intake were sandblasted and repainted Ford Corporate Blue like from the factory.  It has all these NEW parts;  aluminum radiator with transmission cooler, fan shroud, true headers, alternator, battery, voltage regulator, power steering pump, steering gear box, water pump, harmonic balancer, brake booster, master cylinder, air cleaner, oil pump, fluids, belts and hoses.  The exhaust/muffler is pretty new.  The Ford factory air works and blows cold and has been updated to the current R134 refrigerant.  It does need a new blower motor.  It needs a new windshield wiper fluid reservoir.   The fluid pump works fine.

STEERING, SUSPENSION, and BRAKES
The front end has been rebuilt with new polyurethane bushings on the track arm, idler arms, and C-bushings. The rear end has been rebuilt with new pinion seals, oil seals (inner and outer) differential fluid, and bearings on both wheels.   It has all these NEW parts; Skyjacker shocks, Skyjacker steering stabilizer, pitman arm, power steering pump, steering column shifter collar, master cylinder, brake booster, and brake shoes all around.  It has a new aftermarket steering wheel.  Could probably use new rear leaf spring shackle bushings and a new steering shaft in the future.

BODY AND WHEELS
This truck has spent its whole life in the arid temps of Texas.  It has all the original body panels and floor pans.  I did a VIN check and there has been no incidents reported of any collision or body repair.  I had it inspected at a body shop and they reported that they could find no body putty or rust repair.  It is a solid truck.  The paint is not original and it looks to be an older restoration maybe.  It is really shiny and damage free with the exception of a nic on the right front corner of the hood.  It does have some dings and couple of flakes on the hood.   All the chrome work appears to be present and is in nice shape.  It could use some polish.  I think the industry calls this a good “20 footer”.   The bed has been used but does have an older spray in liner that needs re-done.  It has a frame mounted receiver hitch that could be used to pull a boat or trailer (that is why it has the new transmission cooler).  I have never pulled anything with it.   The doors, hood and tailgate work as designed.  The glass is tinted.  It has a rear slider window.  Has new rubber door seals.  The windshield has a scratch on it from the windshield wiper.  The frame is straight.  The tires are TOYO 33x12.5X18 and are in decent shape.  The wheels are 18 Inch Eagle Series 197 Chrome.  They have recently been rotated and balanced.

ELECTRICAL
The electrical system has been inspected by an ASE mechanic and any problems corrected.  All the lights, gauges, switches, and wipers work as designed.  It has all these NEW parts: 36 month battery, alternator, voltage regulator, interior light bulbs, dash/gauge light bulbs, headlight switch, right tail light socket and bulb.  The original gauges were inoperable and replaced with a functional old stock set.

INTERIOR
The interior is really nice.  It has NEW carpet and seat belts.  The seat has probably been re-covered at some point.  It is black vinyl and in the correct style.  No rips, tears or soft spots.  The adjustment mechanism works great.  The stereo is a Sony CD player with detachable face, aux for IPod music, and remote.  It could use better speakers (door ones work).  The windows roll as designed.  The door handles work as designed.  The door skins are in really nice shape.   It does need a glove-box insert, headliner, dome light lens, left vent louver, and right wing window latch to finish it out. 

As you can see the truck is ready for another 100,000 miles.  Mechanically solid.  It is not a show truck and I wasn’t rebuilding it for that purpose.  I like driving it and wanted it to be a daily driver.  It gets a lot of looks and compliments.   It is after all a 38 year old truck.  Check out the NADA book values on this truck.  When you do just make sure you DON’T use the Custom model.  This truck is a F100 Short Bed Styleside with factory air, 4X4 and 390 engine.  The Ranger XLT trim package in a short bed is RARE.   I am located in Keller, Texas.  If you would like to come out and take a look let me know.  I can also help arrange shipping if you are interested.  If you have any other questions or need pictures of anything else let me know.  

I have A LOT invested in this truck and I am asking $17,000 but make me a cash offer and we can negotiate from there.  If you want to try to broker a trade for high end firearms I will listen.  NOTHING ELSE will be accepted for trade.

788,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3094788,"For Sale:  NEW AR-15, 100 rnd mag, red dot & magnifier, etc","Brookfield, Milwaukee, Wisconsin","$ 1,050","Listed On: Friday, May 23, 2014",Rifles,Bushmaster                                                                                ,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"* BRAND NEW Bushmaster AR 15 style rifle (XM15-E2S) Optics Ready Carbine (ORC) with tele-stock.  Fires both 5.56 and .223 ammunition, comes with lock, 1 30-round mag (yes it's grey, that's what came to me from the factory), paperwork, 2 rail risers, and a sling.  MSRP is $1082.45.
* NEW 100-round drum magazine in 5.56 (will handle .223 also).  Comes with the manual, dust cover, carrying case with belt clips, loader/plunger, and lube. These typically run between $159 - $199 plus shipping and/or taxes.
* NEW Sightmark red dot reflex sight (Ultra Shot SM13005) with 4 different reticles, sight adjustment and installation tools, a neoprene protective hood, and manual.  It needs a CR1620 battery, which didn't come with it.  MSRP $95.99
* NEW Sightmark 3x Tactical Magnifier, slide-to-side, with quick detach.  EOTech and Aimpoint compatible.  Great for medium range shooting.  Magnifies what you see through the red-dot and allows for more accurate shooting.  Slides off to the side when you don't want it, without having to remove it from the gun.  Quick detach mount for quick removal or addition to the rifle.  Comes with manual and tool.  MSRP $145.99
* NEW LULA magazine speed loader and unloader for M16/AR-15 magazines.  It's a great time saver if you plan on shooting more than a magazine or two!  It may or may not fit the drum - it's new in package and I haven't removed it to test it.  $34.99 + tax at Cabela's
* NEW Caldwell AR-15 Brass Catcher (not pictured).  Great for catching your empty brass and keeping it for reloading or to sell while on the range, rather than trying to pick it up afterward.  It has a hook & loop strap for attaching, and a zippered bottom for emptying without removal from the gun.  $14.99 + tax at Cabela's

If you were to pay full retail for all of this, with taxes but before any background check or shipping fees, it would come out to $1652.08 (just because I know some of you guys like to do the math and then tell someone how much their gun should be worth).

I'm asking $1200 for it set up as-is, or $1050 with the UTG sight substituted for the Sightmark (see below).  Save the paperwork, hassle, extra fees, and time, and buy it brand new, right here, right now!  You must be 18 or older and not a felon to purchase this.

I have all the applicable boxes and manuals and paperwork, etc.  
I can also throw in a hard case or Blackhawk! Tactical Bag for extra.

See the links below if you have any technical questions on the gear.  Feel free to ask me any other questions you may have (other than those listed below).
I will substitute a UTG CQB red/green dot scope with Venom Tactical 45 degree offset iron sights for the Sightmark optics (both the red dot and magnifier) and knock off $150 bucks.  Otherwise this has to go as an entire package.  
NO TRADES unless you have a S&W M&P 9 Cabela's edition in new or pristine condition!
NO e-mails asking my bottom dollar/lowest price, or if I still have this.  I will ignore you. 
NO lowballers.  Yes, you can get some of this stuff cheaper some places.  But I'm not asking anywhere near full retail, and the online prices you usually quote doesn't include what you'd pay in fees, shipping, background checks, gas, etc.  Just don't bother.
I will travel a little distance - to Johnson Creek if you from Madison area, or Cabela's if you're from up north.  That's it, unless you're going to pay extra for my gas.
YES I will ship this!  Within Wisconsin for my shipping costs (it's legal, look it up) or out of state to your FFL and you pay my shipping costs, his fees.  If it needs to come from my FFL, you're going to pay his fees on top of it.

I say great condition (not excellent) due to some nominal wear. There is a small nick in the stock near the tang, as well as a couple hairline cracks in the wood where it meets the steel. All of the steel components are perfectly intact and the barrels are flawless.

I purchased it used, and have put less than 500 rounds through it myself. It's a great gun, and I'm somewhat reluctant to let it go, but I want to get something a little lighter for upland game.

Included are 2 Briley INVPXL chokes, modified and full. As I am not the original owner, I don't have the case or paperwork that came with it.

I am happy to do a face-to-face sale in the greater Seattle area, or I can ship it. I'll accept cash, money order, or personal check (if you don't mind me waiting for funds to clear before I hand/ship it off).

I did the paint job myself a few months back. 
The rifle has a little under 200 rounds through it. It's been well taken care of. The rifle is Very Accurate. I can consistently achieve 3-shot groups with 55gr Zmax between .33""-.39"" @100yards. With my own handloads I can achieve .26""-.33"" groups with 55gr Nosler Ballistic Tips (all shot from the prone supported, resting the forend on a sandbag. The rifle maintains about .75 MOA out to 400 yards shooting from the prone and utilizing the bipod legs. So in the right hands this rifle has no issues with accuracy!
