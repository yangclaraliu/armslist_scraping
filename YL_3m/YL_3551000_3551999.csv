The M38 is a carbine version of the longer rifle variant of the m91/30 and unlike the m44 carbine, the M38 does not have a permanently attached bayonet.

I'm hoping to find one either today or tomorrow in great-excellent condition.
I don't mind if it's a Century Import as long as the furniture and bore look good.

I'm also in the market for ammo for this rifle as well-  my ideal purchase would be the M38 and a sealed surplus can of 7.62x54r.

Please let me know if you can help!

Selling this 9mm  Ruger LC9 in beautiful Raspberry color.
It comes with box and everything else it came with from the factory.
I purchased it brand new from dealer in June of 2013 and have put only 91 rounds through it with absolutely no issues except it just sits in the safe.  I purchased this for my wife to get here permit to carry but after getting her PTC and this gun she has decided she doesn't want to carry so that's the only reason it's now for sale.

I never even removed the tags from this coat.

Lightweight & Packable - weighing a slight 1.4 lbs, the jacket rolls up and packs into its own hood. Converts to the size of a 2 liter bottle of soda. (Watch Product Video Here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYQJhVUKNtQ)
Built-In Holster Rig - this cross-draw holster rig is permanently sewn onto the interior of the jacket and fits a variety of popular models including: Colt Combat Elite 1911 full size .45 / Glock 22 .40 full size / Sig Sauer P229 .40 mid size / Ruger LC9 9mm compact / S&W 9mm Revolver 2"" barrel J-Frame / Springfield XD 9mm sub-compact / Ruger SP101 .357 Revolver 2"" barrel / plus many more!
Built-In Shoulder Harness - an integrated shoulder harness distributes the firearm weight on your shoulder rather than the jacket. This ensures the jacket will not shift due to the weight of the firearm.

I paid $899 plus tax for this gun. Letting it go for a price that save a guy some bucks and tax and some free necessities to go with that I had also purchased.

Would trade for a Glock 17 Gen 4 or 19 Gen 4 in excellent shape

Like new. Includes two ladder rail covers

The Specs:

The Spike's Tactical 12‚Äù BAR Rail is a 1pc free floating quad-rail that‚Äôs machined from 6061-T6 Aluminum with a barrel nut machined from 7075-T6 Aluminum and finished in type III Hardcoat Anodizing on the rail and barrel nut. The 12‚Äù BAR rail weighs in at 479 grams (16.89 oz.) and has an ID of 1.79‚Äù. 

The BAR rail also features scalloping on the rails that not only saves a little bit more weight but also allows you to run this rail without any rail covers! This sounds like an outlandish claim to those who have had their hands cut up on other quad-rails that have been lovingly called ‚Äúcheese graters‚Äù. The BAR also offers excellent heat ventilation, built in anti-rotation tabs to keep the rail and even the barrel nut from coming loose, and of course; sexy styling. 

But wait, there‚Äôs more! The BAR has 5 built in QD sockets (sling attachment points), allows for a continuous top rail, it‚Äôs compatible with many low profile gas blocks, and it‚Äôs made right here in the USA and backed by Spike's Tactical's LIFETIME WARRANTY!

This is a 20 inch barrel model with 7+1 capacity, heat shield, shell side saddle on the receiver, red dot scope and rail, and pro mag tri rail forend and adjustable AR style stock. Barrel and magazine tube have been duracoated black, heat shield and receiver red.

Works well, but I'm interested in trying something different. I'm interested in trading it for a different HD/Tactical style shotgun. Primarily looking for a Benelli Nova Tactical or a Winchester SXP Extreme Defender, but would consider other similar weapons. I already have a nice field gun so I am not interested in hunting shotguns.
Would consider less expensive model shotguns as well+cash, such as a base model Winchester SXP, any of the ASI shotguns on the market now, the IAC Hawk Remington 870 clones, and others.

While I'm primarily interested in another shotgun but I would also consider a mid or full sized 9mm of some sort or a .38 special snub revolver.  Not interested in rifles at this time.

Would prefer to trade but I'll also sell for $350 firm if you're not wanting to trade.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

The Gen 4 Glock 21 is now a reality.  The Glock 21 is one of the more discussed models from the company:  on the one hand, it gives the shooter 13+1 rounds of the powerful .45 ACP to handle whatever threat may present itself.  On the other hand, the gun is noticeably thicker than other Glock models, creating problems for many shooters with small to medium sized hands.

With the Gen 4 treatment to the model 21, Glock will hopefully satisfy all of their fans who like the cartridge developed some hundred years ago.  One of the major changes to the Gen 4 pistols is the modular back strap system that allows the owner to custom fit the size of each gun to his or her hand.  While the ‚ÄúDoes size matter?‚Äù argument will never go away, Glock has certainly made a credible effort to make the 21 comfortably useable by most shooters."

I have put less than 60 rounds through it.

I'm only asking the reduced price because I want to sell it prior to modern arms deer season so I can get another rifle and use the money from this sale for a smaller caliber deer rifle.

With a choice of three frame colors (green, tan, or black), the full-size HK45 Tactical (HK45T) model uses an ergonomic grip design that includes changeable backstraps together with molded finger grooves that instinctively position an operator‚Äôs hand for optimum shooting. All HK45 pistol series (compact, full-size, Tactical models) are made at HK‚Äôs American manufacturing facility in New Hampshire using American and German components. The HK45 Tactical uses a 10-round steel magazine and has a Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The HK45 Tactical has a proprietary internal mechanical recoil reduction system that employs a flat recoil spring in tandem with a polymer bushing sleeve to reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the weapon, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. An ‚ÄúO-ring‚Äù on the threaded barrel means better slide-to-barrel lockup and enhanced accuracy. Covered by Heckler & Koch‚Äôs limited lifetime warranty, the HK45T is a robust design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. The patented HK Lock-Out system allows the operator to discreetly lock the pistol by inserting a pronged key into the magazine well and turning a control plate that blocks any movement of the slide, hammer, and the trigger. The HK45T can be converted to nine different kinds of trigger firing modes including HK‚Äôs enhanced double action only ‚ÄúLEM‚Äù (Law Enforcement Modification) mode. The HK45T is well-suited for military, law enforcement, security use, and civilian sport shooting."

Recently I sold my .308, so now I have not a reason to have this ammo. 
The surplus ammo is of US make, and holds decent patterns @ MOA. 
This is all quality .308 brass or nickel plated casings. 

-Approx. 1500 Rounds US Surplus FMJ - Available in 200 round battle packs or as a lot.
- 280 Rounds of Winchester Power Point Super X
- 200 Rounds of Winchester Ballistic Silver Tip
- 100 Rounds of Winchester Razor Back XT
- Half a box of Federal

Prices vary. I would really like to trade for other factory ammo. But if cash or other item is offered I will kindly consider. Im mainly looking for other calibers of ammo below. Maybe a pistol, mags etc...

Also must be a face to face trade. Im willing to drive a couple of hours which is half way to chicago. I could go further but the deal must be in my favor and for most or all of the ammo I have.

Texting works great for me, but call if you rather.

THIS DEAL COMES WITH THE LENS, LENS HOOD, LENS CAP, AND 6 77mm FILTERS WHICH ARE: B+W 77MM CIR POLARIZER, B+W ND 0,9 - 3BL 8X (GOOD NEUTRAL DENSITY), DIGITAL HGX CIR POLARIZER, PROMASTER VAR NEUTRAL DENSITY 8 STEPS, AND 2 77MM UV/PROTECTION FILTER.

ALL FOR 1000$ BOTTOM LINE photos are actual photos of lens, flawless glass.


AF-S NIKKOR 24-120mm f/4G ED VR Zoom Lens from Nikon is designed primarily for use with FX-format D-SLR cameras, it's equally at home on any DX-format D-SLR camera. As a standard 5.0x zoom on an FX-format camera body, it's perfect for landscapes, portraits, and weddings - it's an excellent choice for a perfect take-along-everywhere lens. On a DX-format camera, the focal length gets a 1.5x bump that turns it into a formidable longer-range optic with enough wide angle for all but the widest of shots.

The AF-S 24-120 ED VR is a versatile imaging tool with a constant maximum aperture of f/4.0 - this enables photographers to maintain exposure settings throughout the entire zoom range. For those critical focusing-moments - the M/A focus mode switch allows the shooter to quickly change between manual and autofocus modes.

Nikon's optical engineers have graced the lens elements with their proprietary Super Integrated Coating- a superior multicoating process that enhances light transmission for maximum clarity, crispness, and contrast. Additionally this NIKKOR offering also benefits from Nikon's very own Nano Crystal Coat - a high-tech lens treatment that ensures maximum imaging quality by limiting or eliminating the negative effects from ghosting, flare, and glare.

Low-light shooters will greatly appreciate the benefits from the addition of Nikon's VR II image stabilization system. This amazing internal virtual-tripod allows photographers to work with shutter-speeds up to 4x slower than usual - whether it's a candle-lit snap-shot or a moody portrait taken in a dark alley-way under a dingy street-lamp - hand-held photographers can rely on the AF-S 24-120 ED VR for sharp, clear, and extremely well-detailed imaging.

Compact & Versatile 5x Standard Zoom Lens with f/4 Maximum Aperture
Perfect for landscapes, portraits, weddings, and distant subjects. Offers a constant maximum aperture to maintain exposure settings throughout the entire zoom range
Extended Range on Nikon DX-format D-SLR Cameras
Angle of view is equivalent to a focal length of 36-180mm in DX-format cameras.
Nikon VR II (Vibration Reduction) Image Stabilization
Vibration Reduction technology that's engineered specifically for each VR NIKKOR lens - enables handheld shooting at up to 4 shutter speeds slower than would otherwise be possible. This ensures dramatically sharper still images and video capture.
2 Extra-low Dispersion (ED) Elements
Offers superior sharpness and color correction by effectively minimizing chromatic aberration, even at the widest aperture setting.
3 Aspherical Lens Elements
Aspherical lens elements virtually eliminate coma and other types of aberration, even when shooting at the widest available aperture.
Nano Crystal Coat
Further reduces ghosting and interior flare across a wide range of wavelengths for even greater image clarity.
Nikon Super Integrated Coating (SIC)
Enhances light transmission efficiency and offers superior color consistency and reduced flare.
M/A Focus Mode Switch
Enables quick changes between manual and autofocus operation.
Internal Focus (IF)
Provides fast and quiet autofocus without changing the length of the lens to maintain the working distance throughout the focus range. It also keeps the front element from spinning, which maintains the position of a polarizer or lens hood.
Exclusive Nikon Silent Wave Motor (SWM)
Enables fast, accurate and quiet autofocus.
Rounded 9-Blade Diaphragm

This Tactical holster features the Self Locking System (SLS‚Ñ¢) rotating hood system which is so well suited for the tactical situations encountered today.

A special feature of the Model 6004 is the double leg strap and the leg shroud. These two features combined equal comfort and stability in the holster position on the leg.

The Safariland Model 6004 Tactical holster is built for comfort as well as functionality. This Tactical holster features the Self Locking System (SLS‚Ñ¢) rotating hood system which is so well suited for the tactical situations encountered today. The hood on the Model 6004 holster can only be released by being simultaneously pushed down and rotated forward and actually becomes more secure when upward force is applied. The STX Tactical finish of the holster is rugged, protecting the gun in scrape, scratch and dent incidents. Molded sight track and soft SafariSuede‚Ñ¢ protect the gun's sights and finish. A special feature of the Model 6004 is the double leg strap and the leg shroud. These two features combined equal comfort and stability in the holster position on the leg.

- Features the SLS (Self Locking System) rotating hood system.
- SLS allows for a smoother, single-motion draw and greater protection 
   against attempted weapon takeaways. 
- Thermal-molded SAFARILAMINATE‚Ñ¢ construction protects handgun 
   and sights. 
- Standard double leg strap and leg shroud with mounting holes for 
   optional accessories.
