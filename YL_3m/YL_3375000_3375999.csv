Brand New
I have a Naval Special Warfare (Navy Seal) Issue Eagle RRV. It has been Inventoried but was never fielded. Comes with all of the straps to the load out kit, which are rather difficult and expensive to find. This kit allows you to mount a hydration carrier, ruck sack or patrol pack, etc. This is a great find, dont let it slip through you hand. Grab it while its available. It is the very sought after 'BLUE LABEL' series from 2004. These are popular for their superior quality and durability from that year. Eagle Ind. has jumped their manufacturing locations around to different countries but these were MADE IN THE USA! 
Will hold a 10''x12'' (Large) SAPI/ESAPI plate for ballistic protection.  

I will consider some trades with equal to higher value of the vest. Im interested in multicam gear, coyote, khaki, etc. I will NOT trade for Condor or Flyye equipment or ammo. But if you have body armor, kevlar vests, MOLLE Pouches and gear, let me know. Thanks for looking!"

Well the time has come to sell the boys' dirt bike, my oldest learned on it, and was his 4th b-day present, as why the #4 stickers,then my youngest learned and now he has outgrown it,Bike has been maintained , always changed oil, last year new rear tire and tube, rear brakes and new chain,plug.Great bike for the little one to learn on, they actually make training wheel kits for these bikes, i made some from their old bicycle training wheels and worked fine. i also added a kill switch on the left side of the bars.

Runs good, usually starts on 1st or 2nd kick.being a 2004 model it has a few scratches and piece of sticker falling off, but other then that, runs,drives, stops as it should, no problems.

Looking for either strait cash or could do a part trade/part cash deal. comes with a set of shift riding pants, maybe wore once or twice.

$700 cash/$750 trade have clean and clear title in hand.

Can meet up , but prefer not far unless for sure deal is struck.Just cruised a couple other sites and i see the same bikes for more, so at the moment im firm on the price and think it is fair, i paid a lot more for it new, as i bought it brand new from cycle barn years ago.

Well the time has come to sell the boys' dirt bike, my oldest learned on it, and was his 4th b-day present, as why the #4 stickers,then my youngest learned and now he has outgrown it,Bike has been maintained , always changed oil, last year new rear tire and tube, rear brakes and new chain,plug.Great bike for the little one to learn on, they actually make training wheel kits for these bikes, i made some from their old bicycle training wheels and worked fine. i also added a kill switch on the left side of the bars.

Runs good, usually starts on 1st or 2nd kick.being a 2004 model it has a few scratches and piece of sticker falling off, but other then that, runs,drives, stops as it should, no problems.

Looking for either strait cash or could do a part trade/part cash deal. comes with a set of shift riding pants, maybe wore once or twice.

$700 cash/$750 trade have clean and clear title in hand.

Can meet up , but prefer not far unless for sure deal is struck.Just cruised a couple other sites and i see the same bikes for more, so at the moment im firm on the price and think it is fair, i paid a lot more for it new, as i bought it brand new from cycle barn years ago.

With this package now I'm throwing in an unopened CMMG lpk, and 10 small packs of milcomm light grease - one of the best (if not the best) lube for ARs. 

I'm trying to recoup some cash after splurging on a long range bolt action build, so I'm putting this out there as a really good deal.  

This is a factory built PSA 16"" premium carbine, about 2 years old (pre-panic and PTAC crap...FN Parts), and only has about 150 rounds down the barrel during one range trip.  It's in mint condition (not a scratch), meticulously cared for, and the rest of it's life it's been a safe-queen... as evidenced by the PSA emblem on the BCG which still looks brand new...  

It's extremely lightweight, and has all OD Magpul furniture on it (including extended buttpad on the MOE stock, and AFG).  I installed a much better ALG ACT, and complimented that already great trigger with JP Enterprises yellow springs.  Extremely smooth trigger pull, that I'm estimating is barely 4#.  Additionally, this rifle has a BCM Gunfighter Charging Handle upgrade, and an ambi QD sling mount at the castle nut..    

With this package, I'm including 500 rounds of quality brass ammo, an ammo can, and 5 new in the wrapper Pmags.  I have Black, FDE, and OD.  If you want 5x OD mags specifically, there might be a few not in the wrapper, I'll have to check...  Hard deal to pass on...

FTF in South Carolina only.  $850 cash, PP, or MO.  No trades at this time please.  All in with furniture and hardware upgrades, ammo and mags, this is about a $1,400 deal (pricing ammo at .33 a round)...

*More than 100 years ago, the Colt 1911 was chosen as the official sidearm for America’s Armed Forces. Today, a Colt 1911 is once again proudly serving at the side of our country’s military. After a rigorous selection process, the United States Marine Corps selected the Colt Rail Gun as their Close Quarters Battle Pistol (CQBP). This marks the first time since the end of World War II that a Colt 1911 is being shipped to the United States Government. 

*To honor the brave men and women of this important staple of America’s military might, the Colt CQBP will be made available in limited quantities through the Colt Custom Shop. What makes the CQBP stand out is its Desert Tan Cerakoted Stainless Steel Receiver and Slide, Novak® 3 Dot Night Sights and Flat, Serrated Mainspring Housing with Lanyard Loop. The pistol also features an Enhanced Hammer, Colt Tactical Ambidextrous Safety Lock, and a 5” National Match® Barrel.

This is an almost new gun and comes with Sig carry case. 
This Sig Mosquito has a polished feed ramp and comes with two springs and I have found that with the lighter recoil spring this gun shoots very reliably when using bulk ammo... And of course, no problems when shooting better quality ammo such as CCI.

SIG Mosquito specs:

*Black Finish w/ Black Plastic Grips 

*3.9” Barrel / 7.2” overall length 

*Decocker

*1 mag, 10 capacity 

*.22LR 

*Double Action / Single Action Trigger

Great plinking gun and an excellent companion for practice and training. 

As for trades:  Since I currently own several semi auto pistols and long guns in .22LR, I am not necessarily considering any trades at this time."

Ruger SR556 FB for sale with the following accessories:

- Fenix PD35 light w/ Fenix mount
- Samson folding battle sights
- rubber ladders on quad rail
- sling clip + sling
- 3 x PMAG's
- Ruger soft carrying case


This has been an awesome rifle to own. The Ruger SR556 is a gas piston rifle and as a result is extremely reliable. I have put ~300 rounds through the rifle due to lack of time to shoot. The rifle has been cleaned every single time it has been fired, no exceptions. I am a stickler about taking care of a firearm. The rifle has been treated with FrogLube a few months ago.

Asking $1300 OBO ... I enjoy negotiating. However, I'm also interested in the following trades. Some trades will necessitate cash to boot:

- looking for other high quality DI rifles. Daniel Defense etc
- Bullpup rifles
- offer!

Possibly interested in other trades, feel free to offer. I'll politely tell you I'm not interested if I'm not interested! 

Serious inquiries contact me via text message or phone call, preferably a text message, at the following: REDACTED.

Don't let location prevent you from offering. I travel a LOT across the state and don't mind accompanying your schedule!

I've got two semi-rare Mosin rifles, worth $500 together. I'll throw in 200 rounds and some stripper clips as well. 

The first is a 1930 Tula M91/30. This first-year production Mosin is a hex reciever in excellent condition! All parts original matching numbers, minus bayonet. This one is valued at $200, because it's a first year production and a Tula. 

The second is a 1936 Tula SCW Mosin! This rare rifle is a ""shooter grade"" example of an SCW, but it is an SCW none the less. Bore looks great, and I dont believe it's been shot much - it still has cosmoline on the stock! This rifle has the blade sight, brass capped handguard, wire sling hangers, and no import marks! However, this one does not have the MP8 or the ""Made in USSR"". That being said, if you know SCW's, not all have those marks. This rifle is worth $300.

I've been around to stores, however I'd like to trade an existing firearm and possibly up to $100 along with said firearm for a good pistol. Here is what I currently have available to trade:

Norinco SKS in a tapco stock with 30 round magazine. This weapon has had the extractor, firing pin, and piston replaced by me and fitted into a tapco stock. The bolt group and barrel are also in great shape and it is a solid shooter. The rifle comes with 110 rounds of FMJ ammo and 100 rounds of Hollow Point ammo, original 10 round magazine and tapco 30 round magazine, and a tapped receiver for a scope mount along with rings for said scope. All serial numbers on the rifle are matching as well.

Kel-Tec SU-16 B sport rifle. This weapon is BNIB and has never been fired. It comes with the original box, all original paperwork, 2 10 round magazines, 1 30 round magazines, soft carry bag, Simmons Red Dot scope, and 80 rounds of 5.56mm ammunition. For those that are not familiar with this rifle, you can store either two 10 round magazines, or one 30 round magazine right in the stock of the weapon. This rifle is also able to fold in half so it is only 23 inches long for storage. Also, one of the better features is that the forearm of the rifle can fold into a bipod for those extra important long distance shots.

Mossberg 88 12ga Shotgun. This weapon has only been fired 3 times, twice with birdshot and once with 00 buckshot. It sports a beaded front sight, an extended magazine tube (plug removed for your benefit!), and comes with 10 rounds of 00 Buckshot as well as 36 rounds of birdshot as well. Finish on this gun is 100% and there are currently no scratches of any kind.

I can provide more pictures for each weapon upon request, and I can be reached by the contact seller button, or by text (preferred) or phone call to 77zero-54nine-596three. Thanks for looking."

I really don't like to have to do this guys, but I'm faced with hard times and have to sell off some extra firearms. I love both of these guns, they are great shooters, and never gave me any trouble. 

The first ""I'll take it"" gets the item. I expect prompt payment, and prefer PayPal. I will accept a USPS Money Order or Cash (if FTF). I am located in Lincoln, IL 62656. If buying from me locally, all IL laws apply to the transaction. If purchased from out of state, I must ship to an FFL of your choosing. I will need a copy of your FFL's license emailed to me, and I will send with the gun any required info (usually just a photocopy of my I.D.). The long gun will be shipped Ground, the Handgun by Air via FedEx or UPS.

Please do not hesitate to PM me, call or text, or E-Mail me if you have any questions or require additional pictures.

You can by this 106 from me with confidence as I have great feedback (including other gun transactions) and would like to keep it that way.

The CZ 912 is built with a high gloss finish and has a very sleek look with attractive lines both on the alloy receiver and on the walnut stock. The modern style recoil pad provides for not only a significant reduction in perceived recoil, but it is snag free as well. A long recoil spring is located in the butt of the stock that simplifies assembly and allows it to cycle a wide variety of loads across the power spectrum both 2 ¾” and 3”. In addition the rearward spring design makes required cleanings less frequent and easier when they are needed. Removal of the installed magazine plug is simple, requiring only the magazine cap to be unscrewed. Without the plug, it gives the upland hunter a 4+1 capacity.

Has some wear spots, it's a shooter not a looker.

Comes with a green Chinese AK sling.

I am actually located in Northern Virginia, but I am listing the rifle here because it is ban-compliant; it doesn't have a threaded muzzle or a bayonet lug. The only 2 ""evil"" features are the pistol grip and removable mags.

This unique holster design allows you to forget old-fashioned thumb breaks that slow your draw and complicate reholstering. The patented SERPA Technology Lock engages the trigger guard as you holster the pistol and won't let go until you release it. The release is made using your normal drawing motion, with the trigger finger beside the holster body.

Features:
Full firing grip for draw and immediate retention upon reholstering
No thumb break or awkward middle finger release to slow down your draw
Speed cut allows faster draw and easy reholstering

983,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3375983,For Sale:  BUFFALO-BARNES LEAD-FREE HEAVY 357 Mag - 140 gr. Barnes XPB @ 1550 fps - 20 Round Box,"azusa, California, United States",$ 30,"Listed On: Monday, August 11, 2014",Ammo,no type,no type,no type,no type,"https://www.extreme-impact-ammo.com/index.php?l=product_detail&p=291

For those wanting/needing a lead-free, HEAVY 357 Magnum load, generating full power plus, here it is.

Below are real world velocities taken from my personal stock guns. The industry established use of long laboratory test barrels that give false high velocity readings is essentially misleading to the public who won’t be firing the ammo from a laboratory test barrel in the real world, where it matters.

1947 fps—Marlin mod 1894, 18 inch barrel
1518 fps—S&W mod 27, 5 inch barrel
1519 fps—S&W MT Gun, 4 inch barrel
1436 fps—S&W mod 66, 3 inch barrel
1385 fps—S&W mod 66, 2.5 inch barrel
You’ll notice the newer S&W 4 inch Mt. Gun, gave higher velocities than the older 5 inch mod 27 S&W. This is because of different internal barrel dynamics and chamber dimensions of the newer gun. In general, the newer S&W revolvers are made to tighter tolerances than those of 30+ years ago.

Due to the long-for-weight all copper bullet, the 357 does not have the case capacity to use a bulky flash retarded powder and thus there is a noticeable muzzle flash with this load in all the test revolvers, however the rifle shows no flash at all due to its longer barrel.

This load is the typical barn-burning, turbo charged, Buffalo Bore type HEAVY 357 Mag. load and as such, should only be used in revolvers made of all steel. It should not be fired in light weight, alloy framed or cylindered revolvers. Feel free to use it in ANY/ALL 357 mag. chambered rifles and all steel revolvers/handguns."

998,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3375998,For Sale:  Complete AR lower and upper. Build your own. Fun! and Cheap!,"Concord, Charlotte, North Carolina",$ 200,"Listed On: Monday, August 11, 2014",Rifles,no type,223/5.56 NATO                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"I am selling (no trades) an Aero Precision complete lower with a Spike's Tactical lower parts kit installed, a Magpul K grip, and an Aero Precision upper. the only thing to add is the ejection port cover of your choice. Maybe get one with a Punisher symbol or ""Molon Labe"" or something engraved. Maybe not. Whatever floats your boat.

The upper is T marked and the lower is threaded for a set screw for the takedown pin. Pretty standard stuff and a great solid platform for a build of any kind. I have built three ARs susing both Aero Precision lowers and uppers and they have functioned flawlessly and done everything I needed them to.

The price is pretty firm, and at this price, I don't really wish to travel very much, so please plan to meet in either Concord, Charlotte, Salisbury, or somewhere close.

Thanks and good day."
