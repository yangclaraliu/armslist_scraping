Just curious to see what else is out there.  I'd like a 9mm Springfield XDm, Walther PPQ, H&K VP9, but would consider other quality 9mm's (no Taurus, Kel Tec etc.).  Would also be interested in a Mossberg Mvp patrol in. 308, might also consider the 556 version or similar bolt guns.  Would be interested in a basic AK47, lever action rifle in. 38/.357, 3-4 inch 357 revolver like a GP100, a complete AR15 upper with an 18-20 inch barrel with a mid or full length gas system, quality optics for AR15 particularly a Vortex strikefire and magnifier, a Mossberg 590a1 or maybe other combat style shotguns.    Absolutely not interested in field guns or hunting rifles/shotguns though.

I have my ccl, feel free to call/text me at three 1 six 6 one 9 nine 8 five 3 with questions or offers, texts preferred.

Thanks!"

The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series is the right pistol for those who are ready to step up their game with a pistol built specifically for competition.

The XD(M)® 5.25″ Competition Series has the longest slide and barrel of any XD(M)®, which maximizes accuracy, controllability and sight radius. Speaking of sights, the fully adjustable rear sight and fiber optic front sight allow for startlingly fast sight acquisition. The lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used. Add in more XD(M)® features – a match grade barrel, minimal-reset trigger, and mega-lock frame texture – and you have a serious competition pistol that’s ready to help you bring home first place.

Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun.

HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset.

The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break.

The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip.

Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters.

A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available.

The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces.

The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life.

HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity.

The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy.

VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.

Covered by Heckler & Koch’s limited lifetime warranty, the HK VP9 is a solid design engineered with the famous long-term durability that make HK products especially cost-effective when subjected to total life cycle cost analysis. Suggested retail price of the VP9 is $719 with projected availability of July 2014.

This is a high quality factory upper professionally built by Seekins. The barrel is Black Nitride / melonite treated which is more accurate and lasts longer than chrome lined. The extremely lightweight 10"" MCSR V2 Keymod rail has a 1.8"" inside diameter to accommodate suppressors. The Seekins adjustable gas block is over $60 alone and offers you complete tuning capabilities (see below).

The first to come with $500 cash takes it. It is brand new, never fired, and price is firm. Or I might trade for a decent 1911, S&W stainless .357 or larger caliber revolver, other quality pistol or revolvers, Mossberg SPX, AK, Mini 14, or ?

*For an additional $125 I can include a $150 Seekins Precision Melonite / Black Nitride full milspec M16 bolt carrier group (shown at the link below) and charging handle if you need them, which is a steal. Or if you prefer I can include a Nickel Boron treated BCG and Nickel Boron treated charging handle by WMD instead for $150. 

http://www.seekinsprecision.com/m16-bolt-carrier-group.html

From the manufacturer:
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block lets you to fine tune your rifle's gas system for smoother cycling and operation. Regulating the amount of gas used to cycle the action allows tuning the rifle’s operation to a specific load and the use of low mass bolt carriers, buffers and springs to reduce felt recoil. This is critical to allow faster follow up shots, target acquisition and reliability.
The Seekins Precision Adjustable Gas Block is field adjustable. Operation is easy, simply turn the gas regulating screw in to lessen the amount of gas and out to add more gas, then use the brass set screw to lock the setting in place. The overall height of the gas block is 1.37” with left to right dimensions at .94” to fit under most hand guards and still have the customization of an adjustable gas block.
Melonite Coated to reduce wear and corrosion for extended periods of fire, it also makes cleaning easier, as carbon build up will not adhere to the non-reflective coated surface as much as it does on standard Parkerized finishes.

The MCSR V2 rail is comfortable, extremely light weight modular rail system that will work in any situation as well as comfortably fit a suppressor inside the rail. The MCSR V2 was designed to make using a quick mounted suppressor easy to install or remove while inside the rail.
The MCSR V2 rail is designed so that the 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions will accept all keymod accessories and have two anti-rotation QD positions per side (6total). The internal dimension has increased to 1.8"" to accommodate most suppressors on the market."

I travel so sometimes responses or additional pictures may take a day or so. Thus why I'm selling it, it just gets no use or exposure by me, and seems a waste for such an interesting gun from Ruger.

I am selling Samsung's and Google Android's premier smart phone here.  It's 4G LTE and all that, has all the bells and whistles you would expect from a phone like this.  Has 16gb memory space, color is black, and really is new with all the plastic still intact around the phone and all the cords and cables, etc.  Looking to sell for $400.  Would love to sell today and tomorrow.  Prefer cash as I have need for it.  However, if it's a trade that is obviously in my favor I would consider.

I also am in need of a cheaper Droid or Windows Phone or IPhone 4 or 5 that would be in good shape.  Must function just fine so I can use them.  So, if you have one, I would consider taking some off my asking price if you wanted to do a cash/trade deal.  What I had planned to do is use some of the money from selling this phone to buy me a cheaper phone anyhow.  The one I'm using now works find, but the screen is cracked.  I used my 2 year upgrade for the Samsung with intent to sell it.  I go through phones pretty often, so it's better for me to have a cheaper one to use every day.

I have 1630 dollars invested and have not taken it out the box till today. 

This is a nasty piece of hardware. I even gave one of these to my wife and told her this is your first line of defense.This is the pinnacle of home defense or nearly any situation where a large amount of aggressors need to be immobilized. 20 rounds of 00 Buck is a lot of fire power and a single shot to soft body armor typically will break the rib cage.  Unfortunately  it's not a concealed carry weapon but great for around the house and they are a blast at the range. This has become my favorite gun to go to the range with for a cheap day of shooting with target loads. 

Brand new never fired. You can get up to a 20 round drum for these. Comes with everything it did from the factory plus I added a muzzle brake door breach. Comes with 2 mags, paperwork, muzzle thread protector ETC.

Unlike the Saiga this will fire bird shot, low brass, target, high brass loads etc. from the factory with no modifications or issues. Also the Vepr12 12 gauge does not habe the failure to feed or failure to eject issues the Saiga has. I own several of both and the Saiga takes a lot of work to make it a reliable weapon. The Molot Vepr 12 is far superior to the Saiga 12.

This has a collapsible adjusting stock, BHOLR , Bolt hold open last round fired, ambidextrous magazine release, hinged dust cover,optics rail, combat front sight which is ideal for a shotgun and a magzine well. This allows you to slam the magazine straight in just like a hand gun or ar15 as where the Saiga12 you have to get it in at just the right angle in the groove then pull it back just like the ak47.  The Molly Vepr is already machined to accept the saga mags if you prefer them. You just have to remove the mag well and reinstall the mag catch lever wich costs 30 dollars. Personally  I prefer the Mag well as it only takes a fraction of a second to load the mag.

Not looking to travel not really looking for trades but may consider high end hand guns worth 1600 in they're current condition. The Vepr is going for about 1500 if you can even find this model as all Russian guns have been banned from import

I'm in need of someone who knows about and can fix S&W 39-2.
The issue is the slide sticks.  Seems to be smooth until the slide starts to move the trigger then it's tough till you get past the trigger.  Fires fine but the slide is tough to rack.  I had a couple guys look at it but I think I need someone who really knows about these guns don't know if it's a common problem but the gun it's self is supper clean.

I intended to put an odin works lo-pro gas block on it that I had laying around, but it is not low profile enough. It will take one along the lines of a troy low profile (my parallax tactical adjustable lo-pro also fits. I took it off my other rifle and tested it). with these, just bolt up to your lower.
Barrel was $189 new, hand guard was just over $100, and upper and CH were around $70. All of these are new parts. I have had a flash hider on the barrel, but removed it, but other than that, all are brand new.
this would make a nice recce or spr style build. I have this exact same barrel on another ar15 and it shoots 3/4 to 1"" with good ammo (I usually shoot 69gr smk in my other one) at 100.
$275 plus shipping/insurance to lower 48 only."

The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. 

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.

If you prefer AR mags this can be converted to take standard AR mags like the new MSAR E4 model. Located in Vincennes, cash price is $1400 firm. Local pickup only at that price."

This is what I know about the gun. Its an original 1942 Colt M 1911 A1 US Army Issue. (matching numbers except slide does not show serial number behind hammer) According to the serial number this gun was shipped in May of 1942. It is stamped with WB inside a Box for Colonel Waldemar S. Broberg, Hartford/Springfield Ordnance District, Army Inspector of Ordnance: July 1, 1941 - June 16, 1942. The WB inspected pistols are a little more rare for that time frame.

Not sure how this gun made it back to the states, but it appears the gun was made into a national match pistol during the 1950's or early 1960's, it does not have ""NM"" stamped on the slide.. But not all pistols back then were stamped with ""NM"" for national match. There are two types of Camp Perry National Match pistols.. The kind sent back to Armories and stamped SA for Springfield Armory and NM for Colt Armory. These were tuned, and fitted by the armory for military camp perry match shooting. The second was private gunsmiths these were done in competition with the armories for the same reason. Many prominent Gunsmiths of the time wanted national match recognition and made their own finally tuned pistols. It appears this one might have been done by the military, as the barrel has been re-stamped. This gun is in its original time frame finish (parkerized). All Proof markings to fit era. Bore is excellent and looks shinning.

This pistol is a shooter. It is amazingly tight and special fitted for accuracy. Its an amazing piece of history and looks beautiful as well. Definitely a one of a kind 1911. Would be a prize piece for any collection.
