It's the 12.5 inch barrel version. I've only put 300 rounds through it. The previous owner was a family friend. They never fired it, so it only has the 300 down the tube. I put up a picture of some damage to the finish near the windage drum. I bought a cheap NC Star sighting tool and the hole wasn't big enough for the windage drum to move into. I thought the drum was just stiff from being new-ish. Me being an idiot, I gave the tool a couple extra whacks with a hammer and made it clamp even harder on the finish. That's what happened there. Besides that, the gun has always shot very reliably and is a fun gun to shoot. I'll include at least a steel mag and a tapco mag. If you have any questions or want a pic of anything else, just shoot me a message. Thanks!"

The ""Black Army"" is a collectors designation for mid to late 1918 Colt 1911 production. In order to speed production for the war effort, Colt left off some final polishing steps that produced a dark - almost black finish.  From the black finish the pistol became known as the ""Black Army"" almost as if it was a model variation produced by Colt.  Black Armies are not uncommon but difficult to find in this condition.  

These came with 3 different types of grips, diamond and checkered (most common), checkered as pictured here and plain.

Born of the traditions of the Old West, the Rough Rider maintains much of the look and feel of the legendary Single Action Army revolver, only in a scaled down version. Chambered for the .22LR and .22 Magnum cartridges, the Rough Rider is manufactured using state-of-the-art precision machinery that assures its accuracy and reliability. The cylinder lock-up is tight and the perfect timing of the action makes for a handgun that will put its shots where you want 'em.

The machined barrel is micro-threaded and inserted into the frame for the optimal barrel/cylinder gap to give you maximum ammunition performance. A hammer block mounted in the recoil shield provides extra protection and has a red dot indicator that lets you know when the gun is ready for action. A new, more authentic looking flat-sided hammer paired with new exotic cocobolo grips, makes the Rough Rider both functional and handsome. There are also other grip materials available, plus finish options include the attractive and durable Smooth Silver Satin. When it comes to the Rough Rider there are no shortcuts taken!

Ideal for hunting, plinking or western action shooting, let the Rough Rider be your choice in a new rimfire revolver.

It is blued. It is in exceptional condition. No box or papers, but will come with a Bianchi right hand holster. Pics will be up later tonight.

Cash price is $1200. This is firm.

As far as trades, I'm looking for full-size 9mm (only 9mm, and if it's a long slide line an FNS-9L or the like), and either a GP100 in 4"" or 6"" barrel (.357 mag only), or a Smith 686+ in the 4"" or 6"" barrel. I will combine trades. Trade value is also $1200. Whatever you offer for trade, subtract the value by $1200 and that difference will be in cash. I will accept multiple guns in trade, as long as we are even with the trade values and cash making up the difference. I am not interested in anything outside of what I have listed for trade. This is priced fair based on market price so if you value your used gun above what I can get it for brand new, I will not even bother to respond. 

It should be noted that if offering 2 guns, one needs to be one of the mentioned .357's."

Gently used, with less than 100 rounds through her. Grey Cerakote paint. This gun has been converted with the following features. Gas port mod, piston mod, Carolina Shooters supply trigger guard, Tapco trigger group, ATI rubber textured hand grip. The stock is a Phoenix Technologies shock absorbing collapsible. Toward the front, I have installed the CHAOS SAIGA 12 EXTENDED TITAN QUAD RAIL. This thing is a beast, its not only beautiful and finely machined, but adds a very solid feel to the shotgun. There is a Blackhawk vertical grip on the front end, that can also be extended with the additional part that I have with it. Right now i have it in the ""stubby"" configuration, but if you like you can make that a bit longer. On the front I have a Kineti-Tech Barrel shroud. This just makes the gun look that much cooler. It is easily removed, if you prefer to have it off the gun. It does add a little bit of weight to the front, but it is not bad. I do also have the thread protector ring just in case you choose to go without the shroud. The gun comes with a 5 round and an 8 round magazine. The stock cleaning kit is also here, although i haven't used it. There is also a cleaning rod. I did attach a red dot style site on the top rail (as you can see in the pic), but it is not up to par with the recoil of this gun. The site jitters out of position after a few shots, and needs to be re adjusted. Im just sending it with the gun. This gun also comes with a hard case. So if you buy this gun, you will have everything you need except the ammo.
Keep in mind, this firearm has been truly converted, not like others who state it is converted but did not move the trigger group and guard forward to its original intended position that IZHMASH designed. They sell stocks with the built in pistol grip to make it look like it is converted, but in reality the trigger group is still in the rearward position with a mechanical linkage to the hammer.  Just an FYI for those that aren't aware of the difference between a converted and non converted saiga 12.

Like new condition S&W SW9VE Striker Fire, only about 300 rounds through it and never a jamb or malfunction. Comes with 2 magazines and original box. This model is known to have a heavy trigger pull and this gun is no exception. Once you get used to it, it shoots pretty straight. Wife does not like the heavy trigger so I am replacing it with something else. Must provide Oklahoma DL for proof of age and residence. Otherwise if you are out of state you will need to do a transfer through a dealer (your cost). Call REDACTED. Not interested in any trades, asking $275."
