It is a Winchester Model 1897 Brush Takedown model. This is a 12 Gauge shotgun, which is made for 2.5 inch shells. However, it will shoot 2 3/4 just fine. This particular gun has a 28 inch barrel, and breaks down into two halves. Also included is a case that was bought way back in the day with the gun, with two separate pockets for each half of the gun. Tons of history here, even some 100 year old blood on the case for good measure. 

As far as the gun is concerned, it has been looked over from top to bottom by a gunsmith who specializes in old Winchesters, and is 100% functioning. The only unoriginal piece on this firearm is a screw which had a stripped head and was replaced. It is in incredible condition. All original wood, metal, finish, etc. You will have a very hard time finding an 1897 in better condition than this one. 

You could legitimately use this gun to kill ducks and doves for another 100 years. Incredible piece of art.

The trigger is amazing, it shoots AWESOME, recoil is minimal and the muzzle rise is practically non existent... Not to mention it is GORGEOUS.  Only reason I'm selling is I got an NFA trust and I want to build a suppressed SBR.  There are very few items on this rifle that are just basic (buffer tube, gas block/tube and the mag release lever are all I can think of) the rest of it is all top of the line stuff.  Probably won't ever see another quite like it!  The build list is as follows:

-Northtech Defense matched upper/lower with titanium forward assist - $450
-PWS (Primary Weapons Systems) 15"" keymod rail - $270
-Cerakoted in Magpul FDE (color fill is done with crayon for easy removal) - $175

-Battle Arms Development Ambi safety and Enhanced takedown pins - $100 total

-Magpul MBUS back up sights -$75 

All told, I've got about $2,600 invested NOT including taxes/shipping etc, etc for all of the parts to build this rifle.  Considering that it's practically brand new, I don't want to come too far down.

I don't know a lot about this Gun.  I do know that the barrel is the Damascus Barrel and I was told that it is a grade E.  Being that this has a Damascus barrel, it is highly recommended that this gun is not fired unless you have it thoroughly checked out by a professional and are familiar with what type of ammo should be used in this firearm (modern ammo is not acceptable).

The primary reasons behind the huge post war overhaul of large, obsolete rifle stockpiles were the anticipation of another impending world war, and the plan to call up seasoned veterans in defense of the motherland. Already familiar with their old mosin nagant rifles and revolvers, those veterans would likely have required very little new training and would easily and rapidly reintegrate into the red machine. 
With the development of newer semi auots that would have required extensive massive retraining, the important issue became of quick mobilization became apearant. However time passed and those great ww2 veterans eventually aged beyond the point of viability. While newer weapons took over the worlds battlefields, the stocks of long outdated ordnance were now imported to the USA. 

This is a pre war 1934 izzy manufacture m90/31 with hexagonal reciever with original russian laminate non refurbished stock. This rifles bore is stone mint shiny chromed out! ""Have neer seen one like this"" The metal has not a mark on it is stone mint! The magazine follower, action etc have no wear! Mint bore. All matching. No refurbishment marks from other countrys on the stock.
This is a very early import that was sold wrapped in brown paper tied in twine. This rifle saw little to no action its entire life, maybe an officers or political gaurds weapon

The rifles antiquated lines, and historical signifigance is something to be sought after for years to come. This rifle was made well when an individuals workmanship was apreciated and one took pride in what they did. It also was a matter of national pride, a ""we made it here"" battle rifle.

The SCAR is delivered as a battle carbine with battle trigger which means they are horrific.. Special Forces unit armorers have replaced these units with Geissele units (select fire) from the beginning and cleaned up the interiors. These upgraded SCAR units DO have Geissele trigger units installed; 2 stage with second release 2-2.5lbs enabling precision work. Shown with the Trijicon 6x issue ACOG. This unit is simply awesome with a BDC ballistic drop compensator out to 1200 meters.. target at 800? Put the ""8"" on it. 1200 meters away.. put the""12"" on target. Steel cap retention devices, distance/range use, red chevron, upper picatinny rail, fiber optics (adjustable) for day with tritium for night. Battery free, waterproof 100+ meters, dustproof, fogproog w/ MS designation. This system is an awesome platform but for room clearing 6x is too much. Optics package includes an offset Trijicon RMR red dot system also with chevron. Enables fast target acquisition for close quarter battle/ room clearing. On an offset 45 degree mount which allows you to easily switch from 6x to 1x and vice versa ( simply rotate the stock to the port side without moving your head and you automatically align with the CQB red dot). This system also mounts on the top of the 6x ACOG (piggyback). Operators choice! These are overruns from an LEO contract, are new in the issued cases, are Flat Dark Earth.Looks Great ."

Talk about a great man cave or garage piece! This will be the talk of all your buddies! Keep your valuables and guns safe in plain sight.
After building 2 others and keeping one myself, I have taken many suggestions and ideas and was able build this one with convenience as well as keeping function in mind.
Repurposed SAM'S Cola pop machine turned into a functional gun safe. 
Outside lights up.  Has key and another bar lock if adding a pad lock is needed.  Has two sheets of 5/8 firecode drywall all the way around covered with dark indoor outdoor carpet.  18 pistol hooks on door panel, with 4 shell hooks above those. Inside the safe, you will be greeted by a motion sensed led light, along with 8 adjustable shelves, and 15 spots for both shotguns and rifles.  The dividing wall with shelves is removable making room for more shotguns or rifles.  There is a large storage compartment under neath.  The safe plus into a standard outlet with a 10 cord, as well as a power strip located on the inside of the safe allowing for accessories such as dehumidifier or more lights.  This safe is heavy, it would not be easy to pick up and carry out, however it can be bolted to the floor if necessary.   The outside has scratches and looks likes it has been used.  The labels for the buttons have not been changed, allowing the new owner to put their favorite labels in.  
I can send more pics via email.  I can deliver for additional fee, it will be delivered to garage or driveway only, and will require deposit before I load it up.  No trades.  Cash is king.

1 - M107A1 29'' MRB  1- Leupold 1- Leupold mk4 4.5- 14x 50 lr/t m1 mil dot  1 - Black Barrett qdl Suppressor

M107A1 rifle systems are fed from a 10 round detachable box magazine and function on a recoil operated semi automatic design. Intended for use with a suppressor, this one of a kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107. An all-new bolt carrier group design and a four-port muzzle brake engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor is key to making the rifle suppressor ready.

The Barrett M107’s lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles.

Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The Barrett M107 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new recoil buffer system that is also optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning. 

Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference. Delivered with a Pelican case, one 10-round magazine, flip-up iron sights, detachable adjustable lightweight bipod legs, lightweight monopod, sling attach points, and owner’s manual.

Intended for use with a suppressor, this one of a kind rifle allows you to combine signature reduction capabilities with the flawless reliability of the original Barrett M107. An all-new bolt carrier group design and a four-port muzzle brake engineered to work seamlessly with a quick-attach Barrett .50 BMG Suppressor is key to making the rifle suppressor ready. The Barrett M107’s lightweight aluminum upper receiver features an integrated, rigid 27 MOA optics rail. Inside the upper receiver, the bolt carrier rides on a hardened steel anti-wear strip for added durability. A thermal-guard cheek piece protects the user’s face from extreme heat or cold. The rear-barrel stop and front-barrel bushing are bolted and bonded with a compound similar to that used on space shuttles. Enhanced modularity is also a key feature. The rifle’s rail-mounted aluminum rear grip can easily be reconfigured. The Barrett M107 rifle’s lower receiver includes a new recoil buffer system that is also optimized for use with a suppressor. The bolt carrier’s components are protected with a mix of ultra hard PVD coatings and advanced nickel Teflon plating that increases lubricity, is corrosion-resistant and greatly eases cleaning. Numbered witness holes on the magazine are just another example of how even the smallest detail makes a powerful difference. Delivered with a Pelican case, one 10-round magazine, flip-up iron sights, detachable adjustable lightweight bipod legs, lightweight monopod, sling attach points, and owner’s manual.

Prefer concealed weapon license holders, otherwise I will be doing a search for any felonies. FTF sale prefered. Otherwise, buyer will cover shipping costs and FFL fees.

This rifle has only had 500 rounds fired through it, that is basically a break in period for the barrel and this is not your off the shelf CORE 15 or Stag Arms basic rifle. This rifle will outlast any use most people will have for it.

Thank you for looking. this is an extremely fun rifle to shoot on the range and has a lot of room for your own scope, red dot, light, what have you.

I suppose I need to be clear on this, I'm not driving an hour and a half to meet you for my asking price. $800 is the lowest offer I will take for the rifle if you meet me within 30 minutminutes of Lady Lake, otherwise the price will go up. I am no longer in immediate need to get rid of this rifle and do not have a problem sitting at this price until it sells. The rifle and 7 Pmags are still available."

967,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3482967,"For Sale:  Not found in retail stores! Factory shorter barrel & upgrades: competition compensator pinned to Adams Arms 14.5"" Evo Ultra Lite Gas Piston Upper Receiver Assembly with Competition Compensator","Rogers, Minneapolis / St. Paul, Minnesota",$ 850,"Listed On: Friday, March 6, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Brand New in Box! This Adams Arms EVO Ultra Lite Mid Length Gas Piston Upper Assembly is chambered in 5.56x45mm NATO and comes ready to fire right out of the box after installation onto any AR-15 pistol lower receiver. Designed to be the ultimate lightweight solution for competitive, recreational or hunting purposes, the EVO Ultra Lite trims weight wherever possible while still maintaining excellent accuracy, long term durability and high performance. It does this by combining a melonite treated, 14.5"" ultra-light contour barrel with a 12"" extended Samson Evolution Modular Free Floating Handguard and a low profile piston gas block. The shooter's preferred sighting arrangement is easily accommodated by a continuous top picatinny rail interface that runs from the rear of the forged A3 flat-top upper receiver to the low profile gas block, while both recoil and muzzle climb are efficiently handled by an effective Adams Arms Competition Compensator. Additional features include a mid length gas system for a longer sight radius and smoother recoil impulse, complete bolt carrier group, charging handle assembly, one 4"" modular rail section and two 2"" rail sections. 

The upper's barrel has been finished inside and out with Adams Arms' proprietary QPQ Melonite treatment that bonds with the metal on a molecular level. Also referred to as salt bath nitriding, this treatment produces an extremely hard, slick surface on steel that resists carbon adhesion and increases corrosion resistance, extending a barrel's service life by reducing the friction produced inside the bore upon firing for a net decrease in bore surface wear over time. Nitriding converts the barrel steel's surface without any build-up, retaining all of the benefits of traditional chrome lining without suffering the accuracy degradation commonly encountered due to uneven application of chrome inside the barrel's bore. The end result is a barrel that's capable of producing accuracy on par with a match stainless steel tube, while also exhibiting the longevity and resilience of a chrome lined, mil-spec barrel. 

All Adams Arms uppers feature a short stroke gas piston operating system, which prevents hot gas and debris from being directed back into the action upon firing. The result is a rifle that runs cooler, cleaner and more reliably than those utilizing a standard direct gas impingement system of operation. To ensure that damage doesn't occur to the buffer tube from carrier tilt, the bolt carrier is equipped with enlarged ""skis"" to help guide it into the receiver extension. The bolt carrier's solid steel, 1-piece construction incorporates an integral piston strike face to guarantee integrity over time, while the bolt assembly is spring loaded for proper lock-up and to help reduce bolt bounce and cam pin wear. All piston components are finished in QPQ Melonite for corrosion resistance and easy cleaning/maintenance.
