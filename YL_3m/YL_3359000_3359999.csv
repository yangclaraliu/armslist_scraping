This is an Extremely Accurate Shooting Pistol that holds 7 Rounds of Potent .380 Ammo. This little pistol is very Accurate & Powerful, it has been shot very little and is basically brand new. It Includes Federal and Black Hills Gold Hollow Point Ammo for Self Defense and some PMC Premium Brass FMJ Ammo also- over 100 Rounds are included.It also Includes a Really Nice Custom Leather Holster and Uncle Mike's Pocket Holster. This is by far the most comfortable gun ive ever carried, it is so light and compact it's perfect for everyday carry. It was $319.99 plus the 3 Boxes of Ammo and the Pocket Holster it was $417 with tax. The Custom Leather Holster was bought later and cost $68 which is expensive but you have to have a comfortable, quality holster or you won't carry the Gun and it does no good if you don't have it with you.So I have nearly $500 in the Gun, Ammo, + 2 Holsters.Dont worry, I'm not expecting anything close to that for the it. 

THE ISSUE-PLEASE READ THIS IN DETAIL SO YOU'LL KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE CONDITION IS OF THE GUN- IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN IT LOOKS- This Gun was bought for a Female and was Mainly a Raspberry Color according to Taurus, but it looked Pink. Since my wife refused to carry it, I decided I liked it enough to carry it but I couldn't carry s Pink Gun so I painted it all Black and it was perfect but I wanted a more custom look and decided to Strip the Slide back down to Bare Metal and Strip the Lower Frame back down also. Unfortunately I can't make up my mind on how to finish it. I have changed my mind 3-4 times and now I think it would be best to let the New Owner Decide.I have the Proper Finish to Re-Blue the Slide that is now stripped down to bare metal and it's a simple process that'll have it looking factory new in a short while and I have Specialty Black Paint for the Lower Portion of the Gun so it can easily be refinished and look perfect, exactly like the Factory Solid Black Model of this Gun. I have the Stuff Needed to do that job and it'll be done right if you like Black. I also thought about re-painting the Lower Portion Black and Polishing the Entire Upper Assembly to a Mirror Finish like Chrome and this can easily be done with a Dremel Tool or Any Rotary Type Tool and some Polishing Compound available at any Auto Parts Store, Wal-Mart, etc- there are many videos on YouTube and Instructional Guides online that tell you exactly how to polish metal if you're not familiar- it's a very simple process. And the other option is having it Coated with a Finish more durable than any paint or factory finish & you can pick any Color Combination you can think of, they even have various camo patterns- this is an inexpensive solution that can be done by many local Gun Shops and Other Companies that specialize in coating and refinishing. I can recommend someone or just ask your local Gun Shop or Local Paint Store, they will know who does the coating in your area. Plus, this Gun is very small and won't take long to do, and it is already prepared for paint/refinishing/coating so that'll save you even more. AS YOU CAN TELL, I CAN'T DECIDE HOW TO REFINISH THE GUN AND I THINK THE NEW OWNER SHOULD DECIDE SO IT'LL BE JUST AS YOU WANT IT.

Gun is in very good to excellent condition.

Was purchased last season, but looking to upgrade to a semi auto.

These shotguns in there price range around $350, in my opinion are the best pump shotguns on the market. They are well balanced, point and handle nicely, they group excellent, and cycle very well. The finish on this gun is very tough, non glare and matte black.

Chambered for 3"" shells. General features include 28"" barrel, back bored with chrome lined chamber and bore (ideal for steel shot), Inflex recoil pad which is first rate at reducing the kick, and a 4 lug rotary bolt system.

I will throw a Model 1927, D.G.F.M. / Ejercito Argentino (Argentine Army) semi-automatic .45 ACP pistol ... for FREE !!!

Pistol info:
Manufactured in 1951 (SN: 68xxx) with all matching numbers
Excellent mechanical function & condition with clean bore, ramp, slide & bushing
Pachmeyer rubber grips (no backstrap)
Matte finish ArmorCoat (think dull electroless nickel plate) for corrosion resistance

Note: Do NOT mistake these pistols for the Ballester-Molina version. Unlike the Molina's, the Sistema'a were manufactured by Colt with Colt tooling and Colt components and parts for 10 years after which the Argentine government purchased the tooling, equipment and spare parts inventory and took over production in-county. The Colt Sistema's are NOT considered as a ""knock-off"" by any stretch of the imagination!

I am looking to sell, or trade for a decent quality AR or Mini-14 (some type of 223 preferably).  I have never owned a good rifle, so I've been considering this for a while.

I absolutely love this gun, I've maybe put 200 rounds through it give or take.  I sent it in to Chiappa to have some parts updated, works flawlessly and haven't had any problems.

The price is firm, if I don't get a good trade offer or asking price, then I'll probably just keep the gun.

Gun is in good shape, shows normal use i.e. rub marks on stock (pictured) No gouges or cuts anywhere on gun. It is however missing the front fiber optic sight.

These guns have the Armorlokt coating which basically wraps the gun in polymer, making it extremely resistant to adverse conditions. 

It has a 28"" forged barrel which shoots a real nice pattern and is bright and clean. It is also aggressively textured on the forearm which was great when wearing gloves last duck season. Shoots everything from 3.5"" down, and the Supercell recoil pad DEFINITELY takes away a lot of the push from the magnum shells. Has the original factory Modified choke in it along with the plug, will also come with an extra Full choke ($30 value) purchased last year. 

Im selling this on behalf of my brother who purchased it last year, and is looking to upgrade to a semi auto this year. 

Asking $230 firm. No trade. Thank You.

This is $269.75 worth of ammo PLUS shipping (All retail prices taken straight from Lucky Gunner, feel free to verify).  You do the math this ammo is LITERALLY 37 cents on the dollar, heck less than that if you factor in shipping.  Where else will you buy 38/357 ammo for 63% off retail?  No where, that's where.  If you find it that cheap please send me the link I'll take $1000 myself.  Also for this price I am not driving halfway to Columbia, Hilton Head or China.

 The TRP™ series of 1911s from Springfield Armory® are serious tools for the most serious of applications. These tactically proven pistols are intentionally designed to work under the worst conditions you’ll encounter. You'll find all the quality, features and performance that you need in a 1911 of this class.

 TRP™ level quality starts with the forged national match frame and slide. These are precision fit and then mated with a national match stainless steel barrel and bushing. The 20LPI checkering on the front strap, checkered mainspring housing and G10 grips will keep this gun in your hands when the sweat and adrenaline are flowing. The crisp 4.5 – 5lb trigger pull means you can more easily put shots on target when it matters most. 3 – dot tritium sights and an extended beveled magazine well remind you that the TRP™ was designed for use in high stress places – where the environment works against target acquisition, and mag swaps have to be lightning fast. The Armory Kote™ or Stainless Steel finish will protect your TRP™ so it’s ready for the next mission.

 Sometimes performance isn’t optional. When your requirements dictate that you use the best tools available, reach for the Tactical Response Pistol™.


 I've put less than 500 rounds through this gun, function & performance have been absolutely perfect. Gun comes with 2 mags & all accessories in pictures.

This is without a doubt one of the greatest carry pistols ever created. Based on the 1911 platform, this single fire pistol has about 300 flawless rounds through it, so it is barely broken in. This gun is incredibly light and compact, and easily disappears into any pocket. Included with the pistol is the sig hard case, manual, one 6 round magazine, and 5 holsters. The holsters included are the sig out of waistband holster, a leather in the waistband tagua, a cloth pocket holster, a sig in the pocket holster with back piece (to hide the outline of the pistol in your pocket), and a remora holster that can be worn in the waistband or in the pocket. This pistol is perfect for summer carry, or as a back-up gun. I am in no rush to get rid of it, just selling it to make room for other purchases. Thanks for looking!

Note, the pictures below are the actual pistol for sale. I had a photographer friend take some nice pics for me. The knife is not included.

924,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3359924,For Sale:  Fender custom shop custom deluxe telecaster,"Fuquay varina, Raleigh / Durham / CH, North Carolina","$ 2,500","Listed On: Wednesday, August 6, 2014",Miscellaneous,no type,no type,no type,no type,"The Fender Special Edition Custom Deluxe Telecaster electric guitar features a select ash body with a thin nitrocellulose lacquer finish that ""breathes"" and resonates with the responsiveness of a vintage model. Add in all of the modern upgrades and you've got a great playing, versatile guitar that will get you through the job at hand in comfortable style and with superior sound. The custom specifications for the one-piece maple neck come together to give an incredible playing experience. We loved the neck profile on the Custom Shop's Tribute Series Jeff Beck Esquire so much, we had Fender put it on this model. From its large modified V-shaped maple neck and flatter 9.5"" fingerboard radius, to the taller 6105 frets, these elements combine for an incredible feel with easy chording plus allows for amazing string bends that ring out clear and don't choke out. You can express yourself freely without any worries. Hardware on the Custom Deluxe Telecaster includes Fender/Schaller staggered, cast/sealed tuning machines for smooth, precise tuning stability, and a chrome-plated steel Tele bridge plate with six plated brass saddles and string-thru-body design. The quality materials specially chosen for this bridge add to the vintage musical response, while giving you the modern benefits of improved intonation, height adjustment, and smooth edges for comfort. The details of the bridge effect the attack, decay, sustain, and release of the notes in a beautiful musical way that every now and again can give you goose bumps. Other appointments include a single-ply white pickguard and a top-hat switch cap. Includes hardshell case, strap, straplocks, cable, and certificate of authenticity.

The Special Edition Custom Deluxe Telecaster is loaded with a Nocaster single-coil pickup in the bridge position, and a Fender Custom Shop Twisted Tele single-coil pickup in the neck position. These are arguably the best Tele pick-ups the Custom Shop makes and give you that very desirable, yet somewhat elusive sparkle and spank of a vintage Tele. Additionally, it features a special 4-way Tele switch that is custom wired in an intuitive way with the player in mind. The back 3 positions give you the standard traditional settings in the traditional order, and you have the added option to slam the switch all the way forward for the killer 4th position of both pickups in series, which gives you a fuller, fatter humbucker tone with more output.

These Mossberg tactical .22LR rifles, with the look and feel of AR-style rifles, are based on the proven 702 Plinkster® autoloader platform. The Mossberg 715T has quickly become one of the most popular tactical rimfire rifles on the market.

Unlike many other tactical .22s, Mossberg has differentiated themselves by going with a A2-style (carry handle) receiver instead of the A3-style. The Mossberg 715T Tactical has A2 front and rear sights, and the carry handle includes a picatinny rail if you want to mount optics.

Most tactical .22s have a 16 inch barrel, but Mossberg decided to go with an 18 inch barrel for a better sight radius and a more traditional look. Also featuring a full length picatinny rail hand guard, adjustable stock and a 25 round magazine.
