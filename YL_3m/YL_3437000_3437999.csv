Most of us have noticed the change in Remington magazines for their Woodsmaster type rifles.

Manufacturer is Remington Arms of Ilion, New York. Construction is blue steel body with steel spring and cartridge follower, and polymer floorplate. This is the 7600 magazine that does not lock the bolt open, but it will work just fine on the autoloaders. This magazine fits Remington models 742, 760, 7400, 7600, Four, Six, and 750, Woodsmaster and Game Master series, chambered in .270 Winchester, .30-06 Springfield, .25-06, .280 or .35 Whelen Long Action Calibers. It will Not fit a Remington .243 or .308 Short Action. It Will Not fit A Remington 700 DBM Bolt Action. It Will Not Fit the cap of a 1967 Fleet’s Disposable syringe bottle. It will only fit Long Action Game Master and Woodmaster rifles that we have enumerated above. This magazine and its mates are all fresh production factory Remington, and they work where the polymer aftermarket mags are iffy at best.

Buy this one NOW for $300. No fees, taxes or other added costs! $300 FIRM. Check the usual suspects' prices for model PA4592019PGM and you will see what a great deal this is...

Prefer FTF deal with an Ohio resident but will ship for a flat fee of $35 to your FFL. Your FFL must accept it from an individual. FTF deal will go through my local gun shop so you will need an Ohio driver's license and be able to pass the instant background check. The sale price (and shipping) is what you pay. I do not charge sales tax. The listed price is what it takes to buy this gun... I'm not interested in wasting time with low-ballers! Check around and you will find that this price will not be beat!"

It was developed from the famous Mauser Gewehr 98 line, and features a very similar bolt design. The rifle was designed in Czechoslovakia shortly after World War I, featuring a 600 mm (23.6"") barrel which was shorter and considered more handy than the 150 mm (5.9"") -longer Gewehr 98. The carbine followed a similar trend in weapon design at the time, that a short rifle gave away little in ballistic efficiency at combat ranges, but was easier to handle on account of its shorter length.
This rifle comes with bayonet and sheath.  Shipping is $50 out of state (Nebraska) via a certified FFL.  In state without FFL with valid drivers license or other government issued photo ID.

If you were to make a rifle today the way Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken and Ludwig Loewe made them in the 19th century, it would likely cost several thousand dollars.

In addition to greatly expanding the government registration database of all law-abiding handgun owners in Washington, I-594 will specifically regulate transfers, not just sales, of ALL firearms.  This means that in virtually all cases, a person merely handing his or her firearm to a family member or a friend cannot do so without brokering the transfer through a gun dealer with the accompanying fees, paperwork, use taxes, and in the case of handguns, state registration.  I-594 also doubles the state waiting period on handgun sales from five to ten days and extends it to every private transfer of a handgun!"

EXTREMELY RARE!!

Matched pair with CONSECUTIVE SERIAL NUMBERS - ""Distinguished Limited Movie Pistols"" from the 1997 movie ""Face/Off"" with Nicholas Cage and John Travolta. Springfield Armory built the non-firing model pistols carried by Nicholas Cage's character, Castor Troy, in the movie. In 1998, Springfield Armory manufactured a very limited run of actual working 1911-A1s based on the movie pistols, called ""Distinguished Limited Movie Pistols.""

These pistols are a matched pair of gold finished Custom 1911-A1s, with ported barrels and slides, and consecutive serial numbers.  They are in 100% condition.
They have been verified by serial number with Springfield Armory.  Original dealer cost in 1998 was $2895 EACH.

They are priced at $4995 EACH, and we would prefer to sell the consecutive serial numbered pair together.

The Nikon Buckmasters 6-18x40mm Riflescope is a big improvement on one of the best selling scope lines in America, and that's no simple feat. Tricked out with more features, a cooler look, and the same great low prices, this Nikon riflescope has a more rounded, sleeker look that allows the scope to become a part of your rifle, not just an addition. Nikon has integrated the same great optics and exceptional light transmission as the current scopes in the Buckmaster line, now up to a full 92%, and wrapped them in a more ergonomic body with 1/8-MOA click, hand-turn reticle adjustments for precise sighting. Quick-focus eyepieces are also now standard on the Nikon Buck Masters scope, as is the non-reflective, matte black finish. The previous models of the Nikon Buck Masters 6-18x40mm Side Focus Rifle Scope utilized adjustable objective lenses, but they are now fitted with a side-focus adjustment knob to compensate for parallax. This feature allows the shooter fast, inconspicuous adjustments-and reduces the overall length of these rifle scopes, as well. The Nikon Buck Masters series features durable 1"" main body tubes constructed of aircraft grade aluminum. The Nikon 6-18x40mm Buckmaster Waterproof Scope is O-ring sealed and nitrogen-filled for true waterproof, fogproof and shockproof performance"

1/11 twist. Sage EBR chassis. 

Shoots great I have it sited in at 200 yards and makes a 1.5"" group with my loads. 

Comes with:
original black plastic stock. 
Ebr tool. 
2 20rd mags
And Springfield Gen 3 scope mount. 
Scope and ring NOT included. 

Only Issue with the chassis is the top plate is for a regular barrel and not a medium and the previous owner removed the material with what looks to be a grinder. I milled it to fit and cleaned it up but there's still some hack marks. It don't affect the performance one bit tho. A new plate is $140.

Serious buyers may email for pictures. 
I am willing to separate the original rifle and chassis but will need a fair price to do so. 
Thank you for looking. 
I will add more pictures later."

Its lightly used and in pretty good shape.  Very accurate with minimal recoil, +P rated.  This is the relatively rare six shot M856, not the M85; it is one of the very few 6 shot J frame sized .38 snubs out there.  Easily pocket carriable which is  aplus in the summer heat.

I'm interested in trading for a compact .40 handgun such as an M&P Shield .40 or Ruger SR40c, or similar.  Really only interested in .40, but might also consider a Taurus PT92.  Depending on what you have to trade or what comes with it I have a little bit of .38 ammo I could include, or maybe some cash.
