This pistol has been fired less than 50 rounds and has been a SAFE QUEEN for over 12 years and is both cosmetically and mechanically in perfect condition. IT IS A TACK DRIVER and Given its rarity, 100% stainless steel construction, threaded barrel and pure German lineage the P229S is a terrific acquisition for the advanced SIG collector. 

The SIG P229S competition pistol was first introduced in 1998. It was not continuously manufactured and only a relatively small number were made. The P229S was permanently discontinued in 2005. Every SIG P229S pistol was assembled by a dedicated technician at the SIG SAUER facilities in Germany. Each pistol was hand fitted and hand tuned to ensure smooth operation and the kind of superior accuracy you would expect from a SIG target grade pistol. SIG P229 Sport pistols are rigorously tested beyond normal limits and adjusted to ensure the very highest levels of performance. 

All SIG P229S pistols were assembled with a heavy contour target type barrel, precision machined stainless steel slide and stainless steel frame. The heavy stainless steel adds significant weight and rigidity to the platform thus reducing felt recoil and improving control. The P229S also employs a unique proprietary muzzle brake with an expansion chamber to soften recoil and help prevent muzzle rise, further improving on-target accuracy for second and subsequent shots. 

Based on the extensively combat tested P229 frame, the P229S pistol features; a stainless steel slide and frame, heavy match THREADED barrel, unique detachable combination vented muzzle compensator and counter weight, fully adjustable low-profile target sights, wrap around semi-soft Hogue rubber grips, grooved front strap, competition extended controls ( magazine release, de-cocking lever and slide release ), reversible magazine release, patented four point safety system, unique magazines with blue body and aluminum base plate with finger extension, factory tuned target trigger and squared trigger guard with grooved front strap.

Even with a full size firearm if you have shot any number of rounds through one you will notice as any moisture accumulates on your hands or in bad weather conditions it is harder to maintain that stable grip.  Under recoil you notice your hands starts separating, the gun starts shifting and we find ourselves readjusting our grip to maintain proper recoil control for follow up shots.

These guns were designed and developed by a Santa Monica, California police sargent named Alfred Crouch, for use as a SWAT tactical firearm. In the mid 1960s Crouch sold his design to High Standard who used their Flight King shotgun as the platform for the product. In the late 60s and in the 70s these guns were sold to many police departments and some foreign militaries. The compact size, manuverability and ability to use with one hand make these a formidable self-defense weapon. The shooter can fire five 12 gauge shells of his choice just as fast as he can pull his trigger finger.

As CZ became a collectivized industry consolidatingthe production of firearms under a single state entity at Uhersky Brod, so Ceske Zavody Motocyklove Narodni Podnik (Czech Motorcycle Works, National Enterprise) became the sole manufacturers of Czech motorcycles at the old arms plant in Strakonice."

This is a beautiful AR15 built with top notch parts.  It functions perfectly and has only had 30 rounds put through it .  Specs/parts as follows:
Barrel: .223/5.56 spiral fluted 416 stainless steel H Bar 16” match barrel with 1:9 twist rate and .223 Wylde chamber and M4 feed ramps.
Flash suppressor/compensator:  Titan JP Michlek style stainless steel muzzle break and carbine length gas system. It stays right on target for your next shot.
Syrac Arms Gen II adjustable gas block.  This is a self locking “notched” adjuster type gas block and the newest one on the market.  No separate detent to hold down, no thread locking sealant required to keep it in position and only one hand needed to adjust it from the front.  The AR15 platform is known for being overgassed and this allows you to reduce the amount of pressure going to your bolt carrier if you choose to turn it down . 
CTS carbon fiber free float fore end/quad rail 9 ½” long
Anderson 7075 lower with colored pictograms and manufacturer highlights as well as an Anderson lower parts kit.
Nickel Teflon treated upper with dust cover door and forward assist.  This is some of the newest technology out for these black rifles.  Per the manufacturer this needs no lube and is good for 40,000 – 50,000 rounds without lubrication.  I lube it anyway…it can’t hurt.  It makes it real easy to clean too compared to anodized uppers.  
Nickel boron bolt carrier assembly.  Again…the newest technology parts.  Combined with the nickel Teflon treated upper it is a no lubrication needed assembly if you do not like to deal with lubricants.  Carbon cleans off it easily compared to anodized bolts. 
Site Mark adjustable red reflex sight
6 position adjustable stock. 
One Magpul 30 round magazine with 20 rounds of Wolf gold .223 ammo included. 
Located in Macomb Township near M59 and I94."

Glock 23 GEN 4 - excellent cosmetic condition
(NOT a worn out beat G23 GEN3 LEO Trade-in)
.40 caliber S&W

From Glock:
The GLOCK 23 combines compact dimensions for both open and concealed carry, with minimum weight, despite its large magazine capacity in .40 caliber. Having survived durability tests and use by U.S. Law Enforcement agencies, the G23 pistol has repeatedly demonstrated its world-class durability and reliability in even the most unfavorable conditions. That's why countless police authorities continue to adopt the GLOCK 23 as their official service pistol. http://us.glock.com/products/model/g23

Argument for why the Glock 23 could be your only gun, if you only have one.

Included in this offering: 
- Glock 23 GEN4 in original case with cleaning brush
- Interchangeable back straps (2) for different custom grip (3 grip sizes)
- 3 Glock magazines - 13+1
- Mag loader
- 790 rounds of ammo in 50cal ammo can (750 FMJ UMC/PMC and 40 Federal HST HP)

One nice thing about this pistol is that you coulkd purchase a .357SIG and/or 9mm barrel for it and use Glock 19 9mm mags in it.  While you should also switch out the .40 extractor for a 9mm extractor, I have seen people at the range shoot the G23 with 9mm with just the 9mm barrel with the 40 cal extractor still in place.

I received this Glock 23 in a trade for a rifle earlier this year. I am on the fence regarding selling it because it is in excellent condition, it is versatile because you can easily modify it to shoot 9mm with an optional barrel/extractor, and I have ammo for it.  Therefore I'm firm on the deal price and including the ammunition.  I'm selling it to fund another acquisition. 

Also selling a Bersa Thunder 380 with an extra mag and a paddle holster.  See my other listing posting soon. 

Transfer - face to face in Concord. Not really interested in shipping this pistol or the ammo.  Ohio ID - either DL or CCW required, which I will document. You must be 21+ yo and be legally able to possess a handgun.You get to see my CCW and take a phone pic if you would like to."

This carbine is a fine example of the 1st Model Spencer seven-shot carbine without any of the modifications that were added later in the war. The US government contracted for a total of over 95,000 Spencer carbines during the war with 65,000 made at Spencer’s Boston, MA factory and 30,000 of the weapons made at the Burnside Rifle Company in Rhode Island. This Fine carbine is serial #579XX. Has an 22"" barrel with six grooves. The bore is excellent with crisp lands and grooves. The barrel has about 75-80% thinning blue left. There are scattered Inspector marks on the metal parts along with the Number 19 stamped on the loading block and loading tube and other major components. I believe this may be issue numbers for a State Cavalry Unit. Traces of case color on the receiver remain. The beautiful walnut stock and forend are excellent and have not been refinished. There is no stock cartouche nor was there ever one. The stock shows virtually no wear, just some handling marks. One small sliver on the forend has been repaired. The metal is a tight smooth fit wear it meets the wood, no gaps. Sling ring bar on the left side has never been off. The original steel loading tube is in excellent undented condition.

This is not an SBR as it doesnt have a stock, however you can put a SIG brace on it without modifications and not have to register as an SBR. These things make excellent krinkov style guns, tons of firepower in a small package.

Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters.

It is only very slightly used, still in original box with all original documents. Included with the purchase I have the following:

 1) G-Code OWB holster and G-Code double mag carrier (both Kydex/nylon)
 2) Aliengear IWB holster (http://aliengearholsters.com/)
 3) Wilson Combat 1911 magazines, 3 of them. These are widely regarded as the best aftermarket 1911 magazines out there (http://www.brownells.com/magazines/handgun-magazines/magazines/1911-officer-45acp-wilson-rogers-magazines-prod71718.aspx).

Info about the pistol: ""The 1911 Compact RCS is quite possibly the quintessential concealed carry 1911. The RCS comes from the SIG SAUER Custom Shop and has been put through the SIG Anti-Snag treatment which our gunsmiths developed to radically dehorn a pistol. The RCS comes with low profile night sights, checkered front strap (25-lpi), checkered mainspring housing (20-lpi) and slim profile grips. Each of these 7+1 capacity RCS model 1911 pistols feature a stainless steel slide, alloy frame, match grade barrel, hammer/sear set and trigger. The slides and frames are machined to exacting tolerances and hand-fitted to insure reliability and performance.""

It has a 4.2"" barrel similar to a Colt Commander 1911. As mentioned in the manufacturer blurb above, it has night sights already on it. It will accept either 7 or 8 round magazines (which you probably already know if you're looking for a 1911). It came with 2 Sig magazines, so you would get 5 magazines total including the 3 Wilson Combat mags. The pistol and the mags are worth $550, so the holsters are essentially being thrown in for free. The gun shoots perfectly, has tight fitment, and is very easy to carry."

964,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3805964,For Sale:  REMINGTON ROLLING BLOCK,"Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States",$ 780,"Listed On: Friday, December 12, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"From my personal collection, a very early Remington rolling block rifle with features only present on the first 600 or so ""series 1870"" rifles produced. According to Marcot's excellent reference book, this rifle is part of a very small number of sporting rifles made up from military receivers with round tops. This round top variation ended at around serial number 1400. These are early variations/forerunners to the #1 rolling block sporting rifle for which Remington became famous. Related early features are the long lower tang that extends well beyond the upper tang, no barrel markings or externally marked serial number, earliest military-type patent markings on the upper tang, rounded receiver pins (instead of flat on the right side of the receiver), hand filed thumb piece and shield impressed hammer typical of this early serial range, early ""4th type"" Series 1870 buttplate with a distinct antique ""kentucky rifle"" design, and finally a heavy military type trigger guard only found on these very scarce early guns. In addition to those features, it has two features that are unique to approximately the first 600 rifles produced. First, it has the earliest plain smooth/rounded contour forend cap. Guns after this serial range have a distinct schnabel contour. Second, it has the very early ""dished"" breech block (see photo #34), that was eliminated by Remington some time after serial number 588 according to Marcot, and no longer dished. Other interesting features include a sight setup that Remington called ""extra sights"" - a Remington ""combination"" rear barrel mounted sight and combination Beach front sight. At some point during period of use, someone removed the rear combination barrel sight and replaced it with an early Remington sporting type sight with elevator, but the Beach sight is still intact and functional. It also has a set trigger, which became available sometime after serial number 200 according to Marcot, and is in caliber 38 Long Rimfire (these early guns were only manufactured in rimfire calibers). The serial number is only stamped internally on these early guns, under the forend on the barrel, and on the face of the stock typically. Due to a buggered forend screw (the one bad screw on the whole gun...), I was not able to remove the forend, but the serial number 503 is clear on the face of the stock, as are the early upper and lower tang assembly numbers used in this serial range. This gun came from an old time collection and had not seen the light of day for decades, and is completely untouched. Based on that and the definitive under-600 serial number range features, I will guarantee the new owner that the number under the forend will match if the forend can ever be removed. Condition is untouched, there is no doubt I am the first person to remove the buttstock from the rifle in a very long time. Bore is quite nice, especially for a working gun from the early 1870s, with some roughness in the first 8"" or so, but strong rifling. Remainder of the bore is bright and shiny with very strong lands/grooves. Mechanical function seems perfect, other than the set trigger appears to need a good cleaning - it wants to set, but slips back into the standard cocked position."
