I would love to keep it, but we need the cash more right now.
I do NOT have the original box, but I do have ALL of the paperwork that came with it.
Here is a description & a list of features:

Hit your target with the Daisy Model 880 BB Carbine Air Rifle with Scope. The forearm of this rifle features a 4 X 15 rifle scope that offers excellent precision. The rifle can shoot with BBs as well as pellets with a velocity of about 800 ft/s. The multi-pump pneumatic action further increases its performance.

The air gun is made of hollow molded wood grain stock, which makes it light yet sturdy. The steel barrel adds to its durability. The Daisy Air Rifle is ideal for beginners due to its safe cross bolt trigger block mechanism. The Daisy Model 880 BB Carbine Air Rifle with Scope is an impressive gun. It can hit targets at a distance of up to nearly 300 yards.

Daisy Model 880 BB Carbine Air Rifle with Scope:
Monte Carlo-style molded wood grain stock
Rifled steel barrel
Multi-pump pneumatic action
Maximum velocity: 800 ft/s
Maximum shooting distance: 291 yds
Uses .177 cal (4.5 mm) BBs or pellets
50-shot capacity (BBs)
Crossbolt trigger block safety
Weight: 3.1 lbs
Length: 37.6""

This fires either pellets or BBs at @ 800fps - which is very powerful for the money that I'm asking. I am also including about 330 Premium Grade .177 cal , 4.5 mm that are Daisy brand which are Zinc Plated & Ultra Smooth.
Also, I have a container of Daisy pellets - .177 cal. that are also 4.5 mm -- This air rifle can ONLY fire .177 - 4.5mm projectiles -- Anything else may jam, damage the firearm or cause injury or death!
So, the container of pellets has about 100 flat-nosed, 100 pointed-nose, and 100 hollow-pointed nose.
You are starting out with well over 600 rounds of ammunition! Do NOT overfill the BB reservoir - it only holds about 50 at a time. And remember, DO NOT OVERPUMP this air rifle! You can damage many various parts if you risk doing so. Trust me, 15 pumps will kill most small game animals with a well-placed shot!

The rear open-sight is adjustable, so the scope isn't even necessary, but if you can get it zeroed in, the scope is A LOT OF FUN to have mounted on an air rifle!

Please, do not waste my time by trying to haggle me down $5-$10 dollars. THE PRICE IS FAIR AND FIRM. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY WHAT I'M ASKING, THEN JUST GO FIND ANOTHER AIR RIFLE THAT YOU FEEL IS WORTH THE PRICE!

You can phone/text me Mark REDACTED any reasonable hour, but if you call, please leave a message because I do NOT answer the phone from unfamiliar phone numbers! You can try an alternative of REDACTED The very same rules apply for that number as well. Texting is best.
Please remember that this rifle was only fired about 10 times total! You will see how new it looks.
The price is FIRM! Mark REDACTED or REDACTED 

You CAN grab this for $40 + tax at WalMart, but then you PAY TAX & also I am throwing in over 300 BBs & @ 300 .177 caliber pellets of 3 different various engineered pellets! QUALITY ammunition and NO TAX on the rifle, nor any of the ammunition!! Not to mention 4 to 5 FULL air cartridges included!

I would prefer to meet somewhere in Lancaster or VERY close to the immediate surrounding area!

Thanks for looking!!
Any questions, please email REDACTED or text Mark at REDACTED

 This is one of my babies. This is a Stoeger Stage Coach Nickel and Black Wood Side By Side shotgun. I had this professional Made By a GunSmith in Dallas and it took me 8 Months to have made. It was lowered to 26 1/2 inches which is 1/2 inch larger than the legal limit. It was Just always a dream of mine to have a short double. It has Dual Triggers. Which can be fired at once or one at a time.

 It was professionally made by a licensed Smith.  If you look at the Buttstock it was Made Custom to fit the reduced size of the Stock. As well the Barrels were cut down, and sanded so there are no chippings or excess steel deposits. Even the Ribbing on the top of the shotgun has been perfectly mounted. The Black-Finished Hardwood, Polished Nickel Looks beautiful. 

 I fired this shotgun maybe 6 times in the life that I've had it. It has very little if not any scratches. ZERO dents or deep indentations. IT is ROCK SOLID. When you hold it you here no rattling or shaking. Its like a solid piece of steel. This is a SUPER powerful Shotgun. And I’ve never seen one like it before. Hence Why I had it Built. 

 Pretty much the Ultimate in Firepower for a home protection gun, and if you're a CowBoy action shooter this is a must. Everyone that sees it flips out, and when I've taken it to the Local Gun Shop, There are too many Oohs and ahhs. 

 Pictures don't do this justice. 

 I'm asking $575 or BEST reasonable offer.
Ill Throw in a Custom Nylon Scabbard/Case that fits it perfectly and two safe Shells so you dont damaged the firing pins!

 You MUST be a legal Texas resident and Be willing to sign a Bill of Sale.
 I'm in Plano Texas, so I can meet you in public. Please Be professional. Im a Professional Person I’d expect you to be also. Feel free to email me questions and i'll be happy to email you more pictures.

She's a sweet shooter and a powerhouse, but my hands are a bit too small for the .45 acp frame. I hate to see her go, but if you're in the market for a great, reliable CC .45 ACP then look no further, you have found it. 
Comes with original box, two 10 round mags and a box of Self Defense ammo (20 rounds).
She only has 200 rounds down the pipe and has been cleaned and lubed after the two range sessions. She has been in the safe since. Not doing any good in there, so she needs a new home. Well maintained and no signs of wear on the barrel lock up, hood of the slide or striker pin.
New these run $550-600 at most LGS you are saving a lot of money buying from me.

You must have a valid CPL and must be of legal age (21) to purchase a handgun. Trade/sale will be FTF only in a public location. I am willing to travel some, but please don't ask me to take a half of a day to travel to the D only to get to find out you've changed your mind."

I'm tempted to keep it- it's very cool- and reading the reviews it seems this is a very highly praised model- but I wasn't in the market for a high-end handgun and someone else would probably get better use out of it than I.
This is the Tactical model H&K USP in .40 S&W.  It features a match-grade adjustable trigger, suppressor-ready threaded barrel, fully adjustable sights, and more (see below).
The gun is brand new/ in the factory box/ never shot or carried, and comes with all the factory-included stuff (two 13-round magazines, lock, manual, tools, etc.).
The pic is just a google-grab; can send actual pics if needed but mine looks exactly the same.

USP Tactical
Enhanced versions of the USP, the USP Tactical models are designed for users who need the features found on the HK Mark 23, but in a more compact pistol. Both pistols approach the precision found on the Mark 23 by adding an extended threaded barrel with a rubber O-ring, adjustable trigger, and adjustable target-type sights.
The .45 ACP model of the USP Tactical is constructed on the USP45 frame. The 9 mm and .40 S&W Tactical models are built on the USP 9mm/40 caliber frame. The 9 mm variant, known as the USP9 SD, has a slightly different set of features.
Features & System Characteristics:
•Threaded O-ring barrel with polygonal bore profile (no O-ring barrel on 9 mm variants)
•High profile target sights 
•Match grade trigger (not present on 9 mm variant)
•Adjustable trigger stop (not present on 9 mm variant)
•Target sights with micrometer adjustment for windage and elevation
•One piece machined, nitro-carburized steel slide 
•Can be converted to any of nine trigger firing modes
•Patented HK recoil reduction system 
•Corrosion resistant “Hostile Environment” blued finish
•Corrosion proof fiber-reinforced polymer frame 
•Oversized trigger guard for use with gloves
•Choice of flat and extended floorplate magazines 
•Universal mounting grooves for installing accessories 
•Ambidextrous magazine release lever
•Extended slide release
•Extractor doubles as a loaded chamber indicator 
•Patented Lock-Out Safety device"

I've had this gun for about two years.  During that time I have put approximately 250-300 rounds (all brass case, factory NEW ammo) through it.  I have had Z-E-R-O fail to feed, fail to fire, or other problems.  Simply put, I haven't had a single mechanical hiccup with this gun. The gun has recently been broken down and cleaned.  There are a few VERYYYY minor scratches/dings, the worst of which are on the magazines, although the magazines have done their job 100% of the time.  

The price includes the eXplore Optics 4-16X50 scope.  I purchased the scope and the gun on the same day, and they have not been separated since. The scope has one or two ""nicks"" from use, but by and large the gun spent its time in a safe, went to the range (bench shooting), and went back in the safe.  The only known issue with the scope is the sun shade: it does not thread all the way onto the scope, but enough that it hasn't come off without first unscrewing it.  You can look at eXplore optics' website and see that I paid around $400 just for the 4-16X50 scope.  

Search on here for ""FNAR"" and see what they are going for.  My price includes FOUR mags AND a $400 scope! 

I will require a bill of sale (starting you are lawfully allow to purchase & own a rifle in Texas) for my purposes only.  Face to face transaction (CHL preferred) in the North Dallas area.

HK P2000sk V2 LEM 9mm
- Excellent condition
- Ameriglo night sights
- Two 10-round magazines (with Pearce pinky extension, and HK flat base plate)
- Box, manual, lock, extra backstrap included

Up for sale is an H&K P2000sk in excellent condition. I am reluctantly letting this one go since I already own a full-size P2000, and want to fund other purchases. Estimated rounds fired is in the 400 range. The slide looks brand new and has no holster wear. Be aware that most P2000sk on the market do not come with night sights pre-installed (~$80). Two standard magazines are included -- one with a modified Pearce pinky extension (~$10) for better shooting control/comfort; and the other with an HK flat base plate for better concealment (~$7).

Price is $745 for a FTF transaction in Northern Virginia only with bill of sale required.
This is a very fair price considering how used HKs typically go for ($800+ w/o night sights), the excellent condition, and the included extras (i.e. new slide, night sights, aftermarket base plates).

Trades I may be open to consider:
- Sig P938
- Glock 17, 19, 34 (with TSD modification only)
- Smith & Wesson M&P9 Pro Series C.O.R.E.
- Smith & Wesson J-frame snubbies (Scandium/Airweight variations only)

I have a new PWS MK107u complete upper for an AR15 pistol or Short Barrel Rifle for sale. I originally had plans to build my own pistol, however was able to find a complete POF AR pistol a few weeks later. It's only been factory test fired, but never used since it left PWS.

Piston-based AR15s are argued to run more reliably, more cooler, and more cleaner due to significantly less fouling that traditional gas impingement systems cause.

*SPF* Price is $1199 -- willing to ship within CONUS. It is your responsibility to verify that AR15 pistols or short-barreled rifles are legal in your state, in addition to complying with Federal regulations.

I mean NO TURN LINE. Not a mark. The finish by anyone's standard is 10/10. The boxes are original. I personally handled these guns minimally and only with white linen gloves. They have been stored in their factory boxes and were only put in the display case for the photo.

The MK 116 is a very nice piston driven system chambered in .223 Wylde and using the PWS proprietary piston design. This rifle has a 16"" barrel, a 13.5"" PWS keymod rail system, and the rifle weighs less than 7 lbs. As noted in the title, one of the key upgrades is the Geissele Super Dynamic Enhanced two stage trigger with a smooth 2 lb. first stage and then a crisp 1 lb. second stage. In addition to the trigger upgrade, I've added 45 degree rapid transition backup sights, a competition muzzle brake/compensator that significantly reduces muzzle rise and allows the shooter to take full advantage of the trigger for accurate rapid fire and follow-on shooting, and a 1-5x tactical scope and offset mount. 

I'm the original owner of this rifle, which was purchased in November of last year. I've shot the rifle a few times but it has had no abuse and I estimate the number of rounds fired would be no more than 500 rounds. In addition to the items discussed above, a Drago rifle case is also included with your purchase.

Please let me know if you have any questions and thanks for looking."

It provides extreme resistance to corrosion and pitting. 
It provides extreme lubricity for an incredibly smooth action.
And provides extreme reliability in all environments.
Basically said the powder residue, fingerprints and other corrosive oils on a firearm coated with NIB-X will wipe right off. Therefore protecting the firearm as well as saving you time cleaning the weapon.
Best of all it's guaranteed against flaking, chipping and most of all WEAR for lifetime.

This pistol comes in it's original form fitted box with weapon safety lock and all original paperwork even that which explains the NIB-X coating.

One such improvement is a brand new 16"" 1:7 twist DRD hammer forged chrome lined barrel that I had installed in place of the original barrel in early June (poor timing on my part but at the time I had no plans to move abroad). In any event, the rifle has been taken to the range twice since installing this new barrel with roughly 100-200 rounds having been fired.  I had originally purchased the rifle in October of 2013.  A hard case is also included with the purchase of this rifle.

Other upgrades include the Magpul UBR Stock, Magpul Pro Sights, a Fortis compensator/muzzle brake, and a Geissele Super Dynamic Enhanced Flat two-stage trigger with a smooth 2 lb. first stage and a crisp 1.5 lb. second stage (Note that the Geissele trigger is not pictured as it was just installed and the trigger shown in the pictures is a Timney). The rifle originally came with a shorter 13"" rail, but I had this replaced with a new MI Gen 2 quad rail when the new barrel was recently installed. In addition to these upgrades that greatly improve the function, accuracy, and aesthetic of the rifle, a Weaver 1-5x tactical scope with offset mount and a Sight Docter mini red-dot sight is also included. Another nice feature is the upgraded BCG which is a Titanium Boron (TiN) Bolt Carrier Group. You can see the gold coloring of this BCG in the photos and in addition to improving the look, this bcg is very tough due to this coating, quite easy to clean and maintain, and functions flawlessly. 

As I'm preparing to move abroad where I will not have any use for my weapons, I'm selling two rifles, including this one, and one 1911 handgun.
