Then I decided to change scope out to this brand new Leupold scope on it and I haven't had a chance to shoot it since. I cleaned it right after I shot it, changed scope out and put it in case. Haven't touched since. Im interested in selling it because the caliber is a bit much for what I need. It shoots great and doesn't have a mark on her. Perfect like out of box but even better because of Timney Trigger. I have $1100 in it but will take $900...No lowballs...I don't have to sale it. I have another rifle to hunt with and im willing to keep this one if I can't get $900 for it. I also still have box for gun and scope."

9C1 G2 Compact 9mm Pistol
Now, with a Fast Action trigger mechanism for the shooting enthusiast who prefers a quick short trigger pull with a drop free magazine, or the extra safe action inspired by a Double Action Only configuration with a mag-out safety, FMK Firearms has you covered either way.  This unique feature allows the shooter to choose which action they prefer without having to purchase another pistol.  The Fast Action Trigger comes standard for most States except CA and MA which come with the Double Action Only trigger.  Since the triggers are interchangeable the shooter can always purchase one of our trigger conversion kits and enjoy the features of both trigger systems.

Anther unique feature is the grip that has a rubberized backstrap. This backstrap not only effectively reduces felt recoil, it hugs and grips the palm of the shooting hand to provide a comfortable, positive grip. The result is a grip that seems to mold to the shooter’s hand, instead of having to mold your hand to fit the grip.

The 9C1 G2 is ergonomically built to comfortably fit both large and small hands.  The barrel is engineered to sit low for superior point and shoot accuracy and reduced muzzle flip, and the 9C1 G2 has virtually no external protrusions, making it ideal for concealed carry; and of course, it’s Proudly American.

Highlights for all models:

Compact Ergonomic Lightweight Design 
Interchangeable Fast Action or Double Action Only Trigger 
Snag Free Design Ideal for Concealed Carry 
Picatinny Accessory Rail 
Shock Absorbing Backstrap 
Chamber Loaded Indicator 
Engraved with or without Bill of Rights 
100% USA Made

This is a new unfired Beretta 96FS Brigadier .40 cal made in 2004.

Handgun is in as new condition with only minor handling marks, it has never been loaded or fired.

It is completely stock as purchased with OEM Beretta rubber grips, 3 dot sights, and all steel parts except for the lanyard loop.

I swapped the two original 10 round AWB mags for OEM Beretta 11 round mags made in Italy and those are in like new condition with minor handling/insertion marks.

It comes in its blue Beretta case with all the paperwork except the manual and original outer cardboard box(I lost those in a move unfortunately).

This gun is a 'Safe Queen' and I've only removed it to clean/lube and function check before putting it back in the safe.

Beretta no longer produces this model and it is highly desirable because of its heavier and thicker slide assembly.

I am asking $700 and am not looking for any trades.

If you want additional pictures please ask.

Please only serious inquiries.

Must have a valid AZ Driver License and or CCW, no exceptions.

This Taurus 605 has been upgraded with a Hogue rubber monogrip grip and includes a Fobus paddle holster and nylon leg holster. The gun does show some minor holster wear on the barrel and frame. Very good little J frame revolver for the money. All Taurus product comes with a warranty. 

Made for the very serious business of self-preservation the 605 is built to the Taurus Zero Tolerance standard in design, fabrication, fit and performance. Meaning there is simply no tolerance for parts that do not perform as if someone's life depends on them. Using the powerful .357 Magnum ammo this quick-draw revolver has plenty of muscle to back it up. Features include fixed sights, crisp single-double action trigger and a transfer bar for added safety.

They are in size 12. I ordered them based on how great the reviews are so I could not try them on first, but I need a size larger. They are $99 or more everywhere, and well worth it. I got these on a sale for $75 and I will sell them for $70 if anyone would like them to save me the trouble of returning them. If you need some awesome lightweight breathable shoes that are durable, super comfortable, and great for everything from the range to around town to hiking on the trails or in the woods, you can't go wrong with these. I am actually paying $30 more to order them in a larger size for $100. I researched it before ordering them and they are they best for the price, especially for someone that wears a 12 and can take advantage of this reduced price of only $70.

This small-framed, lightweight revolver consists of three main components: a polymer fire control housing, an aircraft quality aluminum monolithic frame, and an extensively fluted stainless steel cylinder. Each of these components give the LCR a unique advantage over traditional revolvers.

The lightweight, chemical-resistant polymer fire control housing contains the entire fire control mechanism, providing a tighter dimensional relationship of the components than if divided between a traditional grip frame and cylinder frame. The end result is that the fire control components are assembled with no hand fitting, resulting in a highly consistent product at an affordable price.

Its fall again and that means brisk mornings, falling leaves, terrorism mislabeled as workplace violence, gross incompetence by the coward in chief and his league of liberal spineless politicians but its also that time when that pesky ISIS tries to infiltrate our country.
But you dont have to worry because Im gonna let you in on a little secret, its called the ISIS EXTERMINATION UNIT chambered in 5.56.  This little baby has a 16"" Stainless Steel barrel with a 1 in 7 twist for those times when 55 grains just isnt enough. It comes with a billet Midwest Industries upper and an Aero Precision lower with all the goodies a CMMG LPK can give. It has KNS anti rotation pins and a Magpul MOE grip for solid handling.  Its 6 position collapsible stock gives it that classic styling and a Surefire Trident flash hider really gives you the nightime discretion an Old Glory lover demands.  It is also adorned with a BCM 10"" Keymod rail for all those little accessories and 2 rail sections will get you started off right.
You may be asking yourself, is the ISIS EXTERMINATION UNIT right for me.  You need only ask yourself 3 basic questions:

1)  Do I love my country?
2)  Do I want something I can recharge at most local sporting goods and Walmart stores?
3)  Do I value my life and the lives of my loved ones over a Terrorist?

If you can answer yes to any of these questions then the ISIS EXTERMINATION UNIT is for you!.  Wont you call, the owner is standing by to answer your questions.  Remember to tell them that Haji says "" it worked on me!"".."

The magazine has a 7 round capacity. The Kel-Tec P-32 is the lightest .32 Auto pistol ever made. Thanks to its locking dynamics and superior ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-32 is mainly intended for plainclothes police officers as a secondary weapon, or for concealed carry by licensed citizens. The small grip size and light trigger pull make the P-32 ideal for female shooters.
