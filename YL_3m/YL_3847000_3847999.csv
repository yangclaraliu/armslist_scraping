I won this bow at a banquet raffle in Kentucky. The only reason I'm selling it is because before I won this bow my wife purchased a New Hoyt as an early Christmas gift for me. I took this bow to Hoffman Archery and they outfitted it with the accys shown. I shot a total of 15 arrows through it at the shop and that is all the bow has seen. It sits in my closet now waiting to be purchased. It is in pristine condition and with absolutely nothing wrong with it. You are basically getting a bran new out of the box bow. 

The bow features a 28"" axle to axle, perfect for ground blinds and tree stands. This is the Black Crimson, one of Mathews custom colors. This bow will come loaded with the following accys:

Mathews Solocam 2 piece quiver
QAD drop away rest
Axion Archery stabilizer w/ 2 harmonic stabilizers inside
Wrist sling
Tru Glow 4 pin sight

Please feel free to text or email with any questions. Like I said before, I shot 15 arrows through it at Hoffman's archery shop just so they could tune it. You will not be disappointed in this biw. It's shoots fast and smooth, with a rock solid wall.

Special commemorative inscriptions are engraved and gold-gilt filled on both sides of the receiver and inlaid in the pistol grip is a Victory medal.

Very few if any of the 750 produced were available to the general public as they were sold originally to the Veterans of Foreign Wars Organization and another which presented these firearms to honored veterans. Over 30 years ago when produced these came in a glass top presentation case at a cost of $3,000. The only other one currently for sale is priced at $4,000.

Drum magazines and other accessories are available from Auto Ordnance which if you are not aware is who developed and built the Thompson sub-machine gun originally. They built these WWII presentation guns to the same specifications in a semi-auto configuration. Price is $1,500 cash or partial trade and cash. New price excludes sling. Real beauty & history.

The unique, tri prong design swirls hot gases immediately as they exit the muzzle, extinguishing the flame to eliminate the visible flash. Built for hard use, the prongs are precision machined from steel then Melonite coated to increase durability. Melonite also makes cleaning easy, because carbon fouling does not adhere as well to the coating as it does other finishes. The design is engineered to eliminate the annoying “ping” often associated with this configuration.

The non-symmetrical design does not need to be timed, making installation simple and hassle free, no crush or peel washers are necessary. No special tools are required either. Flats machined at the rear of Flash Hider will accommodate a number of wrench styles that are readily available.  Flats are 0.75 across and the OD of the piece at the prongs is 0.85.......

Too small for my heavy barreled bolt gun, but would be a nice addition to the slimmer AR- platform barrels.  This is NOT a muzzle brake for recoil reduction, and has never been mounted on a barrel. No trades at this time, and thanks for looking."

I am being repeatedly harassed by guys from a forum called ""fal files"" most of them are not even in this state, yet they apparently have no lives so they feel it is their responsibility to email me constantly and call me a liar and a con man and all other manner of gibberish. those are the type that give all good and honest gun owners a bad image and a bad name. so regardless of their constant bombardment I am keeping this listed. I am not trying to misrepresent anything, i have right here in the ad what is stamped on the rifle. they keep telling me this rifle is not a springfield, yet is says springfield right on it so....but whatever...ALL FAL's are parts guns actually, every one of them. most just don't have springfield receivers and so I imagine none of this headache. see the pics, this is the price, if you are interested contact me, if you are only interested in harassment then don't.

I won this bow at a banquet raffle in Kentucky. The only reason I'm selling it is because before I won this bow my wife purchased a New Hoyt as an early Christmas gift for me. I took this bow to Hoffman Archery and they outfitted it with the accys shown. I shot a total of 15 arrows through it at the shop and that is all the bow has seen. It sits in my closet now waiting to be purchased. It is in pristine condition and with absolutely nothing wrong with it. You are basically getting a bran new out of the box bow. 

The bow features a 28"" axle to axle, perfect for ground blinds and tree stands. This is the Black Crimson, one of Mathews custom colors. This bow will come loaded with the following accys:

Mathews Solocam 2 piece quiver
QAD drop away rest
Axion Archery stabilizer w/ 2 harmonic stabilizers inside
Wrist sling
Tru Glow 4 pin sight

Please feel free to text or email with any questions. Like I said before, I shot 15 arrows through it at Hoffman's archery shop just so they could tune it. You will not be disappointed in this biw. It's shoots fast and smooth, with a rock solid wall.

The famous Winchester Model 1912 pump shotgun was designed by Winchester's Thomas C. Johnson. Introduced in 20 gauge in 1912, 16 and 12 gauge guns followed in 1914. From its debut until the end of the 1950's, the Winchester Model 1912 was the pump shotgun, long known as ""the perfect repeater."" After 1919, the model designation was shortened to ""Model 12,"" but the gun remained the same. Oh, sure, Ithaca, Stevens and Remington guns had their fans, but it was Winchester's Model 12 that dominated both the market and the public consciousness for decades. However, by the beginning of the 1960's, the times were a changin', to paraphrase Bob Dylan.
This is a awesome example of a model 12 i will take in trade a FN 5.7 pretty much is it unless you make me a handgun desl i couldnt refuse cash is king.

This is why the pre-64s are so sought after especially when you have a Georgia Peach this sweet my 12 boasts the 28 inch barrel, Full Choke, beutifull wood no scatches or knicks, the finish has been well kept and the blueing is phenomanal.
I have never held a Model 12 in my hand that is over 50 years old almost 60 years old and looks and feels as if it was just made. This with out a doubt a safe queen the bore and action are spotless and tight there are no flaws or no suprises when looking/getting this gun in your hands this is the Winchester of a lifetime and will be a prize in anyones collection. The SN# is 150XXXX Which dates it at 1954/55 production right inbetween there, sorry this is a NO TRADE SALE, I will ship to FFL one must be provided to me before i ship and i will only accept a POSTAL MONEY ORDER if your out of state no exceptions.

Models 422 and 2206. The 422 was Aluminum frame and available in blue or brushed silver. These pistols were 22LR, ten round magazine and available in 4-1/2 inch and 6-1/2 or 7 inch. The 2206 was all stainless steel.  
I am looking for a 2206 , preferably with 4-1/2 inch barrel although I would consider the longer barrel.  These pistols were lightweight, compact, and accurate.
I am willing to possibly purchase a 422 but the 422 was not as durable as the 2206

This one is particular in that it does not have any import marks.
I've checked on the barrel, under the stock, and around the trunnion and I don't see any sort of import marking. The previous owner I bought it off said that he got it as a bringback, unfortunately there isn't any paperwork to authenticate that so it's just a theory, but it's still interesting to see an unmarked Russian SKS. 

It shoots flawlessly.

Before Marlin started making the Guide Gun, however, Alaska gunsmiths were shortening the barrel on the 1895 lever action. The shortened rifle was great medicine for use on irritated bears in the wild. The compact firearm could pump out lead as quickly as a guide could work the lever--thus, the guide gun was born. This is one of those early conversions. The rifle itself is a pre-1998 Marlin 1895 in .45-70. The barrel has been professionally shortened. 

The whole thing is pre-Remington, pre-safety (just use the half-cock notch on the hammer), and pre-cheapening. It has the classic Marlin pistol-grip configuration and the Marlin bullseye in the walnut stock. This carbine has been carried some, but shot very little. It's a great piece to carry on a trek through the woods or to throw in the canoe on a camping trip. Call it insurance when sharing the woods with critters."

I've been looking for an FNX-45 Tactical and have run across a few scammers here on ArmsList.  Although I've reported/flagged them as scams, they're still listed here, so I figured I'd actually list the ones I've come across:

This guy is selling a BRAND NEW FNX-45 for $200 below retail cost.  He's in Florida and asks for payment right away.  When I asked for a photo with his name, phone, or email in the photo he sent numerous emails telling me he had no time for games, yet he had no time to snap a quick photo before I sent him close to $1000 for a handgun.  

http://www.armslist.com/posts/3730410/florida-handguns-for-sale--brand-new-f-n-pistols--45-acp-pistols

This guy claims his wife is sick and he needs the money for medical bills.  So he's selling an FNX-45 with an RMR.  Total value of $1,500 all for $880!  What a deal!  However, I did a Google Image search and found the photos were taken from another site here:

https://www.ar15.com/archive/topic.html?b=7&f=88&t=1335420

and here:
http://www.theoutdoorstrader.com/threads/721633-Item-Gone!-FS-FDE-FNX-45-Tactical-w-RM07-Trijicon-RMR

When confronted with this information he sent me his driver's license, told me he used to be a cop, etc...I have his name, address, phone, email, etc...Asked for money immediately be sent, Money Order ONLY!!  He normally responds within minutes to my texts and emails, but I asked for a photo with his name, phone, or email in the photo and I've heard nothing for over 8 hours.

http://www.armslist.com/posts/3768142/minnesota-handguns-for-sale--fnx-45-tactical-in-fde-with-trijicon-rm07-rmr

Then I found this ad, for the same gun (different RMR), but exact same city and state.  Coincidence?  I think not.

BE AWARE! BE AWARE! I got suckered into trying to buy cheap priced S&W 500 magnum ammo from these douche bags !! We attempted two different one (1) box orders to check out the ammo. Neither transaction was processed. They send a ""Thank you for your order. You will receive a confirmation email within one hour"" message after you click on the ""submit"" button. We never received a confirmation email! Nothing was ever processed and no charges were charged against either credit card we used. 

But two days later, each credit card was fraudulently used by ""someone"" to attempt a minor ""ping charge"" at an on-line site called ""Racing Junk"" for $20.00. Neither of the owners of the credit cards placed the orders with Racing Junk, but the transaction history of both cards involved only overlaps with the transactions TO GLOBAL AMMO SUPPLY!! 

YOU BE THE JUDGE! BEING DESPERATE FOR CHEAP PRICED AMMO FOR THE BAD A-- 500 MAGNUM, I IGNORED ALL THE RED FLAGS ON THIS ONLINE SITE!

92A1: Legendary 92 Reliability with Ultra-Modern Tactical Features

The ""A1"" class is a specialized tactical branch of the most tested and trusted military and personal defense weapon in history: the 92FS. We started with the super-reliable 92, keeping the engineering characteristics that make it so accurate, safe and dependable; then, we added some features prized by today’s most demanding tactical shooters as well as by those wanting the absolute best for home defense or personal protection. The result is the 92A1, a pistol that is as reliable for its intended use as it is safe and user-friendly even for the novice.

Easy Accessorization and Maintenance

The most noticeable difference between the classic 92FS and the 92A1 is that this comes with an integral Picatinny rail situated in front of the trigger guard. The rail makes it easy to attach a variety of tactical accessories, including lighting systems and laser aiming devices. Also, the 92A1 has a removable front sight, meaning that you can exchange it in a matter of minutes without any gunsmithing or alteration to the pistol. Maintenance is easy thanks to the tool-free disassembly latch as well as the captive recoil-spring unit.

Impressive Firepower, Extra-Durable Magazines

Another feature that will impress you about the 92A1 is the type of magazine it comes with. This pistol comes with three 17-round magazines designed to deliver remarkable firepower out of the box while being absolutely durable and corrosion resistant. Furthermore, the magazines on the 92A1 feature a “dirt rail” along their length, which helps collect dust and grit out of the magazine while keeping cartridges clear of the magazine walls. The result: enhanced feeding reliability and super-easy magazine maintenance. In addition, the magazine well is aggressively beveled, making it super-fast to change magazines without taking your eyes off the target.

Absolutely Reliable, Designed to Last

The base design of the 92A1 is the 92FS or M9, the pistol that has served the US military admirably throughout its campaigns in the world’s toughest environments. But even in this respect, Beretta never rests on its laurels. This pistol incorporates an innovative internal frame buffer that greatly reduces component stress under firing (yes, even with hot +P ammo), making it even more durable and smooth-shooting. The best of both worlds, the 92A1 offers discriminating shooters the classic overall look and feel of the 92 (including the more traditional rounded trigger-guard) with today’s most advanced tactical features."
