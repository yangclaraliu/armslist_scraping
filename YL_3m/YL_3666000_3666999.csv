I am primarily looking to trade the pistol for a pistol in a more manageable caliber (such as 9mm), but will take $450 cash for everything as pictured.

Since only one image can be posted, more info and images on request.  Price is with 2 correct magazines for each gun, but additional are available.  Neither gun uses the later OSP and GSP magazines, but can ""adapt to them"".  The GSP shown also will accept  custom 10 rd magazine.

For NH residents, personal transfer with either NH permit and or state residency and confirmed validity of paperwork from your local police department.  Please note, in some localities, both of these guns may be classified as an assault weapon.  Both generally are considered ""legal exempt"" in CA, and legal in MA and MD.  Some towns and states have specific rules about these guns that do not recognize their use as olympic competition guns, and categorize them as assault weapons that are not exempt from ban.

Accuracy is the same as any other GSP of the era. The first version OSP is much more accurate than the later OSP 2000

Other GSP, black oxide finish, available $600-1400 range, and OSP in the 800-1000 range.

Selected two boxes at random, all rounds fired.  Ammo has been stored in sealed ammo cans, with desiccant, since removed from sealed factory box in the 60's.  

This is never fired brass ammo, so it should be good for several reloadings.

I have 34 boxes left to sell.  That's 612 rounds, and 102 clips (if the factory didn't leave any clips out - I did have one box, a while back, that had 6 loose rounds).  I'll include one of the .50 cal ammo cans, holding 24 of the boxes.  I'm keeping the other can, so the other 10 boxes will be delivered in a plain ol' cardboard box.

If you look around the interwebs, you'll find the clips alone would sell for about what I'm asking for all this, and the ammo is all but non-existent.  I'm selling it to help people out, since it's almost impossible to find this ammo, and I have more than I'll ever shoot.  I don't need to sell it.  I don't have to sell it.  I'm not playing games with people.  If you want it, say so, make an appointment, and show up.  

The price is firm.

If it needs to be shipped, shipping charges will be approximated and will need to be included in the payment.  

Cash or postal money order only.  No PayPal or Square (they forbid using their services for ammo, and I've been screwed by unscrupulous buyers on PayPal before).  No checks (too many rubber checks out there).  No cashier's checks (too many scams with fake ones).

I will travel as far as Oak Ridge, Andersonville, Lake City/Rocky Top, or along Clinton Hwy. to meet and exchange the ammo for the cash.  

Clips will work with 6.5mm or 7.35mm ammo - so if you just need the clips, buy it all, strip out the clips, and resell the ammo."

I have a Ruger LC9 for sale. The gun is like new (no scratches or wear). I'm the second the owner (that I'm aware of), and have only put maybe 30 rounds through it. I'm not sure how much the original owner shot it, but judging by the condition I'd say it was very little.

Includes two magazines (with extensions), a zippered soft case, a holster, rubber grip, and the original box and paperwork (though the manual seems to be missing).

I'm asking $275 for everything, and you can contact me (Cameron) at REDACTED or by email at REDACTED. I'm located near Sheridan and 36, but I can meet you within a reasonable distance."

Prefer cash for best price on my gun. I can throw in some hollow points for the right deal.

My email and text number are below as this sights emailing doesnt work often.

I got this gun in a multi gun trade from original owner, has Sig Night Sights, Holster, lock, one extended mag, original carry box and papers.  I have this same model in 9mm and in .380 and dont need another right now.  They are awesome carry guns for men or women and fit great in small and medium hands, but with ext mag, still work for most large handed individuals.  My mom who is a senior and has arthritic hands actually carries same model too as the trigger pull is minimal and it has a safety thats easy to disengage.

Was told it was unfired but carried.  It is in great condition and I think they probably fired a few rounds through it to test it out but not completely sure.  I have not fired it but it functions perfectly otherwise.

Send all reasonable cash offers.

Must meet publically in or near Clermont which is just west of Orlando, near Winter Garden, Leesburg, Davenport, or Hwy 27 and I-4 If interested in trading then read all below so we dont waste our time.

I would consider trades plus cash or trade straight up or possibly add a gun or guns,  ammo or extras for the right AR in .308, I cant add cash.

I don't need anything so I'd be trading at what I could buy your gun new or used from the lowest priced listings on slickguns, CDNN, classic firearms or J&G when they are in stock, dont need anything full retail, craze inflated or BPS or Gander pricing.

I would prefer to buy things with my cash so I have the initial warranty but if its the right deal, I am willing to work on my guns price too, but since I prefer cash deal, its really going to have to be a trade I really want thats in great shape or new.

Send me a pic if you have a trade and make me an offer. Don't ask what I'd take as I'm not negotiating with myself. I need to see what you have and  condition and what it's worth to you. I don't want to be offensive so it's easier if you tell me what your offer is and I can just say yes or no. 

As for trades, I'm really looking for a Sig 716, DPMS REPR or SASS, Colt, DPMS Recon or Recon 2, POF, BRO, or similar price ranges $1000-$2000.....Will consider most ar's in .308, with no front post and Upper and lowers must be same manufacturer. Only factory built.  Must be new or like new.  I can add one or two guns for right deal, ammo or possibly extras.  I am not looking for one at MSRP, looking for a good to great price. Decent quality optics are a plus. Obviously I would love an LWRC or HK but I cant afford those, so please keep that in mind.

Also possibly interested in new or like new AK's prefer pistol plus cash, possibly rifle if even trade.  I would consider Zastava m92 PAP  (I know they are out of stock in some places, but they pop up weekly under $500 and I can wait)  others i'd consider if not canted  CAI Centurion 39 ,  Yugo M70AB,  Yugo Zastava NPAP,  CAI Centurion 39 Tactical AK, Draco or Mini Draco ....... No wasrs, not interested in saigas even though I know they can be great and arsenals are out of my price range.

Only handguns I want are new or like new .......Glock 19 Gen 4, possibly a 23, FDE/OD are plus..........  Or Gen 3 19/23 in FDE/OD,  Glock 30s, possibly Gen 4 21......no stippling please   (stock glocks are $475-515 new all over and low $400's used, so please dont tell me yours is worth $600)  Also might consider LCR if under $400 plus cash, prefer .357 but open to .38

No junk, old stuff, collectibles, cowboy, military, vintage, builds, shotguns or  hunting rifles Non felon, 21 minimum, DL and bill of sale  required. 

I will try to post my other guns I have for sale/trade today or tomorrow.  Sig Tacops 1911 threaded barrel $1025, Spikes Ar 5.56 $950, possibly Glock 27 with lots of extras $600, Spikes .300 aac in FDE $1350, possibly Mossy Tactical 12ga with lots of extras $500  all prices are asking prices assuming every one will negotiate, so I can be fair if others are with me.

Springfield Armory's Custom Shop listened to pro shooters like 5-Time World Champion Rob Leatham to advance the design of its polymer pistols for competition use. The result is a handgun with improved accuracy, lessened recoil, faster shot recovery and greater sight radius of its newly enhanced performance. The difference was achieved in the details. Fiber optic front sights allow for a faster sight acquisition for faster follow up shots. Adjustable sights allow the shooter to regulate his sights to any load combination. The Lightening cut in the slide reduces reciprocating mass which allows for faster cycling and allows a larger variety of loads to be used.

Product Description

Carbon fiber is well-suited to the tough tasks assigned to cleaning rods. It combines the best features of stainless steel and coated cleaning rods, then adds valuable properties of its own. Stainless steel rods can scratch or wear barrels if they're used carelessly - though they won't pick up potentially damaging small abrasive particles. ""Coated"" rods get part of the job done - they keep the stainless steel shaft from damaging your barrel's rifling, but the coating will pick up small abrasive particles, which means you're effectively running finegrit sandpaper through your bore. Carbon fiber rods are the best of both: the carbon fiber can't scratch your bore like stainless steel, and they won't embed like coated rods. Plus, Carbon Fiber rods can be bent to an extreme degree and return to their original straightness. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, US military armorers called on Tipton to provide cleaning rods that would clean service rifles in demanding conditions. It made sense to us: Carbon fiber is an ideal material for cleaning rods. We call these cleaning rods ""deluxe"" because they feature an ergonomically designed handle that spins on two sets of ball bearings - the result is a cleaning rod that smoothly follows the rifling both pushing and pulling, even while under pressure. The ""shank-through"" construction also allows the user to apply ""reasonable"" hammer blows to the end of the cleaning rod to get a tight patch through a bore. Available in four diameters and six lengths to fit most rifles, pistols, and shotguns. Rifle and handgun rods are threaded for 8-32 accessories, except 17 caliber and 20 caliber rods which are threaded 5-40. Shotgun rods are threaded 5/16""-27.
Hang hole for easy storage. Also allows for reasonable hammer blows to clear a stubborn patch.
Two sets of high quality bearings that won’t bind under pressure and allows the shaft to follow the rifling.
Comfortable ergonomic shape. Handle remains fixed in your hand while the shaft rotates on the bearings to follow rifling.
Shank-through construction for working tight patches.
Carbon fiber shaft won’t embed particles that could damage your rifle bore.

The Daniel Defense adjustable buttstock is constructed of a proprietary blend of glass infused polymers and finished off with soft touch rubber overmolding in strategic points.  The new buttstock is precision formed for mil-spec receiver extensions to have very little forward or lateral play that is so common in many other buttstocks.  This eliminates the need for a tensioning device or friction lock.  All of this results in a durable buttstock that will give the shooter a comfortable and repeatable cheek weld and unprecedented control of the firearm.  The buttstock can be run with one of two included buttpads or without any buttpad at all to custom fit the rifle to whatever gear the operator must wear.  The buttpads come in two sizes: a thicker convex shape (0.8”), and a thinner concave shape (0.5”); designed to keep from snagging when shouldering the rifle.  Limited rotation QD swivel attachment points are integrated on both sides of the buttstock for ambidextrous sling connection.

* FN Manufacturing 1:7 twist, hammer-forged, double chrome-lined barrel with M249 rifling profile for long life and exceptional accuracy 

* Cerro Forge keyhole upper receiver

* Forward placed, reversible/ambidextrous charging handle - Simple design allows the operator to keep his or her strong hand on the firearm and use the other hand to clear the rifle. Ambidextrous handle detaches easily without special tools and returns to locked position once used. It folds forward, recessed, and easily swings back out in a single motion. Non-reciprocating handle only engages when the operator charges or clears. 

* Patented ejection port dust wiper on carrier (See Below) 

* Gas piston system with multi-position regulator - (Patent # REDACTED8) A gas-driven piston incorporated into the upper half of the forward rail system never touches the barrel. 

* Free-floating barrel - for increased accuracy 

* Two-piece keyed 7075 quad rail system - not 6061 

* Tool-less field strip design 


ADCOR patented their Full Auto BCG's exclusively. They have a special, one of a kind dust plate that keeps the inside of the AR's clean, even with the dust cover open. The spring-loaded dust shield mounted on the bolt carrier allows the bolt carrier to return to ready position; the port dust wiper moves into the ejection port opening flush with the inside geometry of the upper receiver. Withstands temperature extremes because of the highly durable, self-lubricating polymer shield. 

In 2010, H.P. Laboratories ran the ADCOR AR's through a torture test that included being submerged in water, buried in sand and 6,000 rounds were fired in 120 round cycles, and the guns were lubricated and allowed to cool after 600 round intervals. During the tests, no parts had to be replaced and there were no jams, stoppages, or malfunctions of any kind. Following this, the B.E.A.R. was able to shoot a .88 MOA group at 100 yards with 69-grain match ammo. 

B.E.A.R. (Brown Enhanced Automatic Rifle) models from Adcor Defense feature a patent-bearing, gas piston system with a free-floating barrel for increased accuracy. This is due to the piston's incorporation into the upper half of the forward rail system - so it never touches the barrel. Extremely close machine tolerances eliminate the need for piston rings. With a tool-less field strip design, a B.E.A.R. requires nothing more than a firing pin to disassemble, yet remains strong. The piston's cyclical rate for a controlled rate of fire adjusts with a turn of the gas plug located in the front piston assembly. Because diminished heat reaches the upper, hot gases and carbon particulates are prevented from entering the receiver, lubricant lasts longer and maintenance is simplified. Due to superior design, the B.E.A.R. has no carrier tilt and low fouling of the chamber and action. 

Trade for LR-308 upper (preferably piston model) with 20"" or larger barrel +/- cash if necessary. I can also ship and receive through my local gunshop, if preferred.

The chassis is in perfect condition, I recently removed it from a Springfield M1A Scout/Squad.  The chassis considerably improved the accuracy of the rifle.  I chose to return it to the factory stock because it is my large game rifle,  the chassis makes the rifle heavier (I am old), and the aluminum chassis froze my hands off (I am getting soft also) on winter hunts.

I purchased it in 2010, I've kept it very clean and oiled. It is in great condition. I've got around 350 rounds though it. Mostly trap/skeet.

This gun is an excellent choice for hunting and home defense!

It originally came with a 26"" smooth bore vent ribbed barrel with a modified choke installed, but I bought an 18"" smooth bore barrel for home defense.

Here is what comes with it:
- both smoothbore barrels 26"" and 18""
- aftermarket green fiber optic front sight
- 6 round receiver side saddle (not installed, because the forend wraps around the receiver when the bolt is open, thus interfering with the side saddle. All that is needed to fit the side saddle is to either cut the forend so there is room for the saddle, or buy a new tactical forend that doesn't wrap around the receiver when the slide is back.
- nylon shotshell stock saddle
- sling stud end cap (and the stock one)
- Allen carrying case
- choke wrench
- hunting 2 round inhibitor
- gun lock

I need a good home for her.

I'm asking $420, it's a fair price when you include the accessories. I've got about $480 invested in it total."

AR-50A1 .50 BMG, BLACK 

Item Number: 50A1B

This rifle is the newest incarnation of the wildly popular AR-50 chambered for the powerful 50 BMG cartridge. A single shot bolt action rifle featuring a unique octagonal receiver bedded down into a V-shaped stock. Designed to be an economical answer for the challenges of long range shooting, the AR-50A1 is amazingly accurate and with its massive fluted muzzle brake, it has a very gentle recoil. The AR-50A1 is a highly refined rifle which is a stark and refreshing difference that maintains its superiority over its competition. 

ArmaLite's great .50 has been refined, with smoother action, attractive new bolt stop, and even greater strength than the original AR-50.  The same great accuracy, but now even more Beautiful.

I've had a lot of people wanting to trade, I am open to anything including guns, cars, boats, gold, silver, whatever. But I'm not going to trade for a shotgun. Some people just don't think. I am willing to trade for a equal value and it must be something that I need or can sell. I am not even going to respond to those who don't understand that a two hundred dollar shot gun is not something I will trade for."

The 6.5x52 Carcano round is powerful and accurate with similar performance to the 6.5x55 Swedish Mauser round. 

The M41 is an improvement of the original Model of 1891. It's somewhat shorter yet still full rifle length. It's built stronger and has much improved sights. It's began production in 1941 and continued to near the wars end. Almost immediately after the war some of the issued M41's were sent back to the arsenal and underwent a full reconditioning for export and this rifle is one of those.

It's in superior condition. The blued steel finish is at least 98%, and the wood is excellent as well with only the most minor of handling marks. Bore is in great shape and everything functions as it should. There are only two numbers on the rifle (barrel/receiver and stock) and they both match. The bolt is not numbered and this isn't unusual at all with Carcanos. When you look at this rifle it basically appears new, and I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better example.

Rifle comes with a scarce and original leather sling in excellent shape as well as an original lead oiler bottle and Carcano screwdriver tool.

Then there is a bayonet in excellent condition. Finally there are 2 brass Carcano clips and 18 rounds of original Italian wartime production ammo.

Bottom line is that this is a wonderful collectible that you can take out and have some fun with. You'll certainly get some looks and probably a few questions from curious onlookers out at the range since M41's just aren't seen that often.

Price $475.00 with pickup in the Brandon area. I won't ship as it's just too much trouble to do so today. Buyer must be at least 18 years old and a Florida resident.

This rifle has been spray painted, if that is a dealbreaker for you you are missing out on an accurate, smooth, reliable rifle. Paint is easily stripped with acetone.
Runs steel and brass great.
This rifle's barrel is made my FN manufacturing in SC. FN is famous for quality barrels and makes the M16, M4 and M249 for DoD.
For those unfamiliar with Sprinco, a standard action spring must be replaced every 5-10K rounds. The Sprinco is rated at 750k+ and will easily last the life of the gun. The XP buffer spring and BCM XP extractor spring make this weapon obscenely reliable.

Approx 2k rounds down the pipe. Worn in and smooth but lots of life left.

Am willing to sell up to five (5) magazines with rifle for $8 each. Would all be reputable GI or Magpul. In good condition. May or may not be painted.

The barrels are short chambered in 308. They are F54 heavy contour from Midway, but were removed off display guns. They will need to be fitted to these actions and cleaned up, blued or coated. 

I already did most of the hard work for you on the actions. The actions are in great shape with no rust, corrosion or pitting. Good quality Mauser actions are starting to dry up and prices are really starting to increase. 

I’m asking $699 OBO for the pair or I’ll trade for a nice light weight 20 gauge semi-auto shotgun (Rem 1100 or similar) or towards a Poly Tech or Springfield M1A or a for a bolt action rifle in 223 or 300 Blackout.
