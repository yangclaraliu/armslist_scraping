I am trying to downsize my Collection - No Trades please.
I figure the best way to handle this is you tell me what caliber you're interested in and I'll tell you if I have anything in that caliber.
You could also tell me what you've got to spend and I can tell you what I've got in that area of price as well.
Since only three pictures are allowed, I'll send other pics upon request.
Thanks for looking."

The rifle is dead on accurate and in good condition Only draw back is that it does not have the original stock or dust guard (not my doing),  It has the 26 inside the triangle, (if youd really like me to take it apart for a picture of it just ask, the stock blocks it) http://www.yooperj.com/SKS-1.htm (scroll down to sino soviet) 

I'll also throw in the red dot sight although its not great quality.

 The Russians gave the machines, materials, and engineers  to the Chinese, to show them how to make SKSs. There weren't many made, and they were made to be quality rifles (trying to impress the Chinese). Many collectors consider them among the best sks'a made (along side East German sks's that were made for show parades).

Me:

I forgot to ask you about price, any flexibility in your price? I only have $1000.


Amanda Peron:

Excuse me! didn't you see the price there before you bid for the guns? the price is fixed, i think i better sell the guns to someone else. Thanks bye


Amanda Peron:

Are you paying $1000 for the rifle alone or both the rifle and the pistol?


Me:

I can only offer you $1000 because my dog has cancer, and the medical bills are getting too much for me to pay. I need both of the guns for my Ranger deployment, but can only pay the $1000. I will accept my fate, but was hoping you would understand the need to save money for my dogs cancer. Can you do it? God Bless.


Amanda Peron:

I am sorry to hear about your Dog but will you pay me the balance later? and when?


Me:

I cannot afford to pay the balance, could you cut me a break? $1000 is still alot of money. I would also be willing to change my dogs name to Amanda. Even though it is a male dog, I am sure he will get use to it since you would be doing both of us a huge favor. Is this okay? I will go to the post office right now and get the money and send it to you with a tracking number.


Amanda Peron:

Ok, i will accept that because of the cancer of your dog. Let me know when the payment has been made, i will go ship to your FFL dealer address and also provide you with the tracking number after the payment has been confirmed.

The solidly constructed M3020 shotgun will more than fulfill your hunting needs. It’s the perfect choice for waterfowl, wild turkey, and upland game. For reliability and performance, no other semi-auto in its price range compares to the rugged, practical M3000.

At the heart of the Stoeger M3020 is the proven Inertia Driven operating system; simple and efficient with only three moving parts in the bolt for lightning-fast, reliable operation. Unlike older gas-system guns, the M3020’s Inertia Driven action is contained primarily within the receiver; giving the Stoeger M3020 a better more centered balance and swing. With no propellant gas venting into the action, the M3020 stays cleaner longer.

This Stoeger M3020's 28"" barrel is fitted with a ventilated, stepped rib and fiber-optic front sight for quick target acquisition, even under low-light hunting conditions. Three choke tubes, IC, M, and XFT, are included.

The M41A uses an electronic pulse action to fire, controlled directly from the trigger. The internal mechanism, including the rotating breech, is mounted on free-floating rails within a carbon-fiber jacket and the entire assembly is recoil dampened to reduce the effects of muzzle climb during burst and fully-automatic fire.[1] Even so, the weapon's recoil is fairly significant.[4] A thumb selector allows the firer to switch between selective, four-round burst or fully automatic firing modes.[1] In the event of a stoppage, a manual cocking handle on the right hand side of the receiver allows the user to check for rounds in the chamber or clear the breech in the event of a stoppage. The standard M41A ammunition magazine stores 99 rounds in a 'U' bend conveyor. Rounds are fed mechanically into the weapon's rotating breech.[1] While the magazine weighs 1.5 kg when fully loaded,[3] standard practice is to only fill it to 95% capacity (95 rounds) to prevent jamming.[1]

The M41A usually mounts the underbarrel U1 Grenade Launcher,[5] comprising a barrel, breech and four-round internal magazine, fired using a trigger just in front of the rifle magazine, the housing for which doubles as a grip during grenade firing. While this launcher was integral to initial versions of the rifle, later models (specifically the M41A MK2) featured a modular system that allowed the launcher to be swapped out for a different unit at the user's discretion.[6] Grenades must be hand-loaded into the launcher's four-round magazine, which are then loaded into the breech and primed to fire from a pump action."

It shoots 7,62x39, will gladly go through the crappiest of surplus ammo. The difference between this rifle and the AK is that its a little lighter and smaller. It's striker fired and the way bolt is designed allows it to be loaded from the top by stripper clips. I use SKS stripper clips if I do that.

The rail on it is from North Eastern Arms. Gives it a slick look and allows you to mount tactical crap on the sides. I modified an AKARA grip adapter to fit and you can use any AR pistol grip on it. I wrapped the stock in paracord to give it a cool lookm some cushion and a little more space for your cheek to line up with the irons. It also has an extended magazine release, I forgot who made it, but it's high quality.

I've shot about 700 rounds since I've owned it. 

It will come with the rifle (with what I described on it), a magpul sling, and 9 magazines. 

Will do a bill of sale when sold.

The Walther PPK is the 1911 of the .380ACP Family.  Bond, James Bond...... That's right, the Walther PPK is the pistol made famous by the Welsh spy.  This is a stunning looking gun.....really a work of mechanical art.  The heavy sturdy frame significantly reduces the infamous .380 snap experienced on other guns.  The extended beavertail prevents any web rash and the gun feels great in the hand.  It holds naturally in the hand and is extremely accurate out to 15 meters. This is a must for the Walther collector and for those looking for a low recoil beautiful CC handgun.

The following is information from the Browing website on this unique firearm: 
Limited Distribution Firearms (Non-Cataloged)
The Browning firearms within this classification are from a unique, special category of firearms which may not appear in current or past Browning catalogs.

These firearms are commissioned on a special build basis by dealers.
These special firearms are unique variations or revivals of previously produced Browning models, often with special engravings, limited numbers, unique dimensions, uncommon finishes, higher wood grades and types, etc.
All are Factory Browning's. These are special firearms and are almost always in very limited quantities with special design features and are available for a short period of time. Be assured that each gun listed is an official Browning firearm produced in the same factories as the regular catalog line of Browning products.

1878 was the year John Moses Browning at age 23 designed a falling-block single shot rifle and the following year he was granted a patent for his design. This design was later purchased by Winchester Repeating Arms Company in 1883 and became the legendary Winchester Model 1885.

Browning reintroduced a limited production run of this famed B78 rifle and is offering it in many modern sporting cartridges.

Up for trade/sale is a 1957 and a 1958 (both with ORIGINAL FINISH) 4 digit serial # Colt Python. The '58 shows a fair amount of wear in bluing and handling marks. Both come with full checkered stocks, hollow barrel underlug, and have excellent lock-up and timing. '57 Python shows MINIMAL bluing wear for its age and handling marks consistent with age and use.

As stated, this is a deluxe and has beautiful deluxe wood. Equipped with rifle style butt. Wood is nice fitting with orig varnish. Now more about Sheriff Hodge. Engraved on the left side of the gun is "" Sheriff Bob Hodge Seattle 1910"". A little research on Sheriff Hodge shows that he was quite a controversial figure in early politics in the Seattle area. He had aspirations to be a politician and made a lot of enemies. He was a very colorful figure who was arrested once and released almost immediately. He sought re-election and won. The people loved him but opposing politicians didn't. This gun is a wonderful condition gun that would add to any collection and has an interesting history.

I am asking for $1400 OBO. I will trade for an AK in 5.45x39 with 6 mags. Id like a bulgarian one please."

This scope was purchased brand new as part of Burris' package with the P.E.P.R. mount and Fastfire III. HOWEVER, this bid is only for the XTR 1-4x24 scope. I plan to keep the reflex sight and scope mount. NOTHING AT ALL is wrong with this scope. This is the Gen. 2 model after the first recall. The Gen. 1 models were manufactured from 2010 - 2011. This was purchased 6 months ago. I am only attempting to sell it because I want a higher magnification. I paid over $800 for the package. I do not need to sell this so please don't try to low ball me. This scope will come with the original packaging, box, dust cover, and battery. This is an amazing deal for this quality of scope! I live in Cottondale, and work in Panama City, so I could meet you within those general facinities. If you are out of this area, I can ship the scope after I have received payment.

 This gun has been used and spent its life in a holster. But the last 50 years it has been in a safe.  

 31xxx serial number tells me it was shipped in 1937 according to my research.

 It is not stamped with ""Property Of US"" However  the early training models for WW2 soldiers were not stamped.

 It does have finish wear but not too bad. Still a presentable piece.
