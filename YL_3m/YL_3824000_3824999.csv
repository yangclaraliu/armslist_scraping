Back and better than ever, these shotguns have the same nostalgic appearance as the classic A5 with state-of-the-art internals. The recoil-operated Kinematic Drive™ cycling system is impervious to temperature, moisture and grime. It’s so reliable, in fact, that Browning backs these guns with an incredible 100,000-round, five-year guarantee.

 All loads – from the heaviest waterfowl shells down to 7/8-oz. trap rounds – cycle interchangeably and without modification to the gun. The aluminum humpback receiver gives these guns the same legendary A5 feel you’re used to without the heavy weight, improving balance and speeding up target acquisition. Revolutionary Invector-DS™ choke tubes and Vector Pro™ lengthened forcing cones provide superior pattern density and uniformity. 

Kick is reduced by Inflex II recoil pads. Included spacers adjust length of pull up to 0.75"". Textured grips keep your hands from slipping. Flat, ventilated rib. 3"" chamber. 30 inch barrel. Three Invector-DS choke tubes and hard case included.

I believe this one was made in the 60s. It's all steel and wood. The forend is corn cob styled. The barrel I wanna say is 26 or 28 inches and has a compensated polychoke. These were made by the Noble company (Model 40NA) for Montgomery Wards (The Department Store). It'll shoot 2 3/4 loads and shorter.

The Five-seveN is a refined variation of its predecessor, the Five-seveN IOM. It features a more traditional-style trigger guard, reversible magazine release, magazine disconnect, and a highly-textured grip that enhances its handling characteristics. The Five-seveN has set a new benchmark in autoloading handgun performance. The polymer frame and slide cover help to create an incredibly light and easily maintained pistol with very low recoil to allow for rapid and accurate follow-up shots. The hammer-forged barrel has a hard chrome bore finish giving it a 20,000-round service life. The Five-seveN pistol comes standard with three 10- or 20-round magazines, hard case and a cleaning kit."

382,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3824382,For Sale:  Colt M1901 Army Double Action Revolver,"North Huntsville, Huntsville, Alabama",$ 750,"Listed On: Wednesday, December 17, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"US Army Issue Colt M1901 Army Double Action Revolver
The Colt 1901 was a slightly modified version of the Colt 1892 ""New Army and Navy"" revolver.  The first model in this early DA revolver was the Model 1889 ""New Navy"" which went through several modifications, including the Models 1892, 1994, 1896, 1901, and finally the 1903. These were the first swing-out cylinder double action revolvers ever made, and Colt revolutionized revolvers with the new design. S&W wouldn't get their first swing-out DA on the market until 1896. These pistols were forerunners of all the Colt DA revolvers that followed, and the basic design was made up until the Colt Python was discontinued in 2004. These early series guns were discontinued in 1907, with about 291,000 produced for all models. The US Army and Navy bought large quantities of these revolvers in the now obsolete .38 Long Colt cartridge. It was this design Colt and the .38 Long cartridge that failed in the Philippines and led to the adoption of the Model 1911 .45 Automatic. This is a genuine US Army issue M1901 US military model, as evidenced by the markings on the butt, grips and frame. The grips are the original smooth walnut grip with the inspector stamp of RAC on each side. RAC were the initials of Rinaldo A. Carr the civilian government employed sub-inspector at Colt, between 1890 to 1903. The frame is also stamped RAC and L.E.B. The initials L .E.B. belonging
to one Leroy E. Briggs, an Army Captain that inspected revolvers rebuilt and refurbished at Remington's Bridgeport plant between 1898 to 1917. The bottom of the butt is perfectly marked ""U.S.ARMY MODEL 1901."" and ""No 157271."" The serial number indicates it was manufactured and delivered to the US Army in 1901. The round barrel is clearly marked with two line Colt address and patent dates ending with “March 5, 95”. The barrel and
frame have 90% original blue finish with some thinning and patina to the backstrap and front strap. Dull blue finish remains on the rear surfaces of the hammer with about 50% remaining on the trigger. Action works perfectly and appears to be still in time. The walnut grips are smooth and in very good condition, although one front corner is missing a small chip. A swivel lanyard strap is on the butt of the pistol. Overall condition is very good. Will ship to your FFL, buyer pays shipping. This gun is priced to sell at the low end of the 2011 gun values guide and often sell for considerably larger sums."

What makes this rifle extra special is that it was made in a short run of these that werent made with a serial number on them (somtime in the 1930's). This increases its desirability to collectors and value by quite a bit. No dros or ffl transfer is necessary for this gem. Cash and carry ( this is just about the only scenario you can still do this) 
This Rifle isnt just a safe queen or a wall hanger ,, if youre looking for a perfect shooting .22 bolt this will fit the bill and definitely last many generations to come.

 was quoted by a collector this thing could easily go for 500-600$ for this run of the model 69a and its condition. So send me fair trades with pics!

I prefer a trade, but offer!  Must meet face to face in Orange county,CA!

What makes this one rare is that it is a 1st variation Walter P38 made in 1941 which is only the second year of production.  This was the standard issue handgun to German officers in WWII.  All Nazi markings are still in tact and have not been peened or removed.  Nice Nazi P38 pistols in 9mm Luger are getting hard to find that haven't been messed with.  The wet shine in the pictures is simply gun oil on the pistol that can be wiped off.  This is a Russian captured P38 with forced match serials.  Very nice near mint condition.

NOTE:  This is chambered for .17 Mach2, not 17 HMR.  This revolver will not chamber or fire 17 HMR or 22 LR.  Will only fire .17 Mach 2 ammo and 22 short blanks. Please do not attempt to fire a 22 short slug through a 17 cylinder."

Basically I have done everything you can think of in regard to performance with this rig. The action is smooth as butter, extremely tight and snappy in 99% condition plus. I've only put 40 rounds down the range with the “TANK” as I don’t get out much and I have too many firearms to lug down there already. Don’t take my word for it, please do research and price all the parts, accessories, and ammo I have listed.

Price is $1650 obo, I am also willing to accept partial trade plus cash difference on buyers end for any quality S.S. or two-tone finished 1911 in the commander size or smaller preferably a sr1911 CMD. As Usual buyer Must have an AZ DL or AZ ID and be legal to own a firearm. I will supply a bill of sale and would be happy to answer any and all questions you may have, just simply email me at REDACTED.  Thank you for looking, god bless and be safe out there."

This rifle was originally owned by an older gentleman who was more of a collector than a shooter. He shot this gun only a few times before I bought it from him. I have owned this gun for three years only shooting it to sight in before deer hunting, in which it was not shot during any season. I put the paint on and it looks pretty cool but can be repainted or removed very easily. The scope is only a year old and is awesome. Its 20x fixed power with mil dots on the cross hairs giving it a sniper rifle feel while being perfectly useable on deer, elk, or similar. I have put a lot into this gun but would certainly sell for less than asking price if its going to some one who will use it.

The design is made to allow for one holster for both IWB & OWB, user reversible. This allows for one holster for many different forms of carry.  All holsters include a lifetime warranty for everything including wear.

The holster is made from a .093 thermoplastic/kydex front and a double sided, heavyweight leather back hand stitched together using the strongest stitch possible (saddle stitch) with a waxed braided cord, much thicker and stronger than normal thread.  The leather is treated to be water resistant and the edges are hand finished using a beeswax mixture to seal the edges and keep them smooth.  The design allows for the comfort of leather while maintaining shape and maximum retention.

In addition, we'll be offering a shoulder holster rig in the future that utilizes the same holster as well as an ankle rig kit doing the same for those that are small enough. We also offer a car mount version and hope to soon offer one with with a quick release to allow for the holster to be easily removed and placed back on for IWB/OWB.

Info/Specs
The Beretta Storm family was launched in 2003 with the Cx4 pistol-caliber carbine. This innovative product is accurate, soft shooting and easy to accessorize. Today’s shooter demands a gun that can accept a large assortment of accessories, and the Cx4 meets the challenge. A retractable Picatinny rail extends from the fore-end for mounting tactical lights. Picatinny rails can be mounted on either side (one side rail included) or bottom of the fore-end for lasers or forward grips. A full length aluminum top rail is included for mounting your optics. This light and compact gun also features a unique patented design that allows the user to reverse ejection and extraction with no special tools or additional parts. Combined with the reversible safety and magazine buttons, the Cx4 is the ideal solution for left-handed shooters. Length-of-pull can be adjusted with the addition and removal of ½” spacers (one included). 


The Cx4 accepts the Beretta family of pistol magazines in various capacities.

Chamber is in the white and the barrel Mesurements are extremely good. It has the original IHC stock as well. Not one part on it isn't IHC. This doesn't look to be a forced match or re finished rifle in any way. It shows honest wear that you would want to see in a collector grade Garand. You can't build this rifle cheaper out of a collection of parts. Especially getting this kind of finish match. This IHC is the real deal and a must have for your complete collection. I'm asking 2200.00 for this rifle. I will consider some trades. M1 Garand trades prefered towards this one. This is exactly what I would be looking for. A nice shooter with a tight barrel chamber in the white, clean crisp receiver stamp, good overall finish, nice tight lock up with the trigger group. I'm not looking for a correct Garand. Would also prefer a 65 Springfield Barrel or tight LMR barrel but not limited to that. I am in NO way in the market for a re welded or weld repaired receiver! I don't sell them so I won't buy them. I will also be completely honest in my assessment of your trade. I value what I'm looking for at 800.00 with one exception. I will give more towards a IHC mix master so long as it meets what I'm looking for. Absolutely no part on a IHC trade needs to be IHC except the receiver. Just don't come to the table expecting top of the mark. If you value what I'm looking for in trade more than that, let's talk. If that seems harsh I apologize, but I'll just buy it from the CMP as a special otherwise. I'm located in Dupage County IL and can ship to your ffl insured for a flat fee of 45.00 inside the continental US. The shipping is what it is because of the amount of insurance I would take out on this rifle. It WILL be shipped in a hard case very well packed. I'll answer any questions you have as long as it isn't what's your best price, your looking at it."

I ORDERED IT TEN YEARS AGO THROUGH AEROMARINE IN 0BIRMINGHAM, AL.  THE INTERIOR WAS CUSTOM MADE 0TO MY SPECS.  THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE INTERIOR IS DESIGNED TO 12 GUNS IN INDIVIDUAL HOLDERS.  THE RIGHT SIDE 0IS SHELVING, FOUR, FOR ANY ITEMS THAT YOU WANT SECURED.  THE INTERIOR IS BUILT OF 1"" PLYWOOD AND IS FULLY LINED WITH COMMERCIAL GRADE PILE CARPET WHICH IS TAN IN COLOR.  THIS A LARGE AND VERY HEAVY SAFE.  AMSEC IS STILL THE LARGEST MAKER OF SAFES AND VAULTS IN THE COUNTRY.  THEY STILL MAKE THE MODEL I AM SELLING.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE NEWER ONES IS THE OPENING LEVER.  THE NEW ONES HAVE A WHEEL OPENER AND MINE IS A STAINLESS STEEL LEVER.  BOTH WORK THE SAME THEY JUST LOOK DIFFERENT.  ACCORDING TO AEROMARINE, MY SAFE IS AMONG THE MOST SECURE SAFE MADE BY AMSEC.  THE DOOR IS SECURED BY TEN 1"" TUNGSTEN STEEL RODS.  3 ON EACH SIDE AND 2 ON THE TOP AND BOTTOM.  THESE RODS RETRACT WHEN THE LEVER IS TURNED.  INSIDE THE 1"" RODS ARE SMALLER STEEL RODS ON BALL BEARINGS.  IT WOULD BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR A SAW OR GRINDER TO REACH THEM, BUT IF A SAW BLADE OR GRINDER REACH THE RODS, THE SMALLER RODS SPIN WHEN TOUCHED BY A SAW BLADE OR GRINDER MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CUT THROUGH THEM.  THE SAFE HAS A COMPLEX 4 DIGIT COMBINATION DIAL LOCKING SYSTEM.  ENTERING THE SEQUENCE AND COMBINATION IS COMPLEX, BUT A LITTLE PRACTICE YOU'LL GET IT AND BE ABLE TO OPEN IN A SNAP. I CONSULTED A PRO LOCKSMITH AND HIS OPINION WAS THAT ONLY COULD A PRO SAFE CRACKER WITH SPECIAL EQUIPMENT COULD FIGURE OUT THE COMBINATION.  HE ALSO SAID THAT A GOOD LOCKSMITH COULD CHANGE CHANGED IF THE DOOR WAS OPENED FOR HIM.  I DON'T KNOW THE EXACT WEIGHT, BUT WHEN IT WAS DELIVERED TO MY HOUSE IT TOOK THREE MEN WITH A STRAP HAND TRUCK.  THEY FIRST REMOVED THE LIFT OFF DOOR AND MOVED THE BODY AND DOOR SEPERATELY.  THE BUYER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MOVING IT.  THE EXTERIOR IS DARK GRAY IN COLOR.  THERE ISN'T A SRATCH OR SIGNS OF WEAR INSIDE OR OUT."

This will allow me to buy the R15 on here for 1500 cash. I know this bushy I have was built at the Ilion NY Remington plant and is virtually the same thing as the Remington R15 450, except this has the 16"" barrel and the factory threaded Izzy Brake and the Remington is Camo, 18"" and button crowned. I just can't see wrecking a factory spec rifle and paying more money only to bring down the value of the rifle because the original finish was painted over. Its a big no-no with coin and guns. Factory finish is always best. So, if anyone has a Remington camo r15 .450 bushmaster in 18"" to swap even for this harder to find factory complete Bushmaster , let's talk. I mean this was bought as a complete rifle, not a upper slapped on a mismatched lower. I'm not looking for other trades, because I have a fortune wrapped up in boxes of Hornady ammo, as well as factory 450 mags, even though you can use the typical .223 mags and change the follower, but the springs are weaker and they are not stamped .450. Thanks and God Bless. I don't mind traveling to trade. Face to Face, will not ship to your FFL, sorry. REDACTED
Round count on this carbine is 10rds and only ever fired factory Hornady loads. This is the good thing about a 450 and 458, is that you know the rd counts will be low and usually top brand ammo, unlike the other ar15 and ar10s out there.
Also consider a .358 Hoosier rifle package with much extra .358 Hoosier ammunition."

The most durable shotgun on the planet. Born of the gunmaking expertise that brought you the best-selling, most trusted shotgun of all time, the Model 870, the Model 887 Nitro Mag is an armor-clad warrior here to carry the torch of our great pump-gun legacy through the most extreme conditions on earth.

Our exclusive ArmorLokt™process seals the receiver and barrel in a vault of weather-impervious synthetic armor that's both completely rustproof and tough as nails. Similar to the Model 870, it's receiver is crafted of solid steel and the barrel is hammer forged to last a lifetime. Twin steel action bars ensure smooth, positive chambering and ejection. And the sleek receiver design, awesome balance and natural pointing characteristics spell trouble for any bird within reach of its 12-gauge 3 1/2"" Super Magnum capability. The extremely rugged synthetic stock and fore-end are ergonomically contoured to offer a positive grip and comfortable handling. Swivel studs are built-in.

The Model 887 Nitro Mag Tactical combines supreme toughness and dependability with a handy 18 1/2"" barrel, a 2-shot magazine extension and a barrel clamp with integral Picatinny rails for mounting your flashlight or other accessories. It also includes a ported, extended tactical Rem™ Choke and receiver mounted on Picatinny rail.
