I've shot 60 rounds through it exactly. It retails on buds for $315, but after shipping, taxes, and FFL it runs for closer to $400. The 783 is a new model that came out in 2013. It is not built like the POS 770's, but rather a slight step down from the 700. Everything is solid, fits like a glove. I've owned both and I prefer my 783 over the 700, you just can't modify it that much like a 700. Selling this to pay for college. Going to borrow a buddies rifle for this season. She's lightweight and the synthetic stock will help with scratches when out in the woods. I know a company makes special wood stocks for the 783 for around $80. Sling swivels and one stud installed for the bi pod.

The 783 uses a barrel nut and free float barrel. The bolt is butter, low profile so it doesn't interfere with any scope. Leopold scope already sold so don't ask if I can throw in a optic, don't have one. This is an amazing rifle and was blowing the center out of the targets at 100 yards no problem. Comes with detachable 5 round factory mag. 

Package Includes: 

Remington 700 front scope bases (what the 783 uses): Price ~$10

Leopold rings: Price ~$20

 sling, sling swivels, sling stud installed (for bi pod): Price ~$30

 UTG bi pod (8-12in, slight panning l-r) spring loaded legs and locking wheels to set height where you want it/level shooting on uneven ground. sling swivel stud/pic rail mount adapters: Price ~$45

 1 box remington core lokt 150 grain and 1 box 180 grain: Price ~$40-50

 116 rounds mil surp 30.06 CORROSIVE ammo on stripper clips+old bandoleers (fires fine, shot 20 rounds. Just need to clean rifle well after. The don't feed super well out of the mag like factory ammo, but still feed non the less. No FTF or FTE. This gun is so simple to clean, takes about 5 min) : Price .50/round ~$58 

50 rounds of lake city stamped '53 armor piercing rounds: $50 -firm

Remington 700 rear bases x2 and second sling swivel stud (uninstalled): FREE

Retail it runs ~$625 for everything. Prices listed are around retail since it is all brand new. 60 round count I would consider new. I will not piece out anything except the ammo, and you would have to come to me in Gig Harbor. I will travel to sell the whole package. Shot it 2 times. 30 rounds each time. Cleaned her after each as well. She is babied but I need to pay tuition. Asking $500 firm for the rifle and everything. No trades. I am the original and only owner."

I bought both of these last year and have all of the paperwork on those purchases. The Mustang was bought brand new and I've been to the range 6 times with it. Perfect, small incredibly fun and accurate with the laser sight. There was a problem with the laser site and I sent it back to Lasermax, they sent me a new one and haven't installed it yet.

The Colt MK IV is used for Bullseye competition. I bought this through gunbroker.com last fall after a competitor had made a number of improvements to it (trigger job, Burris rapid fire). The Clark Custom weighted barrel was installed sometime previous to this owner. I do not have the original box, only the paperwork for the Burris Rapidfire and the invoices for all of the work the previous owner had done to it - along with the phone numbers of the gunsmith. It's all legit. 

My interest in bullseye is waning and I don't figure on using this incredibly accurate gun.  Stunning actually. If you are interested in supreme accuracy, this is the gun for you!

These are the good Beretta's that are more desireable.  This gun is in great condition with a little wear showing on the outside of the barrel from the slide.  Nothing more than what would be expected.  I would rate this gun at about 95%.  The previous owner colored the rear sight dots white, which was a common thing to do to this model.  They were originally red, but I haven't tried to take the white off, as it may come off easily.  The INOX Model is a SS model with an alloy frame which makes this gun a little more valuable.  It is also an earlier Italian model prior to the warning being printed on the frame, so it is a cleaner looking piecel.  These usually go for about $770-$850  on the net.

Very nice, 1970's bow, 52 inch with 50 pound draw. It also has a removable three arrow quiver, with three correct aluminum arrows and broadheads.  I will try to accommodate you to meet locally at a convenient time to see it with no obligation. I have owned it since the mid 1980's, and I got it from the original owner. The limbs are straight, no twist in them, and the bow has always been stored unstrung. I believe that the string could be re-wrapped a little, waxed, and you could go shooting, but it has not been shot in years. This bow has never been wet, never rained on since I have had it. It is dirty/dusty, and I haven't bothered to clean it up.

It currently does not function correctly (stuck case in the chamger requiring a cleaning rod to remove every few rounds), I suspect a headspace problem.  I had red jacket firearms of TV fame build this rifle for me and even after a trip back for warranty repairs (and a YEAR wait--in addition to the 18 months to originally build it) it still does not function correctly.  This rifle is being sold for parts.  I am also selling my collection of magazines, parts and ammo for the rifle.  I want to put this money into my AR-15 SBR and am tired of messing with FALs.  On to the rifle:

This rifle was built on a virgin Argentine 21” barrel standard FAL kit.  I had the barrel shortened to 18” and had 14-1 LH threads lathe cut on the muzzle.  The rifle was then built up using top-quality DSA Paratrooper conversion parts including the trigger housing (lower receiver), sand-cut bolt carrier and folding stock.  The rifle was finally gun-kote finished in a matte greyish black finish.  Other notable features include:
•	18” chrome lined mil-spec barrel with lathe-cut 14-1 LH muzzle threads for installation of popular AK-47 type muzzle devices and suppressors
•	DSA PARA conversion parts, including rugged aluminum standard length of pull folding stock and sand cut bolt carrier
•	DSA extended scope mount (replaces standard PARA dust cover) with captive type PARA recoil spring.  This type of spring allows easy disassembly for cleaning, excellent reliability and can be removed without the use of tools.
•	Accessory rail mounted at 10 o’clock location on handguard
•	 Coonan “upper” receiver
•	Gunkote corrosion resistant and self-lubricating coating
•	Folding L1A1 style rear sight.  Allows for easy use of optics.
•	“A2” type flash hider

The rifle also comes with a vast array of accessories, tools and parts:
•	No less than TWENTY high quality military surplus 20 round magazines
•	 TWENTY spare mil-surp magazine springs, unissued and still in light cosmoline
•	All original parts left over from PARA conversion so rifle can be easily returned to fixed stock configuration (stock, bolt carrier, lower receiver, top cover etc.)

•	Front sight tool
•	Gas regulator adjustment tool
•	Spare complete military surplus bolt

This package also comes with 600 rounds of DAG surplus german 7.62x51 (147gr FMJBT) in battle packs and 900 rounds of russian steel case ammo (150 grain) in plastic bags and commercial boxes.  19 of the magazines are loaded with either DAG surplus or prvi partisan 7.62x51 (147 grain FMJBT).  

This rifle has only had about 200 rounds through it and is zeroed at 25 yards.  It is in excellent condition with only light handling marks.   ALL THIS can be yours for $1700 in cash.  This represents significant savings over all these parts, mags and ammo if purchased individually."

Read below for manufacturers specs:

The Daniel Defense MK18 Complete AR-15 Pistol Upper Assembly is a faithful recreation of the US Navy's Mk18 Mod 1 platform, and features a Premium 10.3"" Cold Hammer Forged Barrel made from Mil-Spec 4150 Chrome-Moly Vanadium Steel that is Chrome Lined for durability and corrosion resistance. M4 feed ramps are incorporated into the barrel extension and upper to enhance reliable feeding, while a true 5.56x45 NATO chamber ensures that both commercial and higher pressure surplus mil-spec ammunition may be safely used.

It is is set up for First Person View piloting. Stick a Go pro camera in it and fly it around. I will use my GoPro for a demo flight for anyone with cash in hand. You need to have your own or purchase one.

This is not a cheap set up. There are a lot of those out there. This has more range, more durability, and the best parts you can buy. Everything is tested and functions perfectly. No issues at all.

This has all the best FPV components that money can buy. Fat Shark Dominator goggles. Immersion RC 5.8 GHZ receiver and 600mw transmitter. Blue Beam antennae set. Two fat shark goggle batteries(one battery gets over 6 hours of flight time). Will include one factory DJI battery plus 3 turnigy 2200 Li-po's. RC drones carbon fiber props are on it right now. I will include 8 fully balanced stock props. All cables are included. I'm including a carbon fiber mount to install two batteries.

Flight time is 15 minutes at slow speed I always fly for 10 and return. Check youtube for awesome phatom FPV videos. I have a few of mine I can upload somewhere if you really need to view. The Phantom has around 2 hours of flight time on it without testing. It's in perfect shape and has never been crashed. The battery door has a small slit in it for the FPV cable or the dual battery set up. New doors are a few bucks.

The range in an open area is far. I know I have gotten it around 2000 feet away. The return to home software works perfectly as I had it tested once.

It all comes in a waterproof tool case. The foam is just rough cut but you can see everything fits in there great. Just pick up the handle and go anywhere you want. I have over 2K into everything.

I will accept partial trades but really need some cash. I will consider trades for firearms or motorcycles. Email with any questions I'm easy to deal with."

Below of the Manufacturers Specs and Description

The Daniel Defense MK18 Complete AR-15 Pistol Upper Assembly is a faithful recreation of the US Navy's Mk18 Mod 1 platform, and features a Premium 10.3"" Cold Hammer Forged Barrel made from Mil-Spec 4150 Chrome-Moly Vanadium Steel that is Chrome Lined for durability and corrosion resistance. M4 feed ramps are incorporated into the barrel extension and upper to enhance reliable feeding, while a true 5.56x45 NATO chamber ensures that both commercial and higher pressure surplus mil-spec ammunition may be safely used. The bolt and carrier both pass a thorough Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) test for guaranteed structural integrity, and the gas key is properly staked to its mil-spec bolt carrier. All steel parts feature a heavy Mil-Spec Phosphate finish for superior corrosion resistance and durability, while aluminum parts are Type III Hard Coat Anodized. 

This upper comes equipped with a 9.5"" Flat Dark Earth RIS II Mk18 Quad-Rail Handguard that covers a pinned, low profile gas block at the carbine gas port position and Free Floats the barrel for increased accuracy potential.

Complete with charging handle assembly and Daniel Defense Flash Hider, the MK18 upper is ready to drop onto any pistol or registered SBR small pin lower receiver.

I shot it to sight it in and it has been in the safe since. It is being sold as new fired. The bipod , rings , and scope do not go with it. I am selling with it 1 box of hornaday subsonics premium ammo and approx 150-200 brass once fired most of which were from my ar. They may have a slight dent in them from the ejection but should not cause any issues if reloaded. I DO NOT WANT TO TRADE FOR A PISTOL PLEASE DONT ASK. the gun is one that I am sad to let go but could use the money for kids going back to school. I do have the original box and papers. The bases are included."

If you are unfamiliar with the M1a Socom series, They are essentially semi automatic, versions of the M14 with a 16"" barrel. It is chambered in .308(7.62NATO) and uses a gas operated piston to cycle the bolt. This is a solid rifle, with a renown for durability, and in some form or another, military service that continues to this day.  I am the second owner, however the rifle is in excellent condition. This Socom is currently seated tightly in a beautiful USGI walnut stock including well preserved stamps. The sling is a simple woven Nylon rifle sling.  I will also be throwing in the stock I bought it in; a chopped down factory synthetic plasti-welded to a Butler Creek folding shot gun base. It's remarkably stable, but ugly as all get out and frankly, not my first choice. Also included in the cost are Three(3) Springfield Armory 20 round box magazines.  I greatly enjoy this rifle, but I need to free up space in my safe.  $1400, but I'd be happy to negotiate under the consideration of the following trade bellow. Text Dugan @ REDACTED.

That being said this is not your grandpappy's 10/22. This is a lean, mean, squirrel poppin', panty droppin' 10/22 worthy of the likes of; Chuck Norris, Steven Segal, Bruce Willis and the like. This baby started life in the Sturm, Ruger & Co. factory based in Newport, NH. This sucker wasn't always as bad@$$ as it is now, NO NO. She was originally one of the few MARPAT versions seldomly seen in the wild. Now you'd better not lean it against a tree or she might just up and disappear on you! Thanks to the good people at Krylon ® She's now sporting a fresh new look. This beast comes with a 10 round rotary magazine, a 25 round Butler Creek, hot lips magazine, and 100 Federal 40 Gr. .22 LR cal. gun batteries! *include request for additional ammo in your message* This rifle is not for the faint of heart. You will need to carry a big stick to chase away all the people who will want to bask in the glow of it's presence."

I am selling this gun because I'm saving up for other hobbies and have other Glocks/9mm pistols

I'm looking into getting a new pistol so although I don't really need/want to sell it this will help fund that.

This gun operates flawlessly although it does have wear after years of being handled and used. Here is a little bit of information about the firearm

This is a full size semi-automatic pistol in .45 ACP. fantastic stopping power yet still quite accurate, it has a 5 inch barrel,3 dot fixed sights and xenoy wrap around grips (i also have a set of Houge Rubber Grips).
The gun accepts 8 round box magazines which i have 3 of (2 of which are brand new).

Like most 3rd generation Smith and Wesson semi automatic pistols, the 4506 features a combination safety lever and decocker mounted on the slide, a plunger type firing pin safety, a magazine disconnect and a pin mounted, pivoting spring actuated external extractor.
