This is a high quality bow with some good gear that goes with it. It has pretty much all you need to get started right. This a light, powerful, and somewhat compact bow and a 70 pound draw is a lot of weight, however, this is an easy bow to grow into. It is pretty dang fast right now at 315-310 FPS, not too shabby. It can be tuned down to 55#. It is in VERY nice condition. These are known to be good bows and have NO or little negative opinions on them as far as quality, performance and shootablity. More and more you see Martin showing up in "" favorite"" bow or "" best bow of all time"" lists or polls.

Scope has Leupold sun shade & Leupold flip up end caps that bend all the way over and lay flat on the scope when fully open.

Extremely accurate rifle.  I shoot HSM 168gr Berger Hunting VLD with it & have it zeroed dead on at 200 yards.  With the CDS dial you simply laser your target with a rangefinder that has the angle algorithm, dial the top turret to the nearest 10yds to a max of 810 yds, & squeeze the trigger.  More accurate method than using a non-caliber specific BDC reticle for a holdover shot.  Rifle is 6lbs 13oz, scope is 15.1oz so less than 8lbs before ammo, scope rings, & rifle sling.  Condition is like new, no scratches.  I was anal with the barrel break-in, cleaning the barrel after each round for the first 10rds, then after every second round for the next 30 over a couple more trips to the range.  I have put no more than 160rds through it.  I know this because I save the brass in the boxes."

If you want something that is all decked out and ready for whatever, this is it. Can't go wrong with an Russian AK which is now banned from importation.  I've done whatever I can with it but sadly it just sits in the safe starving to get fed with the Slidefire Bumpstock.  So I'm putting this up and see what happens. Not in a rush to sell so no low ball offers. Open to trades but it must be really interesting and firearms related. Asking $2,000 for the complete set up. Will not separate anything, it's a complete package. This thing is still unfired except from factory."

The one thing I wanted to add was his new muzzle break, that didnt come out till about two years ago. The action on this rifle is like butter. The trigger is incredible! This is a battle rifle and even though they are expensive you can feel the difference. This rifle isnt for the guy who shots once a year. Thats why I am selling it.

The KSG (Kel-Tec Shotgun) is Kel-Tec CNC’s first entry into the shotgun market. The size, shape, and design is similar to the currently available Kel-Tec RFB rifle, but the KSG ejects downward, instead of forward. The KSG weighs 6.9 lbs. and is as compact as legally possible with a 26.1” overall length and an 18.5” cylinder bore barrel. Even with this compact size, the internal dual tube magazines hold an impressive 12 rounds of 12 gauge 3” rounds in total (6 per tube). It can also reliably shoot shells as short as 1 3/4"" up to the 3"".
This simple and reliable pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. The feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard.
The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.
The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Google ""MK4B Ruger""... very interesting info.
A factory manufactured Ruger MkII in a 4"" bull barrel. Excellent condition and only made between 1985 and 1987. The 4"" Bull then became the Lipsey Ruger later. Most MkII bulls were 4.5"" or Longer. 22/45 had a 4"" bull but was noticeably different with aluminum/steel barrel (mk2 is ALL steel).
comes with manuals, OEM silver case and 2 mags.
Literally in perfect condition. I put 100rds through it and the previous owner was my Dad who never fired it due to having a tapered barrel model he always shot. Interesting link below

NO TRADES. Price is FIRM

Lipsey’s, a large firearms distributor in Louisiana, is now selling a compact, easy-packing version of the Ruger Bisley Super Blackhawk. This Lipsey’s Exclusive revolver is built primarily of stainless steel. The sixgun is chambered for the 44 Magnum cartridge, and being a Ruger Super, it can handle any 44 Magnum load on the market, as well as any 44 Magnum handload that is listed in reputable handloading manuals. The Lipsey's 44 Bisley Super wears a three and three-quarters inch (3.75”) barrel, and has a button-head base pin, giving the ejector a sufficient stroke and allowing for the easy removal of the cylinder without having to remove the ejector rod housing. The sixgun has the Bisley features which make it easier to shoot; Bisley grip, lower sculpted Bisley hammer, and curved Bisley trigger. All of these features make the revolver more comfortable to use, compared to the original Super Blackhawk parts.

Not the hybrid model but a 100% parts copy of a Hi Power. Comes with an aftermarket adjustable rear sight (a $100 value), an extra 32 round extended magazine and a set of Pachmyr wraparound rubber grips that I just remembered I had. Also include an extra set of wood grips and a +2 extension for one of the magazines, giving it a 17 round capacity. In the interest of full disclosure, the slide stop is broken in front of the barrel link pin, but doesn't effect the function of the gun. It's a cosmetic problem, not a functional one. Replacement slide stops run about $25 if you feel the need to replace it or leave it as is and the gun still works. Basically it's a clone that functions the same as the Browning Hi Power, uses all the same magazines and parts, but for half the price. So  you won't mind throwing it in the car like you might your more expensive Hi Power, but still have the same shooting platform. $340 OBO.  FTF with MS residents."

As new including everything that this came with originally- bolt carrier, shortened buffer tube, buffer spring and sliding stock.  Greatly shortens overall length of your AR while closed and looks cool as heck.  As far as I am aware this will fit any lower (do your due diligence though) but it will not work with piston driven uppers.  This rare piece has been mounted but never fired.  I'll grab some real pics later.

It's a good holster, but just not what I'm looking for. I have never worn it outside of my house so its pretty much brand new. 
It is made to fit a Smith and Wesson M&P Shield both 9mm and .40. It has a full guard, and is made for a right handed shooter. 
Its a pretty versatile holster, but in my opinion it excels at appendix carry. 

I bought it for 70 plus shipping and a 6 week waiting period as the company made it. 
I think 65 is a fair price as it is practically brand new and you won't have to pay for shipping or wait for eternity. Don't lowball me ill just ignore you.

-gen 4 g23 plus another gun (lcp, s&w 642, m&p, mossberg 590 a1 with 18.5"" barrel only, etc)
-gen 4 g23 plus an aimpoint pro
-also interested in the following-DLC kahr pm9, mossberg 18.5"" 590 a1, glock 42, I'm pretty much set w/ 9mm pistols, so really only looking for a black pm9
-you can try me with other offers (no ruger pistols other than the lcp, no hunting rifles, etc.) but above is mostly what I'm in the market for. I have an additional 10rd mag ($60) and 8rd mag ($50) for the 45c that I may include for the right trade, plus ~70rds of federal hst jhps ($40).

I have my CCW and you'll need one too or an original pistol permit (I keep) plus a valid NCDL. We both get a bill of sale. FTF Southeast CLT/Mattews area only."

The BA’s modular design enables the operator to customize it to mission-specific demands by selecting from a virtually infinite selection of aftermarket accessories including buttstocks, magazines, grips, bipods and more.

The BA is the new flagship of the Savage Law Enforcement Series — built for pinpoint accuracy. The long-action version is chambered in 300 Win. Mag and the ultra-long-distance 338 Lapua. It features a Magpul PRS-G3 buttstock and an enhanced Savage muzzle brake and has the ability to reach out like no Savage we’ve ever made.

The Savage Law Enforcement Series is now the official precision rifle of the New York State Police Mobile Response Team. Every heavy contour barrel in this series is button rifled for enhanced accuracy and features a recessed target crown. There is no need to lap the bolt, because the floating bolt head ensures both lugs have full bearing on the locking surface. And the headspace on every rifle is set at absolute minimum. Standard features in this series include an oversized bolt handle that permits rapid acquisition for follow-up shots"

For those whom may not know anything about them I'll give a quick backstory. They were fabricated in Rosario, Argentina using Colt tools, with the assistance of Colt engineers for the various branches of the Argentine government. 


Now this particular example is serial number 87283 which based on the range found in a book about these claims its from ~Feb 1956. It was fabricated for use in the Air Force as branded on the side, ""Aeronautica Argentina"". Chances are it was an officer issued gun since it has a ton of holster wear. Its been very nicely worn over its almost 60 years of life. Great shape, shoots absolutely fantastically minus the occasional hammer bite  ;D . The rear sight is a bit knocked to the side, but the gun shoots straight and true. Slide and frame are matching, barrel doesn't have a number on it so I assume its unoriginal to the firearm. Comes with some plastic rosewood colored grips, though I am including the original grips to the gun. It has wear accordingly to a 58 year old firearm. Also including 2x colt 7rd mags that I got with the gun, plus 3 more colt 8rd mags. Original box, and importation manual. I am Argentine by birth so I can translate anything on the gun or answer most questions you may have about it."

I bought this gun brand new (1299.00)after I first saw it knowing it would be to big for CC purposes. The stainless steel finish with the cherry wood grips just make this gun stand out. The elite edition P220 has the extended beaver-tail. This gun is chambered in .45 acp. I put 40 rounds of SigSauer hollowpoints down the pipe just to test functionality, and put the pistol back in the case. I have a total of x4 sig sauer OEM 9 round mags, I paid $45 each ( not the cheap promag knockoffs ) I also have 3 twenty round boxes of hollow point ammo to go along with it. The pistol has original owners manual and sig sticker as well. 
I am in no means in a rush to sell this pistol, I simply am testing the waters to see what I am offered. Please don't e-mail offering junk or $800 for the gun, I know the value of what I have and I also know what fair used asking prices are.

Whether you require the quick target acquisition of a red dot or the range of a magnified optic, the second generation Dog LegTM scope rail has you covered. Mounted directly over the receiver, the patented Dog LegTM scope rail with integral dust cover provides optimal balance, generous rail space, and protects delicate optics from barrel heat. The ingeniously simple and rugged design provides a rock solid mount for accuracy and a forward hinged cover with rear cam lock design to preserve the AK’s field stripping qualities.

Taurus then kept all of the molds for all of the parts in the pistols and all of the old beretta factory workers, essentially the PT 92 is an exact replica of the Beretta 92 the exception of the size of the hole in the magazine which is why beretta magazines need to be dremmeled a little bit to work in the PT 92. You will have trouble finding a pistol of the same reliability the same high capacity magazines and the same ease of maintenance in the same price range."
