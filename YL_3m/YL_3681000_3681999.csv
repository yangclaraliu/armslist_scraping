The P-11 is a semi-automatic, locked-breech, DAO, pistol, chambered for the 9mm Luger cartridge. Ten round and optional twelve round magazines available. The Kel- Tec P-11 is compact and lightweight, thanks to its locked breech. Its ergonometry, perceived recoil and practical accuracy are comparable to much larger guns. The P-11 is especially well suited for plain-clothes police officers, security personnel, or as a secondary weapon for military service members. 

The P-11 has six main component groups: barrel, slide, frame, firing mechanism, grip, and magazine. The barrel is made of SAE 4140 Ordnance steel heat treated to 47 HRC. The slide is also 4140 steel, and contains the firing pin and the extractor. The rectangular frame is machined from solid 7075-T6 aluminum and houses the firing mechanism. The trigger connects via a transfer bar to the hammer and operates in Double Action Only. The hammer is driven by a novel free floating extension spring. The light weight firing pin transmits the energy of the hammer to ignite the primer. The functioning of the mechanism surpasses all applicable SAAMI safety standards. The grip is made of the ultra high impact polymer DuPont ST-8018. The grip also forms the magazine well and the trigger guard. Normally supplied with a 10-round double column all steel magazine.

This package includes an Alien Gear IWB holster ($35 value), 5 12 round magazines ($150 value, 2 10 round magazines.

Caliber is 8x60Rmm and only 4000 made and from what I found, 1200 came to the US. No import marks and this is a cool gun. A magazine tube under the barrel holds 4 or 5 in the carbine, I forget, and the elevator system works like new, as does everything on this gun. Has the cleaning rod, and all parts, plus a nice trigger. The bore is great with fine rifling and minor wear but no rust, no pitting and that goes for the exterior too. Faded finish yes, but the receiver has nice color and parts of the barrel have some color but NO corrosion or pitting. These guns used ammo that was black powder for the 1st 10 years so it is amazing how nice it is inside. I also have a short rifle (26 inch) which is also rare as they made 4600. The more common long rifles (32 inch) are found for sale but very rarely do you see a short rifle and a carbine together, so you can have the whole Portugese triad. The Portugese seriously cared for their weapons as 130 years later, the bore and action are nicer than almost every Mosin I had that are from the 1930s and 40s. I have a full set of photos I can send you if interested. Decent long rifles sell for $375 to $450 and I can not find a record of a true carbine sold anywhere recently, but I will list the short rifle (26 inch barrel and 4400 made) at $475 and the carbine (20 inch barrel 4000 made) at $550.

Volquartsen TF-17 Semi-Auto .17 HMR Rifle, 18.5 Inch Barrel, 9-Round Mag, Birch Stock
Like our other magnum rifles, the TF Rifle features a blowback design. However, in order to help handle the increased pressure of the 17 HMR and 22 WMR rounds, the TF Rifle also utilizes a precision engineered and machined counterweight system attached to our CNC-machined steel bolt. This eliminates the need to use more expensive alloys in the bolt. The weight is located in front of the receiver and concealed in the stock.

Our TF Rifle also includes the same TG2000 trigger unit – a Volquartsen exclusive – tuned to a crisp, clean 2.25lb trigger pull. The rifle sports a black matte coated stainless steel bull barrel.

Please note: This rifle accepts standard Ruger 10/22 Magnum/ .17 HMR Magazines.

Ive put exactly 500 rounds through this pistol and have not had any malfunctions. It's very accurate, and easy to shoot. The handguards fit small hands or big hands rather nicely, and the texture makes for a solid firing grip. I have the original parts and all three of the other types of handguards, and will include a blackhawk serpa holster, a Raven Concealment vanguard holster, two 17 round magazines, and 34 rounds of golden saber hollow point ammunition. To buy everything yourself and pay for the labor to upgrade the parts would cost somewhere upwards of 1300$ I'm willing to sell for 800$ or best offer. It's a sweet deal for a great gun."

Tooele Shooting Supply just received a shipment of BRAND NEW FIREARMS, including a couple of brand new, factory fresh, and hard to find CZ 455 Tacticool .22lr bolt-action rifles.  This model comes with a tactical trainer stock, 16″ threaded barrel, blued finish, and 5-round magazines.

 I just have a few  in stock, and I have them priced to sell for just $509.00 each.

CZ 02159 455 Varmint Tacticool Rifle, .22 LR, 16″ Threaded Barrel, Black Laminate Stock, Blue Finish, 5 Round Magazine

Built as a tactical trainer for those who don’t require the precision of the Manners Composite stock, the Tacticool has a number of ergonomic features that make it a joy to shoot. The stock has ambidextrous palm swells on its pistol grip and an especially high Monte Carlo to accommodate larger scopes. The beavertail forend is great for riding bags or affixing a bipod for precision shooting in the field, with a gentle butt hook to provide excellent control.

In addition to the advantages gained by the interchangeable barrel system of the 455 platform, the 455 Varmint features a heavier, stiffer barrel than its predecessors in the 452 and 453 lines. The 16 long .866 diameter cylindrical barrel gives the 455 varmint an accuracy advantage across the wide variety of rimfire loads available today, and features a threaded muzzle for easy attachment of a variety of muzzle-end devices (suppressors, muzzle breaks, etc). Any of the accessory barrels available for the 455 platform, including the American and Lux (open sights), as well as other varmint weight barrels in .22LR, .22 WMR or .17HMR, can be easily swapped out due to the larger universal barrel channel of the Varmint model.

NOTE: Rifle comes with knurled thread protector.

Winchester 1892 .357 Mag Rifle, Large Loop Lever, 20″ Barrel, Blued Finish, Walnut Stock- Winchester 534190137

The Winchester® Model 1892 has been featured in many Western movies and was the favorite of John Wayne and Chuck Connors. It is considered by many as the smoothest, most compact, handiest and most handsome lever-action ever offered. The Model 1892 is the compact model of the venerable Model 1886. This exquisite rifle features a 20″ round, deeply-blued and polished barrel, receiver and large loop lever. The full-length tubular magazine balances the rifle perfectly. The stock is solid walnut, cut in a straight grip style for fast handling.

Not many firearm models today can boast of having had over one million produced. The Winchester Model 1892, very similar in construction to the Winchester Model 1886, is one of these famous lever-action rifles. It is much like a compact or carbine model of the famous 1886 and has the same dual, vertical locking system for impressive strength. Many of its components have been scaled down and simplified to handle the smaller calibers, and here is where this nostalgic rifle shines. It is famous for its light weight, low recoil and responsive, easy handling. It displays a genius of design that makes it a modern-day treasure. The Winchester Model 1892 features a beautifully finished walnut stock, blued barrel and receiver, finely fit with precision and pride.

A little backstory, I have always wanted a Beretta 950 Jetfire, 25 ACP, but had never found one in the condition I have wanted (I.E. good bluing, like new).  Well, as of a few weeks ago I found one on Armslist that looked great, catch 22 is it was in a different state.  Anyways, I paid the guy and had it shipped.  The long and short of it is that it does not work.  I will tell you what I know:

The hammer when I got the gun was difficult to retract.  I foolishly attributed this to the gun just being excessively dry and took it home.  After lubing it the hammer freed up slightly and I took it to the range.  At the range the hammer failed to properly strike one out of every five rounds.  When I got home I tore the gun down and pulled all the components out of the gun.  The inside of the frame shows excessive wear against the right side of the hammer.  The roll pin that the hammer rides on was bent.  I figured I was only dealing with a bent roll pin and decided to order a new one.  After installing the new one, the problem is no better, and I would say perhaps worse.  Given that a new (straight) pin made the hammer harder to move I have come to the conclusion that it is either the hammer, or the frame that the problem resides in. That said I am not a gunsmith, only reasonably experienced in diagnosing problems in anything mechanical.  

So, I am selling the gun.  If the gun is fixable, you I think will have a nice gun, if it is not, you have a bunch of parts for a 950.  I am fairly certain it is fixable, and a competent pistol smith could fix it up.  I am just unwilling to invest any more money into it.  It is up for $100, or I will trade for 250 rounds of factory .45 ACP.  I am taking a bath on it but I chalk it up to a life lesson that I figured I might get burned on when I did it.  If you would like it for parts or want to try and fix it up, I'm letting it go for a very reasonable price.

It is for sale in the Knoxville area."

Just 1/2 hour on the meter on this diesel generator.

Diesel generator advantages.
More efficient, less fuel consumption than comparable gas generators.
Longer life than gas generators with lawnmower engines on them. Typical gas generators run at 3600 rpm. This genset runs at 1800 rpm.
Diesel fuel can be stored long term.
Multiple fuel options. Diesel, fuel oil, fryer oil, bio diesel, I've heard of people filtering used motor oil and burning it though I have not tried it.

This is not a cheap Chinese Yanmar clone. Yanmar makes a very good diesel motor, do your homework if you buy a Yanmar clone.

Site with details http://www.generatorsales.com/order/yanmar_4kw.asp?page=yanmar_4kw  
Text indicates yanmar, but the picture is a Lombardini genset. The listing is for a Lombardini generator with the deluxe power panel option.

827,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3681827,For Sale:  AR-15 7075 Aluminum Anodized Black 80% Lower Receiver,"Lower Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States",$ 70,"Listed On: Monday, March 9, 2015",Gun,no type,no type,no type,no type,"I have an aluminum AR-15 80% lower receiver that is anodized black with a type III mil-spec hard coating. This is a not an FFL item. This is not a complete AR-15 lower receiver and still requires machining, or drilling/milling, to be completed. (Once this 80% lower is fully machined, Birchwood Casey ""Aluminum Black"" metal finish, or a similar product, can be used for touch-ups.) 

I would like to sell this AR-15 80% lower receiver. I am located in Lower Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

This AR-15 80% lower receiver is made entirely from 7075 aluminum and is T6 heat-treated. 

This AR-15 80% lower receiver was machined by Cerro Forge, a company which produces the forgings for companies like Colt, Daniel Defense, DPMS, and other major manufacturers. The Cerro Forge ""keyhole"" mark of excellence is stamped upon this AR-15 80% lower on the right side, just ahead of where the pistol grip is mounted. (See picture for detail.)

This AR-15 80% lower receiver also has a fully flared magazine well and a .795 inch rear take down pocket already machined out, all to ensure a proper fit with your AR-15 upper receiver. 

My asking price is $70 for this AR-15 80% lower receiver. (I will ship this piece to you for an extra $6.)

I can meet you for a face to face, cash only transaction in Lower Bucks County, Pennsylvania. 

I will accept money orders and Paypal for shipping, but you must pay the Paypal transaction fee. 

The total cost to you for a Paypal transaction would be $78.58 - $70 for the piece, $6 for shipping, and $2.58 for for the Paypal transaction fee. You would also have to keep the Paypal transaction discreet, too. No mention of anything related to guns should be made on Paypal when you complete the transaction. Paypal is ardently anti-gun in case you don't already know this, which can mean that the transaction will be voided by Paypal before I receive your payment, that is, if you tell them or include any information that you are paying me for what could be used as a gun part.

Please contact me with any questions that you may have.

Please check out my other listings for some other AR-15 80% lower receiver items, plus other items altogether, here on Armslist. Thanks!

NOTE: If you want me to send a text message to your cell phone, I can do this if you would please tell me what carrier your cell phone is with. (Verizon/AT&T/Sprint/T-Mobile/?) I need to know this because then I can send a text to your cell phone with my textem account, which I log into with my computer. I prefer to do it this way because it is much easier for me to send text messages with my computer, than it is with my cell phone. Thanks!"

Hi there. Made the decision to switch back to 9mm. Got rid of my Glock 23, and now I'm looking to get rid of the Glock 22 as well. I am looking to trade for a Glock 17 + an equal, or close to equal amount of ammo. Gun is in great shape and shoots like a dream, just like you'd expect from Glock. Easy to carry with the right holster (I suggest www.everydayholster.com) 

Comes with everything in the original box. 3 mags, lock, 2 backstraps (non beaver tail version) hard case etc.

Ammo is mostly FMJ but does have some hollow points. I'd be looking for some hollow points with the trade if possible. Ammo will be in an ammo can, but a different one than pictured, as that one holds sentimental value to me."
