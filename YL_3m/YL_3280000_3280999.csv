This is barely 2 months old is in immaculate condition, .177 caliber adult air rifle. UTG 4-16x50 illuminated reticle mildot sniper scope, with custom GTX trigger that breaks at a super crisp 1.5 lbs, has actual built in suppressor making it ultra quiet eve when shooting alloy pellets at 1250fps or lead ballistic tip pellets at 1050 fps. Ultra flat shooting, ultra accurate, easy cocking effort and looks super sexy too! With Predator Polymag hunting pellets at 25yds, I am getting groups right about 1/2"" ctc and with RWS Hypermax alloys I can keep 10 shots under a dime at 1266 fps according to the chronograph. When it comes to pest control or small game hunting, this rifle really shines; because it's suppressed it doesn't spook game so when you're shooting pigeons, after you drill the first one his friends don't bail right away allowing you to get 2-3 at a time before they get what's up. I use the Hypermax pellets to hunt with right now and out to 40 yards, this rifle/pellet combination will drive a round clean through a pigeon broadside and knock him dead on his ass. With the Polymag ballistic tips, they nearly passthru broadside shots but with how well they mushroom out it drops them like a rock just the same. Because of the tune on this rifle and the wonderful trigger, I've killed pigeons out to 88 yds at my friends dairy (longest shot using range finder) and regularly make kills out to 60 yds no problem. This set up is flat out badass and someone's going to get a hell of a deal here with the way this is modded out.  Text is preferred @ REDACTED"

Hi everyone,

Just picked up this Truglo Triton 20mm RDS from Turners on Saturday (7/12) and have decided to sell it and get an EOtech for the larger sight picture. Looking to sell it at a loss since I did mount it and shot 40 rounds with it therefore it is slightly used but still in excellent condition. There is a tiny bit of wear on the elevation adjustment cap from using it to make adjustments, other than it is LNIB. Retails for $110+.

Asking $85 Cash, no trades at this time

The optic works perfect and has 3 different reticle colors that you can select from (red, green, and blue), and also has 3 reticle brightness levels for all colors. It comes with a low mount (for AK's, shotguns, etc.) and a riser mount for AR platforms. The AR riser provides a lower 1/3 cowitness. From the short trip to the range the sight did hold zero very well and had zero issues.

Features:
* 5 MOA reticle
* 3 reticle color choices
* 2 weaver-style mounts (low mount & AR riser mount)
* Nitrogen gas filled
* Water and Fog Proof
* Multi-Coated Mirrored front lens
* Windage & Elevation adjustment
* Removeable Base
* Battery Included
* Instruction Manual & Box Included

• Laminated benchrest-style stock with raised flat comb
• Adjustable trigger system for pull as low as 2 lbs.

The Mossberg Varmint-Predator (MVP) rifle features a patent-pending drop-push bolt-action that enables you to use your AR-15 .223/5.56 NATO magazines in a firearm optimized for varmint and predator control. The fluted 24"" button-rifled medium bull barrel has a 1:9 twist rate optimized for .223-caliber accuracy and sports a matte-blued finish. Its 11° tapered crown protects the muzzle from incidental damage. The laminated benchrest-style stock features pillar bedding to enhance accuracy and is ideal for shooting off sandbags or packs. Its ergonomic design has a raised flat comb for sighting ease, palm swell on the forend and checkering on the pistol-style grip and forearm. The Lighting Bolt Action (LBA™) trigger assembly is machined aircraft-grade aluminum and hard-coat anodized to military specifications, preventing corrosion and reducing wear. LBA’s creep-free design ensures a crisp break with each shot and trigger pull can be adjusted down to 2 lbs. using only a standard screwdriver. Ten-round magazine included."

No one has showed up with cash if add is still up its still available...

The BDL model has the drop magazine and the fancier stock along with the mounted sling mounts vs the adl models. ... gun is in great shape for being 42 yrs old! Stock is in outstanding shape, action is still smooth and functions the way it should... Safety locks bolt so your last car ride isn't to the hospital... 

The drop hinge mag is an amazing add on as you don't have to put a round in the chamber to unload the rifle, press a button and they fling out, yes it is that easy.... 

Scope is a very old leupold vari xii... If you know leupold you know that for one it's a very durable scope by itself and leupold stands behind there product 100%...it breaks they fix it free of charge....I do have the original scope mounts as well... 



Barrel is in good shape..has a wear mark or two from a safe it looks like..bore is pristine... rifling looks great... 

Has raised scope mounts to hunt in the woods with open sights or to hunt that one clear cut without changing guns... this is the perfect starter gun for your wife or kid, we all know these old rifles are more accurate then these new rifles out these days.. we also know the true craftsmanship that went into these american made rifles vs a press or chines stamped crap... buy a piece of history and a hunting icon when purchasing this gun... I have only seen a few of these around don't pass this up before I decide to keep it after all... pretty firm at 450 cash 550 trade..... will only trade for an xds 9mm or xds .45 bi tone(stainless) pluss ammo or cash on top on your end..."

BORE IS NICE . GREAT OVERALL CONDITION . PLEASE SEE LISTED DETAILS. The HK USP Compact is a small frame pistol capable of firing full power loads. Based on the full-size USP models, these handy pistols combine compact size with optimum effective shooting performance. USP Compacts are smaller and lighter than large frame USPs. The reduction in trigger reach and grip circumference increases concealability and enhances shooting ergonomics. Unlike some subcompact semiautomatic pistols that use a difficult to shoot ""two-finger grip"" frame, the USP Compact uses a narrow, full-hand grip frame with a choice of interchangeable extended or flush-fitting magazine floorplates. This makes the pistol easy to shoot without sacrificing concealability.The USP Compact is built to take the punishment of high-energy +P loads. To reduce the length of the slide and barrel on the USP Compact, the mechanical recoil reduction system found on large frame USPs has been replaced by a specially designed flat compression spring contained in the captive recoil spring assembly by a polymer absorber bushing. Service life is still engineered to exceed 20,000 rounds. Easy to shoot, simple to maintain; the USP Compact is a reliable, safe, accurate, and highly concealable pistol.

The Model 512 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design uses a laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. The holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment. The Model 512 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. Other features include a 65 MOA circle reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 20 brightness settings. The Model 512 is compatible with 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rails. Government Export Restriction: See site for details.

I contacted Kimber they were surprised that I was even talking about it. I was told the ULE (Ultra Law Enforcement) Eclipse only ran in 03 and that they were very rare.  They were built on a steel frame with a stronger spring to handle hotter +P+ LE rounds.  Only 227 were ever produced and out of those less then 20 were tactical.  They were distributed in a test run to dealers that were part of the national gun buyer program.  I don't really know what to value this gun.

It is a great safe for storage of small arms and ammo, money, jewelry, important papers, etc.
It is Fire Resistant and Burglar Resistive.
The size is about 19” wide X 21 1/8th “ deep and 25 ½ “ tall.
I have the original paper work that shows the combination and how to change the combination to other numbers.
The combination works...I can lock it and unlock it.
And it is very heavy!! It has fixed castors to roll on so that will help some.
It probably weighs in excess of 200 pounds.
A locksmith I know valued it at between $400-$450.
I don't expect to get that but will take a decent offer.
It should be a very good safe for pistols or ammo! 
From what I can find on the Internet, I think it was made in the 1920's.

Less than 100 rounds through the pistol, has functioned flawlessly for me. The gun shoots very well and is very accurate. I could use some extra cash right now, so it’s time to let this one go.

If you need an inexpensive gun for home defense or maybe to keep in your car/truck, this may be what you’re looking for. Like all Hi-points, she’s a bit ugly, and definitely heavy, which helps to make it really easy to shoot those big .45 rounds. I’ve added a Hogue Handall slip-on rubber grip since the stock grips are a bit slippery – I find that grip makes it just right – easy to grip and very comfortable in the hand.

It’s in very good condition. I take good care of my guns. It’s clean and looks just like new.

Includes:
•	Hi-Point JHP .45acp pistol

729,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3280729,For Sale:  RARE Browning M2HB 50 BMG BeltFed Semi Heavy Machine Gun By TNW REAL WWII NOT M3,"Claridge, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","$ 10,000","Listed On: Sunday, August 24, 2014",Rifles,Browning                                                                                ,50 BMG                                                                                ,Semi-automatic                                                                                ,Rifle,"Up for sale is a RARE Browning M2HB beltfeld 50 BMG caliber heavy machine gun built by the pro's at TNW Firearms. The gun is extra special! It is a *REAL* semi M2 and *NOT* the cheaper M3HB parts kit variant builds that are out there. TNW informed me that this M2 has an *original* WWII sideplate from Buffalo Arms, Buffalo NY that gives this firearm an awesome history not found on anything else than $30k+ transferrable machine guns! You can also see the Springfield Armory proof mark in the pictures below. The rear sight is also the desirable model with integrated optics mount dovetail making this a great find. The M2 features beautiful wood spade grips and charging handle. Firearm was freshly parkerized by TNW and the overall condition is 95%+ which is outstanding for a weapon of this type!

This firearm was purchased in person from TNW Firearms at Knob Creek, KY Machine Gun Shoot in the fall of 2013. TNW was reluctant to sell this particular model, but as a collector, I made them a good offer and took it home! M2 has only been used for parade displays mounted on a WWII era Jeep. Otherwise this beautiful firearm has been securely stored and is now being offered up for sale for the keystone of your collection!

This M2 uses a BATFE approved semi auto configuration. This allows this to be a normal Title I gun that only needs a normal background check and paperwork like any other rifle. Purchaser / Transferee must be 21 as per Federal law to purchase this firearm. I work with a local FFL who will do the transfer in Claridge, PA or we will ship this to your local FFL for legal transfer.

Included with the purchase the the complete receiver group, WWII vintage barrel in great service life, headspace gauge and 100 M2 links for ammo. No mounts or other accessories included, although with my experience I can assist you in finding a tripod, ground/vehicle mount, etc. I can also offer the firearm without the barrel and provide a discount of $300. I can provide you contact information on a man to purchase quality NOS M2 barrels for ~$600. For the buyer who needs this firearm shipped, not shipping the barrel saves a bundle.

Price is for a local pickup, please contact me for shipping options. For a firearm this large and heavy Fedex or UPS is normally about $100+ for just the weight and additional for insurance. The barrel normally ships best in a separate package and costs nearly $50 itself. I will pack properly and ship on your dime to your local FFL dealer.

Price is $10,000 for this fine firearm payable only in cash or certified check. Serious inquiries ONLY please. If you do not have the capacity to purchase please do not waste both of our time."

If you've ever ""bump fired"" a semi-auto firearm and had fun with it then the Slide Fire is going to blow your mind. It's a fun attachment to have for any AR-15 platform. 
Like ""bump fire"" this device allows you to seemingly have full auto functionality. Whereas your finger is actually pulling the trigger each and every time it is perfectly legal and this product comes with a letter from the ATF to assert said legality. 
Instead of paying for an FFL and thousands of dollars for a full auto weapon you're paying $300 for the opportunity to own an attachment that allows you to aim the firearm while putting as many rounds down range as you want to legally in as little time as you want. It allows you to fire as little as two rounds per trigger pull or as many as your magazine is holding while actually aiming your firearm. 
Trust me when I say this attachment provides instant ""PERMAGRIN"" and is so much stress relief it should be sold with a prescription from your Doctor. 
The Slide Fire is free from defects and can also be fired in the locked position to allow you to ""zero"" your weapon before unlocking it to ""Rock & Roll"". 
The Slide Fire was designed to be used on AR-15 models with a sliding adjustable stock. If your AR-15 has a fixed stock you will have to first install a commercial or Mil-Spec tube."

If you have never seen one of these pistols, they are 85% of the size of a regular 1911; from the browning web-site “John M. Browning developed the Model 1911 to fire the powerful 45 ACP cartridge. We developed it to fire the 22 L.R. and, after extensive testing and research, determined that 85% of the original size was ideal for the smaller cartridge”

These pistols are awesome little guns, after firing one of my friends I picked one up thinking my daughter would enjoy it, but alas her attention is on volleyball and no longer has a desire to go the range.  Instead of having the gun sit in the safe I would rather put the money to use on a build I have in mind.

Accurate LT-32 is an exact copy of the original T-32 powder used by benchrest shooters in 6mm PPC cartridge. In fact the new LT-32 is made in the same factory on the same machines that produced the original T-32 powder. The new LT-32 is known for its extreme consistency and allowing higher velocity out of smaller capacity cases like the PPC family. The extremely small extruded powder results in consistent metering in powder measures and higher velocities compared to spherical powders. Standard Deviations between lots have been cut in half to insure the most consistent lot to lot powder on the market. It also offers outstanding accuracy in varmint and tactical cartridges, including the .223 Rem and .308 Win. LT-32 is the perfect choice for extreme accuracy."

The AR57 is chambered in 5.7x28 and the unique design includes a top fed magazine with spent casings being dropped through magwell of any standard AR15 receiver. The AR57 upper will mate with any AR15 lower. 

I got a pmag30 custom engraved and use it as my brass catcher. Standard mags are 50 rd but I have pinned ones. 

Here are notes:

12.5"" barrel
5"" extension brake so you choose your route 
Includes (2) 10/50 mags
Cali compliant bullet button treatment
Magpul gen 2 mbus
BCG
(Lost buffer but you can find one online)
Box of ammo (40) rds


This thing is so much fun. I just wanna finish my New build. This thing just sits in the safe. 

I'll throw in brass catcher mag and extra mag you'll really like 

Asking $550 plus shipping. Prefer local. 

Willing to trade for

- 1-4x24 optic or a long distance optic (vortex preferred for both)
- 223/556 range friendly ammo + cash
- UBR or PRS stocks mil spec any color + cash
- 6.8 spc bcg, ammo, + cash

- 762x39 range friendly 
- vltor casvl
- 10"" 556/223 barrel
- Raptor CH

Or if you'd rather use a credit card to buy stuff online it's a good way to finance this lol! But seriously.

The savage Model 1914 slide action 22 rimfire was made from 1914 to 1924. manuals as we know them today did not exist for most of the entry level firearms...most had a simple tag or a small pamphlet.. The 1914 was an improvement of tyhe Model 1903. They are close enough in design and function that instruction for one should get you thru the take down and servicing of the other.
