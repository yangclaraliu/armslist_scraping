GSG 522

The German Sport Guns GSG 522 is a great replica of the famous Heckler & Koch MP5. The MP5 has been around for a long time and still looks modern….it started in 1966! The MP5 has been used in SWAT teams in the USA and special military forces all over the world and come in all kinds of variations and caliber sizes.  They’ve also been in lots of movies because it’s one of the coolest looking sub machine guns ever created.

Sure everyone would love to own one and shoot one…however HK stopped making the civilian versions of the MP5 in the 1980′s which means to get a real HK select-fire 9mm MP5 will cost around $15,000-25,000. You also have to get some paper work filled with the ATF since it’s full auto. Even the quality replicas are over $1,500 – $2,500 (learn more about the original MP5).  Not to mention shooting 9mm rapid fire with a 25 round clip would get expensive fast. Each magazine you shoot would cost you at least $6-$8…shooting three magazines at the range would set you back at least $20.

Back in 2008 GSG started selling the 552 in a few different versions and it has been a very popular .22. There are the 522, 522 SD, and the MP5K and slight variations of each with different stocks, barrel lengths and accessories.

There is the 522 Carbine RS above with what looks like a sweet suppressor screwed on the end… unfortunately the sweet looking suppressor is fake due to a lot of reasons that include cost and regulations.

Gun works perfectly with zero issues. Very accurate and has been a great pocket gun. Gun small enough that a person's hand covers the entire firearm, very discreet. Less than 200 rounds through it. One interesting point about these guns is that you don’t have to pull the slide back to chamber the weapon, there is an additional option. If you are elderly or disabled, or suffer from an ailment that prevents you from pulling a slide back on a handgun, this gives you an option that will work.
To load the gun (the optional way), push forward on the barrel catch lever, and the back of the barrel will tip up, exposing an empty chamber. Place a round directly into the breach and snap the barrel down, the gun is now loaded. Then it fires and cycles like any other semi-auto.  Or, of course, you can load the gun the traditional way...simply feed a round from the magazine by pulling back the slide and letting go.  Either way, the magazine holds 8 rounds, plus one in the chamber. This is double action, it has no hammer to cock, so you chamber a round, pull trigger and it fires. It does have a safety. The design of the firearm would make it nearly impossible for an accidental discharge in a pocket or purse.  I wish to trade only. Always looking for the next new gun. Will consider anything really, but long guns and handguns are generally what I am looking for."

I am looking to sell or trade my UTS15 double tube shotgun. This holds 14 + 1 rounds of 12 gauge and is bullpup design. This allows you to have a full length barrel with an SBR like profile. I got this shotgun in trade from another member and am looking at what else is out there. I would prefer cash but always open to trades.

This comes with Original Box and manual. I am not the original owner so unsure of the round count. It looks to be in almost new condition and cycles rounds perfectly. I have seen some videos about this gun's lack of reliability and I can say that is untrue. The PO mentioned never to have any issues at all and I couldn't get it to jam. Gun is awesome. I will say, I have spoken to 2 other owners of the UTS15 and they said the same thing, gun works like a beast.

I am looking for around $950 cashOBO or trades below:

I bought these pins to go in a new lower but decided to use a geissele trigger group instead. If you have any any questions or would like more photos I'm available through email and phone. $30 this price includes USPS shipping. Detailed description below.

These are the Generation 2 pin sets. These are the STRONGEST pins that can be produced and were designed to withstand the high impact of full and semi-auto 9mm and .223 suppressed weapons. The pins are stainless steel pins. End retainers are black oxide, dark earth, or OD green. Connectors have phosphate finish. An absolute must-have for all M-16 owners. They will also protect your AR-15. Special anti-creep retainers prevent wear on your irreplaceable M-16 or AR-15 receiver. Pin installation tool & 2 Allen wrenches included. No modification to gun required.

Standard mill spec AR-15 lowers will utilize the .154 diameter pin kit. 

The .1555 dia. pin is for worn receiver trigger and hammer pin holes. Being non-rotational, further wear is eliminated. They will also fit new receivers and will remove the free-play in match triggers. The .1555 will not fit Jewell Trigger System.

The .170 size fits late model Colts.

For Rock River National Match triggers use the .1555 only.

There is no strength difference between the Gen 2 and Gen 2 Mod 2 sideplates. The only difference is cosmetic."

I am selling a brand new PPs50/22 made by Pietta of Italy.  I was so impressed with this rifle that I bought three of them.  A few months down the road I realized that might be a bit excessive so Ive decided to sell one of them.  This rifle is brand new, unfired, and packaged in the original shipping box with all literature.  I am including the original stick magazine that it sold with.  Other mags and the drum mags are readily available on-line.  This gun originally retailed for $599, but I bought it on clearance for $450.  I am willing to let the rifle go for $350.  Could you save a bit and buy a Ruger 10/22?  Sure. But everyone has one. This rifle is unique, reliable, and has a huge ""cool factor"".

Described below-

While its Full-auto ancestor was made famous in the Battle of Berlin in 1945; the New PPS50/22 is styled like the PPSh-41. It is Semi-Auto, Drum or Clip -fed, caliber .22LR, Solid Wood Stock, and the Barrel has a Full-length, Perforated Heat Shield, just like the Soviet PPSh-41.  The PPS50/22 looks like the Soviet PPSh-41, especially when equipped with the Quick-release Drum Magazine. Made in .22LR caliber, you can Shoot All Day Long, because .22LR ammunition is inexpensive and reliable. With its adjustable rear sight and sharp-blade front sight, it rivals far more expensive rifles in accuracy. The PPS50/22 has a secure , semi-auto action, a smooth trigger, a high-quality and nicely-fitted stock, making Shooting All Day Long very comfortable and a lot of fun! The PPS50/22 is equipped with studs to accept swivels and a sling.

I started this off with a saimese Mauser for 500$ Bought a stainless shilen heavy barrel for almost 200$ Had a gunsmith remove the old barrel, install the new, check headspace, etc as well as test fire for 300$+ also had him drill , tap and install base mounts for 40$ I then had it duracoated snakeskin camo for 200$ with brush colors to match our landscape. This is an all weather finish and is ready for heavy duty use. I also have an upgraded and adjustable trigger for this gun for you to drop in and set it how you like it . A 2 stage trigger is currently installed. 

A ramline stock comes included and came with the gun. Someone tried removing material to fit the gun and got really close. I tried to fit it and it only needs a little material removed for the gun to be complete. This is 5-10 minutes of work. Fit it in this stock, or an aftermarket Mauser stock of your choice.

This High Standard Sport King Model 103 was made between 1960 and 1963. It is solid and well made and puts to shame many of the more modern handguns. It has a 4.5 "" barrel. Weighs 40 OZ and features a wide target trigger less than 3 pounds of pull with no creep or over-travel. 
Comes with one 10-round magazine. Has been sitting unused for many years. Very minor signs of use. The handgun can easily accept any other barrel designed for it since it is a push-button barrel removal.

I hate to sell this rifle but I need some funds to cover a repair in my home.

This rifle is not a safe queen.  I am the second owner of this rifle and it's a great shooting rifle.  I've carried this rifle all over Washington State hunting for deer.  You can see in the pictures that the rifle has a few small dings from carrying and use.  The metal around the pins was marred by a fellow who should never take a firearm apart.  Sometimes a fellow just needs to take it to a smith and get done what needs doing.  In this case he just wanted to do a super cleaning job.  It's flat out accurate.  The sites installed are the midrange sight set with the level bar in the front sight.  These sights are for shooting out to 500 yards or so.  Don't hold me to that though.  The original sights never came into my possession and I do not have the box either.  She looks great and would make a great looking and shootin iron.  The wood is really choice as well.  I had planned on having the wood redone by someone who had the experience to make extra nice again.  Don't get me wrong she looks super and shoots just as she is."

Henry H006MLGL Big Boy .357 Mag Lever-Action Rifle, Large Loop Lever, 20″ Octagon Barrel, Walnut Stock

The Henry Repeating Arms Big Boy .357 Magnum lever action rifle is a great choice for Cowboy Action SASS approved rifle. The Big Boy incorporates a top brass receiver, 20″ octagonal barrel, American Walnut stock, and 10 round magazine tube.

The adventure and romance of America’s Old West are imbedded in its distinctive 20-inch octagon barrel, straight-grip American walnut stock with brass buttplate and brass barrel band. The solid top brass receiver features side ejection. The overall length is 38½ inches and weighs in at 8.68 lbs.
A nice 19th century touch is the use of a fully adjustable Marble semi-buckhorn rear sight with white diamond insert and brass beaded front sight. The Big Boys have the smoothest actions of any centerfire lever action rifles on the market today. They work beautifully to give you competition shooters a leg up in any event you take part in.

Kel Tec KSG 12 Gauge Pump Action Shotgun, Desert Tan FDE Cerakote Finish, 12+1 Rounds, Dual Magazines, Picatinny Rail, Kel Tec KSGTAN

Internal dual tube magazines holds 6 rounds of 12 gauge 3 inch shells each for a total capacity of 6+6+1 (7 per tube if using 2-3/4 inch shells). Pump action feeds from either the left or right tube. Feed side is manually selected by a lever located behind the trigger guard. Lever can be positioned in the center detent in order to easily clear the chamber without feeding another round from either magazine. Cross bolt style safety. Pump release lever is located in front of the trigger guard.

The pump includes an under picatinny rail for the mounting of a forward grip, a light, or a laser. The included top picatinny sight rail will accept many types of optics or iron sights. Forward and rear sling loops are built in, and a basic sling is included. The soft rubber butt pad helps to tame recoil.

The KSG receiver is made from hardened steel and includes the magazine tubes which have been welded in place. The grip and stock assembly is made of glass reinforced nylon (Zytel) and is easily disassembled by pushing out 2 pins, which store in 2 holes in the grip when removed. The barrel and pump assembly is removed by loosening the 2 front magazine tube nuts with a coin and sliding the assembly forward.

Winchester 1892 .44 Mag Rifle, Large Loop Lever, 20″ Barrel, Blued Finish, Walnut Stock- Winchester 534190124

The Winchester® Model 1892 has been featured in many Western movies and was the favorite of John Wayne and Chuck Connors. It is considered by many as the smoothest, most compact, handiest and most handsome lever-action ever offered. The Model 1892 is the compact model of the venerable Model 1886. This exquisite rifle features a 20″ round, deeply-blued and polished barrel, receiver and large loop lever. The full-length tubular magazine balances the rifle perfectly. The stock is solid walnut, cut in a straight grip style for fast handling.

Not many firearm models today can boast of having had over one million produced. The Winchester Model 1892, very similar in construction to the Winchester Model 1886, is one of these famous lever-action rifles. It is much like a compact or carbine model of the famous 1886 and has the same dual, vertical locking system for impressive strength. Many of its components have been scaled down and simplified to handle the smaller calibers, and here is where this nostalgic rifle shines. It is famous for its light weight, low recoil and responsive, easy handling. It displays a genius of design that makes it a modern-day treasure. The Winchester Model 1892 features a beautifully finished walnut stock, blued barrel and receiver, finely fit with precision and pride.

With a large rollover cheek piece for scope usage and straight comb design to minimize cheek slap when shooting, 
the hand conforming thumbhole allows for increased accuracy while distributing the recoil among the palm and shoulder 
thus minimizing muzzle jump and felt recoil. The forend is proportioned to complement barrels from 21 inches to 25 inches 
in length nicely and will accommodate barreled actions with standard sporter contour barrels, and larger barrels up to a 
tapered varmint design can be inlet in these stocks. The forend also has side vents which permit the free floating barrel 
to cool efficiently for those long days at the range. 

This rifle was purchased new by me, added new laminate thumbhole stock and scope, then placed in safe. Never fired.

I am pretty sure this will fit any newer Howa rifles, maybe even the older ones that came out before they started selling them with these HACT triggers. Trigger pull is about 3 lbs. I loved this trigger, but decided to get a Timney which had lower adjustable pull weight. One thing I definitely liked more about this trigger then the Timney, is it's a 2 stage as opposed to a single. The Timney has a very clean single stage break, but I wish it had the 2 stage pull that the HACT has. Just my preference in a long range rifle platform.
