The stainless steel slide and barrel are CNC machined from solid bar stock for precise tolerances. With loaded magazines, each of these handguns weighs less than one pound.

The slide is machined from a solid block of stainless steel and protected by Sig's black Nitron finish.

It also features the Sig Sauer four-point safety system, making the SP2022 one of the safest guns on the market. The Tacpac includes the STL-900 Tactical Light and laser and a Level 2 Roto light/laser holster.

Hey all,
I have up available for trade/sale a awesome conceal carry gun. It is a Ruger Lcp 380 ACP with Crimson Trace laser grip installed. It also comes with a rubber pachymr grip and a pocket holster for the gun. This is a awesome little setup that would be great for most who need a awesome little backup gun. I would keep it, but I would rather trade it off to someone who could use it more than I could! This is used and does show signs of use, but is still a fantastic gun for anyone need a reliable and very compact backup gun. This is for pick up in norman due to my wonky schedule. 
I would also consider trades for 1911’s in 45 acp, Remington Shotguns capable of 3.5 inch shells, certain bolt action rifles, 38spl +P or 357 mag full size revolvers (with adjustable sights preferred). Honestly, just shoot me a text at REDACTED or a message on here and we can go from there. I can trade up or down with extras on my end to even things out a bit. Just be fair on your valuing of your guns as well.
Thanks for looking and happy hunting!

She is a three year old full-bred Labrador Retriever. If you are looking for a hunting dog, don't spend your money on a pup who may or may not have the drive to retrieve, buy one that is incredibly smart and has a retrieving drive that will outlast you and your hunting party. She has been trained and certified as a narcotics detection dog, but I did not want her to live in kennel between jobs. She also has some search and rescue training. She is potty trained, will not tear up your house and will love your kids. She is an amazing watch dog and will love you forever if you play fetch with her. She loves the water and will try to swim in a puddle if it's large enough. She is definitely an alpha female and would do best as an only dog, though she may do ok with a submissive dog. I've moved into an apartment in the city for a job and feel horrible that she doesn't have any room to run around.

I am not the original owner of the rifle but personally put about 500 flawless rounds through it and it always shot very nicely.  The action is very very smooth - the smoothest of any AK I've handled by far!

This rifle has been converted to handle high capacity magazines and also has a threaded barrel for adding on a muzzle device.

Installed in this rifle comes:
--Krebs Mark VI Safety Selector ($60 value)
--Tapco G2 Trigger, specially modified for VEPR by Dinzag Arms ($60 value)
--Brand new beautiful maple wood hand guard ($25)
--Ace VEPR Receiver Block ($70 value)
--Ace Folding Stock Mechanism ($60 value)
--Magpul COE Fixed Stock ($30 value)
--UTG Buffer Tube ($25 value)
--Sling attachment plate which allows a slight to attach on either side behind the folding mechanism (don't know manufacturer) - ($15 value)
--Standard Birdcage Flash Hider ($25 value)
--Pistol Grip with Storage (I think Mako) - ($30 value)

Other features on this VEPR-K performed by Robinson Arms:  
--accepts high capacity double stack magazines
--Rear leaf sight has additional windage adjustment

I price this rifle alone without the above upgrades for $1100 given its rarity and now the current ban on future imports from Russia.  If you want to know more, just do a search for VEPR-K rifles and you'll find these are some of the finest AK pattern rifles out there!

Overall this rifle is in great condition.  It does, however, have some wear on it from basic use.  Basically some finish is missing from a few rivets on the receiver and there are some small scratches on the finish on the barrel (see photos).  I took as many photos as possible to show in careful detail the condition of the rifle--they show everything!

Photos are found here:  http://www.smugmug.com/gallery/n-RDKzb/

Separately, I have for sale an Ultimak Gas Tube adapter rail that allows an optic to be mounted above the hand guard.  This was mounted on the rifle for a short period of time, and removed for this sale.  Separately, I'll sell this for $100 shipped.  I'll include it with the rifle for only $75.  I'll also include a separate wood hand guard the prior owner painted black that has notches cut out to allow for the Ultimak installation.  There are other hand guards you can buy that better integrate with the Ultimak, but this was a good solution for my use.  See above photo link for examples of Ultimak and hanguard installed on the rifle.

NOT INCLUDED IN THIS SALE:
--No Optics
--No Magazines
--Original Robinson Arms Furniture

The value of this rifle and installed upgrades is over $1500 if you were to start from scratch.  I would like to get $1250 in a F2F transaction at a local FFL (plus $75 if you want the Ultimak tube).  I will ship for an additional $40 to your FFL of choice wherever legal.  Buyer pays all transfer/background check fees.  If you are in a state that prohibits the purchase of this rifle, I will not ship it to you, sorry.

I'm generally not interested in any Trades at this time.  Cash only for now.  Thanks!"

Trade Value $400 NOT ACCEPTING CASH AT THIS TIME
I have a S&W Shield 9mm with No Thumb safety for trade at this time. My Shield will come with everything it did new and has had 75 rounds through it. I am entertaining the idea of trading this Shield due to me wanting a 26 or 19 to replace it as a vehicle gun. This Shield is in great shape and has very few rounds through it due to it not being my primary Shield that I carry. It has set in a kydex holster after being shot at one range outing to ensure function check. Obviously if trade is worth more cash/trade will be negotiated but am not looking for a $600 Glock with tons of work being done to it.

Ultra-high capacity magazines keep your rifle running longer between mag changes during competition or tactical operations. These magazines meet NATO STANAG 4179 specifications and are compatible with all rifles that accept AR-15/M16/M4 magazines. Less than two standard magazines wide, so they’re easy to hold and handle with one hand. 60-round model fits most dual-mag pouches for 30-round magazines. Weight is centered under the weapon to help you maintain a normal shooting grip and stance. Seats fully loaded on a closed bolt. “Nesting” nylon followers require no lubrication and fully support the round stack to aid in reliable feeding.

The knife is durable, has no functional flaws, and is very large and folding.  Aesthetically it virtually free of blemishes, although use is evident on the (belt) clip(s).  It features a unique grip which offers many different ways to hold the knife confidently, including a hand position taking advantage of the very long blade and handle, fitting the fingers opposite the blade - this results in utilization of the long handle and blade extending one's reach dramatically.

These knives are noted as being among the strongest in the world, and apparently the lock can support 600lbs (look up the demonstrations).  The knife retails for around $400 new, and I have not found anyone selling this knife online for less than $200.  THIS IS THE LARGEST ESPADA AVAILABLE.  

In addition, this sale will include a Winchester very large bowie knife with sheath (similar selling online for $40+), a small folding remington knife, a smaller cleaver, and two long bladed kitchen knives - an excellent selection for hunting, personal protection, and cooking all in one.  The espada is a $400 knife which I have yet to find for less than $210 used.  I am willing to sell all these knives as a package for $200.  I will Drop the price down to $170 if sold and paid for in the next 24 hours.
