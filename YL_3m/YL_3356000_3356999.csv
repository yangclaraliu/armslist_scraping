Included are a Crimson Trace LG-469 laser, Trijicon night sights SP01Y green/yellow (fitted - I also still have the originals). I am also throwing in a custom Kydex IWB holster that I purchased from MultiHolsters.com, which is specifically made to accommodate this gun with the CT laser. Also included is a SmartCarry IWB holster which allows for completely concealed carry. There is the original box, accessories, and an additional 9 round magazine. Also, 2 Pearce grips for the 2 seven round mags, if you want the little extra grip. In other words, I set this gun up with all the options! I really like it, but I have to raise some cash to pay some bills, and so need to sell this.

I would prefer local, face to face transaction, cash only. It would be nice if you could show me proof that you are an Oregon resident, so I don't run foul of any laws regarding interstate sale of firearms. It also be great if you'd be willing to sign a bill of sale for me, so I can prove if need be down the line that I had sold the gun.

359,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3356359,For Sale:  SCAM ALERT - the saga continues.... a PSA for my fellow Armslisters...,"I'm not really in Pennsylvania...., Pennsylvania, United States",FREE,"Listed On: Tuesday, August 5, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a pretty pitiful story, and not only shows that I trusted in my fellow Armslister too much - but also just how vulnerable Armslist is to outside defrauders.  I would highly recommend that Armslist establish some kind of security/verification system like Gunbroker for personal identification....  

To begin - I've posted two different scam alerts yesterday regarding the two links below.... (ARMLIST NOTE: the posts are still up even though I've flagged them and let you know.  I would encourage any other Armslister to flag them as a scam....).  The only reason I reacted to the situation quickly was because some other Armslisters fllagged them as a scam, and I got an email (unfortunately right after I sent my money...).  I truly hope that no one else lost out like I have... 

Here are the posts that still are up, under a different email and account than last time...

I filed a complaint with the FBI cyber crimes division, and have been working with paypal to get back my money.  Come to find out, the paypal email address the individual provided as his ""wife's account,"" (which was a ""verified"" paypal account) - is actually a disabled woman who was being shanghai'd into using her paypal account as an embezzlement thoroughfare for a foreign national....  yeah... she fell for one of the ""help me, I'm a nigerian stuck in the airport"" emails.....  She has sent me the full dialogue of texts with the individual, emails, pictures, etc, and he basically preyed on a lonely, disabled woman - and used her paypal account as the pass-through for money via armslist listings... 

So the lesson in all of this?  If you're buying something from an individual online, it never goes without risk.  I would make sure if you're using Paypal to get the individual to send you an invoice for the good(s).  We all know Paypal is wonky about anything bang related, but there are abbreviated means for dealing with that.... 

Note:  I'm a 100% rated arfcom'er, ebayer, and am on gunbroker.  All of this is just meant as a PSA and a hope that some of us will ban together to not only keep an eye out for this individual, but others that might try this in the future.  

PS.  This scheme was so fixed, I emailed the guy and asked for the scope reticle, and model confirmation, and he sent me additional pictures that matched what he was trying to sell in the post.  It all lined up....  but I got jacked....

Be prepared with a Crimson Trace Laser product to best prepare yourself for any high stress confrontation in a dark parking lot, secluded city street, or urban hiking trails. Use the best: use a Crimson Trace Laser.

472,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3356472,For Sale:  SCAM ALERT - the saga continues.... a PSA for my fellow Armslisters...,"I'm not really in Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, United States",FREE,"Listed On: Tuesday, August 5, 2014",Optics,no type,no type,no type,no type,"This is a pretty pitiful story, and not only shows that I trusted in my fellow Armslister too much - but also just how vulnerable Armslist is to outside defrauders. I would highly recommend that Armslist establish some kind of security/verification system like Gunbroker for personal identification.... 

To begin - I've posted two different scam alerts yesterday regarding the two links below.... (ARMLIST NOTE: the posts are still up even though I've flagged them and let you know. I would encourage any other Armslister to flag them as a scam....). The only reason I reacted to the situation quickly was because some other Armslisters fllagged them as a scam, and I got an email (unfortunately right after I sent my money...). I truly hope that no one else lost out like I have... 

Here are the posts that still are up, under a different email and account than last time...

I filed a complaint with the FBI cyber crimes division, and have been working with paypal to get back my money. Come to find out, the paypal email address the individual provided as his ""wife's account,"" (which was a ""verified"" paypal account) - is actually a disabled woman who was being shanghai'd into using her paypal account as an embezzlement thoroughfare for a foreign national.... yeah... she fell for one of the ""help me, I'm a nigerian stuck in the airport"" emails..... She has sent me the full dialogue of texts with the individual, emails, pictures, etc, and he basically preyed on a lonely, disabled woman - and used her paypal account as the pass-through for money via armslist listings... 

So the lesson in all of this? If you're buying something from an individual online, it never goes without risk. I would make sure if you're using Paypal to get the individual to send you an invoice for the good(s). We all know Paypal is wonky about anything bang related, but there are abbreviated means for dealing with that.... 

Note: I'm a 100% rated arfcom'er, ebayer, and am on gunbroker. All of this is just meant as a PSA and a hope that some of us will band together to not only keep an eye out for this individual, but others that might try this in the future. 

PS. This scheme was so fixed, I emailed the guy and asked for the scope reticle, and model confirmation, and he sent me additional pictures that matched what he was trying to sell in the post. It all lined up.... but I got jacked.... 

Don't get jacked....  if you have questions, you can reach me at:

The base cost of installation is $30. I also offer mobile installation while you wait (I come to you--cost varies based on location). Installation and sighting in to your specifications is available. In many cases I can accommodate requests for same-day installation. 

I can also get Trijicon sights at a substantial discount from the manufacturer.

This m&p pro is in excellent condition. virtually no wear (the age is unknown I have had it only 2 months) but It is well broken in. Action is super smooth (had a gunsmith complement it) sights are fresh and very bright. Like most m&ps it has never jammed. Has a $75 apex glock- like trigger installed. It also has night sights on it marked m&p. Also has a removable safety. Comes with one 17rd factory mag and one 17rd promag. Both have performed flawlessly

Update: I recently gave this a new paint job. I used ultra flat krylon olive spray paint. these cans cost like 4 bucks and it takes 10 seconds to apply a coat, as opposed to duracoat that you have to ship your gun off and wait a week or two and costs you $100-$300 every time you have to get it repainted. also if you dont like the color its easy to change. 

I completely striped the frame, clogged the magwell with tissue and sprayed two coats. i got a little eager and tried to put it back together after an hour as opposed to a couple days so the finish looks a little worn. if you want i will happily spray another coat and let it cure properly. i have had no functionality issues with fit other than mounting on the rail is a little bit stiff (changed dimension). visually next to magpul ODG, it looks ODG and makes the magpul look brown. alone it looks like a very good ODG. 

I have an HD picture that i can send via mail that does a little better justice. computer moniters make this look like a greenier green than it really is. also armslist doesnt post hd pics very well

726,http://www.armslist.com/posts/3356726,"For Sale:  Jamestown, NC LONG RIFLE FOR SALE","Tampa, Tampa/St. Pete, Florida","$ 1,500","Listed On: Wednesday, August 6, 2014",Antique,no type,no type,no type,no type,"Hello,

Mom is looking to sell a rifle and thought you or someone you know might be interested.

This is a Jamestown, NC School rifle.  The Jamestown School, based in Guilford Co., NC, was famous for its long rifle makers.    The maker of Mom’s gun is Solomon H. (SH) Ward who was one of the last makers.

This long rifle is not as ornate as some of the Jamestown School.  Ward closed his shop was closed in 1902. He was quite prolific as only Anderson Lamb has more signed rifles that survive.  S.H. Ward was a large man and made few rifles himself, but had three workers that stocked rifles for him.  

According to C. Michael Briggs, an authority on NC Long rifles, “most Jamestown Rifles made after 1840 were made as half-stocks with percussion locks.  The School did develop a few unique features.  90% of all Jamestown Rifles have a long, rounded on the end, three screw barrel tangs.  70% of the Jamestown Rifles that I have seen have a double brass dovetailed front site.  Most Jamestown Rifles will have a roman numeral stamped on the barrel (William Lamb and Anderson Lamb often used Arabic numbers on their barrels).  Each rifle would have come with a bullet mold with the same number stamped on the side flat.  I have five rifles that still have their original mold still with them.  One is even signed on the mold by the maker O. M. Dixon.”  

Mom’s rifle is marked  “X”.  Sadly all the marking pics didn’t turn out very well.

Mom’s is not an ornate rifle with lots of silver, but is in good condition.  It is missing its ramrod. It does not have the bullet mold.   It has been serviced and inspected by a smith who feels it is a quality gun.  Mom inherited this gun from her father, who lived in Eastern Tennessee and owned a general store and did a lot of trading."

Geissele Automatics (G2S) 2 Stage Trigger. You will never use a factory AR15 trigger again!

The Geissele 2 Stage (G2S) trigger is a cost-effective semi-automatic-only trigger that provides the same high performance and extreme reliability found in all Geissele Automatics’ triggers.

The G2S rivals the outstanding performance of the Geissele Super Semi-Automatic trigger with a smooth first-stage take-up and a crisp second-stage break.

The G2S is made with the same tool steel as the SSA and the sears are also wire edm'ed. The main differences with the SSA are a different way of holding the hammer pin in, different pins, no laser marking and only spot MP check. Visually, from the outside of the gun there is no difference from the SSA and the feel and reliability is the same.

The first-stage pull weight of the G2S is approximately 2.5 lbs and second-stage weight is approximately 2.0 lbs to give a total trigger pull weight of approximately 4.5 lbs."

Fantastic shape!!

These Mossberg tactical .22LR rifles, with the look and feel of AR-style rifles, are based on the proven 702 Plinkster® autoloader platform. The Mossberg 715T has quickly become one of the most popular tactical rimfire rifles on the market.

Unlike many other tactical .22s, Mossberg has differentiated themselves by going with a A2-style (carry handle) receiver instead of the A3-style. The Mossberg 715T Tactical has A2 front and rear sights, and the carry handle includes a picatinny rail if you want to mount optics.

Most tactical .22s have a 16 inch barrel, but Mossberg decided to go with an 18 inch barrel for a better sight radius and a more traditional look. Also featuring a full length picatinny rail hand guard, adjustable stock and a 10 round magazine.
