I'm wondering if you guys have any old hunting rifle and or pistol parts for sale, any make and/or model,  I'm interested in buying all of the parts except the receiver.  The parts don't have to be in good condition just working condition, parts that have been sitting on the shelf for a long time etc... I'm also interested in any old scopes you may have, they can have cosmetic defects like dirt and rust and scratches, but only the non-Asian scopes. Below is a list of what I like to buy.

hunting rifles-   barrel, bolt, stock if it's a shotgun, trigger parts, inside receiver parts, sights, clips 10 rounds or less, magazine tubes.

pistols-   barrel, cylinder, slides, grips, bolt etc...

scopes-   non-Asian, can have cosmetic defects like rust, dirt, and scratches, optics need to be good.

I'm wondering if you guys have any old hunting rifle and or pistol parts for sale, any make and/or model,  I'm interested in buying all of the parts except the receiver.

North American Arms Sidewinder with Conversion – .22 Mag / .22LR Mini-Revolver – NAA-SWC

You’re likely familiar with North American Arms, the makers of the near-legendary tiny stainless steel single-action .22 caliber revolvers. Thousands ride in cops’ pockets as back-up guns, in hunters’ coats as snake guns, some are used for concealed carry and some are even handy for plinking and targeting. In the past, it’s been necessary to actually take the cylinder out of the frame of the little revolvers to load or unload them. You remove the cylinder base pin, drop the cylinder into your hand, use the base pin to knock out empties, reload then basically “reassemble” your gun. That’s fine if you only need four or five shots!

Hot off the presses at North American Arms is their newest design, the Sidewinder. By simply pulling the ejector rod forward a tiny bit, the cylinder actually swings out, just like a “real” double-action revolver. While the Sidewinder is still single action, the new model also has a genuine ejector rod and ejector star, which will push the empties out all at once, at least far enough you can pluck ’em with a fingernail. It’s definitely easier to load/unload than the other designs.

The Mystic is a take apart, multipurpose, 9mm suppressor. It’s serviceable, a unit that is adaptable and full auto rated. Its Dual Arc Baffle technology design makes sure the Mystic is incredibly quiet for a center fire monolithic core suppressor. What makes the Mystic an ideal choice is it also withstands several other center fire rifle and handgun calibers. The 300 / 221 Fireball and the 300 BLK are prime examples of this. Not only in subsonic, but also in supersonic speeds. The Mystic was tested on 22LR and it sounds great. The 38 Special/ 357 Magnum family works as well. Being take-down, this suppressor will be a favorite for using cast lead bullets. We all know that lead buildup in the 9mm suppressor is a reality. The Mystic suppressor can be dipped ultrasonically, sand blasted, or soaked in harsh solvents without damage to the unit.

The action has had a complete truing job which includes, face squared, lug recesses squared, threads cut in line with raceway ( .010 oversize ) and bolt lugs squared. All work is done on a lathe and indicated under .0002. It is chambered with a match ptg reamer. This is a fresh build and was shot yesterday for test fire and groups. It has a 26in douglas match grade air gauged cm barrel with a 1 in 10 twist that has been hand lapped by myself prior to any shooting and a HS-Precision sendero style stock with extra swivel and full length aluminum block. This stock was special ordered from hs with the green webbing. It has an older factory ss trigger that is light and crisp, its around 2 lbs. All metal has been cerakoted titanium. This rifle looks awesome and shoots little bitty groups at 100yds as you can see from the pics. The two groups with a ragged hole were shot using factory hornady superformance ammo and the other real nice .420 cloverleaf was with factory federal premium with 100gr noslers. Very very impressive considering it was only fired a total of 15 times. Its a real pleasure to shoot. Very light recoil. I wouldnt be a bit scared to set this rifle on a set of bags next to one costing many thousands more than this one and expect it to out shoot it. I will ship to ffl only and include a copy of my DL with shipment. Shipping is $35.00. Alaska and Hawaii pay actual shipping charges. I accept money orders and bank certified checks.. Thanks for viewing my auction and good luck bidding. contact: wolfsmandecker@gmail.com"

I am selling my project rifle for the past few months, a VZ24 converted to 45acp (using 1911 magazines) via a Rhineland Arms conversion kit.  I've put a lot of time, effort, and money into this conversion. This rifle started life as a VZ24 with a scrubbed receiver and mismatching parts.  I then bought a Rhineland Arms 45acp conversion kit with a military contour barrel intending to rebuild it as a ""Mini-Mauser"" of sorts.  Most of the work was done professionally by Jeff at Rangemasters in Lebanon, but I have sunk a large amount of time into it as well. The rifle is accurate and has practically no kick, but there are some small issues:

-If you fully load your magazine, the very first round has a tendency to nosedive into the feed ramp, getting stuck.  If you download your magazine by 1, you will not have any problems.  The rifle used to only feed with 4 rounds in the magazine until Jeff basically built a new feed ramp into the rifle.  Now it'll feed if you have 7 rounds loaded out of an 8 round magazine, which I count as a win. 

-To insert a new magazine, you have to press the magazine release.  A different magazine button (1911, extended variety) might fix that issue, but it's not really a big enough deal that I felt the need to replace it. 

You also have to work the bolt quickly and smoothly for it to feed correctly, but that is something that the Rhineland Arms manual points as well.  The bayonet lug is acraglassed into the stock, and is for decoration only - don't actually try to mount a bayonet on it.  

Most of the original metal parts have a worn blue finish on it.  The new barrel was cold blued to try to match that pattern.  It ended up being a bit darker than the other metal parts in areas, but should wear to be blend in a bit better.


It's a nice little rifle that shoots well.  I just am not as interested in it as I used to be, so I am letting it go.  Asking for $700, which is less than what I have put into it for materials and gunsmithing fees.  No lowballers, I am patient enough to wait for a fair deal."

I'm all for the small business owner trying to get some advertisement and make some money...but really?  I used to love coming to this site and look what all the 'private sellers' have to offer, but now it's becoming really annoying knowing that I have to go through 15+ pages just find something from a private seller.  

If it was a few items, fine.  But 15+ PAGES?  I didn't even see how many more pages there were, I just got frustrated and decided to write this note after I started clicking page after page.  Maybe these businesses should take out an ad rather than to use it as their own personal online store.  

Again, nothing against these businesses, but it sure doesn't help us private sellers just trying to get rid of an item or two because people don't/won't go through 20 pages just to see a private sale.  Does this bother anyone else?  I know these people have a 'vendor' account and are allowed to post a lot, but can't they use some moderation?"

The Model 552 sports a revolutionary sighting system based on advanced holographic technology. The design works by using laser light to illuminate a holographic pattern embedded in the heads-up display window. When the shooter looks through the window, he or she will see a virtual red image of a reticle pattern projected onto the target plane. Overall, the holographic sight improves target acquisition, boosts accuracy, and increases control over the shooting environment.

The Model 552 is built to last, with a rugged aluminum hood assembly and knobbed, tool-free mounting bolt. The battle-proven design can withstand the abuse that any harsh environment, high-powered weapon platform, or military mission can dish out. Other features include a 65 MOA ring reticle with a 1 MOA aiming dot; support for two 1.5-volt AA batteries (lithium or alkaline); unlimited eye relief; and 30 brightness settings. The Model 552 is compatible with Gen I-IV night vision systems and mounts on 1-inch Picatinny or Weaver rails.

I bought the scope new only a couple months ago and it is in like new condition (still have the box and any paperwork that came with it). I am happy with the optical and build quality of the scope.

I am selling it because I bought it to put on a Ruger 10/22, but its magnification range is higher than is practical for my uses. I use the gun mostly for plinking and casual small game hunting and most shooting is off-hand. I've realized that a magnification of 14 just doesn't make sense for that type of shooting. A 3-9 or 2-7 scope would better suit my needs. The scope I'm selling would probably be best for a target shooter or varmint hunter who uses a bipod/rest and really makes use of higher magnifications.

MidwayUSA and OpticsPlanet both sell this scope for $280 (I originally bought it from OpticsPlanet). Those websites offer more specs and reviews. I'm asking $225 (80% of what they charge) for the scope w/ original box and paperwork.

Regarding the pictures, the scope rings in the picture are not the rings included in the sale. I'm including Burris Zee rings (which cost about $30 new).

I'd prefer selling the scope face to face, but if you're willing to pay shipping, I'm open to that option."

Selling it because I essentially swapped out the entire forend of a factory M500 for something completely different and have these parts laying around as leftovers. 

To be fair I'm throwing in the pictured parts as well including the factory 8 shot magazine tube (WARNING: they red loctite these suckers on so getting it off took some doing, it got a little marred in the process so I've smoothed/cold blued the points of conflict - you can see one of the two spots in pic. Apart from the cosmetic blemishes it functions fine), magazine spring, and pump forend. Another warning - this will not including a magazine tube follower as I reused that part, but you can pick those up online for $5.
