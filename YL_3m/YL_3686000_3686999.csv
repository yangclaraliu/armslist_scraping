These is most commonly known as the Airforce model because this was the main market for the 604. Very few of these made it into the civilian legal machine gun registry. Though marked ""AR15"" these were essentially a very early M16 and were full auto from the factory. I have extensively researched every aspect of this gun and find it to be correct and original. The partial fence lower receiver design, such as this, is indicative of the earliest 604's. Later guns had a full fence around the magazine release button very similar to the M16a1. The 604 can be regarded as a transitional M16 due to the evolution of M16 features which took place throughout the production of this model. The early 604 is one of the most collectible of all Colt M16s. The gun you are bidding on is in very nice condition with original finish, nice bore and 100% reliability."

The scope on it is a new Burris Fullfield II  3.5-10x50mm Ballistic plex with Leupold dove tail rings and a Leupold 1 piece mount.
This rifle was built locally in St.Louis by a highly regarded gunsmith Ottocomp(OKM Inc.) Otto Matyska.
I have a ton of money in this rifle so Im not going to give it away but I am l selling  it for quite a bit less than whats invested in it.  I'm Selling for $750 without the scope & rings  or $950.00 with the scope and rings.  It is offered up for sale through the end of deer season but  I would consider trading for a Quality 1911.  As it sits , its sighted in and ready to hunt.  Pick up in or near High Ridge."

It has 76 rounds down the tube.  All load development.  The barrel is a 1/10 twist that was cut from 26"" to 24"", threaded, and fitted with a Surefire SOCOM Muzzlebrake/Suppressor Adapter.  The rail is a Nightforce 20moa steel rail with 8-40 screws.  The mounting holes on top on the receiver were trued to the center of the action, opened up and retapped to accept the 8-40 screws, then the rail was bedded to the receiver.  All the work was down by Bill Corley of Outback Custom Guns.  Bill is a retired Marine Corps Shooting Team member and contract precision armorer for MARSOC.  The stock is a HS Precision stock, as all 700P's are, and the bedding block was sanded smooth for a better interface between the receiver and the stock.

Accuracy wise this rifle is an absolute tack driver.  It really loves the 230gr Berger bullets.  With hand loads this gun is 1/2>moa all day, and has never shot over 3/4moa.  The gun comes with an Eagle Industries drag bag/shooting mat in Coyote.

Also available but not included are 300 loaded 230gr Bergers loaded with h1000 in match brass that have been loaded specifically for this gun, as well as another 400 pieces of once fired match brass.  Please contact if interested in the ammo.

This pistol is made at the famous Radom plant in Poland. Each pistol comes with 3 -35rd. magazines and cleaning kit. The folding stock is not functional. The mechanism is disabled and it has been welded in place

The History...

The PPS-43C (Pistolet-Pulemet Sudaeva, model of 1943 = Sudaev SMG) was born as an answer to the need for a weapon that is more compact and mobile than the PPSh-41, then in use by the Soviet Army. The PPSh-41 was somewhat too long to be used by tank crews and mobile recon groups and paratroopers, so late in 1941, the Red Army issued a request for a new more compact sub machine gun (SMG). The designer Sudaev initially designed his new SMG in 1942, and it was adopted under the designation of PPS-42. The next year he refined the design, and this final model was designated as the PPS-43. This model was manufactured in significant numbers (nearly two million PPS-43 weapons were manufactured between 1943 and 1946). The PPS-43 is sometimes referred to as the best SMG of World War II. After WWII, it was widely exported to pro-Soviet regimes around the world, and widely copied.

Today...

I.O. Inc. redesigned this historical firearm to shoot from a closed bolt position. The safety is located at the front of the triggerguard. The receiver and barrel shroud are made from stamped steel. The rear sight is an L-shaped flip type and is marked for 100 and 200 meters, the front sight is a fixed blade type. The barrel is equipped with a simple muzzle brake. This firearm is an ATF approved pistol. The stock has no function and is permanently fixed in its folded position.

This pistol is manufactured at the famed Radom Plant in Poland. All parts and components are new and Polish made. The PPS-43C pistol comes with 3 curved box magazines, each holds 35 rounds."

I am letting it go for a lower price than what I put into it, I am willing to take a hit because I don't have a dremel anymore to fit the stock. This is a custom 45-70 Mauser with full upgrades.

I started this off with a saimese Mauser for 500$ Bought a stainless shilen heavy barrel for almost 200$ Had a gunsmith remove the old barrel, install the new, check headspace, etc as well as test fire for 300$+ also had him drill , tap and install base mounts for 40$ I then had it duracoated snakeskin camo for 200$ with brush colors to match our landscape. This is an all weather finish and is ready for heavy duty use. I also have an upgraded and adjustable trigger for this gun for you to drop in and set it how you like it . A 2 stage trigger is currently installed. 

A ramline stock comes included and came with the gun. Someone tried removing material to fit the gun and got really close. I tried to fit it and it only needs a little material removed for the gun to be complete. This is 5-10 minutes of work. Fit it in this stock, or an aftermarket Mauser stock of your choice. I will also include rings and a scope.

I have a ton of time and money put into this, over 1200 invested."

This is all really great stuff. Very durable and well made compared to a lot of junk floating around out there for the AKs. I hate to sell it but I don't have an AK now so it doesn't make sense to keep it."

For pain-free accuracy, the Blackhawk Knoxx Axiom Rifle Stock combines the benefits of dual recoil-compensation systems with
the lightweight resilience of an aluminum-reinforced forestock. Weighing in at under 3 lbs., this stock delivers
remarkable comfort while shooting bolt-action rifles and draws out your rifle’s full accuracy potential without the punishing
recoil found with most larger calibers.

• Dual recoil-compensation systems deliver maximum recoil reduction
• Rugged, aluminum construction with aluminum pillar bedding
• 11.25” to 15.25” length-of-pull
• Completely free-floated barrel channel fits all barrel diameters

This rifle was purchased new and I added the new Blackhawk Knoxx Aluminum Axiom Rifle stock to it and put in the safe.
Since I have had this rifle I haven't fired it so it is just like new.
The aluminum stock sells for around $350.00-$400.00 on Gunbroker if you can find them, this is not the polymer stock that sells on Blackhawk's site.

This unit is a CA Model. The only difference is it comes with a 10 round magazine and a bullet button. If you do not live in CA this could be changed for less than $30. This is an excellent opportunity to save! Daniel Defense M4 Carbine V9 Strength to Weight was designed to satisfy the needs of modern shooters not only in popular shooting sports but also for tactical and defensive applications. The DDM4v9 S2W is equipped with an 18” S2W profile Cold Hammer Forged barrel covered by the DDM4 Rail 15.0 gives the operator the option to have the support hand extended out close to the muzzle, allowing them to drive the gun more precisely, and preventing over travel when swinging between multiple targets. This combined with our mid length gas system which is known to have a smoother recoil impulse, allows for quick but precise rapid fire. The longer rail also affords the shooter plenty of real estate for optics and accessories and allows for maximum sight radius for accurate shooting with rail mounted iron sights. This rifle also comes with the newly designed, rugged and comfortable Daniel Defense Butt stock and Pistol Grip.

In development for more than four years, the VP9 is Heckler & Koch’s latest handgun and the first striker fired HK since the renowned P7 series pistols were introduced in the 1980s. Experience gained by HK engineers with the recent P30 pistol had a direct influence on the design of the VP9, but the VP9 breaks new ground with its integration of a unique striker firing system with an enhanced HK “light pull” trigger. The net result is trigger quality unequaled in any production striker fired handgun. HK pioneered the first striker fired handguns, producing both the VP70 and P7 series, designs that impacted several models by HK competitors. But a superior trigger has eluded most striker fired pistol designs. The VP9 trigger surpasses those found on competitors. It has a short, light take-up with a solid, single action type break followed by a short positive reset. The VP9 trigger has a consistent pre-travel pull with a positive wall/crisp break. Typically, striker fired guns have a pre-travel pull that increases in weight as you go through the trigger stroke. With the VP9, you have a less than noticeable pre-travel pull until the trigger reaches the engagement point of the fire control parts prior to trigger break. The VP9 uses HK’s ergonomic handgun grip design that includes three changeable backstraps and six side panels— accommodating all hand sizes. Molded finger grooves in the front of the pistol’s grip also instinctively position an operator’s hand for optimal shooting. Only HK handguns have such a customized grip. Although influenced by other HK models, the VP9 has all the hallmarks of the latest, state-of-the-art handgun. All controls are completely ambidextrous. Slide releases are present on both sides of the frame and the magazine release can be easily activated by left- or right-handed shooters. A new feature is HK’s patented charging supports — simple components that are mounted on each side of the rear of the slide and provide better gripping leverage for racking the slide rearward. The charging supports speed reloading and make operating the VP9 easier for shooters with reduced hand strength. The VP pistols uses the proven P30 steel magazine; 15 and 10-round capacity available. The VP9 has an extended Picatinny MIL-STD-1913 rail molded into its polymer frame for mounting lights and accessories. The rail has been tested and certified to handle mounted accessories up to 5.6 ounces. The VP9’s proprietary captive flat recoil spring helps reduce the recoil forces effecting the operator and the handgun, improving shooter control during rapid firing and prolonging component service life. HK’s famous cold hammer forged barrel — made from cannon grade steel — ensures long service life. Similar HK barrels on 9 mm P30 models have fired more than 90,000 rounds in endurance tests in 2010. The polygonal bore profile, with no traditional lands-and-grooves rifling, contributes to longer service life as well as a slight increase in muzzle velocity. The VP9’s machined steel slide is protected from corrosion and wear by HK’s hostile environment finish and all metal components, including springs and pins have superior metallurgy. VP pistols are made in Heckler & Koch’s Oberndorf factory in southwest Germany. The VP9 is well-suited for civilian sport shooting, security, military, and law enforcement use.

This is a quality build & it is obvious before even firing it. Everything fits tight & operates smoothly, ejecting brass out 2 o'clock high. When using the 21E stock & buffer, the recoil reduction is amazing & multiple follow ups are a breeze. Slight finish wear in a few spots on forend & endcap, but the rifle looks good & shoots beautifully. Round count around 1k & thoroughly cleaned after every outing. Bore is shiny & crisp, & bolt gap hasn't changed a bit. Cycles anything you feed it, especially the crap you don't want back. (Does destroy reloadable brass though, flute marks & a good dent from ejection force, but never a FTE)

I can answer any other questions about this rifle or send additional pics on request. May consider trading or partials, but it'd have to be for something good.

Wilson Combat ""Group-Gripper"" Guide Rod Assembly # 203c 
Improve the accuracy of your 1911's stock barrel by adding this kit. The ""Group Gripper"" is a modified recoil spring guide and barrel link that uses heavy spring tension to force the rear of the barrel up into the locking lugs in the slide. The result is your handgun goes into battery exactly the same each time, squeezing the utmost accuracy from your stock barrel. Minor fitting required. Fits commander models.
 Kit Includes:
•2 piece full length guide rod
•Plug
•Barrel link
Notes:
•Vertical lug engagement is made more consistent through spring pressure on the special barrel lug, which is included
•Minor fitting may be required"

With a large rollover cheek piece for scope usage and straight comb design to minimize cheek slap when shooting, 
the hand conforming thumbhole allows for increased accuracy while distributing the recoil among the palm and shoulder 
thus minimizing muzzle jump and felt recoil. The forend is proportioned to complement barrels from 21 inches to 25 inches 
in length nicely and will accommodate barreled actions with standard sporter contour barrels, and larger barrels up to a 
tapered varmint design can be inlet in these stocks. The forend also has side vents which permit the free floating barrel 
to cool efficiently for those long days at the range. 

This rifle was purchased new by me, added new laminate thumbhole stock and scope, then placed in safe. Never fired. 

Includes Owners Manual and Gun Lock.

Here is a ISSC M22 Rimfire Pistol that is Durable, Accurate and Affordable. This .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol has several safety features, Weaver-style rail for mounting a light or laser and one 10-round magazine is included. Again these are rugged, reliable and affordable .22 LR semiautomatic pistols that are outfitted with features found on many larger-caliber tactical handguns. In addition to being an effective target and small-game pistol, it allows you to practice tactical and defensive drills while shooting less expensive rimfire ammunition. The frame is durable black polymer with a textured handle that has grasping areas for each of your fingers. A Lothar Walther precision match barrel ensures outstanding accuracy. Use the Weaver-style rail in front of the trigger guard to install a light or laser sight. There’s a safety tab on the trigger, a loaded-chamber indicator, hammer decocking lever and an external key lock to ensure safe operation. Rear sight is adjustable for windage. White-dot front sight. 4-lb. trigger pull. One 10-round magazine included. If you know about these then you know they are most often referred to as Glock Clones or a Glock trainer (similar to 19/23)..  I bought this new and it has never been fired. I have the target version (Bottom pic) and I like it so much I bought this. I'm only selling to buy one with a threaded barrel.
